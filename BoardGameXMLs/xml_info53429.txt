							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universe of Babylon 5</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bringing the universe of Babylon 5 to the Traveller system, this book is a one-stop resource for Babylon 5 fans. Combining setting information with new rules, players can learn how jump gates and hyperspace works, play Narn, Minbari or Centauri characters and explore the space station that changed the fate of an entire galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this book, you can become part of the Babylon 5 saga, creating characters to adventure alongside Sheridan, Garibaldi, Ivanova, G'Kar and Molari as residents of Earth's last, best hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the Traveller rules, the Universe of Babylon 5 shows you how to create detailed characters with rich backgrounds, skilled and equipped to survive the trials and tribulations of the eponymous space station. The rules allow you to recreate any era of the TV series, contributing your own stories to the five-year plot arc. Battle against the Shadows; evade the schemes of Bester's Psi Corps; verbally and diplomatically spar with the diverse ambassadors of the Non-Aligned Worlds, Centauri Republic, Narn Regime and Minbari Empire. Defy the millitary might of Earthforce - or ally yourself with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comprehensive rules govern everything from character creation through Starfury combat using Traveller's tried and tested systems tailored to the unique environment of Babylon 5. All you need is the Universe of Babylon 5 book and the main Traveller rules set - and your own imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
