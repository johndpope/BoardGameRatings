Now your Shadowrun game can be equally as fortunate. The Character Deck is a collection of cards with all necessary information on a variety of characters presented in an easy-to-use format. Whether you need a quick NPC or are introducing a player to Shadowrun for the first time, the Character Deck makes it easy to select a character, throw them into action, and track the effects. Their laminated surfaces allow you to easily mark down damage, Edge use, and other info, then wipe them clean when you&amp;rsquo;re ready.&lt;br/&gt; Clearly organized, full of useful information, and presented with eye-catching art, the Character Deck makes Shadowrun faster and more fun than ever. Need top-notch security, a skilled social adept, a Dawkins Group operative, or an expert spellslinger? The Character Deck presents these options and more in an easy-to-use format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;admin comment&lt;br/&gt;this Item was added to RPGG in April 2012&lt;br/&gt;there are no listed owners&lt;br/&gt;moved to (Unpublished Products) on August 19, 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
