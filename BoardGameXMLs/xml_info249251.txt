							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Good Cop, Bear Cop</name>
									
			<description>In this town, there are two types of cops; crooked cops, or bears. And bears aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to be cops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Cop, Bear Cop is a hidden-identity social deduction game where each player is a cop trying to do their job, except some of you are doing your job while also being bears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Good Cop, Bear Cop, players are assigned a secret role &amp;ndash; either a noble, reliable bear, or a not-bear. Not-bears, however, are each competing for their own ends &amp;ndash; opportunities to be lazy, to make money, or to do gardening!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publishers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
