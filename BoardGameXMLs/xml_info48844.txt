			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;From THIS...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wussy PARANOIA player character you made using just the rulebook. No background, no prior experience, no allies or contacts. A few specialties, some basic equipment. Meh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...to THIS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The robust, startlingly cool Paranoia character you made using Criminal Histories. Bonus specialties, illicit equipment, contacts in four different service groups, a long resume, and a looooong list of past treasons he'd gladly kill to conceal. Your character, and all his teammates, have colorful--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRIMINAL HISTORIES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A character-building supplement by BILL O'DEA and the TRAITOR RECYCLING STUDIO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PARANOIA rulebook's method of creating your Troubleshooter player character (PC) is, of course, perfect. Now your friend The Computer offers an even more perfect way to create PCs and the nonplayer characters who know and suspect them. This Criminal Histories rules supplement uses character kits and the amazing Prehistory Pachinko lifepath system to load your character with bonus skills and specialties, cool illegal equipment, highly placed contacts, and a whole dossier of past accomplishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;True, some of your accomplishments were treasonous--and your high-clearence contacts may remember how you messed them over--and your teammates can now investigate your background and uncover your traitorous past. But take heart! Investigate them first, and accuse them before they accuse you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some early roleplaying games had character creation rules that could kill your PC before the game began. Ha! In Criminal Histories your PARANOIA character can die multiple time before you do to your first briefing or shoot your first teammate. That's progress!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Especially useful for two- and three-player PARANOIA games, but offers a rich experience for all play groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     More neat charts and tables than you can easily believe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Completely compatible with characters made the old, obsolete, unfashionable, arguably disgusting way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You! Antisocial roleplayer who wants to kill your teammates in every game you play! BUY ME!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
