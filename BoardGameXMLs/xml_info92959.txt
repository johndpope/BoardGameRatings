And it&amp;rsquo;s better than ever!!&lt;br/&gt;LEGEND QUEST, the high fantasy, paper RPG loved by fans and critics, is back in this exclusive downloadable format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A real gem of a game. One of the best systems I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&amp;rdquo; Dragon Magazine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gold edition of the rule book contains everything from the first two editions, including entries that were edited out of the second edition due to space concerns. This 130-page rule book contains the core rules for the game, including combat, magic and mentalism, as well as creatures and magic items. Also included are several optional rules, some of which were first showcased in the original supplements.
