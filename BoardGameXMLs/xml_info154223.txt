			<description>Kinofune is a tabletop ship combat game that pits players against each to blow each other up to tiny bits and pieces. It utilizes an in-teresting ship build mechanic where players pick their components from a shared resource pool of dice rolled at the start of the game. This means games will always be different since the strengths and weaknesses are randomized at the start of every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A winner is declared when all of the opponent's ships are destroyed. Different scenarios offer different win conditions, such as whoever earns the most victory points after 5 rounds or who can capture the mine first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is also unique because of the pieces. The ships are hand-made out of wood in a tiny workshop in the USA., assembled by the one-man-team known as Alexander Shen. Because they&amp;rsquo;re made of wood, they are also completely open to endless customization op-tions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
