			<description>Karaokards is a new, fun, social card game, inspired by karaoke and based on the songs in your head. It offers two completely different ways to play, both based around playing cards that describe elements of a song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One ruleset enables a traditional card game, gathering friends around a table (and can involve drunken singing, but doesn't have to). Players are dealt five cards. Each card contains two &amp;quot;clues&amp;quot; to a song -- for example &amp;quot;Artist begins with B&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Genre: Rock&amp;quot;. In each turn players play a card and build on a central tower of these clues, defining a song (of the player's choice, which may be switched turn by turn). As the tower gets bigger so it becomes harder and harder to find a song that matches all the clues. If a player cannot play a card they pass; the winner of the round is the last player able to play a card, and they score the number of cards in the tower as points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other game is something completely new: a game for teams or individuals to play during karaoke. Players are dealt five cards. Again, each card contains two &amp;quot;clues&amp;quot; to a song, but this time the players must combine as many cards as they can within their own hand to come up with a song to sing. Once they've chosen a song they add it to the playlist. When it's their turn to sing they announce the clues they chose and score points for each card they managed to use. During the song, other players may &amp;quot;duet&amp;quot; and score points for their own cards that match their song. When the song is finished players who have sung refresh their hands from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who has scored the most cards when the draw pile has been exhausted and the playlist completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
