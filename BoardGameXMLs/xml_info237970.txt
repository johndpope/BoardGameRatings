							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Defend Neo Tokyo</name>
									
			<description>You&amp;rsquo;re at the controls of a six-story combat Mech! But will it be enough to save Neo Tokyo from the giant Monsters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cooperative board game for up to five players, you build a Mech out of unique parts to create a deadly combat machine! Then take the controls and head into Neo Tokyo to battle Giant Monsters &amp;ndash; but watch out for the citizens caught in the crossfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring five-player cooperative battles, you and your friends will work to create the most effective Mechs you can from the parts you have on hand, then defend Neo Tokyo from the gigantic horrors that attack it. If you can work together with your teammates, choose the best strategy, and effectively manage your Mech&amp;rsquo;s power supply and repairs, Neo Tokyo may just survive. If you can&amp;rsquo;t, then it&amp;rsquo;s Game Over, man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---------Game Overview-----------&lt;br/&gt;Players build their Mechs using the three types of parts (Chassis, Arms, Legs).  Each part has a Tile and a set of cards associated with it. The tiles are combined to form the Mech while the cards are assembled to form the player's Command Deck.&lt;br/&gt;Several Monsters are then placed onto the board which represents the city of Neo Tokyo. Citizen cards are also added to the city, and represent the people in Neo Tokyo that the players must defend.&lt;br/&gt;The Monsters then attack, using an Event Deck which indicates which of the two attacked printed on the Monster Stat cards the Monster will resolve. If the Monster in alone in its City Space, it generally attacks the Citizens and the City itself. If there is a Mech in the space with it, a Monster will attack the Mech instead. This is important because when the Monsters destroy a City space or enough Citizens, the destruction track is raised. If the Destruction Track reaches the final space, the players lose the game!&lt;br/&gt;After the Monsters attack, the players will then use their Command Cards or Tile Actions to engage the Monsters, usually generating a random amount of damage that is applied to the Monster.  Each attack raises a Monster Attack Track, which triggers another Monster Attack Phase when filled. &lt;br/&gt;Once the Monsters are all defeated, the Boss Monster appears. This is a bigger and tougher Monster that the players must defeat in order to win.  &lt;br/&gt;If they can do this before the Destruction Track is filled, they successfully Defend Neo Tokyo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
