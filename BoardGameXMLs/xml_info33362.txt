			<description>This trivia game focuses on good manners, the kind Ms. Manners can truly appreciate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample Question: You have just arrived at a very formal dinner party and are about to go through the receiving line.  You do not know the first person in the line, but you do know the third person.  Who should you approach?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That shows this is a TOUGH game and the 60 minute playing time is a best case scenario for those of us who never graduated from finishing school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
