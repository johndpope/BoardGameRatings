			<description>One Hundred &amp;amp; One Romantic Nights: A Romantic Game for Lovers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This comes with two custom six-sided dice and an brief instruction brochure in a card-backed plastic bubble package. The two dice have sides that read:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Home Escape, Hugs &amp;amp; Kisses, Star Gazing, Talk, Show Time and Love Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Go for a Drive, Dinner, Picnic, Breakfast, Naughty but Nice and Go for a Walk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Hundred &amp;amp; One Romantic Nights is for every couple who believes that there can never be too much romance in their lives. With a simple roll of the dice it's easy to spice up nights &amp;amp; weekends. And with over one hundred combinations, this game guarantees a lifetime of unforgettable romantic nights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructions:&lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice secretly if you plan to surprise your lover, or roll the dice together and start play immediately! Use either one or both dice together and refer to the mini guide for pointers if necessary. Play everyday or once a week, but remember to play regularly. Time &amp;amp; place is always up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep in Mind...&lt;br/&gt;Have fun with each roll that you take. Give &amp;amp; take encouragement. Dare to go out on a limb and try something new. Do what you can afford &amp;amp; improvise when necessary. And above all else, enjoy yourself and your loved one at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the expression of romance has changed over the course of time, the underlying purpose has always remained the same. Romance is about escaping from the grind of everyday life to share a magical moment with the one you love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lover's Choice: The Essence of Romance, Carson City, NV&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
