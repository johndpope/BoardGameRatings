			<description>In this memory game, you must ask permission from the other players to advance across the board. Each player takes 2 picture cards from the deck and places them face down on the table. The pictures on the cards (skateboard, hot dog etc.) show the spaces on the board owned by that player. On your turn, you begin advancing your pawn one space at a time along the track. You must get permission to enter a space owned by another player by saying &amp;quot;May I&amp;quot; and the name of the player that owns the space. If you do not ask permission, the owner says &amp;quot;Stop!&amp;quot;, reveals the picture card and turns it face down again. You say nothing on an unowned space. You may continue moving as long as you don't make a mistake, so as more and more cards are revealed, players can travel further and further along the track during a turn. The first player to reach the finish space wins. For a more challenging game, players may draw 3, 4 or 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
