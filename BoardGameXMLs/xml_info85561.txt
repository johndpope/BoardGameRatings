			<description>In Roll 'n Divide, players work together to form division equations and then build individual triangles with double-sided chips (one color on each side for each team) to win the game.  You roll a 10-sided die to determine the quotient (answer) you need to make.  The you pick a chip for the dividend number and divisor number.  You can place them anywhere on the board, either to be part of a triangle you are making or to block your opponent from making a triangle.  If you roll 7 for example, you can take the 56 chip and the 8 chip to place on the board.  You could also take the 77 chip and 11 chip to put on the board. You are able to turn over an opponent's if you are able to use the previously used number in your new equation.  The game board doubles as a storage tray for the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
