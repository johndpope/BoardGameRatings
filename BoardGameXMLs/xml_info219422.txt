			<description>Subterranean Cities is played in four rounds, during which players will take turns placing one of their three crew members in their ship to add and activate ship part tiles. These parts are used to maneuver the ship and collect more parts. Victory points are earned by building your ship, and refurbishing ship parts into structures. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the final round is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
