			<description>Who knows best about the animals on this planet? Who knows the solitary ones, and the ones who travel in packs? Who knows their sizes, and whether they're endangered? If you do, you'll do well at Alle meine Tiere &amp;ndash; and if not, you'll soon learn more about the animals around us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, someone lays out a 3x3 grid of animal cards, then sets the category deck and the remainder of the animal deck next to this grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the active player draws a category card, which shows &amp;quot;height&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;weight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lifestyle&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hazard&amp;quot;; the former categories will show whether you need to find cards in ascending or descending order, while the latter categories will indicate whether you need to find solo/pack animals or endangered/safe animals. Choose one of the rows in the grid, then reveal the backs of the cards, which will show whether you guessed correctly. If you did, you claim one of those cards, remove the other two from play, then replace them with new cards; if not, you turn the cards face down again, and the next player tries to find a set of animals that will fulfill that same category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever is first to collect an agreed-upon number of animal cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
