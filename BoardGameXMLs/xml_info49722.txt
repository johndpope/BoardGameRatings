							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of the Wyld</name>
									
			<description>Primal Chaos&lt;br/&gt;The Weaver has tried to bind it. The Wyrm has tried to devour it. It's beset on all sides, it's back to the wall. But the Wyld isn't giving up yet. It's the fountain of all possibilities, the fount of creation. And to the Garou who try to protect it and its children from extinction it's something more - it's hope itself. But be careful, because the Wyld's help can be double-edged indeed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wild Side of the Triat&lt;br/&gt;The three books of the Triat are now complete. Book of the Wyld offers a look at the most enigmatic and misunderstood of the great spirit-forces of the universe, examining the Wyld's contribution to the universe, its role in the World of Darkness - and the methods it uses to defend itself. Here you'll find allies and equipment to help you defend the Wyld - or unexpected enemies. Because if there's one thing the Wyld is for certain, it's unpredictable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book of the Wyld contains:&lt;br/&gt;    * A long look at the third member of the Triat and the difficulties it faces&lt;br/&gt;    * A bestiary of Wyld-spirits and gorgons, the spirits-in-flesh servants of the Wyld&lt;br/&gt;    * Storytelling the Wyld as ally and antagonist, Wyld fetishes and rites, details on insanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
