							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Siebzehn: The Race of All Races</name>
									
			<description>Siebzehn, the number 17 in the German language, is the ultimate competition &amp;ndash; The Race of All Races. Nine different races of mythical creatures compete for supremacy. Each mythical race is represented by a team consisting of six numbered pieces. Two to nine players control the teams, which maneuver around the board in a counterclockwise fashion. The rules of Siebzehn are simple, but the continuous discovery of new strategies amidst the constantly evolving environment is complex, captivating and magical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team proceeds such that a higher number piece can never pass a lower number piece, and the number 1 piece advances only if no other team pieces can move. Pieces move forward and diagonally in the straightaways and forward only in the turns. The object of the game is to eliminate other races and control the one race that eventually conquers all. Players eliminate opponents from the board by one of three methods:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Circumnavigate the board and pass the highest number piece of one or more opponents with the 1 piece of one of your teams. This is known as a cataclysm and some teams will be eliminated or altered.&lt;br/&gt;    Pass an opponent's 1 piece with the highest numbered piece of one of your teams. In other words, one team passes an opponent's entire team. The team that is passed is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;    Control the most advanced 1 piece in games that reach the end of the 17th cycle, known as the siebzehn cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of a race around a large track is central to the essence of Siebzehn, but the game is not a model of any known race. Several racing games involve familiar competitors such as horses, chariots or cars &amp;ndash; then there is Siebzehn, an imaginary mystical race in which the competitors are famed creatures of myth and legend. As the teams travel around the board, they must persevere through careful movement and placement, calculated blocking of their own and opponent pieces, opponent blocking effects and injuries, dice probability considerations and consequences, and new unexpected ways of seeing the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For an inspiring and exciting gaming experience, discover the land far beyond the familiar and influence the fates of mythical creatures in Siebzehn: The Race of All Races!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
