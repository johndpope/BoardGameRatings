			<description>A Unique Game that Results in a Meal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organize your next dinner party, supper club or get-together around the Convivium Cooking game, a fun party game idea that results in a meal. Dinner party guests answer trivia, create toasts and play name-that-tune to reach the finish line, where they'll be assigned cooking jobs to help create a three course meal. The game includes invitations, recipe cards, ingredients and equipment lists, and a step-by-step guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants complete all cooking after playing each round using the finish line instruction cards. The Game often gets interesting as teams position for various responsibilities for that particular course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for a great evening! Convivium is designed to facilitate conversation during that game as well as prepare a 3-course meal. This makes for a complete evening so set aside approximately 45 minutes for each round if you want to play the entire game (if you want a shorter game you can reduce the number of rounds - it's completely up to you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
