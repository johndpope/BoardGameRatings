							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy of Frankenstein</name>
									
			<description>Twenty years have passed since Victor Frankenstein met his end on board an icebound ship in the Arctic; since the Captain of that ship vowed he would destroy the daemon responsible for his guest&amp;rsquo;s untimely demise. Twenty years since he broke that promise, and watched as the Creature disappeared into the night on an ice raft, seemingly intent on ending his own miserable life. Or so the Captain believed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now 1819, and a sinister darkness has descended upon the city of Paris. A mysterious benefactor of gigantic stature has emerged in the scientific community, never showing his face, yet purporting to be in possession of the late Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s research. He plans to sponsor a grand competition, and he&amp;rsquo;s offering in return an even grander prize: the secret of life itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great men and women of science from around the world come to take part, eagerly drawn to solve this eternal riddle. But a certain captain comes as well, one deeply suspicious of the mysterious patron, hoping to finally fulfill his vow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy of Frankenstein is a game of strategic monster building for 2-4 scientists, inspired by the 200-year-old novel. You&amp;rsquo;ll gather materials from the cemeteries and morgues around the city, conduct valuable research at the Academy of Science, hire less-than-reputable associates, and toil away in your lab&amp;mdash;all in an effort to assemble a new form of life and infuse it with a &amp;quot;spark of being.&amp;quot; Do well, and the Creature may reward you during one of his surprise visits. Do poorly, and you may come to regret not putting forth more effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends once a scientist succeeds in bringing their creation to life, or when the Captain kills the Creature, whichever happens first. Then the player with the most points fulfills Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s dark legacy, for good or ill...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
