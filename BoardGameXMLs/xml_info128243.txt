							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bonsai Barber</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot; A tasty nibble of a game, it is bite-sized barbering at its finest, in only minutes a day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village residents are hungry for the latest in foliage fashion, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to you&amp;mdash;the new barber&amp;mdash;to fix them up. Use the tools of your trade: scissors, clippers, spray can, and more, in this humorous, first-of-its-kind &amp;ldquo;first-person-groomer&amp;rdquo; game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonsai Barber features a colourful cast of twelve intriguing customers, including a temperamental shallot starlet (don't call her an onion!), an oddball strawberry boffin, a cactus cowboy, a daredevil carrot, and a suave banana with top-secret clearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each day, five customers arrive to test your stylistic skill. If the customer requests a specific style, you'll plow that furrow, or you can rely on your expertise to pick from over thirty popular fashions... Or why not turn over a new leaf; be creative and see how they react!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re a demanding bunch, so if you miss an appointment, you&amp;rsquo;ll hear about it&amp;mdash;on your Wii Message Board. But, if you do a good job, you may receive a gift or even a postcard from an exotic destination, as your happy customers travel to distant lands and show off their exquisite coifs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
