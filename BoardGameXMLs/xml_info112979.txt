			<description>Box Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemy's ships have been sighted... and suddenly you're in command!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were ordered to the Quatra Sector to investigate and confirm that enemy battle ships have been sighted. But as you came out of hyperspace, your communications system was damaged and now you can't contact your outpost. The command decisions are yours to make.

But don't forget your true mission - to protect the Quatra Sector with all your skill and daring!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try the fast-paced, action-packed game that puts you in command -- Quatra Command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
