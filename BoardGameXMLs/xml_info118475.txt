							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Home Plans: Explorer&#039;s Haven</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a long, hard walk on the road to fame and glory many adventurers seek out a cozy little home of their very own to which they can return and kick back their tired feet and worried brow. Such a place should be quaint enough to allow the adventurer to hide away for a bit yet built well enough to allow a bit of dry warmth even in the worst of weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The home that is presented in this edition of Fantasy Home Plans is perfect for such a dwelling. Having four rooms spread over a total of 500 square feet the home is large enough to allow the owner to entertain a few guests from time to time yet small enough to keep that charming appeal of a having a little village cottage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
