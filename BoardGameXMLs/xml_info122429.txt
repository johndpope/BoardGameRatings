							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Director&#039;s Cut Survival Horror: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The first set of cards is the initial deck, the first movie Zombie Hospital that we wrote for the Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut Survival Horror role-playing system. There are card sets for two more movies, and plans to release expansions of items and characters at set times during the year. The plan is to write more movies for the Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut Survival Horror role-playing system and convert them over to the collectible card game. The premise is that anyone can pick up a deck and start playing. The goal of this game is to simply survive the movie, with fewer injuries than your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game consists of a 50-card Scene Deck, required to play the game. The Scene Deck is the movie as a whole. Each player has a deck of 50 cards that they have compiled from the available cards and one archetype card. The archetype is the character they are playing in the movie. Each deck is filled with Items, Actions, and Skills to handle the scenes as well as Wounds and other cards that affect game play and the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the card game is ideal for two or even eight players, because players are playing against Scenes as well as other players, this game can be played in a solitaire fashion. The whole premise of the game is to recreate surviving a horror movie, without too many rules to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
