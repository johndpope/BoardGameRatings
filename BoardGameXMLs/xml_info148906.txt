							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return of the Rat Cult</name>
									
			<description>excerpted from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;A Labyrinth Lords Adventure for 4-6 level 2 or 3 characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Felton, a grain and livestock center for the region, has been plagued over the years with infestations of rats seeking the bounty of stored grain, animal flesh, and the offal of both. It rains a lot in Felton, and cats, the usual solution, do not do well in the damp...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many adventuring careers here have started out with the skills of rat-catcher. There are some, however, who sought a different answer to the problem &amp;mdash; elevating the prevalent vermin to the status of indestructible god, and giving worship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Servants of the Small God, usually referred to as the Rat Cult, emerge from time to time, especially after a particularly despoiled harvest in Felton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently though, after a particularly bad harvest, the Cult rose with a vengeance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the party arrives in town, the situation is dire. ... A dozen of the townsfolk have disappeared, and the full moon, typical time of sacrifice as demanded by the Servants, is fast approaching. Panic is beginning to set in, and time is short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
