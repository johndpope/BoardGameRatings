			<description>This is a promotional game not freely available. It was given to customers of UBS (Big Swiss Bank). &lt;br/&gt;Players form words with as many letters possible from their hands. Afterwards they fill up their hands with cards from their Stock. The game itself is kind of similar to &amp;quot;Scrabble Cardgame&amp;quot; except in this game you are allowed to exchange letters in existing words. The game ends when a player has used up his stock of 30 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
