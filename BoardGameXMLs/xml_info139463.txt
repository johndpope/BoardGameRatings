							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Striders of Shadowglade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernatural suspense, horror, and action await the unwary in Shadowglade! 500 years ago, the world ended. More than that, it was forgotten, the minds of those alive scoured clean of knowledge, history, and identity. In the intervening years, society has rebuilt as best it could, new alliances have been forged and blood-sworn enemies made as the surviving nations have begun to rediscover their roots. Out in the wilds and darkness, however, not all that lurks is friendly...or human...or even alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The path of the open road is appealing to many, especially those wary of the political inclinations of the city-states and the undue influence exhibited by the churches of the realm. For some, the decision is a simple one: strike out on your own and make the best of world as you find it. &lt;br/&gt;Striders of Shadowglade are just these sorts of folks. Disenchanted with the hierarchies and regimented life around them, they have chosen instead to walk their own road. Comfortable in the concrete streets of the big city or the quiet hamlets of the woodlands, they find home and shelter where they can and make a community of their own, beholden to no one but themselves and those they choose to trust. Included in this booklet are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Levels 1 - 20 for the Strider, a spell-less ranger variant with some entertaining options! While Shadowglade operates with a strong Epic 10 recommendation, all players interested in the class should be able to play it anywhere!&lt;br/&gt;     Favored Class Options, Traits, and Defects! Small hooks, but strong additions to the right back story, several hooks in the form of class options, traits, and defects are included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
