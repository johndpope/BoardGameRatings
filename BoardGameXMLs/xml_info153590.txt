			<description>&amp;quot;Also, try not to die. That would be bad.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the last few years Kangai has been a wanderer, but his return to his hometown has triggered a series of deaths linked to his past. With a bit of less than gentle prodding, he joins a group of psychic teenagers who solve mysteries under the watchful eye of the government. The group goes undercover at a local university to investigate Kangai's history, but the sudden death of a professor sets them on a new course racing an old enemy for valuable information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of Kangai as you explore the campus, interrogate suspects, and unearth together the secrets behind the lies. Can you catch the murderer, or will the murderer catch you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
