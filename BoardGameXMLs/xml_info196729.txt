							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Template Tome</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest strength of any point-buy system &amp;mdash; infinite flexibility &amp;mdash; can also be a curse to game masters pressed for time or players spoiled for choice. Creating a character from scratch takes time and preparation, and sometimes games come together without warning, or the narrative takes an unexpected twist, leaving the game master in desperate need of flying gorillas, space guards, or fire-breathing dinosaurs.&lt;br/&gt;The Template Tome takes some the stress and number-crunching out of game preparation &amp;mdash; especially minions and background characters &amp;mdash; allowing the game master to focus on plot twists and drama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simply apply any of the 18 pre-built templates from these pages to a pre-existing statblock for a minion or villain to create entirely new challenges for your players. Applying the robotic template to a hawk provides a defense drone. Applying the sneaky template to a reporter offers a ready-to-run spy. Adding the gigantic and fire-breathing templates to a dinosaur creates a city-crushing kaiju ready to tear a swath of destruction through your own major metropolitan area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Template Tome also feature five pre-built NPCs, complete with backgrounds and art. Unleash supernatural Hadean wolves or pit your heroes against the unstoppable power of the Overbear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written and illustrated by Crystal Frasier, the Template Tome is designed for the Mutants and Masterminds Third Edition roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
