							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Music from a Darkened Room (Delta Green)</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLACES, LIKE PEOPLE, GO WRONG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They turn off the path and head into the shadows, becoming something other than normal. Black places filled with blank rooms, closed doors, and empty hallways lined with dust. In these places your voice catches in your throat, the air seems to hum, and bad things happen. People get hurt. Objects vanish. Misery flows like the water from the loose faucet in the bathroom. Hate hangs in the air like old paint. It smells of time and circumstance, and something just a little beyond the world. It smells like surrender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The house at 1206 Spooner Avenue is a place gone wrong. In the last 50 years, 18 people have died there, and you can feel it. Doors in 1206 Spooner Avenue stay shut, and no one ever hears a child&amp;rsquo;s laughter at night. In the hours that stretch like taffy after two, no one ever hears music from a darkened room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Music From a Darkened Room&amp;rdquo; is a scenario playable with Delta Green: Need to Know or Delta Green: Agent&amp;rsquo;s Handbook, available from Arc Dream Publishing. Good luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
