							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pro Pinball: Big Race USA</name>
									
			<description>Pro Big Race USA is a 1998 pinball computer game developed by Cunning Development and published by Empire Interactive. It is the third game in the Pro Pinball series, and is themed around travelling around the USA in a car. It is notable for having a lot more &amp;quot;simulation&amp;quot; features than its predecessor Timeshock!, such as ability to configure table angle, flipper strength and how &amp;quot;worn&amp;quot; the table should appear to be. It also features a skill level setting, perhaps in response to Timeshock!'s difficulty. It also has improved graphical features including a subtle texture on the ball (so you can see how the ball is spinning) and motion blur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pro Pinball: Big Race USA&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
