			<description>In Invasions Tuatha D&amp;eacute; Danann, players will storm the ancient island of Ireland as the Tuatha D&amp;eacute; Danann, seeking to conquer and claim the land from the Fir Bolg inhabitants. The Tuatha D&amp;eacute; Danann are not the only invading faction, the inbound Milesians and Fomorians will also take part in what will be a legendary war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players shall gather resources, fortify hill-forts, reinforce Tuathian armies, and construct megalithic stones which are essential for a Tuatha D&amp;eacute; Danann victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invading factions seek the land for themselves, so the Tuatha D&amp;eacute; Danann must seek each others help, if they wish to have any chance at fending off these invasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survive the invaders and the mightiest of the Tuatha D&amp;eacute; Danann will become King. Fail, and the Tuatha D&amp;eacute; Danann are history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, players will take part in each of the Gather, Build, Training, Movement, and Exploration Phases. These phases will allow the players to use their worker units to gather the resources they need to strengthen their control of the island. These resources will be necessary during other phases, where players will be able to construct hill-forts, prepare armies for battle, and build megalithic stones to solidify the strength of the Tuatha D&amp;eacute; Danann across the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
