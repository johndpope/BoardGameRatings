							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arkadian Warriors</name>
									
			<description>Arkadian Warriors is an action role-playing game developed by Wanako Studios for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players select one of three different character classes to play as from the choices of &amp;quot;Soldier&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Archer&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Sorcerer&amp;quot;. Players can play alone, or cooperatively with another player over Xbox Live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During play, characters are tasked with saving the land of Arkadia by completing a series of 19 quests, ultimately defeating the evil Gorgon. Quests are received at a town hub where other activities can also be carried out. Most of these quests are relatively straight-forward in nature, such as recovering some quantity of a certain item, or defeating certain foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the randomly-generated dungeon, players battle large numbers of enemies using abilities specific to their class. Upon gaining a certain amount of experience, characters increase in power and gain additional spells or skills. Additionally, while battling foes, a meter slowly fills which allows players to temporarily morph into a beastly form. These alter egos take the shape of a phoenix, lion or dragon, depending on class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arkadian Warriors,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
