							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild West Shooting Gallery</name>
									
			<description>A target shooting game with some humour. Just look at the outlaw target, shooting his own foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the complete rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WILD WEST SHOOTING GALLERY&lt;br/&gt;Here we have four lawless characters from way out in the Wild West, at present in a gay mood. Little do they know that the Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s posse is hot on their trail.&lt;br/&gt;Why not join the Sheriff and his men and try your skill at shooting these rascals down?&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;Stand the target in the slotted wooden blocks at the sides of the box, then place it at a distance of four to five feet from the players.&lt;br/&gt;Hold gun in your right hand and insert the metal end of the dart into the muzzle, resting rubber head of dart against palm of left hand, press home dart until spring &amp;ldquo;clicks&amp;quot; into loaded position.&lt;br/&gt;Play can be for a pre-arranged total score, the first player reaching such score being the winner, or for a certain number of rounds, the highest scorer being the winner, 2nd and 3rd highest runners-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
