			<description>Objective: rescue the Royal Baby safe and sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: &lt;br/&gt;Place the Royal Baby (pink card) at the centre of the table. Hand out the 4 blue cards to the youngest&lt;br/&gt;player and the 4 red cards to the eldest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game progress: &lt;br/&gt;Step away from the table (around 1 meter or 3 feet). The blue player starts the game and throws one of his cards towards the Royal Baby. Then it is the red player&amp;rsquo;s turn. In turns, the game continues until all the card are thrown. Beware! Hedgehogs must not prick each other. If one Hedgehog card touches the Royal Baby, its owner (the thrower) loses the game. If one Hedgehog card touches another hedgehog card, its owner (the thrower) loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game:&lt;br/&gt;When all the hedgehog cards are thrown and if no card touches, the player whose card is closest to the Royal Baby wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
