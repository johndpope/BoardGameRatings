			<description>Prohibition has settled over the United States. Liquor is outlawed.  But people still want it.  And there are people who can supply it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 Players are bootleggers running whiskey from stills in the Smokey Mountains to thirsty people in towns and cities below.  Each bootlegger is competing to build a bootleg empire by controlling the highest dollar value of towns and cities across 4 states in 15 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working against them are Sheriffs and Federal Revenue agents whose cars move around the board using Movement Cards and, when a bootlegger is caught, taking actions against them by using Action Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make money selling your whiskey so you can buy more cars, stills, and vehicle improvements.  Each car gets a driver with a skill and cars can be upgraded to go further, carry more whiskey and protect themselves against Sheriffs and Revenuers or other bootleggers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
