							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Winx Club: Miss Magix</name>
									
			<description>Theme: The Winx are having a fashion show to trade their favourite outfits. But some of them will be so popular that only a die duel can decide who gets to wear them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: The game consists of 24 catwalk cards, 12 Miss Magix cards and a die (apply stickers before first game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary and aim of the game: Each round, players try to win as many catwalk cards as possible by using one of their Miss Magix cards. If more than one player wants the same catwalk cards, there is a die duel. The player who owns the most catwalk cards at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: The 24 catwalk cards are shuffled and put in a face-down stack. Each player gets one Miss Magix card per colour (orange, pink, turquoise). &lt;br/&gt;The game is played in several rounds. &lt;br/&gt;At the start of a round, four catwalk cards are placed next to each other, face up. If cards are left over from the previous round, fill up to a total of four. &lt;br/&gt;Then, each player chooses one of their three Miss Magix cards and puts it down, face down. The colour of the Miss Magix card shows which catwalk card(s) you want to gain this round (i.e. if you put down an orange Miss Magix card, you are going for the orange catwalk card(s)). &lt;br/&gt;Players then turn over their Miss Magix cards simultaneously. If you are the only one to have chosen a particular colour, you immediately win that card. Players who were going for the same colour compete in a die duel.&lt;br/&gt;The die duel: All players taking part in a duel. Players take turns rolling the die. A star symbol means that the player stays in the duel, the Winx logo means the player is out of the duel, and a player who rolls the heart symbol isn't just out of the duel but can't use his/her currently used Miss Magix card in the next round (i.e. he/she only has two cards to choose from during that round). A duel ends when all participating players have rolled at least once per die rolling round and there is either only one player left (then he/she gets to take the catwalk cards the duel was about) or all duel participants are out (then neither of them gets to take the cards, they stay out for the next round).&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the stack with the catwalk cards has been used up. The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
