			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curse of the Pharaoh is a murder mystery game for 6 to 9 guests and a host - download the free introductory pdf file (40KB).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us in Egypt, 1894, and determine the fate of the British Empire in a thrilling evening of mystery and murder. You will be in the middle of the action and it will be up to you to wheel and deal with the other guests. Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive Curse of the Pharaoh? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Curse of the Pharaoh you will discover the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Who murdered Abu Nazir? &lt;br/&gt;    What is the secret of the Eye of Horus? &lt;br/&gt;    How did Harry Flinders die? &lt;br/&gt;    Who is the sinister 'Mr Big'? &lt;br/&gt;    ...and what dread secret lies buried in the Pharaoh's tomb, ready to stir once more? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in Curse of the Pharaoh!&lt;br/&gt; The Valley of the Kings, Luxor, Egypt. 23 April 1894. The excavation season will soon be over, as the baking sun makes digging unbearable, but the Oxford University archaeologists lead by Sir William Saville have made a startling discovery. Tonight, the team and their guests prepare to enjoy a slap-up dinner to celebrate the uncovering of the tomb of a previously unknown XVIth Dynasty pharaoh. But while the archaeologists make merry, dark clouds gather, internal tensions among the group burst to the surface and one of the local diggers is brutally murdered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curse of the Pharaoh lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (40 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curse of the Pharaoh is one of our more complex and intricately plotted games, and we don't recommend it if you're new to this kind of murder mystery party game. On the other hand, if you're a veteran you should find it highly satisfying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
