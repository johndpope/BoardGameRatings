			<description>Source: [From the back of the box with special features listed].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve Years ago, an innocent looking junior college Magic Club held a Satanic ritual.  The helpless Kitami was chosen as a sacrifice, but she got her revenge by making a blood contract with the demon that was summoned.  In present day, the love-struck Minase finds one of the clib's old books.  He uses a forbidden spell to control the body of Shiraki, the most popular girl at school.  When his magic goes out of control, however, none of the students are able to control their sexual instincts!  Not only does this attract the girls of the new Magic Club, but also a mysterious school nurse who has been seducing female students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some special features of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     12 possible endings for the game.&lt;br/&gt;     28 different interactive sexual scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;     Original Japanese language with English subtitles.&lt;br/&gt;     Featuring an additional &amp;quot;Erotic Mode&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;     Ability to save scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adult-oriented adventure game. &lt;br/&gt;The game features the original Japanese actors along with English Subtitles.
