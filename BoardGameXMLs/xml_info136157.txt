			<description>In Front Office Football: The Card Game, two coaches assemble &amp;quot;playbooks&amp;quot; consisting of offensive and defensive plays, then play an abridged game of professional football while choosing plays, rolling the dice and determining the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game focuses on the interaction between two coaches, unlike the computer version, which was originally created in 1998 and has evolved through several versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the card game, each team has a set of player cards with specific strengths and weaknesses. Along with your play calls, this helps determine the results of plays, and, ultimately, the winner of the game. It's assumed coaches (you and your friends) have a basic understanding of the rules of football. This is a game for those who genuinely enjoy football strategy and don't mind a relaxing evening at the card table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most of the cards are in the basic sets, each team has twelve specific plays (nine on offense, three on defense) that emphasize its strengths and tendencies. This will give your games the flavor of coaching a specific team without upsetting competitive balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
