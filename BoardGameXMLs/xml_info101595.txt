			<description>A rapid-fire &amp;quot;print-and-play&amp;quot; game where players have to sell arms to various unsavoury customers across North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order of play is through a series of quick rounds, with both players racing to claim territories - either as selling opportunities or to shame the opposing player for already selling weapons there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tricky decisions arrive as the best customers are the ones most actively repressing their own people (popular uprisings are great for business). Getting called out on selling arms to politically dodgy customers means your diplomats will be shamed into retirement and your ability to do further deals is then reduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to sell all their weapons wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt is reported to have said of the Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza, &amp;quot;He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch&amp;quot;. The story is apocryphal, but it tells a truth that persists today. We will support, encourage and sell arms to the worst of humanity as long as it is convenient to do so. Once the relationship sours, however, it's time to back out as quickly and quietly as possible, preferably invading in the wake to claim a righteous victory for democracy and freedom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To sample the exciting diplomatic thrills of global politics, we bring you this game. All it takes is about 15 minutes, 30 coins, 3 dice, a determination to sell weapons to anyone and the cunning to avoid being caught.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
