The second campaign, recreates the fighting over the slot between 9-14 October including floatplane defense of Japanese destroyers and US Navy and Cactus Air Force attacks on shipping. The third campaign focuses on desperate US attacks including a PBY torpedo-bombing attack between 15-19 October 1942. The book also features some of this campaign's legendary pilots including Kiyomi Katsuki, David Everitt, Elisha T. Stover, Jack Cram, Harold Bauer, and Leonard 'Duke' Davis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HISTORICAL RESEARCH: This book includes several introduction sections containing campaign historical background, plus a bibliography for further reading. A campaign map is included that displays campaign targets and airfield locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIRCRAFT STATISTICS and CAMPAIGN INFORMATION: This book contains aircraft statistics for 11 Allied and Japanese aircraft (including US B-17E, P-39K, and Japanese Hamp fighters, and Pete and Rufe floatplanes) in CHECK YOUR 6! format for use in the scenarios. The book also contains detailed notes and rare pictures of the various aircraft featured in the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHECK YOUR 6!
