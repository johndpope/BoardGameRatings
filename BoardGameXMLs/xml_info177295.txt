			<description>In テン呼！ (Ten Calls!), players want to empty their hands as quickly as possible, but they may not be able to play cards when they want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of cards numbered 1-6 (bearing point values of -6 to -1) and a joker valued 1-6 (worth -18 points). Each player starts with ten cards in hand. The starting player chooses a single card from hand and plays it to the table. The next player must play one or more cards that sum to the next number in sequence. (For example, if the first player laid down a 4, the next player must play a 5, a 4 and 1, etc.) If a player can't play, they must draw from the deck and the the next player in clockwise order is obliged to play the required number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player empties their hand, the round ends and everyone scores negative points equal to their cards still in hand. (One restriction: A player cannot lay down jokers as part of their final play.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
