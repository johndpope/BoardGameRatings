			<description>2 players, 5-10 minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will be a featured giveaway promo at Games Unlimited in Pittsburgh during the 2011 Holiday Season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: As employees of Games Unlimited, it is your job to get the hot new eurogames delivered to the store in time for the holidays and into the hands of waiting gamers. The first player to ship one of their packages from Europe to Games Unlimited wins the game and gains all the gamer glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: Players take turns shipping either of their 2 packages from Europe to Pittsburgh. Each player rolls the 3 dice up to 3 times. Any die/dice may be set aside each roll, but once set aside, may not be re-rolled. Players are trying to roll combinations of particular dice to match the next transportation type shown on the path: means you must roll three airplanes (6) on the dice to move one package on to that space on the shipment path. Players may choose which shipment path they start on when first shipping a package. After all 3 rolls, the values on the dice may be used to move one or more spaces as long as the number on the space equals the dice rolled. Packages may not be placed on an occupied space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild/Blocker Markers: Players may use the wildcard/blocker markers to do one of two things in the game: &lt;br/&gt;1. As a wildcard, substituting for one of the required dice values desired at any time during the 3 rolls. If you use a wildcard you must give the marker to the other player who then places it on their Transport Track on the space matching the wildcard value (ex. Player 1 uses a wildcard marker sitting on their airplane (6) transport type. They give this marker to Player 2 who then places it on their (6) space. If the transportation space is occupied that player may place it on another transportation type of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;2. As a blocker, placing the marker on any space along any shipment path as long as it matches the color of the transportation type on the shipment path. Any player may remove a blocker by rolling any 3 of a kind and not moving any of their packages. If successful, they place the marker on their Transport Track or (if occupied) on another transportation type of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any time the shipment path splits into several paths, players may choose which path to continue along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win: The first player to reach (GU), the Games Unlimited store space in Pittsburgh, with one of their packages, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
