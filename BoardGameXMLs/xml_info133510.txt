			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Hori's high-end flight controller. The general look of the Flightstick 2 will seem familiar to PC gamers as Hori gets some parts of the stick from the same OEM that Saitek uses. There is a strong visual similarity between the Flightstick 2 and the Saitek X45 Flight Stick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This type of control scheme is described as HOTAS, which stands for hands on throttle and stick. It is comprised of two separate components: throttle and control stick. Each stick has its own set of pads. PS2 controllers aren't programmable the same way as PC controllers, so you would have to customize the button mapping from within the actual game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main stick has the control stick with several buttons and hats. The self-centering stick has a very strong spring near the base, so there's plenty if resistance. The stick centers itself very quickly. In terms of individual controls, you get a trigger, pinky trigger, launch button, A button, B button, C button, a D-pad, and a POV hat. The hat moves smoothly throughout its range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The throttle control has almost as many items. The actual throttle is extremely stiff, perhaps a bit too stiff in fact. On the throttle you get two more D-pads, a D button, rudder control, a short stick button, a mode switch, and two knobs. This makes for a total of three D-pads, which should be enough to handle all your flight details. Buttons and pads are set perfectly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
