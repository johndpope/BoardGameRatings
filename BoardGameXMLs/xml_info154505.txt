			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Time, the Murder Hobo isn't You!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wondered exactly why the 'soon to be' victims in Slasher movies do the stupid things they do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well now you can find out, with Dead Teenager RPG (DTRPG), where you play the victims. Grab a few friends, 2 decks of playing cards, and blow 1.5 - 2 hours of your life trying to survive a horror film of you own making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hinder your enemies, betray your friends, and sucker some poor bastard into going with you into that dark basement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Struggle against your victims' desire to get themselves killed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    See a shadow out moving in the woods?  Leave everyone else behind and go check for yourself!&lt;br/&gt;    Did 3 of your friends recently get killed while taking showers?  Now you can take a shower too!&lt;br/&gt;    Is that the cat in the closet again, or the mutilated body of Officer Jones? Open that door and find out!&lt;br/&gt;    Trying to start that car?  Fumble around and drop those keys, because you didn't check the back seat anyway!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best part of DTRPG; no one has any idea when or where the Killer will strike, until it's too late. Maybe with enough dumb luck one of you will make it out of this thing alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
