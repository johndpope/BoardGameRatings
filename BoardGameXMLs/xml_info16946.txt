			<description>Super 12 is based on 12 meter yacht racing. Up to six yacht pieces move around a board designed as a sailing race course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt cards and must predict the number of a particular &amp;quot;suit&amp;quot; the other players hold. When a prediction is made other players may raise the prediction or call - by playing a protest penalty card. Winners of each round advance around a sailing course board. Losing protesters go back a space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
