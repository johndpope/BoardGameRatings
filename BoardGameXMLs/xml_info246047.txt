			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few challenges with playing session of [Primetime Adventures] in public. You have a limited time to play, so the pitch session must be shortened. Players may come and go and people will stop by to watch the game in progress. Each time you play in public may be the first time some of the players have tried the game. You most likely will not get to complete a season of the show. In my gaming experience, I have come across a few techniques on how to manage Primetime Adventures and address these challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
