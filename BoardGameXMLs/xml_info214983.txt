							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">McAllister the Runaway</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tis the month of Christmas and today we give out an early gift in the form FVS12 - McAllister the Runaway! This adventure was meant to be a serious campaign addition but could with some tweaking. Instead, we present this as more of a seasonal classic based on a popular movie. The scenario is a solo PC attempting to locate a runaway during the holidays. With a gypsy, a runaway, and an old &amp;ldquo;abandoned&amp;rdquo; house what could possibly go wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a 5th level solo adventurer and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system but was designed to be a &amp;ldquo;tongue in cheek&amp;rdquo; adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
