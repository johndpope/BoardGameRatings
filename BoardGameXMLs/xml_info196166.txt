			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are pre-generated kobolds.  Players begin with a set of tokens that are expended to purchase a variety of traps.  Traps are placed on a series of cards representing either rooms or hallways.  Once players are satisfied with their acquisitions, the cards are shuffled and assembled into a series of rooms and halls - a dungeon - by the game master.  This completed the Build Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of adventurers then enters the dungeon and moves through the areas, attempting to avoid the traps.  These adventurers have several variables that make some more able to avoid specific types of traps, etc., though the mechanic is quite simple.  Eventually, these adventurers will either be trapped or complete the dungeon crawl.  This completed the Dungeon Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kobolds then collect their trapped adventurers, earning points for each.  After a final (rather arbitrary) points adjustment, the game master announces the winner of the competition.  This completes the Scoring Phase and the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
