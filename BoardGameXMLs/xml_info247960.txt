			<description>Interfectorem is the story of Alis, a young sheriff-in-training who lives alone with her sister Sali in a small town next to the woods.&lt;br/&gt;Alis decides to go on a hike one day, but comes home to find her younger sister brutally murdered! Overcome with grief and vengeance, Alis embarks on a mission to find her sister's killer by following the trail of bodies the murderer leaves behind. She must return the favor of death!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interfectorem was designed by Team Who Must Not Be Named, a team comprising of four middle school girls from the San Francisco Girls Make Games summer camp. The team won Grand Prize at GMG's Annual Demo Day in 2015 and went on to raise over $12K on Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Striking a delightful balance between humor and horror, Interfectorem will keep your attention from beginning to end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
