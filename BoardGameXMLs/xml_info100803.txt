			<description>Designers Note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have found a potentially interested publisher, and several changes to the design have been made. I'm very pleased with them, but this may mean that the description here will change. - Alex&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEVEN WEEKS is a 2 to 3 player Euro-style war game that aims to recreate the maneuvering, bloodshed, and events of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 in the German and Bohemian theaters. (The Italian front is also represented as an influence upon forces available and overall morale.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players represent the Prussians and their North German allies, the Bavarian and Federal German forces (including Baden, Hesse Darmstadt, Nassau, and Wurttemburg amongst others) , and the Habsburgs (who also control the Saxons, Hanoverians, and Kurhessen/Hesse-Kassel forces). The Bavarian and Habsburg forces must work together to stop the Prussians from achieving the historical victory - a crushing blow for the Habsburgs, a defeat for independent states in Germany, and the beginning of a long era of Prussian hegemony over German affairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game utilizes hand management and card driven mechanics. The map is a traditional hex map, depicting major population centers, fortresses, and rail lines. The combat system uses a system of &amp;quot;tactical cards&amp;quot; and battlefield deployment, implementing some fresh ideas intended to represent the player's role as the commander in chief of a military establishment and the necessity of relying upon the battlefield doctrine practiced by his/her forces. Prussian forces, for example, heavily rely upon open order formation and &amp;quot;Schnellfeuer&amp;quot; technique, while the Habsburgs are fond of the &amp;quot;Stosstaktik&amp;quot; approach and rely upon a superior artillery arm. The game is completely diceless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to produce an exciting wargame that can easily be played within two hours. The game is currently in playtesting, and hoping for a &amp;quot;Sooner than Later&amp;quot; publication date as we look for a publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
