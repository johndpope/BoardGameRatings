			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Without a Master: Mechanical Mayhem provides a means to run a random dungeon with random encounters without even needing a GM! The Mechanical Mayhem mansion is a dungeon run by an evil wizard who has a passion for creating constructs and other mechanical contraptions. It is populated with mechanical warriors, constructs, biomechanical hybrid creatures and rust monsters come to feast on all the scrap that gets produced. The owner of the dungeon has replaced his body with a mechanical frame in a ritual similar to becoming a lich and spends his days running a factory which produces constructs purely for his amusement. The dungeon is designed for level 8 characters and tips for making a mechanically themed party are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An encounter deck for the random encounters;&lt;br/&gt;     10 new constructs ranging from level 8 to 11, including minions, elite and solo;&lt;br/&gt;     7 fully statted NPCs;&lt;br/&gt;     3 new templates, including one that doesn't have to make a monster elite;&lt;br/&gt;     A new chamber feature table to add a mechanical theme to each room of the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want to play in a game instead of always being the GM, want a fun way to spend an evening destroying robots, or want to add some new constructs to your game, this product is sure to deliver some Mechanical Mayhem!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
