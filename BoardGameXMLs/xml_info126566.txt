							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Dooms</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bad things happen in threes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Dooms is a roleplaying game set at the dawn of civilization. The game is about a thriving community of farmers and tradesmen, the zenith of human development for many days' journey in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this town faces three terrible threats that may destroy it. Only the wisdom of the committee of elders and the strength and cunning of its heroes can save it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will play the parts of these councilors and heroes. If you succeed, the town will be remembered as another Jericho or Ur. If you fail, then it will be destroyed and lost in the mists of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in three sessions, one for each of the three dooms that threaten the town. Each session should take three hours. It will begin with a committee meeting in which the doom is discussed (and in the process defined for the game). One player will roleplays the forces of doom and the others will play the heroes fighting it. At the end, the heroes will return to town and rewarded for their achievements or lambasted for their failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the third session, you will know if all three dooms have been prevented or not. This determines whether the town survives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secondarily, you will know which of the heroes was most glorious. That hero's name will be remembered through history as one of the greatest legends to walk the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
