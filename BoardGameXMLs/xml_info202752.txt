							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Walled City</name>
									
			<description>This Monopoly-style game is subtitled &amp;quot;Chester Attractions Trading Game&amp;quot;, and features the many tourist draws of Chester, known as the most complete surviving walled city in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than following the perimeter, the 64-space playing track winds its way around each quarter of the board in turn. There are 31 attractions, in 7 groups of four and one of three. There are two sets of cards, Lord Mayor and Town Crier, that deliver random penalties and benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on an unowned attraction allows its purchase. Landing on an attraction owned by another player requires paying an admission fee. There is no building, but the admission fee rises as more attractions of the same colour are bought. The fee doubles with the second property, octuples with the third and goes to 50 times the base fee for a complete set. Most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game bears no publisher identification or copyright, and has a self-published feel, possibly a prototype. The square board comes in two segments with smooth plastic taped edges and a hinge made from two Velcro fasteners. The cards and game pieces come inside a transparent plastic purse, and the game as a whole is in a large ziplock bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
