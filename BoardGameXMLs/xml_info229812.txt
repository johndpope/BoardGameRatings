			<description>A One-Round Adventure for 11th Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crimson Codex Faction Adventure 11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The imprisoned daelkyr Virulence has had a tumultuous and unpredictable relationship with the members of the Crimson Codex. From the first time that Ohnal Caldyn foiled one of Virulence's plans, the brilliant but insane daelkyr became obsessed with the Codex, sometimes seeking to destroy any operatives he chances across, other times offering his assistance in the understanding and manipulation of the draconic Prophecy. Whether these are mood-swings or carefully crafted steps toward a goal decipherable only through Virulence's madness is hard to say, but many of the encounters appear as though they have been tests for Codex operatives: the more they fight against and defeat Virulence's minions, the more they gain worth in his eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Codex operatives have grown more successful, their tests have become harder, and Virulence's assessment of their worth is coming to a close. All he needs is one final test to decide if the Codex can be entrusted with a vital piece of information. To entice them, he uses one of the Codex tomes (scholars) whose mind he has twisted, the half-drow scholar Pinesky, to capture Maldwick Roe, the fisherman's son who is tied to the draconic Prophecy and has begun showing signs of an aberrant dragonmark. Certain that the Codex will want to retrieve him, Virulence assigned his most powerful servant on Eberron, the beholder Abrinxenphyrinc, to stand watch over Pinesky and Maldwick Roe and provide the final test for the PCs at the ruins called the Tears of Calinyar. When the former stronghold was destroyed in the battle between the giants and the quori, it took on aspects of the realm of dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
