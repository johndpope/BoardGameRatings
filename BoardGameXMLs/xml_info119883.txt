			<description>Players are divided into teams. The &amp;quot;leaders&amp;quot; of each team are made aware of five words to guess in less than a minute bidding and who will use the fewest words to discover them. If the winner succeeds, his team won the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not very original, but with a neat material, which allows you to play great assemblies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
