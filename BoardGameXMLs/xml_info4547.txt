			<description>The Cities Game&lt;br/&gt;Urban Tension &amp;amp; Negotiation.&lt;br/&gt;A psychology today game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You make secret deals. Apply economic muscle. Buy votes. Break promises. Explore the psychology of power and politics. Develop your skills as a persuader, an agitator, and a negotiator. But above all, you get the mental sharpening of dealing in the complexities of city strife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set your own rules. This game has no dice, no complicated instructions, no restrictions. Like it or not, you must form coalitions with other players. Or risk riots, unnecessary police action and unpredictable change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the role of Government or Agitator or Business or Slum Dweller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discuss and negotiate issues such as riots, teacher strikes and business boycotts. Your vote could sweep you into either &amp;quot;The Future City&amp;quot; or back into the chaos where you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the sources of urban tension, corruption and the undercurrents of city politics. The Cities Game -- designed with a purpose. To simulate the realities of city life. Your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
