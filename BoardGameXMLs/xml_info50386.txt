			<description>From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All AD&amp;amp;D game campaigns have one thing in common - treasure. Of course, some campaigns have more treasure than others, but it is the lure of treasure that entices intrepid adventurers of any world away from the warmth and safety of home and hearth and sets them plunging into labyrinthine depths or into the uncharted wilderness to face fearsome beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To an adventurer, the most prized treasure of all is magic. Open this book and you will find a concise listing of every enchanted item ever invented for TSR, Inc.'s fantasy role playing games. The list in Volume One runs from Abacus to Goblet. The listing includes an experience point value and a gold piece sale value for each item. At last, you'll know exactly what every bauble in any hoard is really worth. No need to keep guessing. The listing also identifies the product where the item is described and the page number where you can find it. A complete list of those products (current through December, 1992) is also provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever wonder what a phylactery is? Do you know what a diadem looks like or how a chaplet is worn? Don't wonder anymore! This book also contains an illustrated description of each kind of item...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
