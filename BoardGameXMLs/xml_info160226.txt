							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gridcasts 01,  Star*Drive TVN Reports</name>
									
			<description>From the Forward:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the tradition of all the great products released for the Star*Drive Campaign setting, this free online product&lt;br/&gt;attempts to carry forward with a series of fictional news reports for Gamemasters to use as they see fit. They originally appeared on the official Star*Drive fansite, Tequila Starrise, and now appear with additional sidebar material in this publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New adventure hooks, supporting cast members, alien adversaries, and a variety of other ideas all crept into the&lt;br/&gt;making of Gridcasts. This represents the fi rst volume of what may eventually become a collection of supplements similar to the Alien Compendium, Star Compendium, and Threats From Beyond. All of these resources increased the appeal of the Star*Drive game, adding flavor and richness to a campaign setting that already holds everything sci-fi gamers could ever desire. Hopefully, Gridcasts can live alongside them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In that regard, these TVN reports all attempt to stay as true to Star*Drive source material as possible. Every effort was made to research and verify any references to original Star*Drive facts revealed in the earlier products published by Wizards of the Coast. This should help Gamemasters to more easily integrate them within their ongoing campaigns. It is also recommended that special attention be paid to the dates that accompany each TVN report for an idea of where it falls within the greater Star*Drive timeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
