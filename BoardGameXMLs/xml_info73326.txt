							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fulsgar, The Warrior&#039;s Guild</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games Master Note&lt;br/&gt;Fulsgar and the Mercenary Guild are provided for use in any campaign. It can be used as a source of mercenary employment, militia and warrior skills, spells and training, and perhaps to provide a focus around which a group of Player-Characters can be focused. The cult also contains routes for promotion from warrior to sergeant to officer, and provides background for Runelevel professions for both Player-Characters and for Non-Player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though each god is given a name, the names can be readily changed. Fulsgar can even be quickly adapted to become a purely secular mercenary guild, without any Divine overtones, though the Divine spells add significantly to a warband&amp;rsquo;s capability. The Open Cosmology is provided to locate the cult within a cohesive mythos and to justify its role in the world, but the cult and history is flexible enough to allow it to be slotted into almost any other mythos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
