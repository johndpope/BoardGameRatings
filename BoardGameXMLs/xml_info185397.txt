							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HFS - The High Fantasy Society LARP</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document begins with a few pages explaining the genesis and history of the High Fantasy Society, essentially a variant Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) that implemented additional rules to support fantasy elements including magic and monsters.  The HFS attempted to be a comprehensive society with combats, fairs, demonstrations, and revels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules specify that players must be costumed.  The Battle Game Rules focus primarily on safety and secondarily on a realistic fantasy combat mechanism that distributes wounds to actual hit locations and discusses debility accruing from certain types and locations of wounds.  Characters gained &amp;quot;Levels&amp;quot; (1-6) by duration of experience and selected a &amp;quot;Class&amp;quot;.  Each Class, at each Level, gave certain custom abilities.  Several Classes gave access to certain types of magic, implemented as a spell system.  A section presents Monster Class rules.  The document also includes a fairly length segment on how to construct &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
