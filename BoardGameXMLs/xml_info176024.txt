			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruesome Gangs is an exciting Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&amp;reg; compatible product line providing the Game Master with a collection of non-player characters (NPCs) designed to work together from the perspective of backstory, game mechanics, or both.  The groups are presented at different Challenge Ratings to increase their utility for multiple gamers.  In addition, this allows player characters (PCs) to encounter one of these groups early in a campaign and then again after both teams have gained experience with minimal extra work for the Game Master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the entire team is unsuitable for inclusion in the campaign at the time, then NPC stat blocks can be used individually as needed.  A mixed approach can also be interesting.  By introducing a single foe into the campaign, this product gives a number of friends or allies that foe could call upon after running afoul of the PCs!  This gives the Game Master a ready-made answer to who would the NPC go to for assistance, or even who would come to avenge his death at the hands of the PC party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using This Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product presents the overall history of the NPC team as well as the backstory for each individual member of the gang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each NPC has four stat blocks (CR 4, CR 9, CR 14, and CR 19) demonstrating his progression and growth over time.  As a visual indicator, the color of the name bar designates which stat blocks from each NPC are of equivalent Challenge Rating along with the CR text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each gang is comprised of multiple members which can include a mixture of races, class levels, and templates.  This section helps the Game Master compare different gangs&amp;rsquo; capabilities and make-up at a glance without having to review each stat block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Members&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Akaoni &amp;ndash; The East Wind &amp;ndash; LE female hobgoblin&lt;br/&gt;    Chi Ren &amp;ndash; The Charnel Wind &amp;ndash; CE male ghoul&lt;br/&gt;    Izumi Satoru &amp;ndash; The South Wind &amp;ndash; LE male nagaji&lt;br/&gt;    Khru Thec &amp;ndash; The North Wind &amp;ndash; NE male human&lt;br/&gt;    Syaitan Darah &amp;ndash; The West Wind &amp;ndash; LE female tengu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of the Five Winds is a skilled team of martial artists led by a vicious ghoul.  They heavily favor melee combat with a healthy mix of stealth capability and some limited spellcasting.  Predominately non-human, they often operate on the fringes of society finding work as mercenaries and enforcers for various entities unconcerned with the nature of those they employ.  One of the Winds is a master of impersonating members of various religions and often leads others into ambushes after gaining their trust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the team cooperates well bound by honor, respect, or fear; however, the two monks share a growing hatred for one another that will likely lead to a betrayal.  The Order&amp;rsquo;s leader is prone to bouts of unpredictability and violence, signs of his diminishing connection to his former humanity.  This is often observed when the team meets setbacks.  A series of well-planned and coordinated events will be punctuated by acts of extreme violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
