			<description>The object of the game is to be the first player to remove all of your disks from the game board, through a combination of luck (in rolling dice) and strategy (deciding where to move your disks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has placed his six disks on their matching &amp;quot;starting circles&amp;quot; at his side of the board, he must then move them to the opposite side of the board into the &amp;quot;Hexagons &amp;amp; Triangles&amp;quot; area and correctly place them on the matching hexagons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must also guard themselves against encounters with other players' disks, which can disrupt or ruin their progress across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- from the game rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
