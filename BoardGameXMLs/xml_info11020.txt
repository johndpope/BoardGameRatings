							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Secrets</name>
									
			<description>Campaign Secrets is a political card game where you are a candidate in the race for the White House. You must out-campaign your opponents to win the favor of your constituents. And most importantly, don't let those voters find out about your dirty little secrets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Secrets is a fun educational game. Each card has tidbits about real presidential elections. In addition, the campaign strategies and secrets in the game, are all taken from real-life strategies and scandals. Playing the game can give many children and adults alike an insight into how a real election comes together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, you play a series of campaign strategies trying to get more percentage of the vote than the other players in the game. Eventually, through game play, you'll either choose or stumble into your running mate. Together the two of you must do your best to wrangle as many votes as possible away from the other players, and to hold on to your secrets so you can pick up a few extra votes at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed for families and classrooms, so while it can be fun and educational for hard-core gamers, it's still simple enough for everybody to play. If you're looking for a fun way to learn about the election process, or just a fun game to play with your family, then this is the game for you. If you're looking a hard-core strategy game then you might want to look elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: You may have played the First Edition of this game, but the Second Edition plays considerably different. The first edition was a quick and dirty version put out as a free give away for trade shows, the second edition is the real game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
