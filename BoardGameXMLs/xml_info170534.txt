							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Empyrion</name>
									
			<description>The world is not as it once was.  After years of tension between the mega corporations and corrupt bureaucrats, civilization is made up of vast independent city-states.  You are the leader of one of Empyrion&amp;rsquo;s ruling classes, a Scion of the state.  The current Grand Scion, and his ruling faction, have grown fat and ignorant in their affluence.  This indulgence is weakness, an opportunity a shrewd Scion would be able to turn into advantage. You are not the only one to have seen it; the other castes have noticed, so make certain you are swift to act. Through cunning and intrigue, and perhaps even diplomacy, navigate the unforgiving political realities of this new world to position your faction as the next ruling class.  Only one may be the Grand Scion of Empyrion; make sure it is you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empyrion is a deck-building resource gathering card game where you compete against 2-5 rival Scions by gathering or stealing resources and shoring up your faction by recruiting specialized citizens to work for you or building unique buildings which confer long lasting and expansive powers.  Focus on building, or blocking your opponents building as you vie to gain enough influence points to claim the title of Grand Scion and ruler over all of Empyrion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
