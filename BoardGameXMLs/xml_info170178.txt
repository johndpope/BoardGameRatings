			<description>Rikedom.nu is a game that was a part of a campaign launched by Sida, (the Swedich government agency responsible for organization of the bulk of Sweden&amp;rsquo;s official development assistance to developing countries). The campaign informed the public nation-wide about Sida&amp;rsquo;s work and views on poverty in the world in general and in development countries in particular. The game was a browser-based quiz game including mecanics for life-lines and time limits. The goal was to make something that appealed for a broad audience at the same time as it har mechanics that drove the game play and educated the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
