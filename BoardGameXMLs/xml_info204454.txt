			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stronghold is the most powerful ship in the known galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stronghold can simultaneously invade with intense Fleet Strength (5) and Ground Strength (5). When backed up on a variety of unit types, The Stronghold is easier to deploy into the Warzone, so ensure that your commanders are well rounded for battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stronghold is a promo card for backers of the Core Worlds Digital KS campaign. It was sent to all those who were to receive other physical card rewards from the KS campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
