							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Annalise: Eternal Tears Interim Edition</name>
									
			<description>A dark-haired woman, staring out of stained glass, watching faces form in the rain. An ancient evil, unearthed for the first time since antiquity, re-learning the limits of its power. A hero, noble and pious, unable to accept the responsibility that is his birthright. A child, shedding a single tear while waiting for her mother to return. Two lovers, intertwined in a bower, each speckled with red, red blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vampire is out there. You are it's enemies, its lovers and its servants. How will you confront the darkness awaiting you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Annalise is a game about making Vampire stories. Each player takes on the role of a protagonist in the story you are about to create together, with the understanding that these characters are the victims, hunters and tools of the Vampire. The best example is that you are playing the story of Dracula with one person in the role of Mina Harker, one as Van Helsing, one as Renfield. The Vampire in your game, like Dracula, is what drives the plot, but it is not a protagonist. Every game of Annalise involves the characters discovering the influence of the Vampire in their lives, and builds up to a confrontation with the creature, for good or ill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about pain, hunger and redemption. Pain, because the Vampire is only attracted to the vulnerable, those people who have experienced pain, suffering or loss in their lives. Hunger, because the Vampire hungers for that pain. Redemption, because there is always the possibility of redeeming your actions and desires - if you wish it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Annalise is a game for two to four players, and can take a variable amount of time to play. A short, intense game can be played in four hours. A long, languid, slow-burning game can take up to 20 hours, broken into 3 or 4 hour sessions. The game is suited for people of all gaming backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information and play supplements are available at the website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.findannalise.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.findannalise.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
