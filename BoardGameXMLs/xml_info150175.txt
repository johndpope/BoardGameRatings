			<description>The object of the game is to reach West Point, the first player to do so wins the game. Players spin the dial and advance their counter as many spaces as the number spun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the counter rests upon a space with the picture of cannon on it, players follow the instructions: lose next turn, start over again, move up to next player, all players move one space forward, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it rests upon a space with a star, the player reads the meaning, which does not affect the game, such as: You will marry young and happy; You will become a great general etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
