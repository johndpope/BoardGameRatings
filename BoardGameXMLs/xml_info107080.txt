			<description>You can become the fishing king!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The penguins are hungry and need your help to feed themselves. Catch all the fish you can before someone steals them from you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this product based on the acclaimed boardgame &amp;lsquo;Hey! That's My Fish!&amp;rsquo;, strategy is fundamental. Keep moving ahead of the other penguins so that you don&amp;rsquo;t get trapped and try to get to the ice flows that hold more fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between 1 and 4 players can play &amp;lsquo;Penguins &amp;amp; Friends&amp;rsquo; at the same time &amp;ndash; providing they can handle the polar cold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of ice blocks that have a set number of fish (1, 2 or 3) under them. The ice blocks are hexagonal and form a structure like a beehive. The starting position of the ice blocks can change, creating different game boards. Each player has a set number of penguins (according to the total number of players in the game and the size of the board) which serve as markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin, the penguins are placed one by one on the board (only on the boxes holding a fish) and in turns. In each turn, one player places one of his or her penguins (placing the penguins intelligently at the beginning is an essential part of a good game strategy). Once all the penguins are placed on the board, the first player starts to move and the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games advances as the players catch fish, eliminate ice blocks and &amp;ndash; this is very important &amp;ndash; trap the other players on ice islands. The game ends when no player and no penguin can move. At this point, the fish are counted. The player with the most fish wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
