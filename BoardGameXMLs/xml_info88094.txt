							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Legacies Campaign Guide</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Legacies is a fresh new fantasy campaign setting and low-magic ruleset. Stylish and gritty, Dark Legacies gameplay is enhanced by the illustrations of industry-leading artists, including Adrian Smith and Ed Bourelle. In addition to a fully detailed world, Dark Legacies provides comprehensive rules oriented toward a mature and intense game experience, making it the definitive d20 low-magic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Legacies is set on Earth, thousands of years after an apocalypse sent the world spiraling into the eternal night of the Abyss. The intervening millennia have seen that world scoured by demons, populated by mysterious races of unknown origin, and eventually reclaimed by humanity as the Reversion pulled it out from its dark prison. The sun rises once again on an Earth that now lingers halfway between the mortal and demonic planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On this reborn Earth, unnatural creatures terrorize the wild lands, practitioners of demonic magic threaten the foundations of society, humans and nonhumans alike pile upon one another in polluted and overpopulated megacities, and adventurers explore ancient and afflicted territories, where they battle for coin, for knowledge, and for glory. And always, the people of the new Earth are wary of the demon threat lying beyond the horizon, where a perpetual storm front marks the entrance to the ever-waiting Abyss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Legacies Campaign Guide is a dark fantasy d20 System sourcebook that provides expanded rules and complete setting information for Dark Legacies, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Unique prestige classes tailored to low-magic gaming &lt;br/&gt;- Advanced technology, including battlesuits and armored transports &lt;br/&gt;- Rules for holy and demonic items of power &lt;br/&gt;- The Abyss on Earth: a codex of demonic creatures and supplemental encounter guidelines&lt;br/&gt;- Complete geography, history, and setting information for post-Reversion Earth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
