							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Han d&#039;Islande</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Han d'Islande is an adventure game adaptation of the eponymous Victor Hugo novel. In 1699 in Iceland, the young knight and son of the vice roy Ordener Guldenlew finds out his beloved Ethel and her father Schumaker have been falsely accused of treason, arrested and imprisoned in the fortress of Munkholm. Ordener must find a chest containing letters proving Ethel and Schumaker's innocence. Problem is, the chest has been taken by Han, a legendary thief who lives with wolves in a cave in the north of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a text interpreter for player commands. The display includes a small graphical representation of the current location of the player, and room for several lines of descriptive text. The storyline is close to the novel, with a few tweaks to the story to add a few surprises for those who might have read the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packaging notes:&lt;br/&gt;The game box included an audio tape containing a radio program (from French radio station France Culture and presented by Jacques Chancel) discussing the Victor Hugo book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
