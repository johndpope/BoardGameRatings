They have decided to mix different board game regulations to clarify their game rules. As a result of this the game became exciting. In a couple of years the balance of the rules became perfect. Players enjoyed the rules of the game but there was one small problem: it was impossible to play if a player is alone. Therefore, 8-th of April 2016 a board bones game became Bones Game Online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
