							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teams: Hit Squad</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hit Squad can be used in various campaigns and their purpose and patron can vary. They may appear as opponents for the player characters. However, the Hit Squad or its various members may also appear in a way connected to the adventure but not necessarily in opposition to the PCs. For example, in an espionage campaign, the Hit Squad might be Department 7's cleaner unit, sent to clean up messy entanglements. The Squad might be the Agency's muscle, so that the PCs do the investigation and then in comes the Hit Squad to make the arrest, capture, or whatever. In a military campaign, the Hit Squad could be a Black Operations unit, involved in deniable missions. Their paths may cross with the PCs, sometimes working in cooperation, other times working at cross purposes. The existence and the patron of the Hit Squad may come to be a focus for investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether used separately or as a team, the characters from Hit Squad offer a quick resource for modern campaigns .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
