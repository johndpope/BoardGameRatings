							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chasing Chariots Game</name>
									
			<description>Race against rival charioteers around the Roman racetrack using your action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 8 cards and choose one of them simultaneously and move their chariot accordingly.  Minus cards moves any other chariot backwards the number of spaces as shown on the card.  Plus cards moves your chariot forwards that number of spaces.  Normal cards moves your chariot forwards based on the difference between the number on your card and the lowest number played.  If a player had played a normal card but had a minus card played against him then he cannot move forward that turn at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all 8 cards are played another set of 8 cards are dealt to all players.  The game ends when one player reaches the finishing post.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports UK National Curriculum Key Stages I and II for History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
