			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important that only the game master read the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[When asked for information, the game master should roll a die and:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1- Misinform, Lie, falsely correct previous data, give the player who asked anything except whatever was asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2- Security Alert! Ask for the player&amp;rsquo;s character personal code and/or threat the player&amp;rsquo;s character with anything you can think of: demotion to lower level, imprisonment, summary execution, etc under the charges of infringing the law, subverting the order or putting the whole complex in danger with their request. The less plausible or logical this act looks, the better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3- Ask annoyingly and endlessly for reasons or details about their request. If you do it right (don&amp;rsquo;t make it take too long, though) the character will cancel it. At least make them wish they cancelled the order. Feel free to finally provide the service without any enthusiasm or put it into that waiting line of requests you have... you know, that one you never will do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4- Humbly excuse yourself since the scarcity or absence of data or resources available makes it impossible to comply with that request for the moment. Send another player in a task to get more resources and inform the player about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5- Politely ask the player to wait and have another player go on an errand to fulfill the request. Challenge, threat or offer a reward to that character for doing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6- Provide the best quality service immediately and in the most flashy way possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
