							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Earth Alliance Fact Book</name>
									
			<description>From Publishers Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans are many things: diplomats, traders, farmers, designers, doctors, explorers, and much more. They are the ones who can do it all. Yet, despite their apparent friendliness and curiosity, they are a race fraught with internal problems. All too often their natural aggressiveness turns inward upon itself. Religious and ethnic groups are still at odds with each other despite centuries of alliance. Good-natured competition between nation-states and colonies all too often turns sour. The government, stable on the surface, internally struggles for control over increasingly independent-minded planets. Telepaths and mundanes remain constantly at odds, separated by genetics and decades of dichotomy. The human race may appear strong and confident from the outside, but internally, they are still struggling to find a measure of stability with themselves. This book will detail the Earth Alliance in its entirety. From the homeworld of Earth to the colonies of Mars, Proxima, Orion, and more, every part of the Alliance can be found in these pages. Vehicles, weapons, equipment, characters, and more are examined in complete detail. The roleplaying possibilities are endless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
