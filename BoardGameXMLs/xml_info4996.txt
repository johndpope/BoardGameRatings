							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quest for the Ideal Mate</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's here!... the revolutionary new game that replaces dating bureaus, singles bars, sex therapy and marriage counseling.  CAUTION.  It is not for monks, nuns or hermits.  Quest for the Ideal Mate is a game for the liberated male and female.  You will discover who you are, who others are--and what you can be together!  Playing with 3 to 12 friends, strangers, lovers, marital partners (or any combination of these).  It could result in a single person discovering their Ideal Mate within the group.  You'll laugh your head off at the responses of the other players while awaiting what's in store for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Shirl Solomon, internationally known handwriting analyst, author and lecturer on personality and compatibility has created Quest for the Ideal Mate to provide an entertaining diversion for people to get to know each other.  One game will tell you more about someone's hidden character than a dozen dates and bare feelings on countless subjects that would not surface in a normal relationship until too late.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;End of box quotes.  There are also &amp;quot;ideal mate trait cards&amp;quot; to be filled out and at the end of the game, you find out how compatible you are with others in the group.  Box says it plays best with an equal number of each sex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
