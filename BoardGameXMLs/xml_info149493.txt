			<description>子育てドラゴン, which translates to &amp;quot;child-rearing dragon&amp;quot; was published in the doujinshi magazine つぎはぎたより in 2007, which was available in a PDF version for international download shopping from after 2008 until 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the players take on the roles of dragon mothers who are stuck in human form until their respective child has reached adulthood or died (the latter does not occur in the game). Therefore, challenges have to be overcome by the child or the mother-child combination. Being published in an RPG doujinshi, the game has a lot of flavor text/descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players decide when to rest or when to move to a different location (from a set of 6 locations), but otherwise is dependent on the luck of the roll. Each turn (defined as 10 years), unless the mother is resting, a die is rolled to determine the needs of the child and the mother then has to match or come within 1 of that die result. Success leads to a roll on a positive event table (modified by the care attribute/skill) while failure leads to a roll on the risky event table for the current location (which are often but not always negative events). In addition, after handling the events, the player may move the family to an adjacent location.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each turn, tiredness is checked to see whether the next turn is spent resting. When playing with 2+ players, players in the same location may attack each other to steal loot from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to lead the child to adulthood (which requires 20 units of loot) wins the game. Solo play is mentioned as an option, but no special rules are provided and some of the possible player powers are incompatible with solo play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
