			<description>Super Mario 3D World (スーパーマリオ3Dワールド Sūpā Mario Surī Dī Wārudo) is a platform game in the Super Mario series developed by Nintendo EAD Tokyo for the Wii U video game console. It is the sequel to Super Mario 3D Land for the Nintendo 3DS, and was released in Japan on November 21, 2013, North America on November 22, 2013, and will be released in Europe on November 29, 2013, and Australia on November 30, 2013&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows a similar play style to Super Mario 3D Land, which combines the free-roaming gameplay of 3D Mario titles with the mechanics of 2D side-scrolling platformers in the series. The game now allows players to play as either Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach or Toad who, similar to Super Mario Bros. 2, each have their own unique properties. For example, Luigi has a floatier jump, Peach can float across large gaps and Toad can run the fastest. Players can choose to play these characters individually, or with up to three other players sharing from a pool of lives. Along with returning items such as the Fire Flower and Tanooki Suit, a new item introduced is the Cat Suit, which allows players to climb up walls, run faster, perform unique attacks and automatically climb to the top of the end pole regardless of where they land. The game also features functionality with the Wii U GamePad, allowing players to rub the touchscreen to reveal hidden blocks or items, as well as hinder enemies to assist the player. The game also supports Off-TV Play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Mario 3D World&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
