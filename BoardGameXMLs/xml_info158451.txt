			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Reckoning, the player begins the game by being killed and subsequently resurrected via the Well of Souls, a magical phenomenon capable of bringing the dead back to life. The player's rebirth was a fluke &amp;mdash; a one-time success in a long string of failures to conquer death. Several thousand years the magic is perfected, and a Gnomish engineer activates the Well of Souls for everyone on the planet. Suddenly death is no longer a thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game would have explored various issues such as &amp;quot;What does it mean to the societal structures of the world when all of the sudden you've got immortality?&amp;quot; Population, for one thing, doesn't stop growing. The world becomes more and more crowded. &amp;quot;What does it do to the leader of a church whose entire power base is predicated on promising you an afterlife?&amp;quot; Suddenly the churches are no longer needed. How does that effect the moral structure of a society?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
