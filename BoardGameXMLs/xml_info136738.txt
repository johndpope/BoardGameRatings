			<description>Cozmica is a 2-player abstract strategy game. The theme of Cozmica is about relocating Earth life in DNA form, to a new world in the cosmos for survival.                                   Both players sit on opposite sides of a 9 x 9 line grid board similar to a Go board.&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives either 18 black or 18 white &amp;ldquo;Go stone like&amp;rdquo; playing pieces (Bio-ships). Playing pieces are marked with either an Animal, Plant, or Microbe symbol. The pieces interact with each other similar to the mechanics of Rock, Paper, Scissors, i.e.&lt;br/&gt;Animals eat Plants, Plants absorb Microbes, and Microbes infect Animals.&lt;br/&gt;All pieces move the same way&amp;hellip;1 or 2 places, Horizontally, Vertically or Diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the game are: &lt;br/&gt;1. Surround and capture opponents Bio-ships.&lt;br/&gt;2. Intercept and eliminate opponents Bio-ships.&lt;br/&gt;3. Cross your own Bio-ships to the other side and off the board. &lt;br/&gt;4. You acquire colonies by capturing opponents Bio-ships or crossing your own to the other side and off the board.&lt;br/&gt;5. To win the game, you must establish at least one colony. They may be mixed [your&amp;rsquo;s and/or your opponents as long as they form a colony.&lt;br/&gt;A colony is: 1 each of all 3 DNA types, 1 Animal, 1 Plant, 1 Microbe.&lt;br/&gt;Playing time is about 30 to 60 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
