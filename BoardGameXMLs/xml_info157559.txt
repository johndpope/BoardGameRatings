			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An anime inspired larger than life melodrama&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Prelude:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        You, the crew of the Tri-Star are currently en-route intercept a Chemical freighter that sent out a distress signal no more than 15 minutes ago. They were under attack from a pirate vessel, but were quickly silenced. At the order of Captain Helena Juno, The JSS Tri-Star, Valiant Class Strike Cruiser, fired its plasma drives, and silently sped toward the target. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        You quickly caught the freighter, and a hostile vessel firing upon it. The captain demanded the attackers immediate cease fire, and surrender, however the ship simply turned its focus toward you. Pilots, Drake Maddog, Rosie Divine, and Adrian Thornsen race to their Exo-Armours, while Devon Malachai prepares to get every moment of the conflict on his various Vid- recorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
