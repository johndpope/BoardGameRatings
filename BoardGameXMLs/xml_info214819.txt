							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kingdom of Keoland</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keoland was the first kingdom founded in the Flanness after the Twin Cataclysms drove the Suel and Blaunkish people east from their old empires nearly one thousand years ago. Despite its antiquity, the Kingdom of Keoland is predominantly rural, an agricultural society composed mainly of superstitious peasants and their lords. There are four cities in Keoland, the capital Niole Dra (Pop app 25k), Gradsul, the largest city (app 50k), Cryllor and Flen (Both between 8 and 12k). Almost every other community in the Kingdom has less than two thousand inhabitants. Keoland is predominantly human (over 99%), followed in number by elves then gnomes and halflings. The dwarven, halfelven and half-orc population is negligible in the grand scheme of the kingdom. The majority of demi-humans reside in the Good Hills, the Axewood and around the Dreadwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
