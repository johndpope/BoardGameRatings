			<description>Author's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navaho myth says that this world we live in is the Third World, and that when it, like the two before, passes away, the Chosen people will travel to the fourth world through a mystical gate in the sky.   It is December of 2012, and the Mayan calendar will shortly click over to zero. The ending of the Third World is at hand.   Dreams and portents have depicted a lantern shining the way to salvation, and so a great lighthouse has been built in the Painted Desert.  The Tribal Elders and Medicine Singers know that it is both a call to the chosen to gather, and a prayer to the Great Spirit to open the door.   Many have gathered here at the base of the Lighthouse, this shining Beacon of Hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it is Trickster Coyote&amp;rsquo;s job to be sure that the chosen are truly worthy of the fourth world, and Coyote is not convinced.  He has sabotaged the beacon.  Grandmother Spider has chosen you and a handful of others out of the gathered crowd to travel on a mystical journey through time and space to unravel the damage that has been done.  She warns, however that Coyote will also travel with the group, seeking to observe, to hinder, and perhaps, if convinced of your worthiness, to help.  Coyote is a Trickster, she reminds you, able to appear to be anyone, or anything.  She wishes you good luck, and sends you on your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beacon of Hope is a roleplay game for 3 to 6 players and one Gamesmaster or GM, designed to be played in a single evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
