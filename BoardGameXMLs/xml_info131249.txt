			<description>Put your overalls on and prepare for some family fun of the swine kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pig-Pen is a quick fire family strategy game where each player does their best to capture pigs in pens.  Grab your hand and play cards building your pen to capture the pigs.  However, be careful, as your opponent will be looking to ruin your hard work and steal your pigs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a game of Pig-Pen, players are dealt a hand of five cards,  with these cards they are going to build pens to capture pigs.  A stack of Pigs, depending on the number of players, is the timer for the game.  Once these pigs are gone the game is over.  On their turn players replenish their hands back to five cards, then they are allowed to play two cards and finally they may discard any number of cards they choose.  The choices they have are to either build their pen(s) or attack their opponent(s.)  Pens are made six cards: Four Pen cards, a Feed card to entice the pig and finally a Gate card.  Players can attack their opponents with attack cards that destroy Pen cards or Unlock Gates.  Even when a Pig is captured, it still isn't safe as players can attempt to steal it with Attack cards.  Players ultimate goal is to have the best point Pigs in their Pens at games end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pig-Pen also features three levels of play.  A simple children's level, an intermediate level with some number comparisons.  And the always fun Secret Bacon Pack, where no Pig is safe from destruction of the bacon kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
