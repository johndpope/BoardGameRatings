			<description>Players choose a card representing their monster's body.  Each such monster's body can then hold a variable number of heads, limbs and tails (i.e. the blob cannot have a head but can have up to 8 limbs and tails).  Each body also provides a special power different from other monsters.  Players bid for different cards of body parts, each provides additional powers for your monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 12 dice to allocate among their monster's body parts.  The dice indicate the amount of power available to each body part and how much damage it can take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each player's turn they can choose to attack with one of their body parts (i.e. laser beams from the head, pincer claw limbs, etc.) rolling the dice from that body part.  The player targets an enemy monster's body part, hits cause damage that remove dice from that body part.  When a body part runs out of dice it is destroyed.  When a monster loses all of its dice it is destroyed.  Different powers allow players to reallocate dice and recover dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
