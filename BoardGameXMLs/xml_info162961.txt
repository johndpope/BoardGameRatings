			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're in some serious trouble! Those clones you let escape from the Primordial Soup Kitchen a while back have made it all the way to the Garden of Smellemental Glee. You better nab them before things get out of hand. Or more out of hand, as the case may be, or, apparently, is. Oh, and watch out for hungry beasts and whatnot while you're out there. It'll take every modicum of brainularity you own to make it through this fast-paced and exciting expansion to the Dementalism card game, not to mention a shlode of luck and a few yorts of good old-fashioned courage. Also, an unspecified amount of gumption. May be played on its own or added to the Dementalism: An Ingenious Game of Ingenious Ingeniousness deck (MOC30001) and other Dementalism expansions. This 60 card expansion to the Dementalism game contains several new Denizens, Giggities (wild cards), and Turmoil Cards and introduces new Beast cards to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
