			<description>From the document's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...Begin cortex news feed for June 12th, 2514&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SENATOR WEATHERBY DEAD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although details are still coming in at this time, we can confirm that Senator Alexander Weatherby is missing and presumed dead. Senator Weatherby was the senior Member of Parliament from Persephone and served in that position for over 15 years. The Senator is better known throughout the system as the &amp;lsquo;Voice of the Browncoats.&amp;rsquo; It was Senator Weatherby who successfully led the campaign to grant clemency to all the independent soldiers who fought against the Alliance in the War of Unification. It is ironic that the Senator was fulfilling the promise he made, in his recent Unification Day speech, to visit the outer planets at the time of his death. Sources in the military tell us that Alliance Lieutenant Edward Blake, who was in command of the Senator&amp;rsquo;s transport, is being questioned in the affair. However, it is too early to know if the Lieutenant will face any kind of court martial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details the NPC Edward &amp;quot;Ned&amp;quot; Hancock&lt;br/&gt;Blake, [Call Sign: &amp;quot;Mother&amp;quot;], and his background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was available as a download, (free bonus content), from the publisher website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
