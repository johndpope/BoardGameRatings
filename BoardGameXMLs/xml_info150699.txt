							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Death Force, Go!</name>
									
			<description>Zombies have arrived and it's up to you to build a team and equip them with weapons to fight off of the hordes of the undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Death Force, Go! is a fast paced, easy to learn game where players attempt to build their attack team and arm them with zombie-crushing weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have 2 stacks infront of them in which to play Weapon and Team Member cards. The goal is to collect 5 team members and 5 weapons. There is a 3rd stack where Action cards are played. These help (or hinder) players in the game. Each card has a value and at the beginning of each turn, players add up the value of all cards on the top of each stack and draw that many cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    No cards are held at the end of the player's turn, play it or loose it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
