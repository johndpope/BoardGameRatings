							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apocalypse 100: Abandoned Home Loot 1</name>
									
			<description>The characters are exploring a weeded over, abandoned community and they come across an old house. Although the place has seen its share of looting there is still quite a bit to be found scattered amongst the debris and overturned furniture. But what exactly can the players find? 21st century homes are filled with a boggling array of possible things that the characters might want and need. This list, along with more lists to come, helps to provide the GM a random chart solution to handling the diverse loot of such places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
