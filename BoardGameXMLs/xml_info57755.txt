			<description>lowCarbs is designed to give the players an understanding of how carbon tax would work (based on how much energy a household uses) ... a more energy efficient household will not need to pay. The situation is different if electricity comes solely from hydro or nuclear generation, which is highly unlikely, as in most parts of the world it comes from renewable and non-renewable sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to juggle between getting the money for the carbon tax and finding a high energy efficient chamsuite (i.e. a set of 8 cards which have all the different appliances represented, i.e. cooker, refrigerator, hot water tank, heater, washing machine, lights, computer and television).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
