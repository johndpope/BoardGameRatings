							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Word Order</name>
									
			<description>To play, you consider several words and phrases, and determine the order in which they entered our language. &lt;br/&gt;Each card has a word on front. Players try to put them in the correct chronological order. When they have finished, they flip the cards over to see how they've done. The year each word entered the language are printed on the back.&lt;br/&gt;The game can also be played competitively, with each player passing a word to a competitor. The competitor must attempt to place it correctly in his personal timelime. If it is incorrect, it is discarded. First player to have 7 cards in their timeline wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
