							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gods of Magic</name>
									
			<description>A card, dice and storytelling game for 2-6+ players. Each player takes the role of one of the Gods of Magic. The Gods create magical realms and fill them with all manner of strangeness. The God whose realms are the most complete and fantastical becomes the current Chief amongst them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common Deck. There are 5 suits of 40 cards each:  Location, Action, Entities, Descriptors and Objects. Each card has a victory point value between 1 and 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his own domain - a player&amp;rsquo;s part of the table where he keeps his realms. A realm is a group of cards that must include one location card and are placed face up in a separate group within your domain. A complete realm contains at least one card of each of the 5 suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start each player is dealt a hand of 10 cards. Each player may play up to 3 cards to their domain to make 1 or more realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.   Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Draw 1 card and place it in your hand. Max hand size is 10 cards. Discard excess cards at the end of this phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.   Play Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Play one card from your hand to add to one of your Realms or to create a new realm. If creating a new realm, the card played must be a location card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.   Dice Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Roll the D10 and consult the Magic Table. The die result will have an effect such as discarding cards, drawing extra card, playing an extra turn, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The realms and what happens to them tell stories. In the spirit of the game players are expected to say something about a realm when they modify it, thus describing the whims and actions of the Gods of Magic.  This is usually a statement listing all the cards within the realm and how they interact with each other. This may include elements not listed on the cards themselves. If any description fails to meet the playing groups standards, the play may be stopped by the other player and the offending player must make a different action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to score 200 or more victory points. If 2 or more players score 200+ at the same time, the player with the higher score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
