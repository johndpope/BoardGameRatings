			<description>From publisher's site:&lt;br/&gt;Quadrant 13 (Q13) is a company-sized game covering science fiction warfare aimed primarily at using 6-15mm figures. It uses the same basic mechanics as I Ain&amp;rsquo;t Been Shot, Mum! and/or Charlie Don&amp;rsquo;t Surf, but is as different in flavour from them as they are from each other. It is a stand-alone game: no other rulebooks or supplements are necessary to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are completely generic, allowing players to use them to play any sci-fi conflict that they choose: whether based on background from another system, background from a film or book, background from a range of figures, or even a background that they have made up themselves. It also allows gamers to play the type of science fiction game that they want to play: &amp;lsquo;hard&amp;rsquo; sci fi, where realism is the key; space opera style games which run almost like a film; battles featuring a small number of super-tough figures against a large number of not-so-tough opponents&amp;hellip;you name it, you can play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q13 is written by Robert Avery, author of eight scenario books for I Ain&amp;rsquo;t Been Shot, Mum!, all of which are also available from theTooFatLardies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
