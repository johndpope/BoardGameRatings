			<description>Scrambled II is a self-contained solid wood game with a built-in storage drawer and scoring system. There are three levels of play to satisfy all ages from beginning readers to word game fanatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Words are formed on the game board using letter tiles of various values. Each player forms words from his own letter stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Words may be formed in any direction or combination of directions. No letters may be skipped over and no single letter tile may be used more than once in any word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until the game board is filled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
