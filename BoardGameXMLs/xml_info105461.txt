							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Riddle of Anadi</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient name of Anadi is legendary among sages, mystics, and wizards throughout the land. It was the Great Sage herself who researched countless magical rituals and spells commonly used today. Yet none know what ultimately became of Anadi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information concerning her fate was non-existant for centuries until a long lost journal written by one of her acolytes surfaced in a forgotten ruin. The scant information from the journal tells little of Anadi's demise other than that she finally met forces she could not control. It does, however, direct the reader to her final resting place deep in mountains infester by trolls and other creatures deemed too dangerous to battle by anyone but the most determined souls. Anadi's final resting place awaits! Can your adventurers west the great riddle of Anadi's fate from the dust of ages?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
