							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Septentrionalis Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Septentrionalis, and the larger world of which it is only a small part, is equal parts utopia and uchronia: a place that never was, full of events that never happened. Neither its history nor its geography are quite the same as those of our own world, although they agree in many places. Much of it will be familiar to even a casual student of history or lover of historical adventure fiction and film, but, as you will see, there are differences. In short, it is a distorted mirror of history, one that magnifies adventure, drama, and mystery, at the expense of the tedious, the depressing and the mundane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an early web publication of materials that eventually would be reworked, expanded, and commercially published in:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Northern Crown Introduction&lt;br/&gt;        Northern Crown: New World Adventures (3.5)&lt;br/&gt;        Northern Crown: New World Adventures (Pathfinder)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
