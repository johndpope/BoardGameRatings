Use as many of these tables as you need, or all of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you find tables for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Scroll Details such as ink, material and wrap bar&lt;br/&gt;     Mundane scrolls - Such as letters, inventorys, bounties and more&lt;br/&gt;     Enchanted scrolls - Scrolls that have a power all of their own&lt;br/&gt;     Curse scrolls - Not all scrolls give you a benefit&lt;br/&gt;     Quirks and Special Features - Make each scroll unique&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that although this has been designed with The Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game in mind, actual costs and values have been left out to allow for use in many other settings and games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
