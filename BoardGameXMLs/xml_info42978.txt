			<description>Players compete for the votes of the world's countries, in the hopes of becoming the &amp;quot;Secretary General of the Nations&amp;quot;.  Each player moves his pawn around the board, which depicts flags of the world.  If he lands on an unclaimed country, he must provide one or more facts about it to claim that country's vote.  The game includes a booklet with facts about the 184 countries (capitol, language, population, religion, currency, and geographic area), or you may use an almanac for other facts.
