			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientists of the 21st century were, in the opinions of some, the pinnacle of humanity&amp;rsquo;s curiosity. Their &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; experiments have run rampant over the universe, ravaging worlds and creating hundreds&amp;mdash;perhaps thousands &amp;mdash; of invasive new life forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of particular note, for our purposes, is the rapid development of new engines for propelling vehicles through space. One corporation conducted experiments that went far, far beyond the scope of normal drive developments. The results of their experiment have come to be known by many names &amp;mdash; the mind worm, devourer of angels, the astro-liminal zone&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The space witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one sure-fire way to encounter the space witch. Use the Infinity Continuum drive in your spaceship, and sooner or later, the space witch will appear before you, crumbling the laws of reality beneath its feet and hurtling your ship through portals no human mind was meant to breach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The being behind these suspensions of the laws of physics appears as a luminous, humanoid-shaped hole in the fabric of reality. Looking through, one gazes into another dimension where space is full of life and sentience, where the absences of thought are like pockets of sadness, holes in Swiss cheese or the shoes of the homeless. Curtains of alien thoughts separate this world from the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It does not speak, but when it appears to humans, it seems to project thoughts and emotions into them. Some survivors report the feeling that the &amp;ldquo;space witch&amp;rdquo; was shuffling through their own thoughts and memories, and there is ample evidence that it&lt;br/&gt;responds to human behaviours. It has no physical form and has never conclusively appeared on any recording, although artistic interpretations by those who have encountered it agree on its general appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
