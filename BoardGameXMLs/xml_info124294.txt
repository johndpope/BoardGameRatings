			<description>Monster Allergy is a cardgame, where players try to outbid each outher with the cards they have in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns choosing some cards of their hand. They play these cards in front of the player at the left of him and says a number and a color. This player can eather accept these cards and play new cards in front of they player that is next to him, with the only restriction that the number must be higher. Or he can say 'YO!'. When a player shouts YO!, you look at the cards, if the player lied and played a number less then the number he called the player loses some points.
