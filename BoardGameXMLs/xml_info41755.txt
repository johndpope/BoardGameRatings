			<description>Diamond Destination, the game of network marketing success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin by selecting a dream and being assigned a job. With only a few prospects, you begin your network marketing business by turning these prospects into customers and associates. You soon discover that through the process of personal development, you will become more skilled and your business accelerates. With more customers and associates, your entrepreneurial income goes up, as does your rank in the company. You then empower your team of associates to duplicate your efforts, and your business quickly expands. Of course, there are challenges to overcome and hard lessons to be learned before achieving diamond status, but with good fortune and great skill, you will reach your ultimate dream: your Diamond Destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
