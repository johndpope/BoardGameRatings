			<description>Put your hand, eye, and brain to the test with this fast paced app-enabled card game! It's Great for groups too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Kubeni is to take what you see on the three dimensional image - which is displayed on either a card or app screen - and recreate it in &amp;quot;real life&amp;quot; before the timer runs out (30 seconds)-  easy right?  But there's a bit more to it... Different modes add new elements to the game and a connected app introduces the possibility of new game modes and kards via update.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;- 100% hands-on game&lt;br/&gt;- 1-8 Players&lt;br/&gt;- 20 minute games&lt;br/&gt;- ALL AGES&lt;br/&gt;- HIGHLY energized&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BENEFITS:&lt;br/&gt;- Portable: Take it anywhere (especially app-enhanced version)&lt;br/&gt;- Handsy: Kubeni is HANDS-ON- think of Jenga, but in reverse.  &lt;br/&gt;- Quick setup/take down:  Play then put away.&lt;br/&gt;- Great for groups: Have friends over and get ready for some thrills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
