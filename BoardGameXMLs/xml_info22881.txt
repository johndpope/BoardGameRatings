			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A truly classic board game that is as old as Rome.  This game was probably played in the very first Roman tavern.  It has remained an Italian favorite to this day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Most throws of the dice have a price, and players pay the board until someone throws the lucky combination that wins all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games in this series are from our favorite &amp;quot;watering holes&amp;quot; on four different continents.  We are proud to present them to our friends here at home, and have forced ourselves to consume a lot of memorable local brews in the fulfillment of this endeavor.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to roll two dice.  Any number other than 7, 2 or 12 requires placing the stake (or stone from the set) on the number rolled on the supplied board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll 2 and take the stakes from 8-12, but place a stake on 2.  Roll a 12 and take the stakes from 2-6, but place a stake on 2.  Roll a 7 and you take ALL the stakes, or place one stake on 7 if the board is empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until agreed, or all but one of the players is out of money (or stones).  A Neapolitan version ignores the rules for 2 and 12, and treats them as any other non-7 roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
