							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Math Bingo</name>
									
			<description>Math Bingo is a twist on traditional Bingo designed to reinforce basic arithmetic skills. In this game, each player has a 4x4 card with a series of numbers. A caller reads a series of math problems (either addition and subtraction for younger children or multiplication and division for older). Players must solve the math problem and mark a space on their card corresponding to the answer. Once a player completes a row or column and claims bingo, the caller checks the math to make sure their answers are correct. If so, they are declared the winner. If not, incorrect answers are removed from the card and play continues until a player completes a row or column of correct answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
