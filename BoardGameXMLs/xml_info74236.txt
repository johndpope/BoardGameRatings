			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have your players already saved the world three time, and the universe twice this month? Do their characters need a break from carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders?  Are they just looking for an adventure with no global importance whatsoever? Then Mr. Robert Burke Johnson of Nabiki Tech has just what they're searching for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wlecome back to the world of good clean fun! In &amp;quot;Return of the Ravagers&amp;quot; your characters aren't asked to save the world from destruction, the country from ruin, or even Aunt Martha's cat from a tree. Instead they will be participating in the creation of this year's newest mega-hit arcade fighting game.  Move over Fatal Street Kombat, Ravagers is on its way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return of the Ravagers is an adventure designed for characters from 6th to 12th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
