			<description>Get Bit! Collectors Edition contains Walk the Plank!, Get Bit!, and Hold Your Breath! &amp;mdash; three independent games that collectively tell a larger story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Walk the Plank!, players represent the worst pirates in a captain's crew. The captain has rounded you all up because you're all lazy and stupid and simply not worth the rum and loot you get paid. That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get Bit! is a card game in which the player pirates find themselves in the ocean, competing to stay alive as others are being eaten by a shark. The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face down, then revealing the values. The number on each player's card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don't move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hold Your Breath!, the game is played in two rounds. In the first round each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &amp;quot;Swim&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Air&amp;quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one AND resurfaces in round two who is the winner. Players can play &amp;quot;Panic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Shark&amp;quot; and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before they run out of air and therefore decide to take a rest (aka LOSE). Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive AND dove the deepest is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in each copy is a bonus chipboard with a newly designed pirate ship, an additional &amp;quot;Captain&amp;quot; stand-up starting token, and even some hunger tokens to go with the now included Sharkspansion for Get Bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
