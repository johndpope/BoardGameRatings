			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survivors of the recent Battle of Enpebyn told of a beautiful, ten-foot-tall Elorii woman clad in the purest shimmering white armor who helped turn the tide in the battle against the il'Huan horde. No one seemed to know who she was or where she came from, and the last time anyone saw her alive was when she dove into the Lavender Way to take the fight directly to the enemy. In the months since that battle ended, the Laerestri have been searching for any information about her, but to no avail. Now a summons has come for you from a most unlikely source - the Council of Elders of Ethelios, capitol of the mighty Elorii nation of Elonbe. It seems that you are to be granted safe passage through the Vastwood for a meeting of great importance. But what could be so terrible that the Council feels the need to reach beyond its own borders for assistance for the first time in nearly four thousand years?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Players of Elorii PCs, particularly Suromari and Warders, are strongly encouraged to play those characters in this scenario. However, the party is not required to have any Elorii in order to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a LIVING ARCANIS STANDARD adventure, designed for 1st to 16th level characters (APL 2 through 15).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
