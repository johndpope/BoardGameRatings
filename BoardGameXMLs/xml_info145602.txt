							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Freedom: The Underground Railroad – Promo Cards</name>
									
			<description>Freedom: The Underground Railroad is a card-driven, cooperative game in which players work for the abolitionist movement to help bring an end to slavery in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freedom: The Underground Railroad &amp;ndash; Promo Cards is a set of 18 promo cards containing Abolitionist Cards, Opposition Cards, and Reserve Cards. Each set was introduced as a different stretch goal during the Kickstarter. But since all three goals were met, they were all shipped together in one pack. These were also available as one pack from the BGG Store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Freedom: The Underground Railroad - Abolitionist Cards is a mini-expansion that adds resolution and historical proponents for all three eras of the game, including Josiah Henson, Thomas Garrett, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, John Parker Hale, Robert Purvis, and more. Each card includes text that introduces players to these important and influential historical figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Freedom: The Underground Railroad - Opposition Cards is a mini-expansion that represents enacted laws and regulations that helped the slavery States and were blows against the Abolitionist Movement. These include the Fugitive Slave Act, U.S. Marshals and more. Each card hinders the Abolitionist movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Freedom: The Underground Railroad - Reserve Cards is a mini-expansion that adds pro-Abolitionist groups and ideas such as The Quakers, the Personal Liberty Laws, the Principles of '98 and more. Each card helps the Abolitionist movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
