							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bilestoad</name>
									
			<description>The Bilestoad is a computer game by Marc Goodman (credited as &amp;quot;Mangrove Earthshoe&amp;quot;) for the Apple II platform, released in 1982 by Datamost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Bilestoad, players control &amp;quot;meatlings&amp;quot; that hack and battle with axes and shields from a top-view perspective. The name is derived from the German words Beil (axe) and Tod (death). The odd spelling reflects Goodman's idea of a future language similar to A Clockwork Orange's Nadsat in which English has been modified by the borrowing of foreign words. Although the game may seem medieval, the backstory in the manual explains that the axe fighting is actually a future virtual reality game designed to reduce real violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bilestoad allows a human player to fight against either a computer-controlled opponent or another human. One can also pit two robots against each other. Movement and combat is accomplished with the keyboard, pressing keys to swing the gladiator's axe or shield outwards or inwards, or to make the gladiator turn, stop or walk. The game play is quite violent and bloody&amp;mdash;players lop off their opponents' shield or sword arms, and dispatch them by decapitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arena of combat is a small island, maps of which (at short, medium, and long range) are shown at the right side of the screen. Scattered around the arena are various objects, including yin/yang discs which players can stand on to accelerate their movement, stars that transport players to other points in the arena, and &amp;quot;faces&amp;quot; that allow players to leave the level. The game offers more strategic variation than many fighting games, letting the player run away and be chased around the island. The musical soundtrack begins with a bizarre, ponderous, off-key re-working of Beethoven's &amp;quot;F&amp;uuml;r Elise&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the author, influences for The Bilestoad include the movie Excalibur and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Bilestoad&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
