			<description>Hollywood 1940s &lt;br/&gt;What would happen if horror movies' monsters were actually played by real monsters? And what if they were now forced to play in kids' movies, romantic comedies or even musicals? And what would happen if, at the end, they decided to rebel?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions, and a hundred of others, will have to be answered by Liz Allaire, a talented journalist who can't count up to 4, and Dan Murray, a tough macho who can't stand beetles. Help them solve all these mysteries in an adventure that will put your brain to a severe test!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
