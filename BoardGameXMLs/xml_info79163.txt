			<description>Campaign 1776: The American Revolution is a tactical/operational level game covering the major battles of the American Revolution from the first clashes at Concord and Lexington to the Siege of Yorktown.  The game combines a detailed tactical game engine with a higher level campaign game so that the player can fight individual battles, a campaign covering several battles, or the entire Revolutionary War.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;     Over 40 historical and what-if battles are included in the game together with a full-feature scenario editor. The game also includes 4 historical campaigns: Greene vs. Cornwallis, Washington vs. Howe, and Gates vs. Burgoyne plus a small campaign covering the major events of the full war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Includes Main Program, Scenario Editor, Campaign Front-End, and Campaign Editor. The Campaign Editor allows the player to construct their own campaign games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete on-line documentation help files together with printable versions of the documentation files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Includes period background music which plays during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
