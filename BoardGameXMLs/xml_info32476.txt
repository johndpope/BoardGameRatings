			<description>Skarb Zakonu - &amp;quot;The Treasure of the Order&amp;quot; is a game of explorers. Players start in a library built - according to the legends - on ruins of a medieval castle of the Teutonic Order. Rumore are that there is a great treasure of the order hidden somewhere underground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to usual game components like pawns, game cards, and a two-floor board this game contains a DVD disc with more than 600 quests and riddles (a DVD player with the &amp;quot;random order play&amp;quot; feature is required).
