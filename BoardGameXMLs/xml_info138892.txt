			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;All-Shaking Thunder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a tense couple of years (or couple of decades, if we&amp;rsquo;re being accurate) in the Sixth World. Aztlan and Amazonia have been slugging it out. Great dragons have turned on each other, testing old alliances and forging new ones. Governor Kenneth Brackhaven of Seattle is facing pressure unlike ever he&amp;rsquo;s ever seen, and scandals seem on the verge of overwhelming him. In Denver, a powerful dragon and an angry elf are set to butt heads in ways that will shake up the whole city&amp;mdash;and provide new opportunities for an old enemy. And on top of that, a new plague is spreading through the world, and the denizens of JackPoint aren&amp;rsquo;t immune to its effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this tension has been building up, and in Storm Front, it breaks. Storm Frontprovides background and updates on these and other plotlines changing the shape of the Sixth World. The shadows are shifting, and runners need to move fast if they want to earn a paycheck&amp;mdash;or if they want to keep from being crushed as the powers of the world slug it out. The world is changing, but some things remain the same. Power will corrupt. Money will flow to those who already have it. And shadowrunners will scramble to make a living without selling their soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storm Front provides plot information as well as adventure hooks that are compatible with Shadowrun, Fourth Edition while also laying the groundwork for the upcoming Shadowrun, Fifth Edition. As a bridge between the two editions, this book is useful to all Shadowrun players, setting the stage for explosive stories and memorable campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Additional Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aztlan and Amazonia slugging it out.
