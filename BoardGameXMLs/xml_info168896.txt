			<description>Educational game of bingo to teach antonyms and synonyms.  Cards are laid out just like a bingo game (5 x 5 grid), but the &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; space is labeled either as &amp;quot;antonyms&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;synonyms&amp;quot;.  The rest of the spaces are words.  The game leader pick a word from the 121-calling card deck and call it out.  Those players with &amp;quot;antonym&amp;quot; on their free space will cover any word that is an antonym of the called word.  Those players with &amp;quot;synonym&amp;quot; on their free space will cover any word that is a synonym of the called word.  Any player who covers 5 spaces in one row of their card - either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, will call out &amp;quot;Quizmo!&amp;quot;.  They are the winner of that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
