							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modular Maze Game</name>
									
			<description>The primary equipment for this game consists of four plastic trays which fit together in pairs, 252 plastic walls which fit between pillars in the trays, and two marbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes two trays and constructs a maze in one using the walls - some walls have large holes which the marbles can pass through, some have small holes which block them.  The second tray snaps onto the first to hold the walls in place.  The players swap mazes and compete to be the first to get a marble through theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with clamps which hold sets of trays together to make multi-level mazes - you can make a two-level maze with a single set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
