			<description>The board represents a corner of French with different routes: the path of Business, the sentimental route etc. The goal is to reach the Fortunate Isles across the entire plateau by road you choose. Different modes of transportation are available: car, rail, plane, boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefit cards are auctioned at the beginning of the game: transport, post office, restaurants, casinos, websites (one card per player). The auction amount is paid to the Fund for Tourism. The transfer takes place through the die roll for the car and paying for his trip by train or plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when one player reaches the lighthouse square, it gets the money up in the Bank of Tourism and each opponent receives 25 FF. Whoever wins two rounds (or one that remains after eliminating competitors by bankruptcy) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
