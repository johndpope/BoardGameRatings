							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minions: Cowboys &amp; Aliens</name>
									
			<description>This is the follow up game to Minions: Darkness &amp;amp; Myth. Like the Darkness &amp;amp; Myth each player has a hand for a single faction, Cowboys or Aliens. Each player starts with a full hand of Minions, Boons and Power cards for their faction. Each Glory card (points) requires that a Quest be accomplished. Players choose a Minion, Boon and Power card they feel is best to win that Glory. Both players turn their cards over. Based on the cards and a die roll, the high total takes the card. Minions: Cowboys &amp;amp; Aliens is a complete game in itself or can be combined with Minions: Darkness &amp;amp; Myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
