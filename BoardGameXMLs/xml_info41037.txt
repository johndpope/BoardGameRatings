							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of the Nasotti</name>
									
			<description>On 138 tokens are reproduced some scenes of the tile board that composes the game. A token is chosen from a bag and all the players are asked to search for the scene reproduced on the token on the various tiles. The winner is the one that at the end of the game has discovered more scenes and thus gathered more tokens.&lt;br/&gt;Searching among the detailed scenarios of Cinecitt&amp;agrave; is not that easy but it is funny for sure thanks to the nice characters, the Nasotti.&lt;br/&gt;The Game of the Nasotti (Il gioco dei Nasotti) is the same game like Nosies im Kinoland!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
