			<description>U-one.  Submarine versus Merchantman.  Consists of a heavy card stock full color four fold board showing the Western Approaches (South West England, the French Coast, and the Channel Islands with a superimposed playing grid.  The game is played by two players (1 controls a submarine, the other a merchant ship).  Each lead ship occupies 3 squares and must move forward the number rolled on the die.  Players must avoid the red squares (minefields) and the object of the game is for the merchant ship to safely enter either Southhampton or Havre.  The submarine must have the merchant ship directly to its bow and must roll a number equal to or greater than the distance between the ships to sink the merchant and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
