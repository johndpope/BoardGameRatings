			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock a New Kind of Mythic Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, your character&amp;rsquo;s mythic path tells you about the kinds of abilities in which he specializes, and perhaps even gives some clue as to his ultimate mythic destiny, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about where he came from, and what made him mythic in the first place. For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment introduces the angelic heritage, for characters whose mythic power comes from the heavenly realms and the forces of truth and justice. Many with this mythic heritage are the direct descendants of angels or other celestial beings, who may have fallen in love with the character&amp;rsquo;s mortal parent, or who may have deliberately been attempting to bring a prophesied hero into the world. Others had their mythic power bestowed upon them by angelic forces in order to do good in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever its cause, this mythic heritage allows you to harness the great cosmic powers of the heavens. This book includes 18 new mythic abilities, which together make up the angelic mythic heritage. In addition to all of the basics of being an angel, such as a halo that sheds light and marks you as an undeniable servant of righteousness, gaining all of the standard angel immunities and resistances, gaining feathery wings, and projecting a magic circle against evil, those with this mythic heritage can also speak with the voice of a god, damaging mortals who hear, turn any weapon they touch into a powerful holy weapon, or shield their allies with their own bodies to not only protect their friends but regain mythic power by doing so, as well as numerous other heavenly powers. Take on the mantle of a celestial guardian!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
