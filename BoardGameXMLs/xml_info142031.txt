							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thing in Lab 34</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some Things Should Stay Under Ground...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the super-secret organization known as The Agency screws up, they screw up big.  Even as they struggle to recapture their lost and rogue facilities, thse places have become breeding grounds for all manner of crimes and horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one of these laboratories accidentally creates a nigh-perfect predator of humanity, it's possible that not even The Agency can contain it.  That's ok, though... that's what adventurers are for.  Maybe some PCs can take care of the problem... or get eaten in the process!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See the layout of the Lab 34 facility, and read what it takes to create a horrible predator like no other.  Learn what becomes of the victims of the Thing, and find out why, if it is not stopped, humanity may be in for a very bad time indeed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
