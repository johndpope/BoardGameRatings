			<description>This light filler from Rudi Hoffmann is somewhat different in several ways.&lt;br/&gt;It uses the closed box as part of the game. As a rules sheet or booklet would hinder play the rules are printed on top of the box lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 6 coloured player mats, each depicting  the outer lines of a parrot. The parrot has to be puzzled of 6 different parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To claim these parts (also in 6 colours), you have to close the box and to rattle it back and forth, up and down. When you open it, you see a hole in an insert cardboard mask, also depicting a parrot. Below this mask is a two-sided ramp with a plateau in the middle, where you notice a circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find one or more parrot-puzzle-piece(s) touching the circle, you can take them to complete the parrot on your mat.&lt;br/&gt;Pieces you already claimed before are put back in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The completed parrot is worth different points, regarding how much different colours it contains (the more the better).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
