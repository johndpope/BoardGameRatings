							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ramses Rage</name>
									
			<description>Ramses II reigned over Ancient Egypt for 67 years. Today, you can shake the tomb, but beware of his rage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with six standard dice and one multi-colored pyramid.  The object of the game is to reach 10,000 points. Points are acquired by rolling the dice and the pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls the dice and tries to earn as many points as possible in each turn.  A highly successful roll or set of rolls allows the player the option of throwing the pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
