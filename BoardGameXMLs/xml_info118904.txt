			<description>Jackass: The Game is a video game based on the television series Jackass. The game was first shown at the 2006 E3 behind closed doors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the Jackass cast (excluding Bam Margera) and crew provided their own voices and supply their likenesses for the game, according to Sidhe Interactive. Johnny Knoxville and other members of the Jackass team also provided stunt ideas to the developer based on unused stunts from the show. A trailer was released in June 2007 on the game's official website, along with the cover art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Filling in as director of Jackass, your aim is to collect the best footage from up to 36 stunts throughout the game to create a new Jackass season for MTV. All stunts have a minimum requirement for content before MTV will approve an episode for broadcast. The new season requires seven episodes of Jackass footage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackass offers two gameplay modes for players:&lt;br/&gt;    MTV Story Mode: The primary gameplay mode for Jackass: The Game, the narratives drives your progress through the game. By playing MTV Story Mode you can unlock new content within the game.&lt;br/&gt;    Episodes - Stunts are collected into groups called &amp;quot;Episodes&amp;quot;. Episodes in the game are similar to the format and structure of the TV series, collecting a series of stunts which may or may not be related by a general theme. In each episode, the player is free to complete the stunts in any order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Progression - Completing goals within a stunt attempt means collecting footage for an episode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jackass: The Game&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
