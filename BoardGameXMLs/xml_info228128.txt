			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the late 22nd century mankind expands into the stars only to find them in more turmoil than it's own internal nationalism. Pitted against the onslaught of the expansion of the Stotatl Empire, humanity must defend itself while forging alliances with others who face absorption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're a Terran soldier or an Aronhi Warrior from the partially conquered Aronhi Empire, one goal stands supreme above all, survival. The wits and courage to stand and fight against superior odds and create victories from difficult situations. But not all the glory lies in the hands of warriors. Exploration of the vast wilderness that is space, charting dangers, finding resources and contacting potential allies is a cornerstone of survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conflict, intrigue, action and adventure of these times provide an exciting roleplaying environment for players, whether they like playing space marines, traders, spies, investigators or just general adventure seekers. The span of events in reality are all possible, giving a wide scope of play. If you don't like flying around the cosmos as a British Royal Space Marine then could always visit a primitive society and face the challenge of worlds filled with mystery, fantasy and danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
