			<description>A proprietary card game based on the standard social card game known in books as &amp;quot;I Doubt It,&amp;quot; but more popularly as &amp;quot;Bulls**t.&amp;quot; It was created by a college business professor in Alva, Okla., in the early 1990s and marketed by his startup company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 72 cards in 14 denominations. Each denomination, numbered 1 to 14, depicts a leisure activity, such as &amp;quot;Golfing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Shopping.&amp;quot; As in &amp;quot;I Doubt It,&amp;quot; the object is to shed all your cards. Players announce in turn that they are discarding a certain number of cards in a certain denomination, always having the option to bluff. The other players can challenge. Anyone losing a challenge must take all the discards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike &amp;quot;I Doubt It,&amp;quot; the game requires players in turn to play cards in the same denomination rather than increasing denominations. (In other words, if Player 1 plays &amp;quot;Hunting&amp;quot; cards and goes unchallenged, the Player 2 must either play &amp;quot;Hunting&amp;quot; cards or pass.) The denomination changes after a challenge -- or if all players pass, at which point the discard pile is retired and started anew. The game also includes a denomination of wild cards (1, &amp;quot;Anything Goes&amp;quot;), and one denomination (13, &amp;quot;Fooling Around&amp;quot;) that can only be played as part of a bluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player sheds all his cards, he scores the point total of all cards remaining in his opponents' hands. The game ends at 100 points. The game also offers rules for couples to play in partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
