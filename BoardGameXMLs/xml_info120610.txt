			<description>NASCAR 07 is the tenth installment of the EA Sports' NASCAR video game series. This was the last NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on sixth generation consoles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NTSC game cover features Elliott Sadler, driver of the #38 M&amp;amp;M's Ford Fusion. The PAL region game cover features Matt Kenseth's #17 DeWalt Power Tools Ford Fusion. This game is the first since NASCAR 2001 not to include a subtitle in the name. The game retains the teammate features introduced in NASCAR 06: Total Team Control, but does not add any major gameplay changes. However, the graphics include a blurring effect to attempt to give a better sense of high speed, and the pace of the gameplay has been sped up considerably. This is also the second EA Sports NASCAR video game to appear on a handheld system (first NASCAR 2000 for Game Boy Color). On the PlayStation Portable, the game is simply called NASCAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NASCAR 07&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
