			<description>This is a quiz game for two players or teams, where players try to name as many items as they can in particular categories. The game is played with 15 cards that list various categories, and a nice wooden teetotum with six sides that affects scoring. The sides of the teetotum show: +1, -1, 1X, 1X, 2X and a joker.&lt;br/&gt;The game is bilingual, having rules and text in both Czech and Slovak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Dino website, the game is listed in English as 'Quicky', although no English version is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game designer and year of manufacture is not stated. The illustrations are credited to Ji&amp;amp;#345;&amp;iacute; Pros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
