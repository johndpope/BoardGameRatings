			<description>&amp;amp;quot;Murder Party - Crimini divertenti&amp;amp;quot; collects under a single cover two different murder/mystery party games for 12 people (but quite easily adapted for less people), with all the materials needed to play. They come together with detailed informations about how to host a Murder Party, and some reports of the experiences of the author that used them also in theaters, restaurants, hotels, schools and company training sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;amp;quot;Una piroga in fumo&amp;amp;quot; (&amp;amp;quot;A pirogue that went into smoke&amp;amp;quot;) is set in Madagascar, among tangled relationships between Europeans and local people. &amp;amp;quot;...Solo pi&amp;ugrave; sette ore!&amp;amp;quot; (&amp;amp;quot;...Just seven hours left!&amp;amp;quot;) is about the murder of a young psychiatrist: patients, neightbours, famuly and friends are among the suspects. Both of them include secret goals for each player, besides the solution of the mistery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
