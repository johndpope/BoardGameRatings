A train is traveling through Egypt towards the ancient city of Khartoum. Among the passengers are a bunch of adventurers who, though strangers, find themselves in the same hot and cramped compartment of the dusty train. A conversation is struck and an uneasy association is made as they realize they&amp;rsquo;re all heading for the same place -the ancient site of THE TOMB OF RAMITIN. Perhaps they all have the same secret aim -to bring back the famed diamond which, according to legend, is hidden in the vault. BUT several mysterious deaths have occurred at the site and the place is now known as the..THE TOMB OF DEATH!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are the Adventurers. They will act out SEVEN SCENES, working from instructions given by the DIRECTOR (on the audio CD). They arrive on set 'in character', each with their own secret identity (sealed instructions sent out by the host(s) with the invitations). The evening culminates in THE SCREEN PLAY AWARD CEREMONY a magnificent affair where players are judged in three categories; On their abilities to ACT, to IDENTIFY CHARACTER TRAITS IN OTHERS and to DISCOVER THE SECRET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner will keep the prestigious SCREEN PLAY AWARD STATUE.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a series of &amp;quot;Movie Mystery&amp;quot; games, which work well at parties with people who enjoy mysteries and a little bit of play-acting.  Role-playing gamers can easily take to this as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
