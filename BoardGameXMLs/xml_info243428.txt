			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took years of extensive physical and mental therapy for him to get over a drag racing crash that left him crippled and disfigured. Hoping to stay involved in racing, he focused his efforts on engineering. But he couldn't get over the constant hushed whispers behind his back and, worse, never being able to drive his incredible designs. He turned his attention to robotics and cybernetics. He was determined to walk again. But still the whispers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the decades that followed, his mental issues strengthened. His early failed experiments in cybernetic interfaces drove him quite mad, birthing his criminal identity as MASTER ENGINE. He would never be pitied again. With his cybernetic armored suit and army of robot minions, the world would fear and respect him!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
