			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos Realms is a pen and paper role playing game that allows you to play the role of another person &amp;ndash; a &amp;ldquo;character&amp;rdquo; that you create yourself. This &amp;ldquo;character&amp;rdquo; that you have created can be anything from an Outdoorsman, Street Fighter or a Toxic Shaman. You may find inspiration from your favorite fictional hero or heroine, or you may build your character from the ground up. Once you have decided what kind of character you want to play, it is time to breathe life into your new character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONSULT WITH YOUR CHAOS LORD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before creating your character, consult with the Chaos Lord (a.k.a. Game Master) to determine the campaign settings as this may affect the types of Character Professions available. It is also a good idea to see what kind of characters the other players are creating, in order to create a well balanced team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
