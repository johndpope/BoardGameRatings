			<description>Build and manage a modern-day skyscraper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A modern skyscraper is an intricate machine of interlocking systems, which depend on each other in their daily function. Tenants will expect everything to just work, and to have all of their needs met under one roof. It's your job to keep this machine running smoothly and efficiently. Keep your ear to the ground, but your eye to the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the architect, you'll have to plan carefully as your building grows from bare ground to a spire in the sky. Will you make it a magnet for entertainment, teeming with tourists raving about their posh hotel rooms? Will you construct world-famous corporate HQs where business titans sit down to power lunches at the best restaurant in town? Or will you build luxury condos for the privileged elite who make their homes way up above it all pampered by the best shops and exclusive boutiques? There are many paths to fame. It's up to you to choose yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the building manager, you'll have to keep careful tabs on everyone that walks through your doors. Are your office workers pleased with the food choices? Do your condo residents enjoy the new grocery store? Are the fountains in the atrium clean and are the escalators in good repair? Does the law firm on 42 think the rent is too high or the carpets too dirty? Keeping everyone happy keeps the rent coming in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
