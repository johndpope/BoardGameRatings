			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take control of either the Bianco or Nero cat mafia families and lead their side to victory in a series of face-offs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each face-off, players choose a boss from their initial hand of 5 cards.  That card is then placed, face down on the table in front of them.  From there, players go back and forth playing one or two cards to raise their attack value above their opponents.  When someone finally passes, the owner of the last card played scores a successful attack.  The winner of the face-of then chooses one of their opponents cards and scores points equal to the number of paw prints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After several face-offs, points are tallied and the player with the highest amount wins the battle.  The first player to win 3 battles sees his family come out on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
