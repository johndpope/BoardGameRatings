			<description>Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Kōkeisha​ (ファミコン探偵倶楽部 消えた後継者,? &amp;quot;Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir&amp;quot;) is a text-based adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer Disk System on April 27, 1988 and June 14, 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario was written by Toru Osawa and Nagihiro Asama, based on the concept by Yoshio Sakamoto.[1] The story begins with a man named &amp;quot;Amachi&amp;quot; discovering the fallen protagonist on the ground near a cliff. The protagonist discovers that he has lost his memory, and after recuperating, he revisits the cliff and meets a young girl named Ayumi Tachibana. He learns from Ayumi that he is an assistant detective investigating the death of Kiku Ayashiro, and heads over to the nearby Ayashiro estate located in Myoujin village. The Ayashiro family owns a huge plot of land passed down from generation to generation, but there is a strange saying in the village that the dead will return to life to kill anyone who attempts to steal the treasure of the Ayashiro family. As the protagonist investigates the mysterious death of Kiku Ayashiro, he discovers the terrifying connection between this saying and the serial killings which take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Kōkeisha&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
