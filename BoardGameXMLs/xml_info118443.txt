							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jugger: An Indian Game</name>
									
			<description>Early 20th century card game published by a Missionary Society, with the intention of making people aware of their work in the sub-continent. The game is fundamentally about India although Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three games are mentioned in the rules; Jugger, Picture Lotto and Buss. The former is the main game, the Lotto game has nothing to do with the traditional Lotto game, and there are no rules (in my set) to the game of Buss..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players ask each other for cards in a set they already have at least one card in that set in their hand. In Jugger, the object is to collect the most sets. In Lotto, the object is to claim the most cards by answering correctly when a question is read out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Notes from the rules;&lt;br/&gt;Picture Cards&lt;br/&gt;At the top of each picture card there is the name of a place where missionaries are working. In the game these places are called 'Juggers', the phonetic spelling of 'Jugah', a Hindustani word meaning 'place' or 'post'. Where a place is not well known and the pronunciation is difficult, phonetic spelling is given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Cards&lt;br/&gt;These are the Key Cards. Each map gives the names of the Juggers (marked by a heavy dot) in the set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question Cards&lt;br/&gt;All the question cards are essential for Picture Lotto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
