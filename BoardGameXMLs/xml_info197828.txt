			<description>2315 &amp;ndash; It's 200 years since the Global Nuclear War and the following nuclear winter on planet Earth. The New Earth League, headed by the new super-power, the Xian, has ordered exploration of Alpha Centauri, with the prime mission to discover habitable planets and new forms of energy. Currently, the energy for propulsion, plasma from Helium-3 fusion, maxes out space ship thrusters at one-tenth the speed of light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After mining Helium-3 on Mars and the Moon, it has taken over 50 years and three space bases to traverse the 40 trillion kilometres to reach AC. The pioneers spend their days charting and mining the planets and moons of the 3-star system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a routine mining trip to super-hot planet, Sir Isaac Newton, a new type of lava is discovered. Rumours soon spread throughout the factions of a new volatile fuel for propulsion. Admirals are alerted, suspicions are raised and treaties are broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five competing factions: the Freelanders, New Brittany, the Nairobi, the Xian (Sian) and the Mozzies vie for control of the newly discovered resource. It's unstable properties could be harnessed to allow mankind to finally reach it&amp;rsquo;s long-sought-after goal &amp;ndash; to travel at the speed of light!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the captain of your faction. Lead your sky-bots and miners into the fray against cunning adversaries in a winner-take-all, pell-mell battle. Will your people share in the staggering discovery, and glory &amp;ndash; or be left far, far behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;METTLE, is a 2-player space combat game, played with fantastic miniatures on 124 two inch tiles. Your goal is to fight past enemy bots, including a cloaked one, knock out laser towers and destroy the opposition fortress. Along the way you must collect lava-X and titanium which can be traded for reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;METTLE is a fast-paced game where both players are immersed in the action at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
