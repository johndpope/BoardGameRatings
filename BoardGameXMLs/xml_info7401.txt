			<description>The game for the academic establishment...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are honorable university professors that try to win the Nobel Price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the help of their well paid doctors, students and some very strange machines they try to get enough scientific publications to qualify for the various commissions that decide about the academic fate of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific part is mainly driven by drawing one or more of  the huge number of event cards - which can be positive or negative (Surprise!!!). But also a bit of negotiating is necessary as you often want to use some scientific machines only another player owns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting in the different commissions requires also some negotiating between the players (Promise everything, but keep nothing..).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game uses a lot of humor in the card texts, the machine names etc., but I guess all the pseudo-scientific names make the humorous part of the game almost non-translatable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
