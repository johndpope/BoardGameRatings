							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Coach&#039;s Box</name>
									
			<description>A game to simulate Australian Football...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two coaches, or teams of coaches, place their teams on the field. Coaches use dice to determine who has possession of the ball. They aim to keep possession, so they can pass the ball to their forwards, and shoot for goal.&lt;br/&gt;Each team has players of different abilities, and they may move their players during the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactics come into the game, as coaches decide upon their best path to goal, whilst ensuring they have a strategy to prevent their opponents from scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A standard game may last up to thirty minutes, but can be extended to last a traditional &amp;quot;four quarters&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by two players, or two teams of coaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
