							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Smack-A-Roo</name>
									
			<description>Smack-A-Roo is a fun family game that is actually 10 games in one: Baseball, Smack-It, Skeebol, Knockoff, Bowlaround, Duck Zoop, 6 Lil&amp;rsquo; Indians, Impossi-Bowl, Clownaround, and Shoot the Works.  Some of these titles reveal the type of game: &amp;ldquo;Baseball,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Bowlaround,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Impossi-Bowl,&amp;rdquo; are all pretty clear, for instance.  Other titles are Ideal&amp;rsquo;s proprietary titles for games or variations that they have devised for this unique &amp;ldquo;arena-style&amp;rdquo; playing board. It&amp;rsquo;s all explained in the instruction booklet, which illustrates how to play each game.  Gameplay is kind of a mix of Skittle Pool, Zig Zag Zoom, and Rebound or Bumper Shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a cool little marble-shooter gadget and marbles, of course.  There are other gadgets and equipment, too: tenpins for bowling games, a triangular pin-setting device, a spinner device and an abstract clown used as challenging obstacles during play, and a sidelines bat for baseball-type games.  Any number of people can play&amp;mdash;including solo (which isn&amp;rsquo;t much fun, however)&amp;mdash;but Smack-A-Roo is best suited for 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
