			<description>Think-Guess-Calculate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting game for 2-6 persons over 6 years of age - encourages quick and logical thinking - good mental arithmetic is the winning factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First of all a quiz master is chosen. He spreads the card face down on the table and spins the disk. When the disk comes to a halt he calls out the letter visible in the window of the disk. The first player picks a card and reads out the question Printed on it. All the other players must now think quickly, and the first payer to call a word answering the question which begins with the letter shown by the disk is halt way to winning that card.&lt;br/&gt;The quiz master now reads him the mental arithmetic question visible in the second window of the disk. If the player finds the right answer he has won the card. If his answer is wrong the card is returned, lace down, to the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;e. g. disk shows: M&lt;br/&gt;card question: name of town&lt;br/&gt;answer: Munich&lt;br/&gt;mental arithmetic question: 8 X 9&lt;br/&gt;answer: 72&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the quiz master doubts the correctness of the answer he can remove the red disk and read off the correct answer from the edge of the disk.&lt;br/&gt;If it turns out that tho player was right, the quiz master is 'out' and this player takes over his duties.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has most cards at the end of the game is the winner and takes over the position of quiz master in the next game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
