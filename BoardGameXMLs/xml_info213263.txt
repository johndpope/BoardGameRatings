							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Criaturas Lend√°rias: Mythical Creatures of Brazilian Folklore</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A book of monsters and supernatural beings, drawn from the legends and folktales of Brazil. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stats are provided for Malandros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 entities described within these pages. Each entry comes with an illustration and 2 or 3 story seeds. &lt;br/&gt;Because this is written for use with Malandros, which takes place in Rio de Janeiro, most of the seeds involve bringing the monsters into a city setting. Their natural habitat tends to be more rural: they're largely creatures of the forest, river and field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creatures are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Boitat&amp;aacute; - a giant, headless snake with the horns of a bull and enormous fiery eyes.&lt;br/&gt;    Boi&amp;uacute;na - an even gianter snake, a vengeful river spirit that sinks boats and controls lightning, among other things. &lt;br/&gt;    Curupira - the guardian of the forests, a goblin-like figure with backwards feet. &lt;br/&gt;    The Devil - you know, Satan. &lt;br/&gt;    Dry-Body - an evil strangling spirit that dwells inside tree trunks. &lt;br/&gt;    Encantado - an underwater spirit that kidnaps and/or falls in love with humans. &lt;br/&gt;    Boto - a kind of encantado that turns into a river dolphin and enjoys parties. &lt;br/&gt;    The Grazing Boy - the ghost of a slave boy who died horribly. &lt;br/&gt;    Headless Mule - a cursed woman who turns into a headless mule and gallops through the night. &lt;br/&gt;    Lobisomem - basically a werewolf, but there are different legends about them in Brazil. &lt;br/&gt;    Saci - a mischievous one-legged elf. &lt;br/&gt;    The Satanic Head - a terrifying predatory floating head. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
