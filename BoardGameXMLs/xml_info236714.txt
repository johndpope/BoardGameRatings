			<description>A Three-Part Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round opens with the PCs having each selected the same tavern for an early evening meal.  The introduction details a conversation between two priests who also arrive at the tavern, priests of Boccob and Ralishaz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before they have much of a clue of what is going on, the PCs are whisked off to another plane to speak in council with Istus.  She explains a very small portion of the predicament, and bestows on them the ability to weave their own fate.  This is a cryptic plot device that they will not understand in this round.  Before returning them to the prime material plane, Istus gives the party instructions, to retrieve a sword found in a dragon&amp;rsquo;s hoard to the east.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
