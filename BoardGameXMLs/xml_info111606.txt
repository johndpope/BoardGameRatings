			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mission&amp;rsquo;s plot revolves around the acquisition of a briefcase, the contents of which are unknown and ultimately irrelevant. It&amp;rsquo;s literally a McGuffin device, used to introduce the idea of The System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agents are tasked by their handler Firefox to travel to Sydney, Australia to retrieve the briefcase from the latest owner, a former B-grade Hollywood actor named Henry Davenport. Davenport had recently won a string of long shot bets, and the briefcase is suspected to somehow play a part in his good fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the players are the second UNITAS retrieval team. Alexi Pachirakov (Codename Magi) was initially tasked, but contact had been lost a few days into his mission. Now with the recent death of several contacts associated with Magi, it&amp;rsquo;s assumed that he had either been captured or gone rogue. The agents have a secondary mission of bringing Pachirakov in for debriefing, or to terminate him with extreme prejudice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To further complicate things, another team of agents is on the board. Tranquility Six, a freelance team for hire, is also on the hunt for the briefcase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
