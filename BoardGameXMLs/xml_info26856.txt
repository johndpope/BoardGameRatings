			<description>From the Three Monkey Games website:www.monkeypoker1.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, the geniuses at Three Monkey Games have turned a classic game on its ear and came up with something BRAND NEW! Introducing MonkeyWinks! The popular indoor game that is easy to learn for kids, and formidable enough to appeal to adults wanting a special challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its predecessor, MonkeyWinks is a game played with sets of small, thin discs (called winks) lying on a special felt mat. Players use a larger disc (called a squidger) to pop a smaller disc into flight by pressing down on one side of the smaller disc. The basic goal of an informal game (easily playable by young children) is to cause the smaller discs to land inside a pot or cup. The formal game has a more robust set of rules, goals, and strategies suitable to serious competition for adults and older children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MonkeyWinks is interactive fun for all players, pros and beginners alike. However, MonkeyWinks is a lot more than just a flipping disc game. For example, the included &amp;quot;Go Bananas&amp;quot;&amp;trade; cards incorporate random events and player changes inspired by everyday kids games. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.monkeypoker1.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.monkeypoker1.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
