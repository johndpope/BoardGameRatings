			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A shark vs manatee? No contest. A shark with a pool cue vs manatee with a bazooka? Interesting... A couple of billion years ago, evolution (or whatever) invented animals. A couple of million years ago our pre-human ancestors invented weapons. A couple of minutes ago we gave the former access to the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals with Weapons is a casual card game for 2-4 players. It develops the idea of the traditional trump-card game by incorporating two main decks (Animals and Weapons), along with a 'sub-deck' of Terrain cards, which are combined to make animal/weapon combos. This eliminates much of the repetition of traditional trump-card games and allows strong weapons to compensate for weak animals. A 'capture or loot' mechanic also removes the stalemate which so often develops in trump-card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;132 cards, with 60 animals in each of the main decks, makes for 3600 combinations in the base game, with multiple game modes to broaden gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be played in under half an hour, AWW is quick, brutal and very silly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
