			<description>Game featured in the Postman Pat Annual for 1994.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple game for pre-school children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses one of the two pictures. The pictures are divided in to 10 oblong segments. These are numbered from one to four. In a turn, the player rolls the die and if he rolls a 1, 2, 3, or 4, he covers one segment with that number (use a piece of card or similar to mark that the segment has been rolled). If a 5 is rolled on the die, the player must uncover one of the segments. If a 6 is rolled, the player can cover two segments of his choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to cover all 10 segments, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
