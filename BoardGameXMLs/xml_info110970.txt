							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Libyan Strike</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're a skilled, but inexperienced, agent about to end up on a mission in Libya, with some very personal reasons to hope for success....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Libyan Strike is Sniper! Adventure Gamebook #6. This title is part of a series of solo adventures published to generate interest in TSR's release of Sniper! 2nd edition after their acquisition of SPI. The player follows a series of paragraphs, each of which end with a series of choices (or die roll checks) that continue the adventure to the next paragraph. The simple combat resolution system requires only the game book, 2 dice, pencil, &amp;amp; paper. The abilities of the player are preprinted in the gamebook and include Stealth, Hand-to-Hand, Firing, &amp;amp; Bomb-Throwing. The player's starting weapons and equipment are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
