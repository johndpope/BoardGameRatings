							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Varag Ghoul-Chewer</name>
									
			<description>From Forgeworld's webstore:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Unusually tactical and thoughtful, Varag Ghoul-Chewer is almost unique &amp;ndash; an Orc Blitzer capable of making rudimentary strategic decisions! Dragged up into the big leagues and placed at the head of the Gouged Eye &amp;ndash; the most famous Orc team currently playing &amp;ndash; his sights are set on winning the Blood Bowl championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add Varag-Ghoul-Chewer to any Orc Blood Bowl team &amp;ndash; not just the Gouged Eye &amp;ndash; with this resin kit. He&amp;rsquo;s a big, mean, angry example of an Orc, clutching a Squig in his left hand and covered head to toe in the kind of chunks and spikes you&amp;rsquo;d expect from an Orc star player. His rules (his gloriously violent rules) can be found as a Star Player card in the Blood Bowl boxed game, as well as in Death Zone Season 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 10-component kit includes 2 32mm round bases, one featuring a hole to slot a ball into, indicating possession of the ball in your games of Blood Bowl.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
