			<description>A Castles &amp;amp; Crusades&amp;reg; adventure for 4-8 player characters of levels 1-3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Module background text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirteen years ago, a young man named Alastair Silverdale worked his magic. Colorful lights and unusual sounds often emanated from his prominent castle in the center of the town of Waldmitte. Although Alastair was of wealthy means, he often strolled the streets of town, frequenting the local establishments. It was in this way that he met and fell in love with Alice Walmesley, who worked in her father&amp;rsquo;s potion shop, The Blue Bottle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an appropriate time of courting, Alastair wished to ask for Alice&amp;rsquo;s hand in marriage but felt he lacked the perfect engagement gift. He left on a quest for a Star Ruby, as it is a symbol of luck and also signifies the infinite heavens from which he felt Alice must have come. He wrote Alice often, telling of his adventures and ever-increasing wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After two years, the letters stopped. Alice waited anxiously for word of her loved one for a year, but none came. Finally she gave up and accepted an offer of marriage from Erasmus Pember, the weapons shop owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before these nuptials could occur, however, Alastair returned to Waldmitte. Upon learning of his bride-to-be&amp;rsquo;s engagement, he flew into a rage, killed both Alice and Erasmus, gathered his riches, and fled from Waldmitte with the bodies. The townspeople gave up searching for the wizard long ago. Legend has it Alastair is hiding in the catacombs called &amp;ldquo;Todesheim&amp;rdquo; to the south of Waldmitte, bemoaning his loss and casting untoward spells on the bodies in an attempt to bring them back to life. Adventurous types sometimes come seeking the three, and more importantly Alastair&amp;rsquo;s missing wealth, but none have succeeded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
