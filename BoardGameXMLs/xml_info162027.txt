			<description>This is a promotional game from a line of similar ones, each named and themed for a Swedish town, and self-described as a cross between Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit. Players roll and move around the board. At specific points they have the opportunity to acquire properties that allow them to collect rent from other players, or to collect dividends on owned properties; answering trivia questions may be necessary to take these actions or increase their effectiveness. There are also event cards that may require players to answer questions to determine what happens, event spaces that require players to play a game of chance for property ownership, and more. The game may be played until one player goes bankrupt, until all players but one go bankrupt, or for a predetermined amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
