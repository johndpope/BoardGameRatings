			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space War Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your opponent blast off into space. Each player controls one Star Ship with the Joystick Controller. The object is to score points by shooting your opponent's Star Ship with missiles fired by the red button on your Joystick Controller. Aim the nose of your Star Ship in the direction you want to fire. Space War games last ten minutes or until one player scores ten points. Player's scores appear at the top of the playfield and are color coordinated with the Star Ships. The two lines to the right of your score refer to fuel and missile supply. The top line is the fuel gauge; the bottom line is the amount of missiles remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with eight missiles. Once the arsenal is depleted, the game will automatically reset each player with eight more missiles ONLY when both players are out of missiles. In most War games, fuel cannot be resupplied. In games 6 and 7, players can refuel and resupply missiles by docking with the Starbase. Fuel is used by adding &amp;quot;thrust&amp;quot; to your Star Ship or by putting your Ship into Hyperspace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Shuttle Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have mastered the exercises, you are ready to try Space Shuttle. Connect your Star Ship with the Space Module to score. Recommended strategy is to first match your Star Ship's speed to the Space Module's speed. Then slowly maneuver your Star Ship towards the Space Module. During Shuttle games the Star Ships have an unlimited supply of fuel. In one-player games, you control one Star Ship with the left Joystick Controller and compete against the clock. You have ten minutes to score a maximum ten points. During two-player games each player maneuvers his Star Ship to score. In two-player games with two Space Modules, the target Space Module will be the same color as your Star Ship. First player to score ten points or the most points in ten minutes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
