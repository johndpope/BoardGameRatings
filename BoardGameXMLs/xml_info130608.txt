			<description>Puzzle Playing Cards&amp;reg; brings puzzle building and card games together. With a variety of different learning styles, you and others work competitively to collect and complete 13 animal puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will collect 4 cards and build hands of each Animal Puzzle. With 13 Puzzles in the game, each puzzle is broken into 4 corner pieces. Each card will have Animal facts, unique colors, and partial images to help guide you to completing your puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game players will pick up a random card from the deck or previously discarded face up card. At the end of a turn you will always discard down to 4 cards at the end of a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will all aim to collect all four parts to a puzzle. The first player to do so announces this and all players will collect points, depending on the completion of their targeted puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed with many different learning styles in mind and it is encouraged that younger players read their completed puzzle facts out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
