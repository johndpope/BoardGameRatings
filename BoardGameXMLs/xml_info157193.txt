							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fireball Forward: Britain&#039;s Lost Opportunity â€“ Villers Bocage</name>
									
			<description>Villers-Bocage, Britain's Lost Opportunity is a book of tactical scenarios for the Fireball Forward! game system. It is centered around the British attack on the town of Villers-Bocage and the larger Operation Perch against German positions west of Caen, in Normandy, on 12-14 June 1944. It features engagements between the British 7th Armoured Division-the famed 'Desert Rats' - and the 50th Infantry Division against the elite German Panzer Lehr Division, the 2nd Panzer Division, and the 101 st 55 Heavy Panzer Battalion. 15 Scenarios cover the desperate struggle for the town of Villers-Bocage, 50th Infantry Division's attempt to drive Panzer Lehr out of its positions west of Caen, and panzer ace Michael Wittmann's daring, single-handed counterattack against a column of British armor that changed the course of the battle. A Campaign Game, an Historical Summary, Orders of Battle, and Designer's Notes are included to help put the scenarios in the larger context of operations in Normandy and allow players to design their own scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
