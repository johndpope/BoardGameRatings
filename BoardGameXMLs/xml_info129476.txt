			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 60 cards numbered &amp;ndash;3 to +5; all are dealt to the players. Each round, players choose 1&amp;ndash;3 cards to put forward face down. They're revealed simultaneously, and the player who have played highest gets the trick. However, the trick is worth the total of all cards, and since there are certain cards that multiply or reverse the value (turn + into -), it's a matter of reading your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
