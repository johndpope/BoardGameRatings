			<description>Players each start with one circular jig-saw piece that says Toys, Cloths, Flowers, Fruits, Animals or Shapes. This decides what kind of pieces each player is trying to collect. To each circular piece belongs six segment pieces, each with a picture, e.g. a pig or a horse (Animals), or a doll or a ball (Toys). These 36 segment pieces are laid out face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game proceeds much like a common Memory game, except that players are not collecting pairs but pieces that belong to their category. Players take turns picking up a face-down piece. If the piece belongs to that player&amp;acute;s circular piece, he/she puts it there. The segment pieces fit the circular pieces like a jig-saw puzzle, and when all six pieces have been added the player has a full circle of Toys or Animals etc. Hence the name of the game, The Cake Game, because the pieces fit like pieces of cake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect all six pieces is, of course, the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each category has its own background color, so players don&amp;acute;t have to be able to read the name of the category on the circular piece. With two players, you can play with two or three categories each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;6 wooden circular pieces&lt;br/&gt;36 wooden segment pieces with color drawings&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 years and up, language independent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
