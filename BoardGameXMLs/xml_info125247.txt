							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Show Jumping Course</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up on the sandy ground of this sports arena, measuring roughly 210 by 150 feet,  has been the course for a rather challenging show jumping competition. No less than sixteen obstacles have been arranged, ascending oxers and triple bar oxers,  some even into double and triple jumps in quick succession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The top bars of the individual obstacles are set to a challenging height of five feet. The individual red and white striped bars rest on very narrow brackets making them prone to fall even at the slightest touch. Each obstacle is marked with a small red flag that has to be at the right hand side of the rider if he approaches is correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start and finishing lines are marked with chalk into the sand of the ground. And on his way from to the other horse and rider have to master each obstacle exactly once, jumping it from the right direction to avoid disqualification. The track is surrounded by a simple iron fence, hung with advertising signs, separating it from the audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
