			<description>A horse racing game in which players take on the joint roles of gamblers, bookmakers and horse owners.  Talk about conflict of interest!  Racing is accomplished by moving horses around a mapboard racetrack.  As each player has incentives to win or lose, or help another player to win or lose, tactics can get quite involved.  All very thought provoking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
