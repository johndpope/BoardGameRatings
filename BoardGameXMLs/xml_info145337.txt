							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inns of Harn: Drunken Hake</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although rustic by the standards of more &amp;quot;civilized&amp;quot; parts of H&amp;acirc;rn, the Drunken Hake is considered the best inn in Arathel, Orbaal. Its clientele includes mostly Jarin locals and some Ivinians from surrounding settlements. Every fall, Arathel's annual justice-moot brings commoners, criminals, lawspeakers, supplicants, and vendors to town and the Drunken Hake becomes a hive of raucous activity. Details are provided about the inn's accommodations and services, as well as its menu, staff, and regular clientele. Detailed floor plans are provided as well as several adventure hooks and a description of the activities of the justice-moot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
