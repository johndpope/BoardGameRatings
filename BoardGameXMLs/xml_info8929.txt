			<description>A number of cards showing faces are displayed face up. Players must try to remember the various features of each face. After one minute, the cards are shuffled and all but one are turned face up. Players then draw the missing person as they remember him. All the drawings are revealed and everybody votes for the one that most closely matches the original. Drawings are then scored according to six features: face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, hair and the extras. Players score points for their drawings and for voting correctly. An helper sheet helps players remember and draw the various features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
