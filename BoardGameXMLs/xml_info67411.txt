							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Level II</name>
									
			<description>Level II is a fast paced skirmish miniatures game, set in the future.&lt;br/&gt;In the year 2222 mankind manages to devastate their home planet.&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear fusion as well as manipulation of genes have become daily buisiness in this harsh world ruled by corporate groups.&lt;br/&gt;Journeys to Mars have become possible and science is about to find a way to travel to the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of Level II's biggest strengths is, that it consists of a ruleset only. No miniatures come with this game!&lt;br/&gt;This way a player may pick any of his miniatures and calculate their point costs referring to the extremely well elaborated and very fine tuned equipment list.&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for about everything that has ever set it's metal or plastic foot on a futuristic war-torn gametable:&lt;br/&gt;Humans, aliens, different kinds of humanoids, tough races, weak races, robots, androids, crafts, cannons, artillery, sabotage, special ammunition, cybernetics - everything you could wish for.&lt;br/&gt;Even the equipment table basically covers everything &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot; - maybe you'll have to substitute sometimes some weapons (like a boltpistol with a common pistol), but you will be able to work with everything that you might find in the hands or at the belt of your miniature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook covers the basic rules as well as experts' rules and campaign rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though Level II is designed for small scale skirmishes with only a couple of individual fighters per side, the rules don't prevent you from playing large scale combats as well. &lt;br/&gt;In that case however players should have only a few different troop types, to keep combat simple.&lt;br/&gt;For example on the one hand you could get about 50 - 100 light weighted fighters for 1000 points, but if you really spice them up, you may field less than 10 tough guys for the same value, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level II uses an unique command system:&lt;br/&gt;The army of a player is divided into several groups (one at least!) consisting of a number of fighters depending on the faction they are fighting for.&lt;br/&gt;Each group gets one command (e.g. &amp;quot;advance&amp;quot;), represented by a chit placed at that group's position. Depending on that command, each fighter of that group may take up to two different actions (mostly moving + something different, like e.g. taking aim).&lt;br/&gt;In order to change that command, certain conditions have to be met (roll versus a certain value with modifiers according to circumstances like e.g. groupleader killed or minimum distance not met) - if the roll fails the command is either changed later or even not at all.&lt;br/&gt;Specialits may act according to their specialities whenever the player sees fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level II plays very realistically: Most weapons kill an unarmoured human with one hit - just as in real life. This way you will have to be very careful with about everything: &lt;br/&gt;How are you going to spend your points?&lt;br/&gt;Where and (even mor important:) how are you going to move your fighters?&lt;br/&gt;This way, Level II is a very tactical skirmish game where the skill and the experience of a player garantee a victory instead of lucky dierolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
