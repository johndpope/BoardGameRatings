							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Futures VII: Tsar Wars</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Based on two major novels by George Griffith (FF II), The Angel of the Revolution and Olga Romanoff.&lt;br/&gt;In The Angel of the Revolution, written in 1893 and set in 1904, the Terror, a socialist and anarchist alliance, uses its flying ships and the opportunities presented by a war between Russia and Britain and her allies to conquer most of the world and bring about a socialist utopia. In Olga Romanoff, written in 1893-4 and set in 2030-37, the last inheritor of the Tsar takes her devastating revenge. Both are lavishly illustrated by Fred T. Jane of Jane's Fighting Ships fame.&lt;br/&gt;Role playing material includes a long worldbook describing the history of the Revolution and its aftermath, the revolutionary base in the African &amp;quot;lost world&amp;quot; of Aeria, the final war and the end of the world. It includes rules for air-ship, war-balloon, and submarine construction and combat, the mysterious Vril force, contact with the higher intelligences of Mars (plus a section describing a campaign fusing elements of FF II and FF VII), and much more. The worldbook also includes war-gaming material by Matthew Hartley (author of many war-games including Aeronef, which was partly inspired by George Griffith's novels)&lt;br/&gt;There are three long adventures and five adventure outlines. By courtesy of Steve Jackson Games there are also four printable sheets of &amp;quot;Cardboard Hero&amp;quot; style figures for the main characters of the novel and soldiers of the Terror and the Tsar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
