			<description>20th Century @ War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20th Century @ War has 3 different technology levels and additional technological advances within each level. It recreates 4 different governmental types for historical accuracy, and also has a fast paced 'conquest mode' where the world is neutral and the players carve out their own empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War I&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1914 and Europe is about to destroy itself. The Germans/Austro-Hungarians along with the failing Ottoman Empire duke it out with the British/Franco alliance on one front and the Russian Empire on the other. Will the Americans enter the war and save the French? You decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War II&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1941 and Hitler controls most of Europe, only England fights on. Japan, forced by crippling sanctions from the U.S. prepares a surprise attack against its rival in the Pacific. Will the Soviet Union fall to the Wehrmacht or hold Moscow from the Nazi hoard? Will the U.S. intervene in Europe and save England? You decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War III&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1984 and the world is on the brink of Nuclear War. The Soviet Union is beginning to crumble from within. The Politburo realize that it&amp;rsquo;s now or never in their bid to destroy the decadent capitalists of the west. Will the U.S. survive the nuclear exchange, will its vaunted &amp;lsquo;star wars&amp;rsquo; defense system protect them from the Soviet missiles? Or will the Red Army roll straight through Europe to the English Channel and beyond? You decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1999 and the great plagues have left the &amp;lsquo;New World Order&amp;rsquo; in tatters, only the East Coast and Beijing offer a beacon of light within the horror. Around the world governments fall, armies dissolve, chaos reigns. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you regain control and forge a new era for your people. Will the East Coast reunite North America under a single flag or take control of Europe with an iron first? Will Beijing return to a great Monarchy and remake the Inner Kingdom or will the Communists take their revenge on a weak and paralyzed Japan? You decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A massive 3' x 7' table top game which recreates World War I, II &amp;amp; III. 2000 pieces, 2 to 5 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
