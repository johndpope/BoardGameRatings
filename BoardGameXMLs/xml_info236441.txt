			<description>Discover the wildlife of the North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;Create food chains from living beings.&lt;br/&gt;Experience the man-made environmental destructions. &lt;br/&gt;Protect the environment through ECO innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-operative and competitive game modes from age 8, for 2 to 8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Family game mode:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw and put 5 cards to the center of the table face up. &lt;br/&gt;     Each player plays 2 cards simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;     Resolve:&lt;br/&gt;         Eco cards neutralize the related threat cards. &lt;br/&gt;         Remaining threat cards kill the related living being cards.&lt;br/&gt;         Check if each living being has at least one nutriment. Then discard all starving beings.&lt;br/&gt;         Players get their own played Eco cards with the neutralized threat cards and the survivor being cards as VP.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Each player draws 2 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the deck runs out the player with the most VPs (collected cards) wins. In case of co-operative game the players lost if the number of the discarded cards exceeds a specified number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategic game mode:&lt;br/&gt;The players take actions to collect beings and eco cards from a 3x5 matrix. Eco cards could be played as a specific action and neutralizing threat cards for bonus VPs. During this game the players build food chains (the longer worth more VPs)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
