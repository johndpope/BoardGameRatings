			<description>Gear Burn is an cool Roll &amp;amp; Move Racing game.  Yes, I'm serious; don't run away screaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear Burn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Offers interesting decisions on every turn.&lt;br/&gt;2. Maintains the fast speed of a dice &amp;amp; racing game.&lt;br/&gt;3. Has realistic consequences for high speeds.&lt;br/&gt;4. Is super easy to learn and play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic player turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(First you need to take a close look at the map to see how the spaces are laid out.  Then the following will make more sense.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Shift up or down 1 gear.&lt;br/&gt;2. Roll a number of six-sided dice equal to your gear.&lt;br/&gt;3. The highest number showing on a single die is your speed rating.  You MUST move forward a number of spaces equal to your speed rating.&lt;br/&gt;4. The lowest number showing on a single die is your maneuver rating.  You MAY move side to side a number of spaces equal to your maneuver rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher gear you are in, the more ground you will cover, but the less turning you will be able to do.  You will need to downshift going into the corners or you will hit the wall.  If you can't use all of your speed without hitting an obstacle, then you have to stop and skip your next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The living rules currently reside here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://docs.google.com/View?id=dhdx9f7c_50g5dpgm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://docs.google.com/View?id=dhdx9f7c_50g5dpgm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A nice PDF of the board is here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/47345&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/47345&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
