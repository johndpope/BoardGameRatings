			<description>Innovative and exciting, Eyewitness Newsreel Challenge is an ideal new way to use your VCR.  It combines the enjoyment of VCR viewing with the competitveness of a game.  And it's great fun to play with any size group!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As and &amp;quot; eyewitness, &amp;quot; You'll watch newsreel clips from yesteryear - clips that are always interesting and often hilarious.  Take good reporter's notes, because when each one - minute clip is over, you and your teammates must create questions about what you've just seen and heard:  &amp;quot; What number did you see on Babe Ruth's football jersey?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot; Did you catch the name of the canary who bicycled though Central Park?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stump the opposing team, or answser their questions correctly, and your team moves ahead on the scoreboard. There are over 100 vintage clips in 15 different categories - from Hollywood to History - from Daredevils to Disasters - from Inventions to Industry.  And each of the clips can be played again and again, because the Players make up the questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, Dim the lights.  Take a step back in time.  And ivite family and friends to see who's got the scoop when you play Eyewitness Newsreel Challenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
