			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This jigsaw activity is designed for students to become familiar with several datasets of Arctic weather data, collected in Eureka on Ellesmere Island. Students join a role-playing activity to read and interpret graphs while considering the optimal time to plan a research mission to the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity includes several components, one of which is a concise role-playing activity in which students are assigned to one of four research teams.  Each team has a different set of priorities, constraints, and goals.  Students role-play team members as they analyze data and make final determinations on whether or not the team should perform research in the arctic.  The teams then present their findings at a joint seminar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
