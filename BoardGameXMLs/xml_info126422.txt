			<description>N2O: Nitrous Oxide (or N2O) is a tunnel shooter (similar to the 1980 hit Tempest) notably featuring a soundtrack composed by the popular American electronic music duo, The Crystal Method. The soundtrack was heavily used to promote the game, and the audio tracks from the game are in Red Book audio format so that the game CD can be played on a non-console Compact Disc player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N2O: Nitrous Oxide takes the form of a tube shooter in which the player shoots insects while collecting &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; coins, mushroom shields, and other psychedelically-themed weapon power-ups. As more and more insects are shot the game increases speed. N2O: Nitrous Oxide has been noted for its aesthetics and for having smoothly seamless but fast-paced gameplay. It has been suggested that the game is similar in presentation to a Crystal Method concert and that the game is best played at high volume and in total darkness to maximize the &amp;quot;intense and dynamic&amp;quot; effects of data flashers and strobes. The superior audio capacities of televisions (especially those attached to home theater systems) over typical computer systems has been suggested as one of the advantages to restricting the game to the console market and not releasing it as a PC game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;N2O: Nitrous Oxide&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
