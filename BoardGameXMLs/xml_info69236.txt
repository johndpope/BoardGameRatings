							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Golf Game</name>
									
			<description>A lavishly produced game which tries to be a straight simulation of playing all 18 holes on the course at St Andrews, the home of Golf. The game has 9 huge colour printed, double-sided boards, laying out an accurate depiction of the course. Players shots are randomise by using a spinner and cards for direction and distance. There are a series of long clear plastic rules which are your clubs. You choose which one to use as you progress. These mark the point where your ball finally lands, based upon the randomisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are in English, French, German, Italian and Dutch. There is no designer given, nor actual year of production, but the score-pads included refer to St Andrews as the home of the 1978 Open, suggesting it was produced around then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
