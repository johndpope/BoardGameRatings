			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet Guide line is a great resource for Players to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; more of their adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It inspires DMs providing them with set of beautifully drawn handouts of one location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet Guide: Valar_7 consists of sized map, illustrations, handouts which can be easily printed or presented to players during a session, in order to enrich the planet's description and create a more precise presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that Planet Guide is stat free and generic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It provides a frame for GM to build his own adventures based on visual aids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Valar_7?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valar_7 is a small industrial world with two lifeless moons. Two hundred years ago most life on the planet was destroyed by environmental cataclysm. This period is now widely known as The Great Crisis (TGC). During TGC most of colonists fled but few of them decided to stay. Those who stayed constructed underground vaults and shelters and waited for better times. Times that never came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to TGC planet has changed. It transformed into barren wasteland, polluted with radiation, acid rains and infected with virus outbreaks. For many years Valar_7 was lost to civilisation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now a new process of colonisation has begun. On Valar_7 scientists have discovered deposits of precious ore and rare minerals. Corporations sent miners and workers on planet&amp;rsquo;s surface. New settlements arise... And long forgotten secrets of first colonists are waiting to be revealed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
