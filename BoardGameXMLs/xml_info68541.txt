			<description>&amp;quot;Patapon is a video game published for the PlayStation Portable handheld game console combining gameplay features of rhythm games, real-time tactics and God games. The game is presented in a cartoonish, silhouetted two-dimensional  environment designed by Rolito, and features the player acting as a deity who commands an army of caricatured miniature tribal creatures by beating traditional talking drums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is put in indirect control of a tribe of Patapon warriors; to command the warriors, the player inputs specific sequences using the face buttons on the PSP, each representing a &amp;quot;talking drum&amp;quot;, in time to a drum rhythm. These sequences order the tribe to move forward on the linear battlefield, attack, defend, and other actions. If the player inputs an unknown sequence or enters them off the main rhythm, the tribe will become confused and stop whatever they are doing. However, repeatedly entering a proper sequence in sync with the rhythm will lead the tribe into a &amp;quot;fever&amp;quot; increasing their attack and defensive bonuses. The tribe will stop doing anything after performing the last entered command if the player does not enter any more commands. Some commands are square, square, square, circle (Pata, Pata, Pata, Pon.) and circle, circle, square, circle. (Pon, Pon, Pata, Pon.)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Patapon,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
