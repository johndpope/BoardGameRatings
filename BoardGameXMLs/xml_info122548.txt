			<description>Quick-play introduction to the classic game Monopoly. Be the player with the most money at the end of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all about raking in the rent by putting your tokens on as many properties as you can. But beware, any property you own can be snatched by the next player who lands there. On your turn roll, move your token, and then pay rent, buy, build or auction. When you land on any colored property space, you can build on it &amp;ndash; even if someone else owns it. The building tokens have a number on them and they can only be played if they are the next highest token. Look out for the special die that helps build or demolish properties. Properties and utilities cannot be mortgaged in Monopoly Express. If you run out of money, the game is over. The player with the most money wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard, 32 colored property tokens (8 per player), 8 Chance cards, 8 Community Chest cards, 2 Utility cards, 4 movers, a money pack, and a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
