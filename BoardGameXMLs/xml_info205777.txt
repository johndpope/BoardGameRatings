							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Generic Non-Player Characters: An Assortment of Wizards, Warlocks, and Their Followers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARE THEY FRIENDS OR FOES?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters are the stars of the adventure, but they are measured by the foes they fight... and they move through a world populated by others who would help or hinder them in their quests. DMs can find both of those in this book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generic Non-Player Characters: An Assortment of Wizards, Warlocks, and Their Followers is a collection of NPC stats, presented in the format used in the Monster Manual of the world's most popular roleplaying game for immediate use. You bring the adventure, and we provide the stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, this product includes several new spells with which to bedevil the PCs... and which they can add to their rewards when they stand victorious at the end of the battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
