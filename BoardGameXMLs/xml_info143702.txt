							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AT-43 Unit Box: Assault Medusa</name>
									
			<description>The assault medusas are autonomous combat systems based on a modified type 1 frame. They are meant to favor endurance and design. Slower than the golems, the assault medusas are ancient attack systems that were designed in the habitat of Thera. Engineered in the traditional way, associating ergonomics and resistance, their carefully programmed ranged combat procedures make them great support units. Due to their movement mode, they are most reliable when used as shooting platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard equipment of the assault medusas, as .troops/range, is either sonic weaponry (sonic gun), or nanomunition weaponry (nucleus rifle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to its exceptional toughness, the assault medusas can endure a lot of light weapon fire without suffering any losses and return fire with lethal accuracy. A great classic of Therian attack systems, the assault medusa will never go out of fashion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 2 assault medusas. Armament: nucleus rifle &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 assault medusa. Armament: nucleus gun &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 assault medusa leader. Armament: nucleus rifle. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 3 cards: Assault medusa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
