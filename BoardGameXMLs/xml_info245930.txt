			<description>Players split into two teams. Each round a player puts his device into his mouth and flips the sand timer. He draws a card and tries to say the word written on it as many times as he has to in order his team finds the word! When he is out of time he gathers the cards found by his team. The team with the most cards wins at the end of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
