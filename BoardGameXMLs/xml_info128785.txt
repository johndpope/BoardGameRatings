			<description>This is a traditional game in Fukui-prefecuture, Japan using the variant of Hanafuda cards called &amp;quot;Komatsu-Fuda（小松札）&amp;quot;. Each player tries to get rid of his/her hand of 6 cards. You can play as many card as you want in your turn provided they make the sequence continuing from the previous number. There are some other ways to play 2-3 cards of the same number at once. If you manage to play all 6 cards in one turn then you get double the game point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game only works with 7 players. If there are 8, then one person with a particular card sit out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
