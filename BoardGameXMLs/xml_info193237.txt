			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HeroForge-Anew is a character builder spreadsheet for D&amp;amp;D 3.5. It makes the process of character generation far simpler, allowing you to create in minutes what would once have taken hours, and in hours what would once have taken days! Powerful and well designed, it can handle the majority of 3.5 content, and more content is being added. Try it, and never look back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HeroForge-Anew is a version-controlled, public source workbook based on the previously-available HeroForge.  Although there is a single principle developer, public input and assistance are welcomed.  The initial version of HeroForge-Anew was 7.0.0.0; the numbering convention was rationalized (Major, Source, Minor, Bugfix) with 7.4.0.0; the rpg items noted here are the final versions prior to additional Source material being added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
