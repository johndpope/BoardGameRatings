							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Calculi und Trampoli</name>
									
			<description>Trampoli consists of a  game board and sixteen playing pieces in two colors.&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are set up in the last row and aim to reach the opposite end of the game board. A piece can either move one field in any direction, or make a jump. A jump requires another piece (own or opponent's) to be exactly the number of fields away that the number on the jumping piece (they are numbered 2 to 6) states. The jump goes onto that piece and then, like in a trampoline jump, continues for the same distance yet again (in a straight line in any direction). The first player to get all his/her pieces into the last two rows on the opponent's side is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
