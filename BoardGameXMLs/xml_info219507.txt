							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Realms: Rescue Run Promo Card</name>
									
			<description>Since being court-martialed by the Star Empire, smuggler and thief Joan Shengtu has done what she needed to do in order to survive&amp;mdash;gaining a reputation along the way. When a new client&amp;rsquo;s mission goes sideways, Joan finds herself caught in the middle of dueling gambits between the Star Empire and the Trade Federation. Recruited to perform the heist of a lifetime, the fate of the Star Empire rests in her hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescue Run is an Event card for the award-winning Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and it is based on the first Star Realms novel, Star Realms: Rescue Run.  Events are shuffled into the Trade Deck, and resolve when they are revealed.  Rescue Run has a powerful effect that gets even stronger as the game progresses and players improve their decks.  Tension builds as the action unfolds, just like in the novel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
