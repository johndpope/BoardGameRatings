							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lowlander</name>
									
			<description>Lowlander is a card-driven solitaire game of fantasy exploration so compact, you can almost take it with you anywhere. Starting from your hut in the wild, your branch out to new frontiers as winter comes along and you need to gather resources in order to survive. But beware, in the vast forests of the realm dark and vicious creatures hide in the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select from various scenarios ranging from simple hunts in the wilderlands to defending your home from the forces of the necromancer Yrmgor. No session will be like the other, as the modular gaming board is randomised before each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lowlander you can take a job in the village, go mining in the mountains, engage in skirmishes with the local fauna or simply collect wood for the winter. As rounds progress, you will move the game's clock, altering it from day to night time, which will impact your encounters in the wild, for it is safer to travel by day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lowlander is intended as a budget-game with a rich gaming experience for the true board game enthusiast who needs a solitaire fix and will be released by Q3 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
