			<description>French cycling themed game that was published for ProTour team Caisse d'&amp;eacute;pargne. In this game that is played on the beach the players first draw a track in the sand. Then they use a sort of marble that is flicked in a similar way as the famous Carabande game. The marble determines the positing of the cyclists (pawns). He who reaches the finish first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
