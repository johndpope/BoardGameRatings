			<description>From the game publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Trivial Quest is &amp;quot;the IMPORTANT Game of Life&amp;quot; because it is an educational game that allows us to learn and discuss all the things that will help us to lead successful, happy, and healthy lives. The goal of the game is to make it interesting and fun to think, to remember, and to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by each player selecting one of the 6 categories of trivia questions based on the dice results of 2 six-sided dice. If the player provides the correct answer, their pawn pieces moves towards the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few variations of the game allow for more complex scoring to either increase or decrease the game speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
