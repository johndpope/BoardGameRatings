			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most magic items are portable and designed with Player Characters in mind. This means that the choice for rich NPCs with no adventuring background can be quite limited. Collected together in this ebook are magic items based around the concept of furniture, ranging from beds and chests, to tables and rugs. These items are suitable for fleshing out the insides of temples, the homes of nobles and royalty, and the residences of the well off, including PCs who have constructed (or claimed) their own base of operations. Covering a wide range of concepts, from time saving and defence, to scrying, interrogation, and business, these furnishings add realism and depth to any game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ebook contains 41 new items of magical furniture for all levels of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wondrous Creations 5: Furnishings is a magic item sourcebook compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and suitable for GMs and players of any level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
