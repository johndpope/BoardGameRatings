							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arena Football</name>
									
			<description>Arena Football is a PlayStation 2 and Xbox video game developed by Electronic Arts (under their EA Sports brand). It was released on February 7, 2006. The cover features quarterback John Dutton, from ArenaBowl XIXs champion team, the Colorado Crush. The game is similar to EA's other simulation football games (NCAA Football and Madden NFL Football), but adopts a style of play that is similar to the faster and more frantic paced Arena game. The game includes all the rules, rosters, and teams for the AFL season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the teams that are competing in the 2006 season are included. The New Orleans VooDoo have been excluded because they have temporarily halted operations due to Hurricane Katrina. However, their logo is available for use in the game's create-a-team feature. The VooDoo resumed operations in 2007. The Kansas City Brigade franchise and its colors have been included, but the official name and logo didn't make it in because they were unveiled after the game had gone into production so the team was known as the Kansas City KC in the video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arena Football (2006 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
