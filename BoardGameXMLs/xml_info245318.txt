			<description>The 1980s saw a decline in general merchandise traffic on British Rail. This meant numerous open and closed wagons became surplus to requirements. In 1992, around 400 VDA vans were scheduled for conversion into open ballast wagons, these being delivered to Network Southeast and the West Coast Mainline. After privatisation, the wagons continued in service with new owners English Welsh &amp;amp; Scottish railway, who repainted many of them in the familiar EWS livery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ZCA Sea Urchins Wagon Pack includes 40 different versions, with two different under frame types in clean and weathered schemes and a choice of loads including grey ballast, pink ballast, pea gravel, sand and empty (with load remnants).This pack also includes the Retro-Reflective TSR Signs (Post Mounted) asset pack as a free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
