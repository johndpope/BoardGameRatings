			<description>There is a variety of options (which are all in Japanese). There is a side view perspective of the action similar to arcade soccer games. Even the players' surnames are in Japanese. This game is a prequel to J.League Soccer Prime Goal 2 and J.League Soccer Prime Goal 3. Each half can be set up for a duration of up to five minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a &amp;quot;lifting game&amp;quot; included in the options mode that allows players to balance a soccer ball on his virtual body for points like in an arcade game. The names of the moves are in Japanese; making it unlikely for Westerners to comprehend their moves. The highest score ever achieved in this mode was 59780 points and it was captured on YouTube on September 6, 2007. Typing in &amp;quot;J.League Soccer Prime Goal&amp;quot; on Google will make the video appear on the search engine. Easy moves are worth ten points each while the most difficult moves are 200 points each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;J.League Soccer Prime Goal&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
