							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Speedy Gonzales</name>
									
			<description>Speedy Gonzales is an original race game, where chance has a rather large part, but also tactics are important. The game is played in two phases. In the first phase, the players set their water-gourds - small tokens - along the route. In the second phase, the race itself, each player on his or her turn is confronted with a difficult choice -- either drink one or more water-gourds, and then roll a die for as many gourds drunk (with distribution - 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4) and advance the number indicated, or advance one space without using a water-gourd. Players can collect water-gourds by landing on spaces with them, but cannot carry more than three at the same time. For those not far-sighted enough to plan for the future, some wells are available along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
