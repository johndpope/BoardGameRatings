			<description>Let's Save Our Earth is an educational non-competitive board game which has been created to teach children and adults alike, simple things they can do to make a difference in helping the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's Save Our Earth has a clever game scheme and a cast of characters known as the Eco-Angels and the Schmutzies. Players select their favorite tokens and spin to proceed. The object of the game is to move from start to finish, collecting trees along the way. Trees are awarded for answering questions correctly and when landing on certain spaces that result in drawing from a stack of cards. However, landing on Schmutzie spaces or answering incorrectly can result in a loss of turn or having to go back spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eco-Angels are earth-friendly and help educate the players with the wisdom found on certain cards. The Schmutzies, on the other hand, do not abide by such rules and have left their stains on the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
