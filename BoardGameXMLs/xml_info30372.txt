			<description>This is a religious-themed trivia game for members of the Latter Day Saints (Mormon) church.  The trivia questions are religious in nature and are asked and answered in a mechanism simulating a simple baseball game. The key to the game is the question and answer booklet, which includes two pages of rules and 53 pages of questions. Each page has six numbered questions and answers. There is a cardboard field inset in the box and plastic pegs to use as runners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each &amp;quot;at bat&amp;quot;, the batting player rolls a D6. For the first batter, the &amp;quot;pitcher&amp;quot; on the opposing team reads that numbered question from page 1. If the player answers correctly, he receives the result designated for that question. If he answers incorrectly, he is out. Pegs are placed on the field and advanced accordingly. One roll on each page provides a result without a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each succeeding batter, the question moves to the next page of the booklet, allowing a long game before any possibility of a repeated question arises. As per normal baseball rules, three outs ends an inning and the team with most runs scored after nine innings wins. The game seems to expect high scores: there are holes in the scoreboxes for 24 runs by each team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the questions are very basic: &amp;quot;Who was the real father of Jesus?&amp;quot; (God). Others require more detailed knowledge of the Mormon church: &amp;quot;Name the brother of Joseph Smith whose name begins with the letter H who was one of the Eight Witnesses&amp;quot; (Hyrum), or &amp;quot;Which of the following is not an office in the Melchizedek Priesthood: Elder, Seventy, Teacher, or High Priest?&amp;quot; (Teacher).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
