			<description>&amp;quot;Much like the Incan Gold game (Diamant), it's a game of pushing your luck and knowing when to betray the other players to get away with as much gold as possible. Every turn a player decides whether to play a card to continue journeying into the caves, or to retreat with their current gains. The chances of dying and not making any money increases as players move further into the caves.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The difference between this game and the original is that it uses normal playing cards, and there are more choices for the players involved.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are available on the author's website here-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.curufea.com/Wikka/wikka.php?wakka=MayanGold&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.curufea.com/Wikka/wikka.php?wakka=MayanGold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
