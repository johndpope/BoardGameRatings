			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get Good at Being Bad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are a GM looking for some options for a campaign's Big Bad Evil Guy, a player in an evil-themed adventure (or a whole set of adventures), or the lone evil PC in a group that likes to live dangerously, this book is ready to give you ways for your character to be evil AND fun. Because no one knows evil like the Four Horsemen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a brief discussion of evil in its many flavors, they get right into evil options. Evil traits allow your character to have walked the dark path of a betrayal-steeped confidence artist, violent road of a leg-breaker, or have been the immoral problem fixer as a cleaner. New feats let you spread humiliating rumors, use blood sacrifice in place of costly spell components, or just devote yourself to one of the Heralds of the Apocalypse. Archetypes for evil themes allow characters to begin the path to lichdom, make music from tortured screams for the delight of dark patrons, become a daemon knight, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seals are broken, and the last horns have sounded. Come see, the Heralds of the Apocalypse are here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
