			<description>From the University Games web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to help parents and children learn more about each other's interests, Kids Battle the Grown-Ups is a trivia game that offers a level playing field for both sides. And now the popular board game has been made into a card game packaged in a sturdy tin. It's the perfect game to take along on family vacations! Grown-Ups are asked questions most kids can answer, and kids are asked questions that most Grown-Ups can answer. Grown-Ups, is J.K. Rowling a man or a woman? Kids, if you take your coffee black, what do you add to it? (The answers - a woman, and nothing.) Answer all 3 questions on your card correctly, and you win the card. The first team to win 2 cards, wins the game. It's time to find out who really knows more... the kids or the grown-ups? Game comes with game cards and instructions. For 2 or More Players, Ages 8 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
