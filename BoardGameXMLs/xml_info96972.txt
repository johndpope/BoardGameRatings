			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duel it out with five new speed machines for Test Drive II!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Supercars. Five elite automobiles from around the world that speak one common language--performance. Now, with The Duel: Test Drive II, you can race them in head-to-head competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'88 Lotus Turbo Esprit--If you're expecting typical British reserve, guess again. This Esprit is as sensuous and aggressive as any exotic to come out of Italy. And any car capable of pegging its 160 mph speedometer is certainly worthy of Supercar status. The Lotus handling is world famous. The 2.2-liter turbocharged engine, irresistible. Keep a stiff upper lip and let Esprit's 228 horses stampede.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ferrari Testarossa--A legend in its own time. The elite of Grand Touring cars. This Ferrari hits 185 mph with twelve cylinders singing in perfect harmony. 0-60 mph strikes in 5.3 seconds and the quarter mile blurs by at 13.3--well over 100 mph. But speed isn't the only thing to snap necks. Take one look at its styling, its wrap around leather interior--and you'll know exactly what you'd do with $134,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Porsche 911 RUF--Introducing Louis Ruf's gift to the automotive world--a custom built, twin-turbo Porsche 911. Top speed: 211 mph. 0-60 mph: 4.0 seconds. Blindingly quick. Acceleration that sucks you into the seat. Supreme ruler of the German Autobahn, this 469 bhp bullet is perfectly street legal. But don't let that fool you. The space program would provide better preparation for this experience than driving school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'88 Lamborghini Countach 5000S--Stunning. No other word best describes the Lamborghini's look--or performance. How can a car so outrageous be so darn fast? Take a look under the hood. The Countach sports a powerful V-12 with four valves per cylinder. Before you can say &amp;quot;Giotto Bizzarrini&amp;quot; you're at 179 mph. And nothing can match its stability at top speed. Go out on the open road. Count how many times &amp;quot;WOW&amp;quot; leaves your mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'89 Corvette ZR1--Tough to keep a 185 mph Corvette under wraps but the ZR1 stands as one of Detroit's best kept secrets. Designed with one goal: &amp;quot;create the world's fastest production car.&amp;quot; It's engine, code named LT5, is a legend before its time. An all-aluminum, four cam, 32 valve V-8 so strong that Chevrolet engineers has to completely redo the rear end to accommodate more rubber. Is there anything similar to the ZR1? Check out the Indy 500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
