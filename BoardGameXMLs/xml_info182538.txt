			<description>Get into this crazy race where you try to save eggs from the frying pan and take them back to the safety of their nest. Two players, at the same time, will try to move the eggs without breaking them. Use the Chicken Magnets to carefully lift the eggs and take them back to the nest. The player with the most unbroken eggs will be the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each clip the magnet, dangling by a string, to their belt/waistband, like a tail. They squat and pick up an egg from the pile in the frying pan. Then, carefully, they walk/waddle over to their &amp;quot;nest&amp;quot;, and gently, without using their hands, use the nest to separate the egg from the magnet. If the egg drops, it will break apart, and the yolk will spill out. Players compete to rescue the most eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
