			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undead Conspiracies contains eight playbooks of player classes for Dungeon World that has gorgeous cover art done by Nick Ladd. This pack features undead adventurers who band together to defeat those who would undo their schemes. With eight classes in the bundle you have enough choices to make an entire undead party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Deathbringer: You are a powerful undead eternally sworn to Death himself. Encased in armor and armed with an weapon Death himself has granted you, you adventure out into the world to send him more soul.&lt;br/&gt;    The Entombed Sorcerer: You are an ancient sorcerer mummified and put to rest in your tomb. Your final resting place has been disturbed and now you are free to walk the world again.&lt;br/&gt;    The Lich: The diabolical undead magician masters dark sorceries and harvests bodies of the living. All the corpses you come across is your campaign is merely a source to fuel your future undead army with.  &lt;br/&gt;    The Phantom Warrior: You are the lingering apparition of a warrior slain in the battlefield. Doomed to wander the earth without rest you return to the only trade you knew in life.&lt;br/&gt;    The Returned: Bummed your favorite character died and that they will be gone forever? Not anymore! The Returned has two playable options for you to choose from. The first lets you play an undead version of your character who just died while the second is an adventurer who died a while ago and has been undead ever since.&lt;br/&gt;    The Sticher: You are the deranged undead surgeon who uses his medical knowledge to stich your careless party members back together after they get wrecked in the dungeon. You can also provide surgical grafts to your thankless party members and yourself. Results may vary.&lt;br/&gt;    The Unliving Aristocrat: You were in death as you were in life: As pompous as you are filthy rich. Money can buy everything, even an eternal existence in the form of an undead noble. Use your money and pretentious rapier skills to upstage your party members with.&lt;br/&gt;    The Vampiric Magus: You are the more dangerous breed of vampire who has spent their unliving existence mastering magic. The blood you steal from your victims has provided a wonderful fuel for your mastery of blood magic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
