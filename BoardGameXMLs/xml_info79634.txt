							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battleground 9: Chickamauga</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;December 30, 1862 - January 1, 1863&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MURFREESBORO: This bloody battle,fought over a three-day period along the Stones River near Nashville, was one of the costliest engagements of the American Civil War.  In the end William Rosecrans' Army of the Cumberland overpowered Braxton Bragg's Confederates, forcing them to retreat ingloriously toward Chattanooga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;September 19-20, 1863&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHICKAMAUGA: During the following summer, Rosecrans' high-spirited Federals had continued pushing back the raging Rebel army beyond Chattanooga, until they reached the wooded banks of Chickamauga Creek.  There Bragg's Confederates, now reinforced by James Longstreet's corps from the Army of Northern Virginia, surprised their now-outnumbered foe along the banks of this &amp;quot;River of Blood&amp;quot;.  The resulting two-day melee was one of the fiercest-fought and deadliest battles of the war, and resulted in one of the few Confederate victories for Bragg's Army of the Tennessee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
