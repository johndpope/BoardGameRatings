			<description>An express game of urban planning for 2 to 5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Steamplanners, players build linear cities, bidding on contracts for factories, offices, train stations, churches and palaces to create thriving urban landscapes. A player may have their plan for civic glory thwarted however by the railroads of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win:&lt;br/&gt;There are a variety of urban building tiles in the game worth victory points:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Train Stations&lt;br/&gt;     Palaces&lt;br/&gt;     Churches&lt;br/&gt;     Factories&lt;br/&gt;     Corner Office Towers (left and right orientations)&lt;br/&gt;     Central Office Towers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must acquire needed Building tiles through contracts (auctions). To win the game a player must use the Building tiles to build the city worth the most victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each city may only have one Train Station and no more than one Palace. A city may, however, have one or more Churches, as well as one or more Factories and Central Office Towers. To score bonus victory points, a completed city requires both a left and right Corner Office Towers. Central Office Towers need not be present in a completed city, but they help keep your citizens from leaving on a train through the nearest railroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally there are two other types of tiles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Parks&lt;br/&gt;     Railroads&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are not worth victory points, but instead may help or hinder an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one stack of Building tiles is exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an express re-theme of Wettstreit der Baumeister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
