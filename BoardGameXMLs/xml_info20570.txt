			<description>The board consists of 12 rods arranged in a pattern of a circle with 2 perpendicular diameters and 2 sets of co-terminal arcs arranged at a 45 degree angle with respect to the the diameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 24 beads (either blue or red).  The goal is to create patterns of 4 beads along any &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; either horizontally or in a stair-step pattern.  The line can be along the outside of the circle, along one of the two straight lines, or along one of the arcs.  A line along an arc in a stair-step pattern is called a &amp;quot;helix.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all 48 beads have been played, the game is scored as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 point for each line of 4 beads&lt;br/&gt;1 bonus point for the first line of 4 beads&lt;br/&gt;2 points for each line of 5 beads&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest total score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can also be played as a partnership game with partners sitting across from each other and sharing a color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Score Four&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
