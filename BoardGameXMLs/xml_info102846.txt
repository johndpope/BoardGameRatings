			<description>(BGG User Summary:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The days of lightening strikes from the sky are over for you. There will be no more large scale offensives  in which you take part. The Allies have the initiative and they are racing across France. Your duty is clear. As elite troops your are expected to fill the gaps and slow down the tide. The army's depending on you, Germany's depending on you, and your very lives are depending on how well you can perform the task assigned to you. Load up, and move out...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fallschirmjager is an expansion with alternate rules for Ambush! that allows for playing the original 8 missions from the German Fallschirmjager (Airborne) troops point of view. The rules contain information on how to substitute US units &amp;amp; counters for German ones, how to include German special weapons (Panzerfausts, Flamethrowers, etc.), and Victory Conditions for the modified missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following 8 modified mission briefings are included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mission 1: Blutig St. Michaux&lt;br/&gt;Mission 2: Retreat through Chasoul&lt;br/&gt;Mission 3: Cold Morning in Belgium&lt;br/&gt;Mission 4: Fallschirmjager&lt;br/&gt;Mission 5: Fall Taschendieh&lt;br/&gt;Mission 6: Assault on Fortress Belgium&lt;br/&gt;Mission 7: To the Last Bullet&lt;br/&gt;Mission 8:&amp;nbsp;Battle of the Ardennes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a player aid sheet.&amp;nbsp; This includes charts on German equipment/weapons cost, squad member cost, a special German weapons chart showing the ranges and kill ratios for flamethrowers, panzerbucshe, panzerfaust, explosives, mortars, and shaped charges.&amp;nbsp; The player aid also includes a map of the conflict area and numbers corresponding to where each mission took place historically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario/variant originally appeared in Battleplan Magazine (#2) May-June 1987. It was published by Diverse Talents, Inc. (also Fire &amp;amp; Movement and Space Gamer publisher).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
