			<description>One player takes on the role of an athlete giving a tricky interview to three journalists. However, the athlete is exhausted after a hard training session and is fed up with all the interviews. Wanting to get rid of the journalists as soon as possible, the other two players are coaches who stand behind the Journalists and make motions helping the athlete decide what to say. The Journalists have to guess what topics the athlete is talking about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of 6 rounds, each player scores points based on how well he does in his current role. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
