							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brokebridge Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tower bloke rising from the surrounding town of Efsberg, Brokebridge Tower was one of those failing community structures than mar many towns and cities. Dilapidated before the coming of the Sea of Leaves, the tower is now dangerously undermined and in risk of collapse. Still, as an easily defendable position, it is here that Rajiv Shan took his children and set up camp. Now, with Shan gone, it is up to the children to survive in the forest and to make Brokebridge Tower a haven to grow up in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
