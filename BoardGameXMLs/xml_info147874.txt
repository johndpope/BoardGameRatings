			<description>Swish and its twin game Squeeze are non-mancala bead capture games. They are played on a base-5 hex hex board divided in a 37-cells inner area and a 24-cells edge. One player makes an initial setup with three 'hex rooks' of both players on the edge and 19 beads in the inner area. The other player may choose either to move first or the color to play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Swish the rooks capture by the long leap. They may capture both beads and pieces, though not simultaneously. Multiple captures are possible. The player who captures 10 or more beads wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the July 1984 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
