							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neverwhen: Starships</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her eyes narrowed as she spotted the spaceship. The battle worn hull of the starjammer was looking majestic against the sun. The sail was fully extended to take advantage of the solar winds. Her tail twitched slightly as she examined the control panel, the lights were all normal.  Normal except the check engine light.  But the shuttlecraft had always said that. She caught her reflection in the windshield, she was always proud of the stripes that ringed her cheeks, her neck, and down to her tail.  She fiddled her ears about, moving them back and forth, trying to figure out the most serious look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ship came back into view, in all its beautiful glory.  As her ship got closer she could read the name on the hull.  &amp;quot;Mag'linz Reven'ge. &amp;quot; The radio crackled to life &amp;quot;Captain Vo'llt'ur, Welcome home!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neverwhen: Starships is a must-have companion volume to the Neverwhen rulebook.
