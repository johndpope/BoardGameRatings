							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Big World: Korea</name>
									
			<description>One of the &amp;quot;My Big World&amp;quot; series, featuring historical monuments and tourist sites in Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, a card is drawn from a pile. It may show a monument, a famous building, or anything that is related to a specific place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players should locate the place on the map, as exactly as possible. The first player puts his token on a grid. Other players do the same, one by one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have placed their tokens, the card is turned over, revealing the exact location (grid) on the map. Then, the players receive points accordingly. The closer to the answer, the more points he or she will receive. If two or more players' tokens are on the same grid, the player whose token is at the bottom receives more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until 12 cards are revealed. The player with the most points wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
