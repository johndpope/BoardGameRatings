			<description>DARK WORLDS is a science-fiction strategy board game of space exploration, discovery, technological development and conflict, for two to four players. Each player assumes the role of a ruler of a space-faring civilisation. Rulers are tasked with spreading the influence of their civilisation throughout the universe. This requires the control of space sectors, and the discovery of unknown worlds (planets), with the aim of colonising them and harvesting their resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planets come in a variety of types. Some, due to their harsh environments, support only limited populations. Others, such as lush, earth-like terran worlds, can support vast populations and have abundant resources. The greater the population that a colonised world supports, the more precious resources (and victory points) it will yield for the ruler that controls it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gathered resources pay for establishing colonies, and for technological research, such as hyper - drive engines and weapons for spacecraft, and improved planetary infrastructure. Each technology developed will yield particular advantages for a civilisation, in addition to providing victory points for winning the game. Resources may be spent to hire mercenary fighters, serving your battle for control of space sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some worlds also yield rare alien artefacts, which confer victory points for the player that finds them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the ruler who controls the most developed worlds, controls the greatest number of space sectors, researches the most technologies, and discovers the most valuable artefacts will be victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
