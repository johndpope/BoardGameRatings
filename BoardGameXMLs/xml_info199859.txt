							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Circle of Democracy</name>
									
			<description>วงเวียนประชาธิปไตย = Wongwian Prachathippatai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple roll-and-move race game, derived from the traditional European game of the goose, to which has been added a theme of Thailand's evolution towards democracy. Players roll a die and move their tokens around a spiral race track of 145 numbered spaces to end at the Democracy Monument in Bangkok in the centre. Various spaces contain thematic bonuses or penalties. The board is surrounded by a chronology of Thai democracy from the Siamese revolution of BE 24 June 2475 (AD 1932) to the &amp;lsquo;Black May&amp;rsquo; protests of BE 17 May 2535 (AD 1992).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, and the Thai Institute that published it, were sponsored by the German Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (Konrad Adenauer Foundation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entirely in Thai, except that the title is also given in English on the outside and inside of the folding board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
