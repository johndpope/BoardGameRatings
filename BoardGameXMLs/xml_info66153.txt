			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Life as a warlord these days isn't easy, with warriors being increasingly picky about their teammates. Also, it seems like they just die too randomly anymore. Not to mention that opposing warlord across the chasm forming his or her own teams to combat yours. Only the shrewdest of warlords will emerge from this feud victorious.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;The two players create small armies of fighters by playing card groups (melds). Then attacking player commits is fighters to the battle and so does the defender. Players alternate in attacking and defending until one of the two has captured 13 or more enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Themed Rummy game created for the 2009 Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules &lt;br/&gt;Artscow Deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
