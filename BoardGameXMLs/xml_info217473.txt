			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wizard&amp;rsquo;s WARdrobe, you take the role of an apprentice wizard who has busted in to the Grand Wizard&amp;rsquo;s magical WARdrobe to battle other wizards for epic loot. Each player starts with 99 Hit Points, two learned spells in hand, and a wizard inventory playmat with 8 color &amp;amp; number-coded body locations for items (2 feet, 2 body, 2 hands, 1 head &amp;amp; as many accessories [trinkets or familiars] as you want). During your turn you allocate 3 actions to cast spells, use items, and grab items from the 8 face-up WARdrobe piles. The more powerful the effect, the more actions it costs, so keep an eye out for boots and familiars that can give you extra actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear Up!&lt;br/&gt;The more items you are wearing, the harder you are to hit. The innovative hit roll system supports the theme nicely: When a wizard deals damage to other wizards, they roll an 8-sided hit die and refer to the hit location on each affected players&amp;rsquo; playmat. If the wizard has an item in that location, it is moved to the junk pile and no damage is dealt. If the wizard does not have an item in that location, then the damage is rolled and dealt to the wizard&amp;rsquo;s HP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throw Down!&lt;br/&gt;There is a vast repertoire of offensive and defensive effects in the base game (over 200 cards), with more to come in the preset expansion boosters. Once your wizard is suited up with synergetic buffs, you are ready to use your spells and items to attack your opponents and defend yourself. The last wizard standing wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard&amp;rsquo;s WARdrobe is quick to set up and very easy to learn: the game pieces laid out almost teach the game itself. It is fast-paced (you can start slinging right off the bat) yet still highly strategic (with dozens of spells and 8 WARdrobe piles to choose equipment from, there are many lines of play). So far, in the hundreds of private and public playtests at conventions and stores, almost every game has been unique and exciting. The few games that weren&amp;rsquo;t we used to refine the game to its current 5th version, which is running super smooth, fun, and balanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
