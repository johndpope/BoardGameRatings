			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sixth release of our Combat Advantage PDFs for 4th Edition features Reputation Feats, a new type of feat that can be awarded to PCs or purchased based on successful adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minor reputation feats grant a PC a minor benefit when encountering townsfolk, purchasing or selling items. They are never bought, but granted by the GM to award a PC for a job well done and are meant to represent the infamy a hero gains as he makes a name for himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major reputation feats work as normal feats, but have unique requirements. For example, the Dragon Slayer feat can only be purchased by any character who has slain a dragon at least three levels higher than himself. Learning from his experience, the hero earns special advantages against other dragons, but leaves himself vulnerable against other dragons in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
