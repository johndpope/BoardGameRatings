			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A faded wooden sign that simply reads &amp;ldquo;Warm Hearts&amp;rdquo; hangs from the front porch of the lonely one-floor longhouse, built on stilts to keep it off the snow pack. This simple shop is an essential stop for anyone who plans to live in the cold parts of the world, for this shop sells the best heating system available - the brazier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of rewarding players with the same old magic weapons and armor? Looking for a new set piece around which to center an adventure? Planning to run a campaign in a cold climate? Well, Healing Fireball Publications is proud to present the first book in a line dedicated to expanding underutilized groups of magic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book describes and expands on the use of braziers, both as mundane sources of heat and as a base for magic items. The book also contains dynamic rules for lighting and using a brazier in all sorts of conditions. In addition to all the information on braziers, there is a complete section on different fuels to use in them and all this information is wrapped up in a fully described set piece The Warm Heart Brazier Shop, complete with staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
