			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Venture into America's romantic past. It is time when the young Nation is struggling to survive the tragic Civil War years in which over 620,000 lives were lost; families torn asunder; and the assassination of a President is being secretly planned.  It is also a time when a small group of men rose against all odds amassing great fortunes and political power by laying their steel ribbons across America's vast plains and over her towering and majestic mountains. These were America's RAIL MASTERS....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1862 and President Lincoln has just signed the Pacific Railroad Act granting you $100,000 and a steam locomotive. Your assignment is to safely travel across the United States and deliver five special spikes to your holding company.  The first Railroad to deliver all five spikes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will be the next RAIL MASTER?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rail Masters Trust Company is a Trivial Pursuit inspired train trivia game with added economic and pick up and deliver mechanics. Players take the role of one of six holding companies from 1862 and start with $100,000 granted by the government. Starting from the roundhouse, players roll and move around the board answering train trivia questions to get extra moves. There are six spike squares of five different colors the players are aiming to land on where they can purchase a spike from the government. The train playing pieces have slots to hold two spikes maximum, so spikes must be delivered to the roundhouse before more can be picked up. On Rail Crossing spaces, &amp;quot;community chest&amp;quot; type cards are drawn that decrease or increase a player's money. Players can sell their spikes to any other player at any time for any price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trivia questions are all multiple choice or true and false, so you don't need to be a train trivia expert to be competitive. If playing against a REAL train buff, you can always take away the multiple choice from that player and make them answer the questions outright to even the field...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
