							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Official Rules for Modern High-Tech Boardgaming</name>
									
			<description>This is a Booklet with around 86 pages(some are for taking notes), that details *NEW* Weaponry for use by itself, or with *Battle-Tech*(TM-FASA), and associated games along that line. A 'disclaimer' is denoted, wherein the publishers attempted to gain permission from FASA to associate the Booklet with *B-T*, but they(FASA) declined to 'Team up' with them on this. Apparently, they(the publisher of this, et al) wished to gain some 'authenticity' from FASA, to allow others to be able to use these 'Rules' in any 'Official' capacity. They've even included a copy of the 'letter' from FASA, with their 'polite' response of &amp;quot;no thanks&amp;quot; from the then President-Sam Lewis!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this Booklet(which measures 5-1/2 inches by 8-1/2 inches), you will find it ALL to be in BLACK &amp;amp; WHITE print(including numerous Artist's drawings) with a BLUE plastic 'binding' for the pages. They have created their very own 'unique' terms for most of these *NEW* concepts, that were arrived at through numerous playings within the *B-T* gaming circles. Some of the items discussed relate to current Vehicles and Weaponry(circa 1992), while others are quite fanciful in their conceptualizations. There are even a few that look to be 'lifted' from some other 'genres', and they've made an attempt to find a 'niche' for them within this. They have even provided &amp;quot;Unit Organizational Displays&amp;quot; that allow for several individual 'Units' to comprise a much larger one. For some of the 'Weaponry', you'll need to provide a 'Status Sheet' of your own making, but they do provide a general 'diagram' of how to go about accomplishing this. One other item of note- there are numerous 'narratives' that are used to give some sort of more descriptive idea of what is being portrayed. And lastly, there is a means of using another 'product' from this publisher(namely &amp;quot;Assault on Kuwait City&amp;quot;) with these 'Rules', which is mostly just using the game's counters &amp;amp; mapsheet from that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
