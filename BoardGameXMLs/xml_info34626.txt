			<description>SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE CASE OF THE DEAD DUKE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sherlock Holmes has been called in to find out who killed Duke Richard. The Duke was unloved by all and found poisoned in his study. The players make up the clues Holmes finds. Clues point to who did it. Players try to pin the murder on one another. Someone has to be guilty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an Engle Matrix Game so players pick a character in the story to champion. Each turn they buy the right to make what action happens next (Like what clue Holmes finds...) Action are not automatic. They pick another player to be their referee. The ref sets the &amp;quot;to happen&amp;quot; roll. Other players may jump in with counter-arguments forcing big dice rolling contests. Bit by bit clues add up until one of he players is arrested. Since players never make up the same clues the game plays differently each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Case of the Dead Duke plays out like an episode of the TV show &amp;ldquo;Law and Order&amp;rdquo;. First the players find clues then someone is put on trial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an intermediate level Matrix Game. It comes in a box with a 20x15 inch hard board map of London, character sheet booklet, rules booklet, scenario booklet, wooden counters, plastic gold coins and 2 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPE: Intermediate Engle Matrix Game&lt;br/&gt;PLAYERS: 2 to 10&lt;br/&gt;AGE: 12 to adult&lt;br/&gt;DURATION: 2 hours&lt;br/&gt;COMPLEXITY: Moderate&lt;br/&gt;REPLAYABILITY: High&lt;br/&gt;COST: $40.00&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
