			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1989, millions across the world have embarked on epic quests for treasure and glory. Using TSR's 2nd Edition of the World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game, these gamers played heroes entwined in storied struggles against all manner of villainy: terrible fire-breathing dragons, scheming dukes of the Underworld and great giant kings. Huzzah!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2nd Edition was wonderful and unique. Not only did it maintain most of the game's 1st Edition mechanics, but it created more options for the player and delivered to the Game Master a horde of awesome product. Game Masters had at their fingertips the most distinct and downright awesome campaign worlds ever designed - worlds teeming with dungeons, dragons and epic struggles of man. To boot, TSR published a decade's worth of material, so we all had uncountable sources of inspiration and adventure. In the end, 2nd Edition proved to be an exceptional arena for adventure and story-telling. A lot of material still lingers in bookshelves and closets. A lot of memories still linger, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a great time for gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Myth &amp;amp; Magic - 2E Revived!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter Myth &amp;amp; Magic, a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game that brings back 2E and it brings it back better than ever. Myth &amp;amp; Magic retains so much of what made 2E so damn great and at the same time cleans up and modernizes a few of the mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why the update? Well, for starters, we want to make the experience a bit smoother and aligned with today's gaming expectations. No clunkiness or downright strangeness. But, even more importantly, we want to attract gamers that never played 2E, gamers that started with 3E or later, a segment that comprises the lion's share of today's gaming market. We want to create a thriving player base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I honestly can't express how much we love 2E and the memories we have playing it. That love is evident in the quality of the Myth &amp;amp; Magic experience. We want to share that experience with all gamers, from the old guard to the new school alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the Player's Guide?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a whopper of a book, with every rule and suggestion to create and play a heroic Myth &amp;amp; Magic character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Races and Classes: Players choose from the legacy races (dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, halfling and human), and the half-orc, which has been updated as a core player race. The Player's Guide includes all the legacy classes as well: bard, cleric, druid, fighter, paladin, thief and wizard. We also brought forth the barbarian and monk as core classes, creating them in the spirit of 2E.&lt;br/&gt;     Proficiencies: Characters still choose weapon proficiencies to wield specific weapons, but players may now use weapon proficiency slots to specialize in a fighting style or combat maneuver. You can really individualize your character on the battlefield with your weapon proficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;     Noncombat System: The skill system is wide open. The attribute check really rules the day here, allowing characters to roll attribute checks when they wish to perform noncombat tasks. There is no preset list of skills. The entire noncombat system uses the BASE20 system, a streamlined mechanic that makes running and playing the game incredibly easy.&lt;br/&gt;     Nonweapon Proficiencies? Yes, we brought the entire nonweapon proficiency system forward. It works hand-in-hand with the open skill system. Nonweapon proficiencies represent specialized training. They provide a bonus to the attribute check to use the proficiency and also include a method for auto-successes. While anyone can attempt an attribute check to perform something under the purview of a nonweapon proficiency, a trained character has a markedly greater chance for success (even auto success).&lt;br/&gt;     Class Talents: This is a novel approach to individualizing members of the same class. In a way similar to kits, Myth &amp;amp; Magic allows each player to create the type of class he or she wants to play. Class talents are chosen at character creation and at every 3rd level thereafter. They may seem, at first glance, similar to feats of 3.x, but there are huge differences between feats and class talents that become evident with play.&lt;br/&gt;     And More: Every piece of adventuring gear you would expect is included. Many of the spells you enjoyed in 2E appear in the book alongside brand new ones. There are rules for exploration and travel, as well as advice for alignments and hirelings. There's a whole bunch of game here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
