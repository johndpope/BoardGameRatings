			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an excellent arcade game from Bill Mansell who wrote SEAWOLF . . . Stated succinctly, there appears on the screen five levels of scaffolding there are a number of bricks that have to be collected by the player who is in control of a little figure dashing around the scaffolding. This would be relatively simple but for the fact that the player must also contend with a number of monsters, contact with which is fatal. Lest you think the game is restricted to collecting bricks and fighting monsters, it is possible for the player to dig holes in the path of the monster, the latter fall through and for a little while they are out of the way of the industrious brick collector. Control is with the four arrow keys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts on level one and progresses upon the collection of all the bricks. The game has a certain number of bricks to it in the sense of the method of play, but broadly it is a skill game in the sense that when a monster reaches a ladder he may or may not use it. Just as SEAWOLF made a pleasant change from space arcade games, FRENZY is equally unique. The title of this game is particular well chosen as the player has to be very fast on his feet to do well. Sound is of course supported, and the only question is whether it is the player or the monsters that achieve the frenzied condition first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
