			<description>In the pristine little neighborhood of Gnome Crossing, the competition for the highly coveted award of &amp;ldquo;Yard of the Month&amp;rdquo; is fierce.  The residents will stop at nothing to win, including sabotaging their neighbors&amp;rsquo; yards. Some gnomes grace the gardens, while others bring disgrace and weeds. Who will be the first to successfully grow 10 flowers in their garden? And who will be the laughing stock of the neighborhood?&lt;br/&gt; Yard of the Month is a game for 2 - 6 players, ages 8 and up. Each game can last 30 minutes to one hour. There are 108 cards in the basic deck, featuring 7 different cards: Gnick the gnome, Gnack the gnome, the flower, the fertilizer, the hammer, garden tools and weeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is that each player (neighbor) is growing a flower garden. You have access to materials to help your garden out or even hinder an opponents garden. Including the infamous garden gnomes. First we have Gnick. His job is to keep your flowers safe. Then you have Gnack. When Gnack is placed in a garden, well the garden pretty much becomes useless. That's why there are hammers. Remember the part where I mentioned not everyone thinks gnomes are cute? Smashing gnomes can be good healthy fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to be the first to grow 10 flowers in your garden using other cards in the deck to help you reach your goal, and make it more difficult for others to succeed. Pretty simple right? Trust me, it can be a challenge at times, especially when you don't have the cards you need or your opponent's keep planting weeds in your garden... !@#$% weeds! And the gnomes, ugh the gnomes! Where's a hammer when you need one?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they plant seeds, which will grow into flowers. They do this by placing any flowers face down. They are flipped over on their next turn, unless they use fertilizer to grow them immediately. When it is your turn, you may play all the cards in your hand or discard at the end of your turn. Or simply just end the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other cards that can be played are the gnomes, weeds, garden tools and hammers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gnomes can be played in any garden. There are 2 gnomes, Gnick and Gnack. Gnick's job is to protect your garden from weeds, while Gnack's job is to prevent you from growing flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weeds are placed in a neighbor's garden on your turn. These kill all seeds in a garden and also prevent flowers from growing or surviving. However, if Gnick is protecting a garden, weeds cannot be placed in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there are weeds in a garden, the garden tools are used to remove them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hammers smash gnomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
