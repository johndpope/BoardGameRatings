			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new unchained class for you to explore - The Unchained Gunslinger!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord, make me fast and accurate.&lt;br/&gt;Let my aim be true and my hand faster&lt;br/&gt;than those who wish to harm me and mine.&lt;br/&gt;Let not my last thought be &amp;ldquo;If only I had my gun&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;and Lord, if today is truly the day you are to call me home,&lt;br/&gt;Let me die in a pile of brass&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The Armed Lutheran&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does your tabletop gaming heart beat faster when you think of throwing lead with your trusty shooting iron?  The gunslinger class was a revolutionary way to play, giving us a class that was eminently playable with valuable skills.  But could it be more flexible, could it have more varied choices and avenues of play?  You bet it could!  Check out Purple Duck Games&amp;rsquo; new Gunslingers Unchained and the new take on a player favorite.  The unchained gunslinger gives a total option choice for deeds, so you can customize your lucky lead-thrower to your heart&amp;rsquo;s content.  The unchained gunslinger also gets to show his stuff with the Contraptions class feature, building all sorts of clever items to get the advantage over those who are less likely to live by their wits.  Legendary Classes: The Unchained Gunslinger also contains three awesome archetypes for the unchained gunslinger, the motley gunman and his mystical patched cloak, the bootleg alchemist who bolsters lead with a bit o&amp;rsquo; magic formula, and the construct tinkerer, who keeps mechanical companions by his side. A new way to play that you are sure to enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
