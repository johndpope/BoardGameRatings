			<description>To the Sound of the Guns is a set of Napoleonic miniatures rules that, to quote the designer, &amp;quot;could be used at not too serious a level, and that were quick to use without being outlandishly unrealistic.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is designed for 15mm figures but rules are provided for 5mm as well. The designer does not much care about scales but assumes 1 figure = 20 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first published in 1982, with a revised version published in 1983. The latter version consists of a 42-page rulebook (including 8 pages of army lists designed for competitive play) and a sheet of tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
