			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep below the surface lies an ancient beholder city called Ilth K'hinax. In times past, hundreds of beholders called it home&amp;mdash;until simmering rivalries within their society exploded into warfare. The few survivors fled, leaving the city deserted for hundreds of years. However, the story of Ilth K'hinax's glory was passed down from one generation of beholders to the next. Now, after countless years of self-imposed exile, the beholders are back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After securing the city, the hive mother of Ilth K'hinax implemented a plan to wipe out all the beings living above it. Unfortunately for the beholders, several facets of the hive mother's plan have been revealed through the exploits of a party of adventurers. Now, this group of heroes must meet eye to eye with Ilth K'hinax's newest occupants in an effort to stop the hive mother's pernicious plan!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eye to Eye is the last of three adventures featuring the nightmarish beholder. It can be played as an individual mission or as part of the series which began with Eye of Pain and continued in Eye of Doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
