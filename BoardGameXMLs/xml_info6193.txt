							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diet: The Cheating Man&#039;s Game</name>
									
			<description>A roll-and-move game that parodies dieting.  Players move around the six different diet circles (Low Cal Diet, High Protein Binge, Crash Diet, Drinking Man's Diet, Surgical Diet, and Sportsman's Diet) trying to lose all of their calories.  Players can play honestly, or cheat on their diet.  If they cheat and are caught, however, they gain even more calories than they had before.  Mealtime cards add random events to shake things up.  The first player to lose all of their calories wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
