							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mah Jongg: Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Millions of players and fascinated by Mah Jongg, the enchanting game of luck and skill. Now, instead of using heavy and very expensive tiles, you can experience the game with these beautiful custom designed cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike in regular Mah Jongg, this card game starts each round with a &amp;quot;Charleston&amp;quot;, where each player simultaneously gives 3 cards to the player on their right, then 3 cards to the player opposite, then 3 cards to the player on their left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to call Mah Jongg, by collecting 3 sets of 4 identical cards, and a pair. Again, this is different from regular Mah Jongg where sets of 3 and runs of 3 are also collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
