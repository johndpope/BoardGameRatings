			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Battlemap of a Modern Ruin, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time for these prehistoric monsters to remember why they are supposed to be extinct!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Mammoth Primordiod Commander&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Ruins 5 is a single exterior map of a sundered highway surrounded by six shattered and ivy covered skyscrapers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Ruins 5 is intended for use in modern, post-apocalyptic settings. It may also be of use in near or far-future science fiction as ruins of Earth or another planet&amp;rsquo;s civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity&amp;rsquo;s Last Gambit: The apocalypse was long thought to be of man&amp;rsquo;s decision when it would occur through nuclear fire, but it was nature that caused it. The earth&amp;rsquo;s tectonic plates ground together and produced some of the highest magnitude earthquakes on the Richter scale. Volcanoes all over the world erupted, even some long thought dormant. From the cracks in the earth and the lava emerged nature&amp;rsquo;s vengeance. Reptilian monsters that had slumbered since the Late Cretaceous period awoke ravenous. They assaulted the coastal cities and consumed the survivors of the initial natural disaster. After eating their fill, they hibernated for a time. Humanity dubbed them Hibersaurs, massive dinosaurs that slept within the earth until it was a hot enough to return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The humans evacuated the coasts and went inland to try and create something that could save the human race from these massive monsters. They scrapped their tanks and other engines of war to create massive Primordiods of steel to match the monster&amp;rsquo;s scales, hydraulics to match their sinews, and a coolant system to withstand the heat generated by the fire Hibersaurs They made these Primordiods in the images of primal mammals, great apes, sabretooth tigers, mammoths, and other symbols of the strength of mammals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Hibersaurs returned, the humans sent their Hibersaurs to meet them in the coastal cities to defend the heartland of what remains of humanity. Will the Primordiods defeat the Hibersaurs or will humanity be completely consumed by the massive appetites of the Hibersaurs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
