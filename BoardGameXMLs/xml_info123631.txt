			<description>Universal Hero is a computer game released by Mastertronic in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, and later for the Atari 8-bit computers (1987). The Spectrum version was developed by Stuart Middleton working under the name of Xcel Software. The Atari 8-bit release was commissioned by Mastertronic from a third-party developer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking the part of Burt, the &amp;quot;Universal Hero&amp;quot;, the player must repair a space shuttle in order to make their way to a planet where they can pick up the spare parts needed to mend a space freighter which is out of control and on-course to destroy both Burt and his chances of returning to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is in the form of an arcade-adventure, with the player having to explore the flick-screen environment, avoiding enemies and solving simple puzzles by finding objects that need to be used in the correct locations to proceed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Universal Hero&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
