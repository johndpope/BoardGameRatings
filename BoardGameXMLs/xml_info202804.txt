			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Borrowed Time is a game for 2+ players, one taking the role of GM. You'll need at least 2 decks of cards, and one copy of the Character Sheet for each player. You'll also need tokens to place on the tracks on your Character Sheets; one for Humanity, one for Spirit, and one for the Reaper. Before you begin, divide the cards into two decks: the Hearts and the Diamonds, representing Humanity and Spirit, and the Spades and Clubs, representing the Reaper. Place your tokens on the first increment on each track &amp;ndash; the heart, diamond, or sickle icon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF version is published as five separate files; the RTF version is published as two separate files.  Pages counts in this entry represent the aggregate page counts for each version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
