			<description>Learn by playing program: Familygame for 8 years and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Kaksintaistelu is a dice game for two palyer, where you need to count right. There will be no numbers over 12, but compinatoins that the two dice in the game can give are several. The game will teach the younger players how the dots in the dice can give the same result in many different compinations. For example: the sum 8 can be made from 6+2, 5+3 and 4+4.&lt;br/&gt;Like in Tic-Tac-Toe, you are trying to get your pieces in lines while trying to stop your opponent doing the same.&lt;br/&gt;Both players get 29 pawns (red or yealow) And you get the points for the length of the lines you have made. The lines have to be echelon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
