							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bigby&#039;s Curse</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;Bogby drank a botched potion of longevity and now lies helpless as the evil denizens of Iuz seek to turn him into a lich. Only you can reach Bigby in time to administer the antidote -- if you can find &lt;br/&gt;the mage locked away in his enchanted tower, and if you get to him before the setting of the sun. Wondrous, and sometimes dangerous, surprises await you behind every door. But don't forget that Iuz wants to find the wizard, too, and you're getting in the way of his plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a race against time and the forces of evil. Are you up to the challenge? Can you cure Bigby's curse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENDLESS QUEST Books are action-packed stories based on exciting role-playing games that allow you, the reader, to make the decisions that determine the adventure's outcome. Read them over and over to experience new paths of excitement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENDLESS QUEST Books -- You Control The Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
