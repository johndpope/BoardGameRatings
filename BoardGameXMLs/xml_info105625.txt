			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ocean is a dangerous place, and  your task in &amp;quot;Fish Tales&amp;quot; is to help Sunny safely through it. To solve this, you will need to eat as many smaller fish as possible - and, as if this were not difficult enough, you also need to avoid being eaten by the larger fish. As you eat, you grow larger, and you will soon be able to eat even bigger fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you will encounter various different obstacles and bonuses - both Mines and Toxic waste, but also Power-ups and Pearls.&lt;br/&gt;There are two possible paths to victory. Halfway through the game, you can choose to take the &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; path - or the &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; path. Each with different levels and difficulty to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
