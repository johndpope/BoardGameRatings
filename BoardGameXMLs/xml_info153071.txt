			<description>Each player gets a deck of picture cards. The cards are laid picture down a few meters/feet away from the game board. Then one of the players spins the spinner. The spinner shows the cards the players need to find, and the way the players have to move to their cards. Then the players turn their cards up one by one, and the first one to find the card, shouts &amp;quot;Found it!&amp;quot; This card is placed on the game board, and the next player spins the spinner. The first person who finds enough cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
