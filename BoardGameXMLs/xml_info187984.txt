			<description>Adijuh (Адиюх) is a rather new game, which combines the rules of Russian checkers, stacking and a unique way to win. The game was created by Viktor Pankovich in 2007. It has become quite popular in Russia, where a lot of discussion is going on at several game forums. There are postal tournaments and numerous problems have been composed recently that show the beauty of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has basically the same rules as Russian Checkers. However, captured pieces are placed beneath the capturing piece and so columns are formed (similar to Bashni). A king can only move if it captures. After the capture the king becomes a normal piece again unless it ends its turn on the opponent's back row. The game stops if a player cannot make a move. The winner is the player who has got more pieces of either color in the opponent's half of the board. The sum of all points is always 24.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adijuh is played with a standard Chess board and Checkers pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
