			<description>(From the Rules)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complete a treasure hunt of knowledge.  All players are on a treasure hunt to assemble artifacts and knowledge from the different areas of the Smithsonian.  Players can acquire an advantage as they learn more of the answers and improve their skill each time the game is played.  One fun aspect of the game is that the winning treasure hunter receives a round of applause from all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(more detail)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 15 categories of trivia on each card, each of which corresponds to one of the museums, galleries, or research facilities in the Smithsonian Institution.  The object of the game is to collect one treasure (answer a question correctly) from 6 of the categories then return to the starting space.  Movement is made via a six sided die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
