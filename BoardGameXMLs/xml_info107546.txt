							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NCAA Basketball 09: March Madness Edition</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This downloadable game from EA was an experiment. It is the same game engine as their NCAA Basketball 09 game, but you are only able to select from the 64 teams that made it to the tournament that year. The game should feel familiar to anyone who has played this series. Each team has three different tempos from which to select: up tempo, balanced, half-court. Each team also selects three coaching goals to focus on during the game. Adhering to both of these sets of criteria will generally improve the chance of winning. There is also a spectator mode that will play out match-ups to show the gamer who would likely win. All of the teams' stats are tweaked to reflect the current standings at the time of release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game allows for 1-4 players on local console only. (There is no online multi-player.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
