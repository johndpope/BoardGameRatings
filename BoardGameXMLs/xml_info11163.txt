			<description>Deal six cards to each player.  Place deck in middle of table.  First player must lay down an engine, or draw a card from the deck.  Play continues with all players trying to place an engine on the board or drawing a card.  Players add to the engine by laying down a car of the same color.  Only one card may be played per turn.  After 11 cars have been played on the engine, a caboose can be added to complete the train.  During a turn, a player may play an engine of a different color and start a new train.  Players may add cars of the same color to any train engine.  The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
