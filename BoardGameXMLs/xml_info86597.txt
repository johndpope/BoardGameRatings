			<description>Capt'n Sharky and his friends have discovered a new island. Right in the center of it, Sharky sees a large palm with many of coconuts. The friends decide to pick them off, but watch out - upwards is not the only way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting contest is about to start - who will reach the top first and pick the biggest coconut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw cards, showing which two characters they support. These Cards are kept hidden. &lt;br/&gt;Each Player has a set of cards, allowing him to move various characters up and down the tree. The goal is to collect the most valuable coconuts with the own characters without being identified by the others, what would enable them to play negative cards on the right target. The player who's characters have collected the most valuable coconuts at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
