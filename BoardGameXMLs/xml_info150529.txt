			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naked Formular (sic!) is a Formula 1-themed hand management card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During setup, the race track is decided by placing a set number of track cards face down in a circle. During the game, one card at a time will be turned face up, and for each track card, players will play cards from hand, competing for being in first place for that specific card. What cards are good to play depends on the number and type (straight, chicane or corner) of the track card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player plays a card, if another player has 2 cards of that number in his hand, he can nullify the card played, steal it and put in in front of him. This protects him a while from getting overtaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
