							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Children of the Magi</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the people of the Persian Empire were the Magi, a special group of people who served the emperors as priests and scholars. Many also had amazing powers they used to help the empire. With these important jobs, the Magi grew very powerful in the empire. Each year, the Magi would go from town to town in the empire and find children with special gifts and bring them to Persepolis to train to become Magi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you will tell a story together about the days of the Persian Empire, pretending to be young Magi in training. You live in Persepolis and know well the halls of the emperor&amp;rsquo;s palace. You listened to your parents&amp;rsquo; teachings, and know the right ways to act and the importance of telling the truth, although sometimes you are still tempted to tell lies and act badly. You&amp;rsquo;ll explore the rooms of the palace and help the people you find there as part of your training, and eventually, if you do well and avoid drug, you may graduate and become one of the Magi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for one adult game master and about four children from the ages of five through eight.  The resolution mechanism uses card flips compared to character traits in a process reminiscent of the board game &amp;quot;Memory&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
