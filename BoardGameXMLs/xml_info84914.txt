							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shrek Flipped-Out Fairytales</name>
									
			<description>Players assume the roles of Shrek, Princess Fiona, Donkey, or Puss in Boots and travel through Shrek's fairytale world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to collect the 4 items (unique combinations of character, place and thing cards) needed to complete their Fairytale card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement through the fairytale world is by rolling a die. A player landing at a crossroad spins the spinner (3 are embedded in the board) to find out which way he must travel. After the player collects his 4 items, he must be the first to return to Shrek's ship to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once on the ship, the Fairytale card is turned over and the previously unseen story is read aloud, substituting the items on the collected cards as indicated in the story. Example: &amp;quot;There once was a sweet little lass named {Character 1} who lived in {Place 1}...&amp;quot; might become &amp;quot;There once was a sweet little lass named Pinocchio who lived in Smelly Swamp...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
