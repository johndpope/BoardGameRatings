			<description>The Adventures of Gilligan's Island (known on the title screen simply as Gilligan's Island) is a single-player Nintendo Entertainment System video game by Bandai that is based on the 1960s sitcom of the same name. On BitSaga, this video game is given a &amp;quot;B+&amp;quot; rating on the rarity scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls the Skipper (who looks like a formless jellyfish resembling the child from the video game A Boy and His Blob due to graphic limitations) and is followed around by Gilligan, who is controlled by the computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using four episodes (known in true video game parlance as levels) complete with threats from creatures in addition to headhunters and the surrounding terrain, the player had to wander around the island, collecting various objects, speaking with the other castaways (the millionaire, his wife, the Professor, and Mary Ann) and solving various puzzles. The computer's control of Gilligan is often a source of frustration. Frequently getting stuck in things, the player has to cut him free each time, or rescue him if he falls down one of many holes (which are not bottomless but lead to an underground cavern instead). Luckily, the game has a password feature for each level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were attempts to make original dialog (which sound more like jokes intentionally ripped out of a third grade student's joke book), to create in-depth plots, and to emulate some of the actual episodes of the television series. Unlike the show, the island in Gilligan's Island is full of homicidal enemies. Bird-type enemies seem to be plentiful as they can manage to ram the player every five seconds. However, the player's life bar is considered to be large and the time limit can be forgiving to the expert player (it gets reduced to two minutes if Gilligan goes missing however). The Skipper can attack most of the game's enemies with a punch; bringing a somewhat violent element to a game based on a completely non-violent television program. There are four bosses in the game (a gorilla, a large cannibal who happens to be the leader of the headhunters, and a skeleton). that don't even flash if the player is connecting a hit to them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Adventures of Gilligan's Island&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
