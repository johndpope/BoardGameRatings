							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 2 â€“ Douglas SBD-5 Dauntless</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Douglas SBD Dauntless was the US Navy&amp;rsquo;s main carrier-borne scout plane and dive&amp;ndash;bomber, and was a good match in combat against the faster, but lightly armored Japanese fighters. Able to carry a substantial bomb load, the Dauntless proved to be very effective in sinking Japanese ships, and it earned glory during the famous Battle of Midway. The SBD&amp;ndash;5 was the definitive model of the series, with an increased ammunition capacity and a more powerful engine than its predecessors had. It was also produced in a land-based variant, the A&amp;ndash;24 Banshee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Douglas SBD&amp;ndash;5 Dauntless (Lee)&lt;br/&gt;Major Christian C. Lee and his VMS-3 performed search, patrol, and convoy escort duties in the Caribbean until 1944.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Douglas A&amp;ndash;24B Banshee (Ruet)&lt;br/&gt;The GCB 1/18 &amp;ldquo;Vendee&amp;rdquo; harassed German forces retreating from the south of France from Summer 1944 to the end of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Douglas SBD&amp;ndash;5 Dauntless (Kirkendahl)&lt;br/&gt;Lt. JG Kirkendahl flew in bombing squadron VB-16, aboard the USS Lexington, which fought in the Pacific war until 1944.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each WW2 Wings of Glory&amp;reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
