			<description>Hewns is a modular boardgame, in which players are competing to mine a planet surface which is created differently by the players every new game. The purpose of the game is to mine more Substract (which is a highly valuable liquid with living sub molecular creatures) than any other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players use bidding drones to bid on Aliens (called Hewns); technologies; scouting advantages; and the first player token. The alien Hewns all have different skill levels and abilities. However, Bidding costs valuable Substract!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has his/ her turn they can enter their Hewns through common entrances onto the board which is made up of Nodes and ravines. The spaces of ravines and nodes can be either big, medium or small and these spaces sizes will restrict certain Hewns from entering, e.g: a medium sized Hewn can enter big and medium spaces, but not small spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Hewns reach the mines on the board they can choose to mine aggressively or normally. The more aggressive the mining the worse the planet will react to the Hewns and also the faster the game will play out. Players can also attack other Hewns owned by other players but the Substract they have collected will be used up as ammunition for the long range and/or powerful shooting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
