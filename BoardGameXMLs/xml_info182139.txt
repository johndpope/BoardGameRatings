							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thin Blue Line: A Detroit Police Story - Player&#039;s Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Watch your step rookie, or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up in Corktown.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calamity brews in Detroit. Paranormal activity is on the rise. An angry spirit, a dangerous creature, or a pack of desperate cultists hides under every sewer cover and within every abandoned building. The officers of Corktown Precinct are the only thing standing between the city and paranormal onslaught. Corktown has a secret, though. Its crew of supposed washouts are either psychics or have encountered the paranormal. These damaged, over-worked, and under-paid officers must keep paranormal activity in Detroit under wraps and out of sight. No mean feat in a city as old, large, and haunted as Detroit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corktown officers face constant threats from mundane crime, paranormal forces, as well as their inner demons and growing madness. Do they have what it takes? Can they stand against the growing threats, or will they be consumed, along with the city they guard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thin Blue Line is a modern horror setting that requires the Savage Worlds Core Rulebook and the Savage Worlds Horror Companion for use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF uses layers for ease of printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that this version of The Thin Blue Line - A Detroit Police Story omits detailed information on the setting's NPCs, paranormal creatures, adventures and an adventure generator, and cursed items. All of those materials will be available in the full version, coming in September 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
