			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trisq is a drawless connection game for two players: Red and Blue. It's played with trapezium-shaped pieces on an initially empty square board. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored red; the left and right edges are colored blue. The recommended board sizes are between 6x6 and 9x9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All pieces are the same and only differ in color. They can be placed in any orientation, but always with the front side up. Thus, when playing on a physical board, the back side of the pieces should be marked so as to distinguish it from the front side. A square can accommodate four pieces, and no piece can be placed in a way that makes this physically impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two pieces are point adjacent if they share nothing more than a vertex, and edge adjacent if they share at least part of a side longer than a vertex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red plays first, then turns alternate. On his turn, a player must place one or two pieces of his color on empty spaces of the board. On his first turn, Red can only place one stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a turn, for any two point adjacent, like-colored pieces there must be at least one like-colored piece edge adjacent to both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passing is not allowed. Players will always have a move available and must make one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player who completes a chain of edge adjacent pieces of his color touching the two opposite board edges of his color. Draws are not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The featured placement restriction was first used in Corey Clark's Slither. Asymmetric, variable orientation cell division was first used in Mark Steere's Tripen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
