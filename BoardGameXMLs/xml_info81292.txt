							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Austerlitz 1805</name>
									
			<description>From back of box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 2nd December 1805 Napoleon achieved his greatest victory on the field of Austerlitz. You can now simulate this famous battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The programs allow you to command either Napoleon's French Army or General Kutusov's Austro-Russian army, against a sophisticated computer opponent.  The problems faced by both armies lead to two quite distinct games for the player, each of which can be played at one of three levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different strategies can be employed by the player and the computer opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a large scrolling map, infantry that can change formation, cavalry, artillery and a comprehensive system of re-organisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game created by Ken Wright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
