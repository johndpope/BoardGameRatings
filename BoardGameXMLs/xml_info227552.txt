							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pike&#039;s Peak or Bust</name>
									
			<description>Small Pins are strategically positioned on an image of the mountain. This is the board. The starting Pin is marked base, and the Game&amp;rsquo;s Goal Pin, obviously at the Peak, is marked top. A player&amp;rsquo;s objective is to reach the TOP by spanning his Metal Traveler from Pin to Pin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attached to the board is a Metal Traveler on a string. This Traveler has rings on each side that are used to encircle the Pins on the board. Starting from the base, a player positions his Traveler and encircles another Pin with the other end of his Traveler in order to move and climb to the summit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Traveler spans easily to any pin, from pin to pin. A player does not need to force any Traveler span to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who reaches the top of Pike's Peak first wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
