							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Druids</name>
									
			<description>The year is 596 A.D. and the Gregorian Mission has decreed a conversion of all pagans to Christianity. Under attack, the Druids - the prophets and scholars of ancient Paganism - must try and prevent the Christians from spreading their new religion, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. As the church gathers more converts, they grow stronger with each passing day...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Druids is a press-your-luck style dice game with a twist where, with the help of the gods, you play as a priest of the ancient Celts, desperately trying to stop the Christians from converting your believers. The twist is that the other players are rolling against you! If they can convert your believers, the victory will be theirs instead. Use the special abilities of the gods to keep the missionaries at bay and keep your faithful strong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
