							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fishing: Jeu De Peche</name>
									
			<description>The fish are moved from the center pool, out of any exit, on a throw of the dice. Fish always move in a clockwise direction. No fish can pass another or occupy same square.&lt;br/&gt;To be caught a fish must land on the square with a fisherman's hook, and the player must throw again to determine size. If he throws a 1,2 or a 3 the fish is Too Small and has to be thrown back into the center of pool. If he throws a 4,5 or 6 the fish is over the correct size and is kept.  There are other rules to enhance play. First player to catch 3 fish is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
