			<description>Thomas the Tank Engine &amp;amp; Friends is a video game based on Shining Time Station and the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends television series released in August 2, 1993. It was developed by Software Creations and published by THQ. It is available for the Super Nintendo and Mega Drive platforms as well as for the Nintendo Entertainment System but was cancelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back cover of the North American version reads: &amp;quot;Take a trip to the Island of Sodor with Thomas, Percy, Bertie, Sir Topham Hatt, and other friends from the PBS hit show, SHINING TIME STATION. Eight different adventures await the player, as the game lets him explore the entire island on a network of various tracks. The player can even design your his own custom courses for Thomas and company to travel on! In Race mode, the player controls Thomas as he races against either Percy or Bertie in a test of his quickness. Younger players will find assistance in Special mode, and Sir Topham Hatt is along to pose some tricky trivia questions to everyone throughout the game. There are plenty of video puzzles to unscramble and lots of clues to uncover throughout this friendly collection of games for the younger set.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control Thomas the Tank Engine as he takes special trips he has to organise: Take children to the seaside, medicine to the hospital or deliver the mail. Beware of dead ends, level crossings, other trains and vehicles through the player's route. Based on the famous television and railway series, this game is designed for ages 3 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp;amp; Friends (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
