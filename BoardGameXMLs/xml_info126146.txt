			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A budget run n'gun in which a soldier must find four bombs and use them to destroy four generators that power a drug trafficking gang's base. Hazards include enemy soldiers, dogs, barbed wire, mines... The player can collect extra ammo and energy along the way. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THE EVIL DRUGS DUKE OF COLUMBIA MUST DIE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acting on a top secret CIA intelligence report, a commando unit acting under orders from the special United Nations narcotics taskforce smuggled four bombs into his underground cocain refinery, hidden deep in the South American jungle.
