			<description>Subtitled: A game where one's dignity may be assaulted, vandalized and cruelly mocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Princely States of the Sapphire Raj, a world unlike our own. It is a world that has no knowledge of men; they may have been forgotten in a long lost age of antiquity, or perhaps they simply have not yet come. It is a world of mysteries and magic, alchemy and astrology, treachery and truth. Everything is as it appears, and yet nothing is what it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a world of secretive faerie tales and hidden magic; it is a flamboyant era of wondrous illusions and spectacular marvels. It is a world where the influential wield their power in defiance of the ancient gods, raising grand temples and statues in their own honour rather than obeying the gods in humility.  This is a time when the poor are being trodden on and abused, the lowers castes are working themselves to death in honour of the higher castes and when those who are outspoken are being tortured, dismembered or killed in plain sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet when heroes are most hated, it is a time when The Princely States need them most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rajah Spiny Rat is a game of epic adventure for two or more players. Using the rules contained within this&lt;br/&gt;book, players tell stories of great heroes in a strange and magical land akin to the ancient Sanskrit epics&lt;br/&gt;of early Indian literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
