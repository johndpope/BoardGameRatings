			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rudra's Hidden Treasure was one of the last RPGs that Square released for the Super Famicon. It boasted four parallell stories; each time the game was started, the played coulc choose which of the four characters to currently follow the storyline of. They intertwined and each provided detailed that made up the full story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game had a &amp;quot;kotodama&amp;quot; spell system, the player had to construct the spells by himself, by combining short words into full spell names. The game contained allusions to Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest in this aspect; one could enter the spells from those games and get the same effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character design was made by the in Japan famous special effects designer Keita Amamiya.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was never any official translation of this game; however pirate translations were made available for emulators after a couple of years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from a duplicate entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every 4000 years the world is destroyed and remade, play as three different characters, each in their own scenario, starting 15 days before the end of the world. The game world combines elements of fantasy and magic with more modern technology and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What separates the game from most RPGs is the magic system where you are able to learn and combine different &amp;quot;mantras&amp;quot; in your spell book to create spells with different powers and effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
