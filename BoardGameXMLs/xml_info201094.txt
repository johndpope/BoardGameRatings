							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 – Sopwith 1½ Strutter/Comic</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sopwith 1&amp;frac12; Strutter was an innovative multi-role airplane, designed to answer the request of the British Admiralty for a two-seat bomber for the Western Front. Its nickname comes from the odd shape of the inboard struts, which attached to the fuselage rather than to the lower wing. It was the first British airplane to use a synchronized machine-gun for the pilot &amp;ndash; able to fire through the rotating propeller &amp;ndash; and the first two-seater with a &amp;ldquo;puller&amp;rdquo; engine. It served with both British air services and was also widely used by French aviation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sopwith 1&amp;frac12; Strutter Comic was derived from the two-seater Sopwith 1&amp;frac12; Strutter. The Comic was modified to become a single-seat fighter, used by British Home Defense to defend the British Isles from German bombing raids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sopwith 1&amp;frac12; Strutter (Costes/Astor)&lt;br/&gt;Serving in the French Air Service during World War I, Dieudonn&amp;eacute; Costes scored eight victories in the Balkans, becoming a fighter ace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sopwith 1&amp;frac12; Strutter (Collishaw/Portsmouth)&lt;br/&gt;Raymond Collishaw, one of the greatest aces of WW I, started his glorious career in this aircraft in 1916, when he successfully dueled against six German airplanes at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sopwith 1&amp;frac12; Strutter Comic (78 Squadron)&lt;br/&gt;The 78 Squadron used this aircraft in home defense, exploiting its flight stability and long range capability to defend Britain against the huge German bombers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each WW1 Wings of Glory&amp;reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
