			<description>The APR Flight Simulator is a unique pilot's training device. Developed and tested for several years by leading aviation experts, Flight Simulator answers the need for more realistic ground training by simulating the psychological atmosphere of actual in-flight conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As each pilot flies his cross-country flight, situations are programmed that test his flying abilities. By reference to components of the Flight Simulator, incorrect responses are immediately observed, analyzed, and explained. Greater insight generally results from group discussion of the particular situation.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each pilot selects a flight course according to his proficiency level. When the Flight Simulator is used by more than one pilot, it becomes a competitive cross-country race. The more experienced airmen are handicapped by flying programmed courses demanding greater skills, and the point score is given consistent with the appropriate knowledge. A student pilot can compete with the private or commercial pilot, while all are fully challenged by the situations encountered.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Southwestern area of the United States has been chosen as Flight Simulator country in answer to the Simulator's need for the greatest variety of flying terrain. The map-board is WAC scale, 1 inch=1,000,000 inches.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
