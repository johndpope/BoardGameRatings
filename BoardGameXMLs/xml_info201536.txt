							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nymar&#039;s Tears</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is best suited for low (3-5) level characters. It has very little combat and places heavy emphasis on character interaction. This adventure is largely an investigation of the mysterious events plaguing the village of Southwood. The players learn pieces of information from interviews with the remaining residents and this information leads to revelations that will provide them with the means to bring peace to Southwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important person in Southwood, in terms of resolving the mystery, is Weedeen, the cemetery caretaker. The Dungeon Master should pace the adventure around the revealing information that Weedeen has. However, even if the players interview him early on he will not think to tell the PCs about his relation to Nymar unless he is told of Quinn Merchen&amp;rsquo;s observation. Once the players learn about Weedeen and his connection to Nymar they will be well equipped to confront her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3rd - 5th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
