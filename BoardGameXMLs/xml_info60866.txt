			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane Quarter: A City Quarters Sourcebook is the third volume of the award-winning City Quarters series, which began with the highly acclaimed Thieves' Quarter. Thieves' Quarter is the winner of the 2004 Gen Con EN World RPG Awards for Best Setting Supplement (silver) and Best Cartography (gold), and Arcane Quarter was produced by the same people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane Quarter explores the workshops, libraries, and arcane orders that might appear in any urban fantasy setting, from the artisans making mastercraft goods to the aging wizards and sorcerers protecting their academic traditions. Every aspect of the setting is created with the larger city of Liberty in mind, but designed so that GMs can pick and choose which elements to include in their own campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane Quarter includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     maps by Christopher West, a regular contributor to Dragon and Dungeon magazines&lt;br/&gt;     dozens of complete NPC and familiar stat blocks, from archmages to spell component vendors&lt;br/&gt;     new rules for magical duels&lt;br/&gt;     plots, plot hooks, and conspiracies linking it all together&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
