			<description>Coloroulette is described as a &amp;quot;competitive colour matching game for all the family, based upon famous works of art&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt; Each player is given an art card, each of which shows a colour representation of a famous painting. These range from Old Masters to Modern Art. There are 84 &amp;quot;colourstrokes&amp;quot;, which are small rectangles of card, each showing a daub of a particular colour.  Each player receives seven coloustrokes at random and the object of the game is to collect or swap colourstrokes in order to obtain the set of seven colourstrokes which are the principal colours apparent in that player's art card. This is harder than it might seem - there are, for example, quite a few very similar shades of white. &lt;br/&gt; This game is principally designed to test a player's ability to match colours, but there is some luck introduced in the use of a spinner which can alternatively enable a player to win or lose colourstrokes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
