			<description>Blurb from the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old West is a game for role-play in an iconic West. Gunfighters meet High noon in the streets.  Pony express riders transport important messages through Indian country, the gold rush in the Black hills is on, and the railroad begin to expend into the West. The telegraph has not connected the East and the West yet. The land west of the Missouri/Mississippi line is untamed. Cattle barons and town founders act as they like, as the law is with the most powerful man. Settlers travelling in wagon trains, seeking their fortune in the West, cowboys herd large amounts of &lt;br/&gt;cattle across the vast lands towards the bustling, lawless cow towns which are the railroad gateways to the Eastern market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Plains and Rocky Mountains have plenty of game to make a fur trapper or buffalo hunter rich, if he can avoid the wrath of the local tribes. Territorial marshals and rangers are way too busy with securing the land from renegade Indians and highway men to hunt down the average criminal. The still war-affected army is occupied with peacekeeping in the South, where renegade rebel  gangs roam the country side, while the Apaches wage a war against all whites at the South-Western border. The demand after bounty hunters has become high, and hired guns are looked after all over the Old West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indian tribes of the West, though under increasing pressure, still manage to keep their native lands. In the South the Apache and Navajo has begun a fierce guerrilla war against settlers, Mexican and Texan alike. The plains tribes have forged powerful alliances, which shall make sure the Big chieftain in Washington keeps his word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some say the Indians use their medicine, and it actually works.  Frontier men claim to have shot a charging Indian several times without even scratching his skin. Healthy men die within days of a mysterious ailing caused by an Indian curse.  Creatures from Indian mythology roam the Old West from the Northern Rockies to the deserts of Mexico. Drifters with cursed guns leave a trail of death behind them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;at least thatâ€Ÿs what is told around the camp fire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old West is far from being tamed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
