							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lurker</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The desire to kill can spring from any intensely felt emotion; ambition, fear, even love. In some individuals, this homicidal urge unlocks psychic power and lays down a bridge between life and death, real and false, material and phantasmagorical. Lurkers, often resistant to and confused by their waking powers, manifest weapons forged from their unfulfilled desires for death and violence. Many go mad or embrace their gift too readily, becoming vicious and corrupt murderers. Others take up their blades for a higher purpose, dealing justice however they deem fit. Despite their moral and philosophical leanings, all lurkers are driven by emotional instinct and kill their foes with methods others might deem unnatural or inglorious. To call a lurker disturbed is no insult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Lurkers are melee-focused combatants that excel when using stealth, or as part of a skirmishing assault. They can scout ahead regardless of obstacles, and can sabotage enemies with their occult powers.&lt;br/&gt;Parent Classes: Soulknife and Spiritualist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
