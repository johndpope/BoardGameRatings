			<description>(Translated from publisher's site in Norwegian)&lt;br/&gt;How much do you actually know about the USA? About the USA's culture, geography, showbiz and famous people? In this game you really get to test your knowledge - and you are guaranteed to learn something new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into three categories; Stars and Stripes (with geography, culture and history) - where all the states are present, Showtime USA (sports and entertainment) - where Entertainer includes miming tasks to be solved on time. Every card of questions has a picture and a question relating to it. All the pictures depict the USA, and make the game a wonderful visual experience! The content in the Star and Stripes category is based on the high school curriculum. The game has been been developed by the experienced educational book writer Clara Amland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
