			<description>In Dogfight, each player has three eight sided dice which are rolled in turn. Dice &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; other dice based on number and location when rolled on the table from behind a line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dogfight was originally conceived as a collectible dice game called Zodiac in which twelve unique characters were composed of sets of three custome 8-sided dice.  The idea of characters made from dice was later restructured and published as Button Men.  The original client decided not to buy Zodiac, and it was revamped as Battlin' Dice for another uninterested client and later printed as Dogfight in the Origins 2000 preregistration book.  It was included in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
