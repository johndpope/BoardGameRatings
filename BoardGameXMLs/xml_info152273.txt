							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stilt Houses</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small village lies just off the shore of this shallow lake. The few wooden houses on their stilts are connected by wooden walkways constructed in a similar manner. The open construction of the houses hints on a quite moderate or even warm climate all year around while the construction high stilts suggests that the water level of the shallow lake could on occasion rise quite a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most of the inhabitants make a living as fishermen and probably travel across the lake overgrown by water lilies a single walkway connects the small settlement with the dry land, probably to allow the occasional trader access to the village or maybe to harvest fruit from the trees growing along the shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
