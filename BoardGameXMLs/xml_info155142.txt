			<description>9-all is played with a pair of dice, thirty-six chips, and a board with a section of nine numbered squares for each player.  Players take turns rolling the dice and placing their chips according to the outcome.  The largest number rolled is what counts, and the squares a player can cover must add up to that number, otherwise they must pass.  The first player to cover all nine squares scores a &amp;quot;9-all&amp;quot; and wins the game.  If all players fail to cover their squares, the player with the fewest uncovered wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
