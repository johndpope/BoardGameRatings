							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Duke Nukem: Land of The Babes is a 2000 video game in the Duke Nukem series of video games. This game is a direct sequel to the 1998 title, Duke Nukem: Time to Kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set mostly in a dystopian future, the game begins in modern day Los Angeles, when Duke is interrupted at a strip club by the sudden teleportation of women and pig-cops. After a gun battle, Duke uses the teleportation device to travel forwards through time, where he is greeted by a woman - a member of the Unified Babe Resistance - who explains that in the future aliens have invaded earth, killed all men and enslaved all women. The Unified Babe Resistance has avoided the aliens thus far, and have sent for Duke to fight off the aliens. The game has a linear story mode that focuses more on tactical maneuvering than on the gung-ho jumping and shooting in other Duke games; it also includes a two player death match in rooms similar to some of the other game's environments.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
