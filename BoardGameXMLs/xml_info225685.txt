							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knightmare (1991)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Knightmare is a computer game on the Amiga and Atari ST computer systems. It was released in 1991 by Mindscape International Ltd.. The game was written by Tony Crowther. It is based on the Anglia Television TV show Knightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was the second of two games based on the show, following an earlier (and different) game- also known as Knightmare- released four years previously by Activision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knightmare is based on the CITV TV show of the same name, where a group of 4 children attempt to complete a quest. The format of the game differs from the TV show in that the view is in first person, in the TV show the main player had to wear a helmet to blind them to their surroundings. Knightmare was written by Tony Crowther, who also created the game Captive. Knightmare uses the same game engine as Captive and has some similarities. But unlike Captive where parts of the level were computer generated, all the dungeons in the game were designed by hand. Knightmare was published by Mindscape International Ltd. The player is required to complete four quests in order to gain the knowledge and ability to beat Lord Fear, the antagonist in the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightmare_%281991_video_game%29 Knightmare (1991 video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
