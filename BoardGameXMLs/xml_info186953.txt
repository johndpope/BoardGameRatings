							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lascaux</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over 2,000 figures illustrated in the caves of Lascaux. Of the ~600 identified animal paintings in Lascaux, over half are equines, with another 90 stags.  Others include aurochs and bison, some lions, and one each of a bird, a bear and a rhinoceros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no paintings of reindeer, even though archaeologists have determined that reindeer made up the principle meat eaten by the people at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no aesthetic reason not to depict reindeer &amp;ndash; they are beautiful animals.  Therefore their absence must be attributed to religion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An artist&amp;rsquo;s soul of itself does not limit what can be depicted.  This limitation must be imposed by an external religion.  This game explores the conflict between art and religion, as well as other challenges of life in the Paleolithic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
