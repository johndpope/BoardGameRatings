			<description>Campaign Book 5&lt;br/&gt;Yellow Ribbon - Rules for Indian Wars 1850-1890&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designed by Greg Novak, publisher Ulster Imports&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 46 page A5 black and white booklet provides a background and rules for Indian Wars of the 1860s. Miniatures are typically 15mm Plain Indian wars range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Figures represent from 2-5 actual soldiers (with 16 figures representing a troop). Sequence of Play is divided into several phases, including Command (where one of seven orders are issued to army units, and one of six to Indians), Movement, Fire, Morale/Medicine and Close Combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both sides can Hold and Move, but the Army can March, Reform, Charge, Mount/Dismount, and Disengage. The Indians can Close, Skirmish, Withdraw and Watch. And the use of Medicine Points to determine what various bands do is well done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an associated booklet &amp;quot;And Continually Wear The Blue&amp;quot; sub-titled &amp;quot;A Short Guide to the US Army and the Indian Wars 1850-90&amp;quot;, about half background on army organization and tactics and about half scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;both &amp;quot;Yellow Ribbon&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;And Continually Wear The Blue&amp;quot; are originally published 1988, revised 1989&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
