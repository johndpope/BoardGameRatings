							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Agatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun</name>
									
			<description>From the ReadMe file:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;September, 1940.  War has engulfed Europe and the Battle of Britain rages, defining England&amp;rsquo;s finest hour.  Hercule Poirot is sequestered at his desk behind blackout curtains at the immaculate Whitehaven Mansions.  Arthur Hastings sits nearby, riveted by Poirot&amp;rsquo;s account of an island summer vacation turned deadly.  Shortly after Poirot arrived at the Smuggler&amp;rsquo;s Rest Hotel, a resident was savagely murdered.  Poirot solved the mystery in a single day; and now he wonders if his friend Hastings would have been equal to the task. Eager to prove himself, Hastings allows Poirot to take him back in time - to recount all the events he experienced and see if Hastings can arrive at the same insightful conclusions as Poirot himself. Play as Hastings (who is in turn playing as Poirot!) as you relive the tragic confluence of people, circumstances, dark histories, and motives culminating in the primal crime.  As the seemingly omniscient Poirot ominously intoned the day before the murder, 'The sun shines...the sea is blue...but there is evil everywhere under the sun.'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
