			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         GUIDELINES FOR PLAYING CALL OF CTHULHU IN SEVEN DIFFERENT ERAS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On release back in 1981, the initial setting of Call of Cthulhu focused upon the &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; 1920s-era of the early twentieth century, the time of H. P. Lovecraft. It did not take long for players to realize the potential of the game &amp;mdash; that it could adapt easily to other time periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subsequently, over the last thirty-plus years players have been confronting the Cthulhu Mythos in all manner of historical settings. Be it the Dark Ages, Imperial Rome, The Dreamlands, Victorian Gaslight, or even the far future: the minions of the Great Old Ones can always be found lurking in the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest edition of Call of Cthulhu includes investigator occupations, equipment, and weapons for both the 1920s and modern-day settings, allowing for games to be set either timeframe. In due course, other published settings will be updated to the latest edition of the rules; however, Cthulhu Through the Ages has been created to help players adopt the latest rule set for the wide range of settings published by Chaosium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here you will find straightforward guidance and era specific rules for investigator creation for seven different settings, along with updated rules for combat, as well as a sprinkling of other topics, like scenario seeds, setting specific monsters, and investigator organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eras &amp;amp; Settings included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cthulhu Invictus&lt;br/&gt;     Mythic Iceland &lt;br/&gt;     Cthulhu Dark Ages&lt;br/&gt;     H.P. Lovecraft's Dreamlands&lt;br/&gt;     Cthulhu by Gaslight&lt;br/&gt;     Cthulhu Icarus&lt;br/&gt;     The Reaping&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUIDELINES FOR PLAYING CALL OF CTHULHU IN SEVEN DIFFERENT ERAS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cthulhu Through the Ages was created to help players adopt the latest rule-set for the wide range of settings published by Chaosium. here you will find straightforward guidance and era-specific rules for investigator creation for seven different settings, along with updated rules for combat for Cthulhu Dark Ages, Cthulhu Invictus, and Mythic Iceland, as well as a sprinkling of other topics, like scenario seeds, setting-specific monsters, and investigator organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some settings like Cthulhu by Gaslight and the Dreamlands will be familiar to many veteran players of the game. Others, like Mythic Iceland, Icarus, and The Reaping, will be new. Settings like Icarus and The Reaping are offered as possible visions of the future.
