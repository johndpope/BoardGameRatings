							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Duel</name>
									
			<description>It is a period of war. The intergalactic empires of Enate and Kurth have grown desperate as scare resources have forced them to aggressively expand across the universe. They use planetary nodes as instruments of war, consuming entire star systems in the blink of an eye. Now the two empires compete for the final goal: Complete domination of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Star Duel, you control strategic galactic nodes to gain Energy, Minerals, Population, and Influence, then use those resources to crush your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;In Star Duel, players take turns activating, exhausting, and moving their nodes while also attacking the nodes of their opponent. The player who best manages his network of nodes will emerge victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TURN OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each turn, the players choose two of their Node Programming cards, orient them to match their coordinates for a node, and reveal the cards to the other player. The player that programmed the lower number goes first. After the first player completes his actions for the turn, the second player performs his actions and then a new turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, the player may perform each of the following actions one time and in any order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Execute Program [target a node, replace a node, or produce energy]&lt;br/&gt;Exhaust node;&lt;br/&gt;Move node.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;A player wins immediately if his opponent is ever reduced to 0 influence or 0 population. Additionally, a player wins if he controls all available nodes at the end of a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
