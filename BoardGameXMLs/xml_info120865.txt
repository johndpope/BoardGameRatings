			<description>It's a game about jousting. The object is to remove both your opponents knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on board with two lines of holes which the knights fit in. Each player has two knights which are positioned facing the opposing player on one side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player 1 moves one of his knights 1 space, the player 2 moves one of his knights 2 spaces, player 1 moves one of his knights 3 spaces. Each player continues to move a piece one hole further than his opponent's last move until one of the pieces reaches an end hole where it turns and complete its move in the opposite direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an end has been reached or 'bounced off' the opponent's next move distance reverts to 1, each move again being one higher until an end is again reached by any piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player must move his pieces forwards until one of them has reached the opponent's end of the board, thereafter both pieces may move in either direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a pieces finishes its move alongside an opponent's piece, it scores a &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; and the opponent's  piece is removed, when a player loses both of his pieces he has lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
