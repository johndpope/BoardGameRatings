							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: Rhonda&#039;s Irregulars</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 3007, Cranston Snord's Irregulars emerged from the winnings of a poker game. Under the command of Cranston Snord, an officer disgraced and discharged from Wolf's Dragoons, the Irregulars gained a reputation for unorthodox tactics and a fetish for collecting lost artifacts and treasures. Now, 43 years later, Cranston has given his daughter Rhonda active command of the Irregulars. Under her leadership, the Irregulars have grown in size and reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Federated Commonwealth command used the Irregulars against House Marik with satisfying results, and they looked the other way when the Irregulars went collecting. Now, the battered Federated Commonwealth wants the Irregulars to conduct raids into Clan-held territory. The Irregulars are willing to take on the Clans, but they have another objective in mind; a Star League naval base believed to be deep inside Clan-held territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhonda's Irregulars is a BattleTech scenario pack chronicling the Irregulars' history from Cranston's discharge from Wolf's Dragoons, to their actions in the Fourth Succession War, to their battles, including Operation Merlin, the Irregulars' foray into Clan territory. Also included are new 'Mechs and vehicles used by the Irregulars, unit rosters, and personnel files.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BattleTech scenario pack follows on from the BattleTech: Cranston Snord's Irregulars scenario pack, updating the unit roster and history. It also provides 14 assorted scenarios and rules for two new BattleMechs and a new vehicle from the Star League era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
