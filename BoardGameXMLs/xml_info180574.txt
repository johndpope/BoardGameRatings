			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feel the unbearable vibrations in your chest as the beast roars before you. Thunder Lizards brings six of the most iconic species of dinosaurs to the OSR. It features stats, information and gorgeous artwork of the T-Rex, triceratops, raptor, ankylosaurus, supersaurus and stegosaurus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sincethe stats present the most iconic dinsaurs of their families you can use them for other dinosaurs, too. Don't want an ankylosaurus? Use the same stats but call it an edmontonia instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the dinosaurs gets an optional special ability rooted firmly in the realm of the fantastic. Fire breath, regeneration and electrical attacks are just a few of the nasty surprises you can send against your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, we've put in some goodness for PCs to enjoy. The Hunter class is adept at tracking down and killing his prey, and from the carcass he can fashion weapons, armor and more. At the height of his power he gains the ability to mimic the powers of his trophy for added versatility and strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is compatible with OSR d20-based games, including White Star and Swords and Wizardry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
