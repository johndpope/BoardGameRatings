							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carnivores</name>
									
			<description>Carnivores is set in the year 2190. During a routine space exploration mission, a science vessel known as the FMM UV discovered a planet with a climate suitable to sustain human life. The new planet was code-named FMM UV-32. During the initial scouting expedition, the planet was declared inhospitable for colonization because of its unstable terrain and large population of dinosaurs and other prehistoric reptiles. News articles about the planet led to an Earth corporation purchasing the rights to the planet and creating DinoHunt Corporation. The company allowed for paying customers to hunt dinosaurs on their planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivores_%28video_game%29 Carnivores (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
