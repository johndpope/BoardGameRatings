			<description>It's a card game that simulates a boxing match. Both players draw cards from a single pile. Every card represents an specific action (jab, hook to the body, duck, clinch, etc) that can be linked to another action (jab-cross-left hook...) or countered by specific actions. The round lenght is commanded by the number of cards left in the pile. The match ends when one of the boxer's stamina reach zero (you lose one stamina point for every  punch you get), or by instant KO (one KO punch) or TKO (three knockdowns in a single round).&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 diferent types of punch, 4 dodge moves + 2 cancel moves making a total of 14!!! possible actions per boxer. AND aditionally you can play it with a board adding even more moves and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
