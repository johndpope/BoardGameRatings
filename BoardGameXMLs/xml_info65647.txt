			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Death in the Pincers&amp;rdquo; is a short adventure for five 1st-level characters that takes place in the Chaos Scar, near the King&amp;rsquo;s Wall. It starts as a fight with drakes modified by a Chaos Shard, turns into a battle in the middle of shifting magical terrain against giant ants that are trying to steal the drakes&amp;rsquo; treasure-laden bodies, and ends with a second battle against giant ants fixated on eating the characters instead of the drakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not playing a Chaos Scar campaign, you can still use this&lt;br/&gt;adventure by integrating it into any existing campaign situated near a wilderness area that had mining operations at some point in the past. Unlike some Chaos Scar adventures, it features a great deal of interaction with an active chunk of the meteor. If you use the adventure somewhere other than the Chaos Scar, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to invent your own explanation for the meteorite&amp;rsquo;s magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
