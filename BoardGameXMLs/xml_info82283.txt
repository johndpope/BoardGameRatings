							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Color a Dinosaur</name>
									
			<description>Color a Dinosaur is an electronic coloring book video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. In the game itself, the player colors various non-threatening dinosaurs by using the provided dinosaur images and palettes. Players can either color using the free form mode or in the automatic mode where they only have to choose a color. The basic colors are either brightly-colored patterns or limited variations on pink or red; giving the game a childish feel to it. However, an extra set of patterns can be reached by pressing the Select button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended for younger audiences as no sophisticated features are offered in this game (animation, minigames, etc.) The game's overly simplistic nature, lack of a save feature and bad visuals have made the game a frequent subject of criticism among the gaming community. Tommy Tallarico did the music for this game; which is rather repetitive compared to his later works like Earthworm Jim, although this is largely due to limitations with the NES sound drivers. Dr. Stephen Clarke-Willson was the producer and the educational consultant for this video game; making it one of the few video games produced by a person with either a doctorate or a medical school diploma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Color a Dinosaur&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
