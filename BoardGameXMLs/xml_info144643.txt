			<description>Bohemian Schneider is a trick-taking game in the Ace-Ten-family for two players played with a 32-card pack. Players are dealt six cards initially and after each trick, players draw another card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is collect valuable point cards. There's no trump and no need to follow suit, and the only way the second player can win the trick is to play the next higher card of the suit led.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over after the deck runs out, and the player with the most points wins the game. The cards have the typical point values for Ace-Ten games (Ace 11, Ten 10, King 4, Queen 3 and Jack 2 points), but the card ranking is the more usual AKQJT987, instead of ATKQJ987 that is used in Ace-Ten games. To win, player needs to collect 61 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bohemian Schneider is similar to a German game Elfern, or Figurenspiel, in which the cards don't have the usual point values, but instead the honour cards are all worth one point and the goal is to collect 11 of the 20 honours, hence the name (Elfern means &amp;quot;making elevens&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Source: &lt;i&gt;The Penguin Book of Card Games&lt;/i&gt; by David Parlett)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
