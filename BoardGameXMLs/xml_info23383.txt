							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hokm</name>
									
			<description>Hokm is an old trick-taking card game from Iran usually played with four players in fixed partnerships; however there are 2 and 3-player variants. It is part of the Whist family of card games and similar to spades, but there is no bidding, and trump is declared every hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Hokm is to be the first team or player to win 7 points. It's the most popular card game in Iran. Deal and play are anticlockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word Hokm literally means &amp;quot;command, order&amp;quot; but in card game jargon, it's Persian for trump suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H&amp;acirc;kem&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each hand, one of the players becomes H&amp;acirc;kem. H&amp;acirc;kem literally means &amp;quot;ruler, governor&amp;quot; and in card game jargon, it refers to a player having certain privileges in the game. In Hokm, these privileges are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To be the player who receives the first cards dealt. &lt;br/&gt;- To be the player who makes trump (i.e. chooses and declares what suit will be trump) for the current hand. &lt;br/&gt;- To be the player who leads to the first trick of the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players and Cards&lt;br/&gt;Hokm can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players. If with four players, two players normally team up against the other two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a standard 52-card deck. Within each suit, the cards are ranked from highest to lowest: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
