							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lutrins</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, a great empire existed in harmony with its neighbors through commerce and rule of law. Citizens followed the edicts of their god, who ordered every aspect of their lives. After centuries of peace, a great cataclysm occurred and the god was lost to his people. Without the direction of its god, the empire crumbled and society fell into chaos. A thousand years later, the people live aimless lives and wonder when their final doom will befall them. Can they overcome their melancholy and chaotic ways, or will they and give in to their misery and pass into the twilight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races of Twilight: The Lutrins is the second in a series of d20 race supplements from Silven Publishing utilizing the 3.5 rules set. Not simply a collection of elf and dwarf variants, the Races of Twilight series provides detailed information on unique and original player races that can be incorporated into any fantasy campaign. While intended for the experienced gamer who enjoys deep characterization and role-playing over one-dimensional heroics and &amp;quot;roll-playing&amp;quot;? Races of Twilight can be used by anyone who likes unusual characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the races presented are in some way approaching the final phase of their cultural, political, or physiological development and are slowly fading from the world. Some have fallen into decadence and apathy; others have lost their dominance and position in a world of multiracial empires; still others have been crushed by disease, overpopulation, or magical travails. Whether each races dies and is forgotten or overcomes its difficulties and thrives is in the hands of players and DMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While each book provides numerous details on a new race, plenty of room is left for DMs to develop a unique background and role for that race in his or her campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races of Twilight: The Lutrins presents a race of marine-loving humanoids that struggle to find meaning after the loss of their god. Once a powerful and noble race, their society has collapsed and their faith was shattered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed information on lutrin characters, lands, and culture&lt;br/&gt;     A new core class, the Entropist&lt;br/&gt;     The entropic philosophy, a replacement for the lutrin religious beliefs of yore&lt;br/&gt;     Ten new feats&lt;br/&gt;     Three new prestige classes: Lutrin Redeemer, Madcap, and Seadog&lt;br/&gt;     New weapons and equipment, both magical and mundane&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
