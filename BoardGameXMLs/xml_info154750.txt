							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carmen Sandiego Math Detective</name>
									
			<description>Carmen Sandiego Math Detective is a 1998 Carmen Sandeigo video game. It is similar in structure to Carmen Sandiego Word Detective, which was released a year before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Lipman was lead animation layout artist, character Designer, and animator for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot of the game is that Carmen Sandiego has shrunk famous landmarks into crystals using the Quantum Crystalizer machine, which the player must restore to their full size. The player travels to different hideouts, and plays maths-related minigames such as Atom Smasher, Crimewave Sensor, and Microchip Decoder, which when completed provide passwords. Once the player has enough passwords, they can get keys which allow then to free crystals from the machine. The game comes with &amp;quot;over 400 word problems, a strategy guide, glossary of math terms and progress reports&amp;quot;. There are 3 levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Carmen Sandiego Math Detective&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
