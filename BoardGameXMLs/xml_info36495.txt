			<description>&amp;quot;You are a Barbarian Warrior surrounded by enemies. Kill them all before they kill you. Solo card game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck of cards. There are three kinds of cards in the deck - Attacker, Defense, and Kill Cards. Each turn the player chooses to draw one to three cards. Defense and Kill cards are kept in the player's hand (up to a maximum of six), and Attacker cards are placed face up on the table. Each Attacker in play at the end of the turn causes one point of damage to the player (up to a maximum of four points per turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You have 10 hit points. If you are reduced to zero Hit points you lose.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If you go through the whole deck without dying you win (You have escaped). Your score is equal to the number of hits you have left plus the number of attackers you killed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
