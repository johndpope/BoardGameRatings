			<description>Morena is a cooperative story telling activity.  There are two decks of cards.  One deck has 88 pictures that depict scenes of tribal life in the Brazilian jungle, the other comprises 22 track cards that can be used as transitions between the scenes of the former deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player draws and plays a card, he or she tells a story about the card, using the scene depicted as an inspiration.  As more cards are drawn, the players build up a grand tale, using their descriptions of the scenes played as components.  Players can chose not to pass or not to play the cards they have drawn.  As the activity is purely cooperative, no one can interrupt or contradict each other's contribution to the tale that is being spun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
