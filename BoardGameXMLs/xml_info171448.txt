							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maison Ikkoku - Omoide no photograph</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A menu-based adventure game based on the comic book Maison Ikkoku by Rumiko Takahashi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a menu-based text adventure game with illustrations. The player controls Yusaku Godai, who is trying to find a secret photograph that miss Manager is supposed to hide away. The game is very faithful to the original comic, having the player move between locations in Maison Ikkoku and the town, constantly being out of money, and meeting all the cast from the origian comic book, including Nikaido who didn't appear in the animated TV series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released Pc-98, PC Engine, MSX2 and was ported 2 years later to the Famicon; this port included an extra ending scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
