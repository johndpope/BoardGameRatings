			<description>The year is 1922. A pandemic is sweeping the globe. At first, scientists believe it to be yet another wave of the Spanish Flu. In the disease&amp;rsquo;s early stages, patients present with high fever, vomiting, and weakness. Quickly, the Spanish Flu theory comes under scrutiny. Patients all report having been attacked. Where the disease spreads violent crime seems to inexplicably rise. As outbreaks skyrocket, several studies conclusively prove the disease in not the dreaded Spanish Flu; it is something much worse. Late stage symptoms are found to include death, reanimation, superhuman strength, and an insatiable craving for human flesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After precious few years of peace, the nations of the world are returning once more to the trenches, united against a common foe. In Zombies &amp;amp; Zeppelins, 2-4 players lead the forces of humanity against hordes of the undead. Together, players must attempt to clear the numerous infested cities around the world. Should they fail, mankind will be swept away in a tide of the damned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies &amp;amp; Zeppelins is played on a game board depicting a map of the world which has been divided into 25 regions. The game uses a card-driven system to determine both the spread of the undead and humanity's military capacity. Player's must carefully manage their meager resources in combating the undead. Through clever maneuvering of their infantry, armor and artillery, and a little bit of luck, players might just be able to avert Armageddon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
