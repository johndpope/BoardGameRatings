			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE UNIVERSE LIVES&amp;mdash;AND HUNGERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If we look too deeply into the roiling chaos of reality, chaos may look back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Olympian Holobeam Array, funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy, was built to delve into a fringe theory of physics. It uses highly classified technology that its parent company developed in conjunction with the U.S. military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few hours ago, the Holobeam Array went online. A few minutes ago, it went offline in a catastrophic power surge. Its engineers soon restored power and communications. Its lead researcher said everything was fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delta Green, a secret agency dedicated to investigating, stopping, and covering-up deadly incursions of unnatural forces, had reason to suspect otherwise. It immediately pulled strings to launch an emergency inspection, sending the players&amp;rsquo; Agents to investigate, under cover of a Department of Energy safety inspection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agents have no idea what they&amp;rsquo;ll find when they reach the Array.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Observer Effect&amp;rdquo; is acomplete scenario for DELTA GREEN, the role-playing game of Lovecraftian horror and conspiracy. It is playable with the full rules in the AGENT&amp;rsquo;S HANDBOOK, or the quickstart rules in DELTA GREEN: NEED TO KNOW, available from Arc Dream Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
