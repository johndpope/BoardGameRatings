			<description>From the introduction: Before the Storm lets you play an epic fantasy campaign in one evening, starting in the penultimate chapter, and picking back through the characters&amp;rsquo; shared history, to discover who they are and what they&amp;rsquo;re really doing here. With their final battle upon them, you&amp;rsquo;ll see their struggles to stick together despite all their differences, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find out what remains when the Storm clears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a narrative-focussed game, so almost everything that happens in the story will come from the players&amp;rsquo; imaginations. Players should expect to make things up on the fly, bring drama to the game, and be open to the likelihood of their character dying. Before the Storm suits people who like to delve into the emotional heart of a story, and who can look for a poignant&lt;br/&gt;narrative outside of the traditional order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there are secrets, and the potential for antagonism between the characters, information is shared between all of the players, and gameplay is fully cooperative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
