			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle Dracula is famed and feared throughout Sovilinksca as a dreadful haunt of the undead and the home of the archfiend Count Vladimir Dracula. Stories abound of his evil ways; young girls turning pale and gaunt and dying with puncture wounds in their necks, only to be seen later on seducing their former playmates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong men found dead with not a mark on them, but their faces contorted with fear and their hair bone-white. Gypsies ferrying strange merchandise to the gates of the awful castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even you, a brave and fearless adventurer, have avoided Castle Dracula. But now, charged by a woman's dying words to complete her quest, you have vowed to enter the Castle and defeat the monsters within once and for all! Will you succeed, or will you end up like so many of those before you... nothing more than a meal for the foul undead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
