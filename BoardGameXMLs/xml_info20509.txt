			<description>DRG - Das Spiel - Ausgabe Innere Medizin 2005 (DRG - The Game - 2005 Internal Medicine Edition) by Jurgen Junghandel is a bluffing card game about the new accounting methods used in German hospitals (DRG stands for Die Riesige Gemeinheit, or The Huge Injustice). The game was released last year in a Neurology edition, but was completely reworked for this year. What&amp;rsquo;s it all about?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game casts players as doctors doing their bookkeeping. They have to make sure that the numbers work out as much in their favour as possible &amp;ndash; they can leave the cases that will incur huge costs to their colleagues. Cases are laid out &amp;ndash; a primary diagnosis and a face-down &amp;lsquo;waiting&amp;rsquo; card which eventually becomes a secondary diagnosis. Depending on the difficulty level of the secondary diagnoses, a table defines the value that the primary diagnosis will have in this case. This value can be changed by other players by playing out &amp;lsquo;on call&amp;rsquo; cards. The next player tries to capture the trick by playing out a case with a higher value. When scoring, the &amp;lsquo;waiting&amp;rsquo; card for each case is turned over separately and the value adjusted for a long or short waiting time. The costs are tabulated and the gains recorded. Over the course of the game, &amp;lsquo;after months&amp;rsquo; cards can also be played that can ruin the best cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
