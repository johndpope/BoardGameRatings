			<description>In the Astrobirdz card game, you decide how many tricks you can perform with the hand of cards you've been given. Each round your high cards equal fantastic sport board tricks you're trying to perform to gain all the trick cards for that round. Each turn you draw from one of the six foil BERZERKERBIRDZ cards and use their powers to help you win the contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition of the ASTROBIRDZ card game includes a full color deck of 54 cards, 6 foil BERZERKERBIRDZ cards, an ASTROBIRDZ fingerboard, a score pad, and a set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Astrobirdz card game is a game of strategy and skill as you use the cards you've been dealt to perform as many tricks successfully as possible. The game is great fun for two to six players, ages 10 and up. Each game takes from 20-40 minutes depending on how many players there are in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
