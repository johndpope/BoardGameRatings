			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Regiment Alpha 2.1 is an Apocalypse World hack that primarily emulates the genre of mid-20th century military action. However, one playbook (the Operator) comes with an electronic warfare move that clearly suggests that with a little tweaking Alpha 2.1 can accommodate more modern warfare scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following playbooks are part of this hack:&lt;br/&gt;- Soldier&lt;br/&gt;- Officer&lt;br/&gt;- Medic&lt;br/&gt;- Sergeant&lt;br/&gt;- Commando &lt;br/&gt;- Sniper &lt;br/&gt;- Operator (Modern)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Regiment also contains special player moves to emulate military life and action.&lt;br/&gt; Player Moves&lt;br/&gt;Combat Moves: Attack, Assault, Covering Fire, Hit the Deck, Push Yourself, Combat Action.&lt;br/&gt;Support Moves: Assess, Rally, Help. &lt;br/&gt;Liberty Moves: Blow of Steam, Scrounge. &lt;br/&gt;Peripheral Moves: Will, Petition, Recovery &amp;amp; Healing, NPC Action, Attack a Vehicle. &lt;br/&gt;Engagement Move: Engage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various factors effect combat scenarios like Volume of Fire, Terrain, etc. A number of military weapons and vehicles are covered, including unusual weapons like the Molotov Cocktail and the Satchel Charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GM toolkit contains various principles of play that are part of the familiar Apocalypse World Engine lexicon, along with some new concepts (Immerse them in the chaos of war and Remember: gear can fail).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another innovative feature is the use of Battle Plans. The Battle Plan allows players to pick a mission without getting bogged down in planning. The plans are: Recon Patrol, Combat Patrol, Fire &amp;amp; Maneuver, Ambush, Hold Ground, Pincer, Defense in Depth, Infiltration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
