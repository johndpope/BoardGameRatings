			<description>Lee Takes Command, The Seven Days Campaign June - July 1862.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In June, 1862 Robert E. Lee is chosen to command all Confederate forces defending Richmond against The Army of the Potomac under the command of George &amp;quot;Little Mac&amp;quot; McClellan. In the ensuing campaign, known as the Seven Days Battles, Lee flings his men into attack after attack, always threatening to, but never quite succeeding in, crush the federals. Yet so completely frustrated and demoralized is McClellan that he calls off the federal invasion that reached the very gates of Richmond. A Legend was born!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system presents a grand simulation of operational warfare during the age of rifled muskets. Using hidden movement, players must maneuver historic armies while seeking to discover which combinations of units and tactics lead to victory, or are formulas for defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lee Takes Command is Volume II of Clash of Arms Games' simulation of the great campaigns of the American Civil War. Lee Takes Command brings the struggle of the Seven Days campaign alive with a four color 34&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; map and 240 multi-color counters. The game features multiple scenarios, hidden movement and dummy units, gunboats and shore batteries, command and control complexities for both sides, historical commentary and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
