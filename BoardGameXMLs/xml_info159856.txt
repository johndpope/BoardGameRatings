							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Empire: The Game of New York</name>
									
			<description>Empire is a battle game, similar to Risk in game play, set on a map of New York City. The map has NYC (and neighboring Jersey) separated into 6 boroughs, distinguished by color palette: Manhattan in red, The Bronx in orange, Staten Island in yellow, Queens in green, Brooklyn in blue, and Jersey in purple. Each borough contains neighborhoods. These are actual neighborhoods, but the size and boundary are exaggerated in this map for game play. Neighborhoods attached by bridges, tram or subway are also considered adjacent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to occupy all neighborhoods on the map with your player cubes by systematically booting out neighboring players by rolling higher dice values than the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
