			<description>&amp;quot;Samurai Western is a PlayStation 2 game released in 2005. The player assumes the role of a samurai named Gojiro Kiryu, who travels to the Wild West in search of his brother Rando.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it was not particularly emphasized either in the game's marketing or in the game itself, Samurai Western is actually a &amp;quot;gaiden&amp;quot; (side-story) entry in the Way of the Samurai series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samurai Western does away with the adventure elements present in the main Way of the Samurai games, and instead is comprised purely of action. The game is divided into stages, with the goal of each being to defeat the dozens of enemies that appear within it. The game can be played alone, or simultaneously with a second player. The game has multiple difficulty levels, ranging from Normal to Insane. You may also practice a level before you play it, but it does not count as a level completion.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Samurai_Western,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
