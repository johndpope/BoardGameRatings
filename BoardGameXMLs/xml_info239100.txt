							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Random Oracular Pronouncements</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters may at some point interact with oracles, or use divination spells or items. They may find prophecies in old books or be given what sounds like useful information from a wise old man. Such information is often cryptic in nature and subject to interpretation. Such may be a source of clues or a means of advancing the plot. Then again, it may not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are 100 short, cryptic messages for characters to come across from such sources. All sound like they have a meaning to them, if they can only be interpreted. None do, unless the GameMaster decides otherwise. These can be used as pieces of misdirection, so that important clues are hidden, as potential adventure and encounter hooks or perhaps, should they match up, genuine clues for an adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn away no one, not even enemies, from your fire when there is snow upon the ground. One day you will need hospitality, but it will be in short supply if you have shown no mercy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is cover and one the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
