			<description>Toys Awaaaay! is a board game tie-in with Disney's Toy Story movie.  The goal for players is to launch their toys into Andy's Toy Box, which is part of a backdrop mounted on the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects three toys and puts them on the 2 starting places on the board.  Taking turns, they flick a spinner and, based on the results, moves one of their toys towards Andy's Bed (where the launcher is installed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a toy has reached the launcher, the player loads it onto the device and launches it at the backdrop.  A toy that landed in the Toy Box is safe and scored.  A toy that landed off the board is placed in Sid's Room and remains there until its player flicks a lucky result on the spinner.  The toy is placed back on a starting place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to land all three of his or her toys into the Toy Box wins and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
