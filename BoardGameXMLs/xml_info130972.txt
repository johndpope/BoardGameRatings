							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fighter Destiny 2</name>
									
			<description>The sequel to Fighters Destiny.  Publisher SouthPeak Interactive dropped the 's' in the title due to copyright issues. Fighter Destiny 2 made improvements upon its predecessor, boosting the FPS to 60, and adding graphic and audio enhancements. Some of the characters make a second appearance in the sequel, but the majority of the cast is all new. Although the game mechanics remain unchanged, a new &amp;quot;Fighter's Arena&amp;quot; mode has been added, a giant board game that allows players to build up their characters' attributes in addition to having them learn new fighting skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fighter Destiny 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
