			<description>The Game consists of 3 games: The Steamboatgame (Het Stoombootspel), The Giftgame (Het Pakjesspel) and The Memoryvariant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All games are based on a dutch special-day: Sinterklaas. This is the dutch version of SantaClaus and is celebrated on december 5th each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Steambootgame players use there playingfigure to collect presents from the hold of the ship on the gameboard. They do no know the value of the present they took.Via stairs and rooms of 3 different colors they attempt to bring them to the deck, to secure them. To do so, they throw a dice with the 3 different colors on it. A player must stop in a room of that color. When 2 players are in the same room, they have to switch presents. Two special actions which are in some rooms give players the chance to look at another players present, or his own, or to catch up with another player who is at max two stories higher in the ship. If all presents are on the deck, the player with the highest value of presents wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Giftgame players buy a few small presents upfront. They agree on the amount of money to be spent. You can also use the chips in the game and play for points.In this game also the colordice is used to decide to what field on the gameboard the player moves his playingfigure to. On each field is a different symbol, each giving a different action. The possible actions are: Take a present, switch presents and open them up, give present away to the player with the fewest presents, all presents in front of the players are passed to your neighbour in a clockwise fasion. and finally open up a present. When there are no more presents in the pile, the game ends. When playing with chips in stead of real presents, the game ends as soon as the last chip is taken from the supply. The player with the most points wins!~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Memoryvariant is just another memory: There are 2 pairs of 12 different colored-and-valued chips. Turn them up-side-down so the sack is showing, shuffle them, and try to find the matching pairs as in regular memory. The player witrh the most chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
