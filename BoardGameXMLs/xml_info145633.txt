			<description>Ascension: Apprentice Edition is a 110-card set designed to be an introductory experience for two players to the Ascension deck-building game. All the cards in Ascension: Apprentice Edition feature new frames to assist players in telling the Heroes apart from the Constructs. The card borders are colored differently for the starting deck, the center deck, and &amp;quot;always available&amp;quot; cards to make sorting easier at the end of the game. The set also includes new art for many cards, as well as retouched versions of old favorites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ascension is a deck-building game in which players spend Runes to acquire more powerful cards for their deck, while spending Power to defeat monsters and gain Honor. Gameplay is similar to other deck-building games, with the player adding cards to his deck by purchasing them from a central deck, which has the top six cards revealed and available for purchase. When cards are removed, they are replaced with a new one from the top of the deck. Victory points are earned in three ways: first, each card purchased is worth one or more victory points; second, victory points can be gained by defeating monsters with a power resource featured on several of the cards; and third, some cards give victory points directly each time they are played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
