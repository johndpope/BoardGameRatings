							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Taking on the Dead - New Cleric Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue introduces three new cleric archetypes that focus on taking the fight to undead. The ghost hunter learns how to harness his ability to channel energy in enhancing his weapons and armor to deal with the incorporeal threats. The Undead Hunter hearkens back to an older version of the cleric, not only using her channel energy to turn undead, but even destroying them at higher levels. The vampire hunter uses her faith to empower her ability to take on those blood-thirsty undead predators. A new domain and spell are also included in this issue as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
