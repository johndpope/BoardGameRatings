			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tricks, Treats, and Terror!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: Halloween brings you an awesome assortment of autumnal enemies drawn from the legends and lore of Halloween and the harvest with a healthy dose of horror. You'll find 15 monsters from CR 1 to 17, from simple bat swarms to disembodied body parts like floating beheaded, creeping crawling hands, and stitched-together carrion golems. The fruit of the harvest can be friendly or fearsome, from charming gourd leshies to murderous jack-o'-lanterns and deadly hangman trees. Some Halloween horrors are found in the dusty crannies of haunted houses, like the sinister soulbound doll or the anguished loneliness of the attic whisperer, or may stalk the shadowed lanes of civilized places stealing what others hold most dear like the silent shadow collector. Of course, beyond the trehshold of midnight treads the stuff of purest nightmare come to deadly unlife in the form of the crawling host of the deathweb or the entropic shadows of the soaring nightwing. As if over a dozen existing monsters were not enough, this book brings you two different torch-wielding mobs, from terrified villagers to terrorizing fanatics. In addition to the featured creatures, you'll find mythic feats to help your heroes and villains become headless horsemen and ghost riders, as well as a quartet of whimsical treasures perfect for tricks and treats with the ghostly gossamer, goblin mask, witch's broom, and sack of gluttony! Grab this fantastic 32-page Pathfinder monster supplement today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
