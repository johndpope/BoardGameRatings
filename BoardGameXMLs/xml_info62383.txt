			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factions Player's Guide is the second book in the Factions game line. It expands the setting, and moves the revolution timeline forward, bringing the struggle deeper into civil war. More Skills, Advantages and Disadvantages, Special Abilities, and Rituals give the player plenty of more options in detailing their character, even above-and-beyond the overall power level of characters made in Factions at War. More Equipment, Weapons, and Talismans are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also featured is the Lifepath Character Creation system, an alternate method for making characters that takes the player step-by-step through their character's life, and fully immerses their personal history in the details of the Factions world. Both players and Refs alike will find the Player's Guide to be a great addition to their Factions campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
