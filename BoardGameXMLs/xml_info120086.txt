							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Player&#039;s Companion: Hard to Kill (Feats 2)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hard to Kill is a collection of thirty new feats designed to provide players of both types of characters with ways to ensure the success of their characters. In addition to a handful of feats for adventurers of the first type, the bulk of the feats presented here are for the second type. Called &amp;ldquo;Survivor Feats,&amp;rdquo; these feats offer a wide range of new abilities to characters, but these abilities come at a price. To take a Survivor Feat, a character must have in his past suffered a setback of some sort, in some cases a very significant one. It is said &amp;ldquo;that which does not kill me makes me stronger&amp;rdquo; and that is certainly the basis for Survivor Feats &amp;ndash; although being killed is in fact the prerequisite for several of these feats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
