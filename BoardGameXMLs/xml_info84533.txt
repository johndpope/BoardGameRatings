			<description>Web Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;A conversion of the two-fisted pulp game Adventure! to Savage Worlds. It really is mostly Necessary Evil stuff converted into the framework of Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction (sic):&lt;br/&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s it. This is what I used to run my own Adventure!-Style pulp game. The only thing which I never really dealt with here was the Adventure! game&amp;rsquo;s dramatic editing system. To my way of thinking, that&amp;rsquo;s what bennies are for anyway, right? Have fun, and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done it, run right out and get the following books:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVENTURE! the pulp-prg - This is the best pulp game made yet! I just haven&amp;rsquo;t liked the systems it was coupled with. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got it jiving with Savage Worlds, the world is a better place! The background and fluff in this book are amazing! Warren Ellis has even done an ADVENTURE! story! If you want to crank up the timeline and play in ADVENTURE&amp;rsquo;s slightly post-modern future, pick up a copy of the Aberrant rpg, and it&amp;rsquo;s suppliments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Worlds core book - Best system ever! Period. The new book is in pdf format and the original can still be found here and there. Go to Great White Games or Pinnacle&amp;rsquo;s websites to get this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neccissary Evil - The first Savage Worlds Super hero (?) setting and what they&amp;rsquo;ve done is great! If you want to link Neccissary Evil up with Adventure! instead of Aberrant, you can DO it! It works great! Maybe even have PCs stumble across evidence of the Atlanteans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
