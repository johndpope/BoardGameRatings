							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rifter (Issue 62 - May 2013)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of The Rifter&amp;reg; is truly going to be spectacular with as many as 48 pages of &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; source material for Rifts&amp;reg; (20 pages of &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; Rifts&amp;reg; Vampires source material, new Necromancy spells, a Northern Gun robot, and the missing Rifts&amp;reg; Black Market experience tables!), plus detailed castle floor plans and descriptions that can be dropped into any Palladium Fantasy&amp;reg; campaign anywhere you need one, plus some epic Heroes Unlimited source material I may expand into a complete sourcebook in the future, news and information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 2013 is the Palladium Fantasy RPG&amp;rsquo;s 30 Year Anniversary, we are trying to include something special for the Fantasy RPG line in every issue. This issue has that detailed castle and many maps/floor plans and the cover reprints the popular Kevin Long Palladium Fantasy RPG&amp;reg; cover from the 1980s. In fact, EVERY cover of The Rifter&amp;reg; in 2013 will be a fantasy illustration. Last issue was Amy L. Ashbaugh, this issue a classic Kevin Long, next issue&amp;rsquo;s cover will be by Chuck Walton. Still trying to decide who will do the October issue. Note: Writers &amp;amp; Game Masters, if you have some awesome Fantasy material (large or small) you've been thinking about sending in for The Rifter&amp;reg;, this is the time to do so. Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rifter&amp;reg; Number 62 includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rifts&amp;reg; &amp;ndash; OFFICIAL Rifts&amp;reg; Vampires Sourcebook Bonus Material &amp;ndash; by Kevin Siembieda and Matthew Clements. Awesome, fun stuff we cut from the sourcebook due to page count considerations. Heck, we had already increased the Rifts&amp;reg; Vampires Sourcebook from 96 pages to 128, and then to 160. The book finally topped out at 176 pages and we still had source material and ideas that Kevin Siembieda finished up for inclusion in this issue of The Rifter&amp;reg;.&lt;br/&gt;         More about the secret Vampire Special Forces Organization, Deathspike.&lt;br/&gt;         More Deathspike O.C.C.s including Werewolf Agents.&lt;br/&gt;         Two notable Deathspike leaders.&lt;br/&gt;         The vampires&amp;rsquo; Top Ten Enemies List.&lt;br/&gt;         Vampire Harvesters and their &amp;ldquo;Meat Wagons.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;         Some additional vampire fighting gear.&lt;br/&gt;         11 Hook, Line and Sinker Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Rifts&amp;reg; &amp;ndash; OFFICIAL Black Market O.C.C. Experience Tables &amp;ndash; by Kevin Siembieda. Please note that the Experience Tables will also be made available online for free in the next week or so. Please make sure people who purchased Rifts&amp;reg; Black Market know about that.&lt;br/&gt;     Rifts&amp;reg; &amp;ndash; OFFICIAL Necromancy and Bone Magic spells. What else is there to say than more magic and darkness for your Necromancers (and the African Witch).&lt;br/&gt;     Rifts&amp;reg; Northern Gun&amp;trade; Sneak Preview. Kevin is selecting one of the NG Robots and artwork to give you another taste of what&amp;rsquo;s coming in May. Also see the more expansive, FREE Rifts&amp;reg; Northern Gun&amp;trade; Advance Preview that has been available on DriveThruRPG.com.&lt;br/&gt;     Palladium Fantasy&amp;reg; source material. A very detailed presentation of a castle with dozens maps and floor plans, plus a general description.&lt;br/&gt;     Heroes Unlimited source material for making your heroes international police. It is an idea that Kevin Siembieda thought was so perfect for a setting with superhumans that he is thinking about expanding this material into an entire sourcebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
