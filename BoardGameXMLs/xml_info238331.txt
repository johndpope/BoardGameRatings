			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a mass of land in the northern reaches of Europe that we&amp;rsquo;ve come to know as Scandinavia. Although the term is little more than a convenience for referring to multiple places and people, it is the land that comprises much of modern-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. It has played host to a Germanic culture for thousands of years, including the ethnic groups we refer to as Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes. Often called the Nordic countries, these lands also hosted one of the most ruthless inhabitants in history &amp;ndash; the Vikings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Dark Ages Guide: Vikings is a sourcebook for the Entropic Gaming System that delves into the history of the Norsemen we refer to simply as Vikings. From local chieftains to pirate raids to unifying kings, the lands of Scandinavia and the Norse people that lived there were surrounded by action and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Dark Ages Guide: Vikings includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A history of the Norse people.&lt;br/&gt;    A look at the religion of Odin.&lt;br/&gt;    Lengthy timeline of the Viking Age.&lt;br/&gt;    Sample Qualities and the Seithr Weird character.&lt;br/&gt;    Gear straight from the Norse people.&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure frames.&lt;br/&gt;    ... And more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
