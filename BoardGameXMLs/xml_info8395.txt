			<description>Giganten could be briefly described as &amp;quot;Dinosaur Stratego.&amp;quot; Each player has a set of 23 saurians (dinosaurs of various kinds, pterodactyls, pleisosaurs, etc.) which are stand-up cardboard pieces with plain backs, so the opponent cannot tell which piece is which.  Pieces move and attack each other Stratego-fashion, with the goal being to find your opponent's eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were two versions of the game produced.  The original 1981 version came in a small box, with a larger box coming out in 1982, and had numbers on the pieces to indicate their strength on land and in water (air being a special case).  The larger version won the &amp;quot;Essener Feder&amp;quot;-prize (prize for the best rules) in 1983. The later (1992) version again came in a much smaller box and did not have numbers on the pieces, instead having a booklet that shows which pieces defeat which others in each kind of terrain (functionally it appears to be similar).  This version also has fewer types of creatures than the first - no crocodile, diplodocus, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the included booklet of the small edition &amp;quot;How came the idea to Giganten&amp;quot;, Hubert Pinthus talks from an old, well known game with opponents of unknown strength. It's clear that he meant &amp;quot;Stratego&amp;quot; and he admitted that Giganten was heavily inspired by Stratego. The change from military units to dinosaurs is a minor change, but there were more important changes: 1 - small edition: added variable terrain (land, swamp, lakes); the lakes in Stratego were not terrain, but mere obstacles. 2 - large edition: added variable board consisting of 4 parts and added 2 more dinosaurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The French version of the game was called &amp;quot;Dinosaures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
