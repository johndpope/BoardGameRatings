			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead trees and murky puddles, ponds or even small lakes make up much of the landscape as far as the view extends. Where the blank earth cant be seen it is covered by moss and meaty, alien grass. And although you can't see the ground of the murky waters, covered by water lilies large and small, at least you can tell not to tread there. The same can not be said for the carpets of moss and grass. Although their surface looks trustworthy it hides just as many bottomless pits filled with icy water or quick sand. Even the sunlight that has dissolved the fog is a mixed blessing at best as it roused all kinds of nasty insects as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
