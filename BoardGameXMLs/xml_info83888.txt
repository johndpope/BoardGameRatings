							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Medieval Naval Warfare Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I produced these in order to allow for naval actions within a small scale c.1200 A.D. mythical Mediterranean campaign, which will include Christian, Byzantine, Near Eastern, and North African states. However, I believe that they would be very suitable for use in pure naval/pirate campaigns from as early as 800 up to 1500 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are designed to provide a relatively fast, easy, and basic style of the game. In order to achieve this end the number, types, and operating details of the ships included has been strictly limited. 15mm or 25mm figures may be used ... Dice needed: D6, average dice = 2,3,3,4,4,5, &amp;amp; D10.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must construct or scratch build models to hold the 15-25mm figures used in the game. (Figures must fit on the deck space of the ship without overlapping.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set covers movement, initiative, wind direction/force, rams/collisions/shears, missile fire, running aground, grappling, &amp;amp; melee combat. Rules also come with an appendix on medieval paint schemes and another on medieval flags &amp;amp; banners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #120 (September 1997). (These rules are somewhat more elaborate than those typically found in a magazine.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
