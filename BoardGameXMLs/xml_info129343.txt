			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Darker Dungeons is a game supplement for Fantasy Adventures for Kids that adds six new character classes and twenty two new monsters to the original game. Each new character also has its own set of magic items that will make them more awesome. Exciting Adventures gives you suggestions for creating your own adventures. There is also an adventure titled Blood Mountain that will challenge your characters. In Fire Mountain, your party must venture into an active volcano and defeat an ancient red dragon. Fantasy Adventures for Kids and Darker Dungeons combines to form a fantasy roleplaying game system designed to introduce the wonderful world of roleplaying games to children. This game system is also great for introducing roleplaying games to adults that have never experienced these types of games because the beautiful imagery of this game system will help inspire the imagination of any player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
