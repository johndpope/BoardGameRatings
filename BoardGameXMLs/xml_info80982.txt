							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Decisive Action</name>
									
			<description>Decisive Action is a modern Division and Corps level simulation that depicts combat with maneuver brigades and battalions along with supporting artillery, airstrikes, electronic warfare, engineer, helicopters, and even pysops units. Units are depicted with official NATO symbology, and US Army official map control measures delineate the battlefield. Scenarios include Germany, SouthWest Asia, and the US Army's National Training Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique military feel of Decisive Action sets it apart from any previous commercial wargame. Decisive Action's ability to represent modern combat and the Army's planning process led to it having recently been selected by the US Army Command and General Staff College as a training tool for officers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decisive Action includes a full set of Unit, Map, and Scenario Editors that allow the user to create their own battles. The simulation has play options including  &amp;quot;Play Against The Computer&amp;quot;(AI Mode), and Play-By-E-Mail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: HPS website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
