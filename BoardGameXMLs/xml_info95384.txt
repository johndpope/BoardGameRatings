							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bucket Brigade</name>
									
			<description>A game for children. 4 is the ideal number of players.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has set of five buckets which can be lifted by handles that fit under the rim, 5 marbles and a 'well'. The players each arrange their buckets in a row, one end of which touches the well.&lt;br/&gt;Someone says &amp;quot;Go!&amp;quot;, the player must lift the bucket closest to the well and tips the marble into the well. He returns the bucket , lifts the second one and tips the marble into the now empty first bucket. This procedure is repeated until the marble in the fifth bucket has been transferred into all the other buckets. The winner is the first player to get 5 marbles into the well.&lt;br/&gt;Simple but will appeal to its age range. Adults should supervise because the youngest children might fancy eating a marble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
