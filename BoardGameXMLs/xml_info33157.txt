			<description>In Aviation Tycoon, players buy stock in four airline companies as they fly passengers across various airline routes. When an airline route is used, that airline gets paid. When dividends are paid, those with stock get paid &amp;mdash; and keep getting paid until the airline has no money left (assuming the funds can be easily divided among the shareholders). Special event cards can close airports, double payouts for using routes, etc. Special player cards give each player access to a special ability (which all share during a round).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
