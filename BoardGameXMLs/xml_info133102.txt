							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mark My Words</name>
									
			<description>The game is played on a grid mat. After the initial first letters are laid on the grid surface, each additional letter added to the game must create one or more new words. Words may be &amp;lsquo;read&amp;rsquo; from top to bottom, right to left and zigzag, as long as they are touching in sequence. The tiles must also connect on some part of the neighbouring side which is not always easy because the tiles are cut in various shapes and sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must 'mark' (write down) all words they discover during the game. Depending upon the agreed game rules, a point is given for each new word. The player with the highest number of points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
