			<description>&amp;quot;Super Juegos&amp;quot; was a pioneer Spanish magazine about both, board and computer games, which was published between 1984-1985. Every issue included a board game inside (two in issues 7 and 8), with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the games included in issue 8 was &amp;quot;Azules y grises - La batalla de Bull Run&amp;quot;, set in the American Civil War. It was a straightforward, 3 pages rules wargame in the usual line of the magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
