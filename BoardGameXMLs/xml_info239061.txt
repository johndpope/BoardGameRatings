To save the nation&amp;mdash;and perhaps their own conscience&amp;mdash;the heroes must slip their mortal bonds and find the First Emperor of Taldor in the infinite planar city of Axis. But things are not as they should be in the First Emperor's resplendent halls. Can the heroes save not just Taldor, but the legend who founded it, or will they discover the hard way that even a city of light casts long shadows?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
