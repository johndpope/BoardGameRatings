			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FORTUNE'S CHILDE is a fantasy roleplaying game designed for one player and one gamemaster.  The player assumes the role of the Fool, a lighthearted wanderer adrift through life, whose personal quest is the same as all our quests: to attain wisdom and good fortune while avoiding ill events and staving off death.  At the beginning of each game session, the player decides whether his character is Upright or Reversed, with his or her abilities depending on that choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses 22 cards from a Tarot deck to make attribute, skill, and combat checks, as well as to cast spells.  These cards, known as the Major Arcana, are numbered 0 through 21.  When a card is turned over, not only is its number revealed, but also whether or not that card is Upright or Reversed; this orientation affects the outcome of any particular skill or ability check.  In lieu of actual Tarot cards, the GM may simply use index cards, numbering them 0 through 21, and indicating one end of each card as the top and one end as the bottom.  This game mechanic is known as the Major Arcana system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FORTUNE'S CHILDE is a free-form and stylized game that uses a &amp;ldquo;theater of the mind&amp;rdquo; format rather than battle maps and exacting rules.  It celebrates abstractions and is designed for experienced RPG players and GMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
