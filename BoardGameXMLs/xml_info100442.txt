							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">2-5 Skidoo</name>
									
			<description>This is game #8 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-5 Skidoo a press-your-luck game for 2 players on an 8x4 board, in the family of games that includes games like Can't Stop, Cosmic Wimpout, 500, Farkle, Ten Thousand, and Pass the Pigs. The name is derived from the phrase &amp;ldquo;23 skidoo&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each of the 4 columns on the 4x8 board correspond to numbers 2-5.  During a turn a player rolls 6 six-sided dice (numbered 1-6).  They pick three to add up, to beat a target number (this is either zero on their first roll, or what their last total was).  The players then take one of the remaining 3 dice and apply it to one of their columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player can't apply a die to advance one of their pieces, or don't beat their target number, all advancement resets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until a player gets all four of their pieces off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
