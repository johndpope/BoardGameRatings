			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I didn't do it! When I find the one-eyed nun, you'll know I'm innocent!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether wanted for a murder he didn't commit, or if he saw something he shouldn't have, or if he crossed the wrong people one too many times, the character is on the run. He needs to keep his freedom at least long enough to make sure he keeps his life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Advances: Fugitive is an advanced class for characters on the run from powerful organizations or individuals, because they want to prove their innocence or because they crossed the wrong person. Inspired by films and TV shows like Enemy of the State, Nowhere Man, and, of course, The Fugitive, this eight-page booklet includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Fugitive advanced class.&lt;br/&gt;     Three new feats--False ID, Conceal Item, and Flickering Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;     A fully detailed NPC -- Fugitive Hal Hollander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Advances: The Fugitive continues NUELOW's series of quirky releases for the Modern OGL RPG system. Each entry in the series features an advanced class, an NPC, and a selection of rules that are ready to be dropped into your game whether you can find immediate use for the class and character or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
