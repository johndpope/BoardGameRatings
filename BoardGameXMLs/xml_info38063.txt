							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sudden Full Contact: The Battle of the Bulge 1944</name>
									
			<description>Sudden Full Contact - The Battle of the Bulge 1944 is a detailed new VARIANT Historical Module that tells the story of the Battle of the Bulge and the struggle for the critical village of Hotton, which lays astride the Ourthe River crossing. The gamer is transported into a pitched battle, with German attackers hurling tanks and men against the American defenders in a desperate attempt to ward off the defeat of the Third Reich. Standing in their way are resourceful Yank engineers and tank-men with no intention of taking one step back. This is not a complete game. Ownership of Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1 and Yanks: ASL Module 3 are needed to play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire battle-site was mapped on foot by designer Pedro Ramis and the detail is incredible! Scenarios bring you into the ranks of the 23rd Armored Engineer Battalion, Kampfgruppe Bayer, Task Force Mize, CCR, and other hard-fighting combat elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games comes with new historical game map and 8 scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
