							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nightmare Boy</name>
									
			<description>After unfortunate events result in the disappearance of Aster, Noctum&amp;rsquo;s king, the balance between Monsters, Mongos, and Dreamers is lost &amp;hellip; and chaos engulfs the land of Donorok in the Noctum region. Defenseless against evil, the children of Donorok are trapped in a malevolent wizard&amp;rsquo;s dreamlike world and forever locked in darkness. Their only hope? Nightmare Boy, who&amp;rsquo;s ready and willing to enter the nightmare and put his life on the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as a young boy named Billy as he tries to save innocent children and takes on freakish monsters to escape a nightmarish realm. Explore a hell-like open world in your quest to free the children from captivity; each rescued child grants the protagonist special abilities and powers &amp;mdash; such as double jumps, projectiles, explosives, and more. Tread carefully when talking or interacting with NPCs: Quirky characters and their reactions can have game-changing consequences. In fact, mere survival is far from guaranteed in Nightmare Boy: Fast reflexes and a taste for exploration are key if you intend to collect rare items, vanquish enemies, and eventually face your deepest fears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;Sharp Controls: Players have absolute control with double and triple jumps, wall-grabbing, multiple forms, spells, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;World Map: Far corners of the world are revealed as players venture further and further into the nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Collectibles: Helpful in uncovering a number of possible endings.&lt;br/&gt;Precious Stones: Necessary to save the game (as a tribute) or to be able to afford items in the store.&lt;br/&gt;Player Choice: Very different outcomes available, whether players interact with characters &amp;mdash; or not!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
