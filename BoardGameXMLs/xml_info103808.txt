							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Plumb Crazy Pipes</name>
									
			<description>Plumb Crazy Pipes is a pipe turning, tool brandishing, plumbing board game. The goal is to get the most doodies to make it all the way through a maze of pipes to the sewer below. Whoever gets the most wins the job as head plumber. The problem is that the last plumber was a mad scientist, and some of the pipes accelerator, duplicate, change direction, and beam the dooodie around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each plumber has a set of tools that allow them to mess with the other plumbers or helps themselves. Plumbers may also rotate a pipe during their turn. It's a fast-paced strategy game with doodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
