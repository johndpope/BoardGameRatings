			<description>When skiing, players stand on the Balance Board, and by distributing their weight and using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk as virtual ski poles, simulate the sport of skiing as accurately as possible. When snowboarding, players stand on the Balance Board rotated 90&amp;deg; and use the Wii Remote  and Nunchuk to propel themselves forward. Players have the ability to swap between skiing and snowboarding at any time during gameplay. The game can also be played without the Balance Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game world features 7,000 vertical meters of skiing or snowboarding. Besides racing, the game also features different modes such as a School, Slalom Challenge, and Half-pipe in addition to an Enjoy the Resort mode in which up to 4 players may ski or snowboard wherever they want on the slopes. Another thing to do is collect thumbs up by finding or completing various things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game makes use of the player's own Miis, in addition to customizable characters created in-game as avatars, and players can earn unlockables such as character apparel and upgraded equipment by completing various goals, such as finding hidden courses, etc. The WiiConnect24 service will make possible the sharing of in-game photos taken by players during their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features two courses, Jamboree Snow Resort and Mt. Angrio, each which have runs for all skill levels and challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;We Ski &amp;amp; Snowboard,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
