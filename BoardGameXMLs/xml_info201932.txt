			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Settle For Standard Demons?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mortals come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, so why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t demons? With dozens of alternate racial traits for every PC race, why does every single quasit have the same suite of spell-like abilities? If elves, dwarves, and humans can have class levels, why can&amp;rsquo;t dretches, glabrezu, and balors?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a variety of unique demons, from the lowliest dretches up to the mighty balors, presenting each one with a flavorful description and backstory, as well as mechanical differences that set them apart from others of their kind, including several that have class levels and full statistics entries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a player looking for exciting new options for planar binding and even summon monster spells, or a GM who wants a more interesting infernal encounter, look no further than the infernal legions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
