							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Module 1: The Secret of Eberon&#039;s Manor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years ago Eberon&amp;rsquo;s Manor burned.  The stately old house in the woods had been overrun by a band of humanoids, pillaged and burned.  What became of the people and wealth believed to be housed within the manor is not known.  Most assume that what was not destroyed was carried off to the marauder&amp;rsquo;s lair.  Rumors still circulate, though, that a series of halls and chambers lie beneath the manor.  What wealth, wonders or horrors may be found there is not known.  Those that have set out to investigate the manor never returned to tell their tale.  Will you and your companions uncover the secret of Eberon&amp;rsquo;s Manor, or will you too vanish beneath the ruins?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secret of Eberon&amp;rsquo;s Manor is a Dungeon Module for characters of 1st to 3rd level for Labyrinth Lord and similar classic fantasy adventure games.  The module includes Background and Start information, rumors, maps and encounters.  The adventure site can be used independently or as part of CM1 Borderlands of Adventure Campaign Module, available now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
