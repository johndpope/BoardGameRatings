			<description>A traditional dexterity game, Climbing Path involves carefully moving a ball up the face of a sloped wall full of holes, trying to avoid the holes in order to reach the destination, by means of pulling on two strings attached to a ball carrier. Suggested paths printed on the board can be followed for varied difficulty, or you can attempt your own path. This is similar to the dexterity game Labyrinth, but this one is vertical, and uses strings to move the ball, instead of tilting the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
