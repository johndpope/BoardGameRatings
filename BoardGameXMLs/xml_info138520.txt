			<description>Leapfrog is an alquerque-style game played on a square board of 97 spaces in a complex pattern.  Each player has a Frog King and 8 Frog Pawns and the winner is the first player to get their Frog King to the central space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player on their turn moves one piece a series of &amp;quot;leaps&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; each leap being over exactly one occupied or unoccupied space.  If the final leap is over a friendly piece then the player must immediately make another move with that piece.  If the final leap is over an opponent's piece then the turn passes to that opponent who must make a move with that piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leapfrog was published in issue 7 of the Games and Puzzles Journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
