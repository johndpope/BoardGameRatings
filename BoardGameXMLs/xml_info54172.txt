							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wars: Destroy Death Star Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the game box photos, it appears to incorporate a space themed grid made up of connected circles (rather than more common hexagons or squares).  It appears players race across the grid, avoiding or destroying tie fighters along the way to the Death Star.  One space looks to be the &amp;quot;vent&amp;quot; in the Death Star that players are likely vying for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This seems to be a either a UK or at least European release only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though named the same as Star Wars: Destroy Death Star Game, these are much different games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
