			<description>Detana!! TwinBee​ (出たな!! ツインビー,? &amp;quot;Here Comes TwinBee!!&amp;quot;), originally released outside Japan as Bells &amp;amp; Whistles, is a vertical-scrolling shoot-'em-up game originally released by Konami in 1991 as a coin-operated video game. It is the fifth game in the TwinBee series and the second released for the arcades following the original TwinBee (the previous sequels were released directly to home consoles). In Japan, Detana!! TwinBee was ported to the X68000 computer in 1991[1] and to the PC Engine in 1992[2], as well as for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in the compilation Detana!! TwinBee Yahoo and for the PlayStation Portable in TwinBee Portable. The PC Engine port of the game was released for the Wii Virtual Console in North America and Europe in 2009 as a &amp;quot;Hanabi Festival&amp;quot; release. The game was released for the PlayStation Network in Japan on June 16, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detana!! TwinBee marked the debut of Japanese animator Jujiro Hamakawa (credited under the pen name Shuzilow.HA) as the series' primary character designer for every subsequent installment. Detana!! TwinBee was awarded &amp;quot;Best Shooting Game of 1991&amp;quot; by the Japanese arcade game magazine Gamest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set several years after the events of the original TwinBee, TwinBee and WinBee are relaxing at their island when they receive an SOS  signal from the distant planet of Meru. The signal contains a message sent by Queen Melora, who pleads for the salvation of her planet from the invading forces of the evil alien Iva. TwinBee and his friends decides to set off to outer space to defeat the forces of Iva and save Planet Meru. Detana!!  marks the first appearance of TwinBee's and WinBee's respective pilots, Light and Pastel, who became prominent characters in many subsequent TwinBee  video games and related media, although they were originally unnamed in this game (the characters were given their names in the audio drama TwinBee Paradise).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Detana!!
