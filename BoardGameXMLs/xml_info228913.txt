							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alice Black: Blood Tribute</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Alice Black, feared feline space pirate and captain of the dreaded Manticore. For years you have plagued the spaceways trading slaughter for profit. You seek no approval from King or Lord. Yet infamy has a price and your coffers are low. Without the necessary funds your ship will fall into scrap, shadow ports will close their doors, you and your crew will be left helpless against the tender mercies of the Wolves. Your one chance at salvation lies in stealing tribute from a faded Wolf House. However, your success will break a treaty and doom trillions to annihilation. Alice Black: Blood Tribute is a solo game and adventure in one book. All you need to play is this book, a pencil, some paper and a few common dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
