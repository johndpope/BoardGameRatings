			<description>In Doodle Realms, players are explorers leading the expansion of their realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, an explore card is placed in the center of the table, then, players simultaneously pick a combination of SHAPE and TERRAIN to explore and draw on their personal 11x11 game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a certain number of rounds, players score their realms based on a set of scoring cards. Each scoring card is tied to a TERRAIN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 4 scoring phases and about 20 minutes, the player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
