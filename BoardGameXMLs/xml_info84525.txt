			<description>In the game, up to six bears try to create a store of honey. On the field, around a meadow, are six bear caves. In the middle of the meadow there are the bees. Every player has a choice to move the bears or the bees.The bears move exactly four steps, and if they cross one, they can lift honey pots, which they try as quickly as possible to transport to their caves. When moving the bee you roll a special die (2x honey symbol 3,4,5,6). The honey bee is then moved to a space and on their old space is a honey pot is laid. The bees can also chase the bears, if caught the affected bears lose the honey and start again in the cave. Honey which is already in the cave is safe. The winner is the bear who has a full stock (adjusted according to players) collected first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
