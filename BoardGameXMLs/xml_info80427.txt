			<description>From the Back of the Game Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Ian Williams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 3D graphical representation of warfare in the Napoleonic era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 'The General' you see the conflict unfold before you from a first-person point of view.  Distant troops are only identifiable by using a telescope, units may be obscured by buildings, orders take time to reach the units to which they have been issued and reports from your Brigade Commanders may be lost on their way back to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These features along with many others, make 'The General' exceptional. The standard 'birds-eye view' has been replaced by the 'General's-eye view' and communication problems added to give the players a taste of the real difficulties faced by the generals of that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assume the role of The General of the Grand Army and experience the authentic atmosphere of Napoleonic Warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
