							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Traveling Circus Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Each player is the owner of a traveling circus.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A web published game for which you can make your own components, or you can use the board, pawns, money, houses, and hotels from a Monopoly set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of Act Cards will need to be created. Each card represents a carnival or circus act. There are four types of acts: acrobats, clowns, animals, and freaks. An Act Card is drawn any time a player lands on one of the spaces that requires any type of card to be drawn. The Monopoly cards are not used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last card is drawn from the Act Deck. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
