			<description>Subsunk is a text adventure game by Firebird developed by Peter Torrance and Colin Liddle in 1985 for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum home computers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ed Lines, reporter for the &amp;quot;Seafaring Gazette&amp;quot;, is aboard the nuclear submarine Sealion for a routine patrol when the sub is attacked and disabled by a foreign power. The crew are taken into captivity and the sub scuttled - with the hidden journalist still aboard. He must alert headquarters with the news of what has happened and escape the doomed vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced using The Quill computer program and includes simple graphics. The player must guide Ed Lines in his attempt to escape the stricken submarine; he must reach the telex room and issue the distress signal &amp;quot;SUBSUNK&amp;quot; to alert the authorities and bring assistance. Meanwhile, the wrecked submarine is filling with water...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was followed by a sequel, Seabase Delta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Subsunk&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
