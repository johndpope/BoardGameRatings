			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Lead your party against the giants! Will you be brave enough to challenge the towering, unconquered Giant Fortress?&lt;br/&gt;The Giant Fortress stands on the very top of the highest mountain of the Glacial Spine. A path, haunted by snow trolls, hobgoblins and other dread monsters, leads to the fortress. A small plateau before the fortress houses the hobgoblins encampment. The hobgoblins act as servants and cannon fodder for the giants.&lt;br/&gt;The fortress is a massive structure made of granite and grey stone dug from the very belly of the mountain. The building rises to the sky for 3 levels (although, being giant-sized, it is roughly 160 feet high).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
