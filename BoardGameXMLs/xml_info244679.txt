			<description>Speed Farkel is a fast, six-player version of the popular game, Pocket Farkel, in that the scoring combinations are the same.  However, all players start with zero score and all players roll every turn at the same time.  Players scramble to try to roll a minimum score that has been determined by rolling the 12-sided &amp;quot;IGNITION&amp;quot; die.  The scorekeeper records and adds all scores after every round.  The first player to get over 10,000 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
