			<description>Components:&lt;br/&gt;4-piece jigsaw style board&lt;br/&gt;30 sale cards&lt;br/&gt;4 pawns&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents a clothing store holding a sale. Players move their pawns around the store by rolling the die. Lift spaces allow short cuts between the 'floors'. There are eight types of item on sale in different areas of the board. Landing on a 'BUY' square allows a player to take an item represented by a price-ticket showing retail price / sale price / saving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a maximum of &amp;pound;30 to spend and may exit the store once they have spent &amp;pound;25. The player who exits first gets a &amp;pound;2 bonus for his parking fee and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score the savings amounts made plus bonuses for suits - jacket and trousers or skirt and jumper - plus cash in hand. Player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
