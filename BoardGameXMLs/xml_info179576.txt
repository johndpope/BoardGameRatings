			<description>Star Fox Zero is a third person sci-fi action game and the sixth installment in the Star Fox series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Fox Zero sees the fictional Lylat star system under attack from the mad scientist Andross. The rogue mercenaries known as the Star Fox Team once again step up to defeat Andross and save the Lylat system. SF Zero continues the classic gameplay established by its predecessors- players control ace pilot Fox McCloud as he pilots his Arwing craft through various scrolling shooter-style levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SF Zero features several new vehicles. It marks the appearance of the transforming walker Arwing previously only seen in the never officially released Star Fox 2. Players will also once again get to take control of the Landmaster Tank as well as the new drone like Gyrowing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SF Zero features a unique aiming function where players use the WiiU game pad to aim separately of the Arwing's position simultaneously during play. For the first time two players can play at the same time in coop mode, with one steering the ship and the other aiming and firing the lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
