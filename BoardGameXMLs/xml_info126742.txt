			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control their cars from a birds-eye view around various tracks in various environments. In Championship Mode, you race against three opponents and the aim is to complete the tracks in either first or second position, which will unlock the next track. There are four championships, each with four tracks. Around the tracks are various powerups, which can be used to help yourself, or hinder others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
