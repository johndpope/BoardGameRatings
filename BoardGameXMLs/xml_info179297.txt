							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Random Aliens!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Brutes and Alien Mystics are fine and dandy, but you&amp;rsquo;re going to want some more aliens to flesh out your galaxy. White Star is a great tool kit, and this is another tool for you to add to that kit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement provides a step-by-step series of random tables to create new aliens for use by players or Referees. It also includes five pregenerated and illustrated sample aliens created using that very system for you to use in your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hyperspace Messenger is a series of short supplements designed for use with the White Star role-playing game, though it uses simple concepts which can easily be integrated into any OSR-style science fiction game. The goal is to deliver quality supplements exploring a single concept all within the span of only six-to-twelve pages. Okay - I guess I got a little carried away with this one and went to 16 pages, but only because I was having fun rolling up aliens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
