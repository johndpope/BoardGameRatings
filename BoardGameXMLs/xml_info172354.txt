			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making the Unknown Known. Welcome to a world where the unknown needs to be known. The United Nations Specials are a select team of psychics and investigators whose sole purpose is to make the unknown known. This game provides players with character generation rules, psionic lists, magic lists, and stats for the people who run the UN Specials. Also included is an introductory adventure, &amp;quot;Road Trip USA!&amp;quot; Last but not least, a catalog of creatures and baddies that will provide GMs with hours of campaign ideas. This book requires: siz-sided dice, pencils, the Action! System Core Rules, insanity, and most of all the desire to make the unknown known! Apocket RPG! Great for road trips and flying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
