							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Atheneum of Yearning</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A level 3-6, 50 room dungeon with factional play for Lamentations of the Flame Princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The atheneum was a center of learning which became the headquarters of a dangerous cult. Where forgotten ones hoped to be chosen for the pure land. Their rituals went wrong during the city's raid. Now it's been forgotten inside its containment cube for 50 years. Until a secret entrance was found in the basement of a nearby house. Only the players have access to this hidden chamber for now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
