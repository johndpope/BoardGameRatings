			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stone family has been living in the Florida Keys for generations. Wealthy icons of the community, the family is led by patriarch Eric Stone and his wife Vanessa. Their four children are also icons of the community, doing charity work and setting a standard for the local &amp;lsquo;aristocracy.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But on September 4, tragedy strikes and the family is torn apart when their boat explodes, killing Eric, Vanessa, and two of the children. Authorities haven&amp;rsquo;t ruled out foul-play, but without any evidence, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to proceed with an investigation. Could the surviving children or family friends have been involved in the death of four Stone Family members?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol One-Sheet Series do not include rules, only charts. Each game requires players to own at least one game in the Protocol series, or Protocol Prime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
