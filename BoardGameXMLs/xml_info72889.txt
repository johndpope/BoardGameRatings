			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An isometric platform puzzle game from Ocean Software, developped for 8-bit systems and subsequently ported to various systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls two creatures, Head and Heels, alternating between the two and, when possible, merging them into Headoverheels. The game is played in a flick-screen environment, with most screens presenting the player with some sort of puzzle to reach the exit, occasionally some dexterity test. Most dangerous object kill at a touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two creatures have different capabilities: Head can jump high and glide in the air, but walks slowly, whereas Heels runs quickly and can carry one object, but barely jump. When combined, Headoverheels can both run quickly, pick up objects and jump high, but is big and can therefore not fit everywhere. How to advance through the rooms is a matter of clever thinking of pushing and lifting objects, out-maneuvering enemies and skillful jumping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once escaped from the initial prison, the goal of the game is to free four imprisoned worlds. The player can choose to skip some of these and just escape, but the final score will be better if worlds are saved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head over Heels was revived by Retrospec in 2003, who released a remake for Macintosh, Windows, Linux and BEOS. This remake is identical to the 8-bit versions, with identical sprites but in multicolour and newly composed music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Jon Ritman: design&lt;br/&gt;Bernie Drummond: program (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
