			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic Items as Characters is a short supplement for Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 4th edition that gives all the necessary tools to players and Dungeons Masters who want to create sentient magical items for their games. It uses the same feats, classes, powers, and level system already familiar to D&amp;amp;D players to quickly create new and dynamic characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic Items as Characters seeks to maintain the balance of D&amp;amp;D 4th edition while injecting entirely new ideas into the system. These Magic Items can become an interesting player character, joining the party in their adventures. They can also become important NPCs, weapons of great power coveted by many power figures while they themselves work towards their own goals. Consider that powerful Magic Items are important parts of mythology and modern story telling, from the Hammer of Thor to the Elder Wand of Harry Potter. Why should your D&amp;amp;D games be denied this level of mystery and excitement?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
