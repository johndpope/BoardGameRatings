			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your trip to Lux III hits &amp;quot;difficulties&amp;quot; your patron suggests a way you can repay him and avoid his lawyers. It's a simple enough task, on the surface; all you have to do is infiltrate a criminal gang, discover who their boss is, and put him out of business. But there's a drawback, and it's a big one. The gang operates in Tin Town, a robots-only slum, and fleshies just aren't welcome there. But fear not, for your patron has a solution; you're going to enter Tin Town disguised as robots!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have the heroes got what it takes to be a robot and avoid detection? Can they infiltrate the gang and work their way to see Mr. Big? Or is it all going to end in one huge rumble?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in the latest installment of Daring Tales of the Space Lanes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
