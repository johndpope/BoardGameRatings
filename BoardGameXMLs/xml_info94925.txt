			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alien reality is infiltrating our world, replacing it piece by piece. Horrific creatures slink about unseen, stealing indiscriminately and leaving exact replicas in their wake. These simulacra are indistinguishable from the originals, and there&amp;rsquo;s no telling what will be the next target. It might be the fire hydrant down the street, the local post office, or an aged Merlot in a private wine cellar. A person can also be replicated and replaced&amp;hellip; your neighbors, your friends, your family&amp;mdash;anyone can be next. Even you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few men and women who can see the invaders creeping about our world. They wage a quiet war against the enemy while those who they struggle to protect recognize nothing of their sacrifice. They are the Anonymous, tragic heroes who risk more than just their lives in the struggle against the enemy; they risk their humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exquisite Replicas is a role-playing game of paranoia and horror where intolerable choices collide with the fragile hope of what it means to be human. The war must be won, but it is up to the players to decide at what cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
