							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wayside Inn</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wayside Inn is the first stop on the road North away from the village of Solis. It is a modest two story inn that stands at a fork in the road; to the Northeast is the small village of Haven and the dark and dreary Ashen Swamp, and to the Northwest is the long abandoned road leading to a desolate region known only as &amp;quot;The Darkened Vale&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the edge of of the Solis patrols, The Wayside Inn is a reasonably priced establishment with one of the most well known taverns in the region. The rooms are almost always booked, the lobby is always filled to capacity with merchants and adventurers alike, and the dwarven ale never stops flowing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its claim to fame is the entertainment. Known as the &amp;quot;Ethereal Bard&amp;quot;, a magical device in the lobby creates an illusion of a singing musician that floods the room with uplifting and soothing music. The device can even take requests... For a fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wayside Inn is a focal point in the second act of The Coming Dark, Chapter One: Into the Light, a large scale campaign currently in development by Darklight Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may use this map pack in any way you wish; the above is how the inn currently exists within the module The Coming Dark. What is actually inside the inn, or even what the inn is named, is entirely up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack includes high resolution (200 DPI) images of the first and second floors of The Wayside Inn, both in full color and in &amp;quot;printer friendly&amp;quot; grayscale. Package also includes 50DPI JPEG images - black and white or color, with or without grid lines - for use in applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
