			<description>Taipan! is a turn-based strategy computer game for the Apple II and TRS-80 which was created in 1982. It was created by Art Canfil and the company Mega Micro Computers, and published by Avalanche Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Taipan! was inspired by the novel Tai-Pan by James Clavell. The player is in the role of a trader in the Far East. He owns a ship, and may decide if he wishes to start without any cash but five guns, or with some cash and a debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to accumulate wealth through trade and possibly also through booty won in battles against pirates. As soon as the player's net worth reaches one million (in the game's undefined currency), the player has the option to retire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic strategy of the game is to buy goods (opium, silk, arms, and general cargo) at a low price and sell them at a higher price. The silk, arms, and general cargo have no special features; opium is special in that it can be confiscated at random points by the local authorities, resulting in a fine for the player. This makes dealing in opium riskier than dealing in the other goods; however, it is also in general the most profitable item for trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.com/Taipan%21,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.wikipedia.com/Taipan%21,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
