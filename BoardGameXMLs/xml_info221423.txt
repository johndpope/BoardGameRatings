							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Emperor&#039;s Samurai</name>
									
			<description>The Emperor's Samurai is a tactical/action game set in ancient Japan. Players control 1 of 4 samurai from competing clans, in an attempt to earn honor through retrieval of the Emperor's stolen items and captives. They must enter the Mongol Warlords dungeon, and maneuver the shifting passageways before the entire dungeon caves in! All while surviving encounters from the opposing samurai and a deadly assassin who watches over the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to secure the most honor. Players collect honor by picking up tokens, fighting opposing samurai and entering the vault. When players reach their carry limit, they'll  want to exit out any stairway, thus securing their honor and preventing other players the opportunity to take it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposing samurai can be extremely dangerous but the assassin who watches over the Warlords dungeon can be even more deadly! His movements are quick and unpredictable. Players will be using action cards to evade the assassin, attack opposing samurai, and manipulate the dungeon paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, the Warlord begins caving in the stairways and eventually the vault, thus funneling the players and ramping up the action! The game ends when all carried honor is secured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The samurai with the most honor earns the privilege of becoming a member of The Emperor's Samurai!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
