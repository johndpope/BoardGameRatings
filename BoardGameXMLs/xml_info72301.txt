			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Star League crumbled, General Aleksandr Kerensky led most of the Star League army into the unexplored space, determined to create a new society free of the Inner Sphere's madness. One Clan dared to defy Kerensky's legacy and was wiped out, its name erased from Clan  history. Convinced that remnants of the Not-Named Clan still survived, Clan leaders created a rite to ensure the death of any whose heritage would be traced to these traitors. Clan warriors discovered descendants of the Not-Named Clan during the invasion of the inner sphere. Their law decreed that these survivors must die, and now their children must also die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bloodright has begun...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloodright is a roleplaying adventure for MechWarrior: Second Edition. Set in the BattleTech universe of the year 3053, the adventure is for Clan player characters. The story opens on the battlefield of Tukayid, and sends the characters on a quest across the Inner Sphere that could bring them honor and glory, or disgrace. The adventure includes new Clan archetypes, new OmniMechs, complete statistics for the Broadsword-class DropShip, and a section on roleplaying Clan characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
