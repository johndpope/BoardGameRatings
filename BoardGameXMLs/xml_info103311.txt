							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delicious - Emily&#039;s Taste of Fame</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Delicious &amp;mdash; Emily's Taste of Fame, the titular protagonist and her friend, Francois have a car wreck in a relatively rural region.  Betty, the owner of a nearby diner (that even has a drive-through window) offers them work to scrounge up some cash for a tow.  This puts Emily in charge of the diner &amp;mdash; entirely in charge of the diner &amp;mdash; cooking, cleaning, and serving.  All the while, Francois is very helpful by popping in with distracting tasks that he's quite sure Emily will be able to do, despite her protestations based on how busy the restaurant is.  Follow the plot and characters in this screen-tapping, arcade-style game, as you run, maintain, and repair the diner, with the story every unfolding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
