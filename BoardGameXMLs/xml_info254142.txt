							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robotech: Crisis Point</name>
									
			<description>Robotech: Crisis Point is a strategic game of unit movement and area control in which you take on the role of either the Army of the Southern Cross (AoSC) or the dreaded Robotech Masters. You and your opponent maneuver your units trying to defeat the enemy's forces. Using heroes and distinctive commands at the right time can turn the tide of the battle in your favor. Are you ready to defend Earth as the courageous Army of the Southern Cross or capture the flower of life as the Robotech Masters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, players try to destroy their opponent's units while also successfully defending their own forces. Players take turns tactically deploying units, strategically placing their combat and support units to defend their own forces and destroy those of their enemy, while using their hero and command cards to win the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the players have finished the tactical, token, and command/hero phases, they tally up the victory points for the units and strategic locations successfully defended. They then add the victory points for the enemy units they were able to successfully destroy. The player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
