			<description>Set before SpellForce 2: Faith in Destiny, The Golden Fool remains true to the RPG and RTS genre. Delving deeper into the SpellForce world, the DLC explores the story of the game of stones, Drakkar. &lt;br/&gt;In the second of three DLC&amp;rsquo;s, players can now join in the bitter battle as Carla, one of the non-playable characters from the main game with the aim to win back the legendary &amp;ldquo;Golden Fool&amp;rdquo; stone. The stone, of which only one is in existence, defeats every other stone and ensures the holder will forever be the Drakkar champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each DLC offers players a different twist on the tale through elaborating on the backgrounds of those characters that are non-playable in the main game,&amp;rdquo; said Gennaro Giani, Localization and Production Manager at Nordic Games. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve packed The Golden Fool with challenging puzzles and tricky situations that will flummox even the most experienced of puzzle solvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the Tuscari Desert, the game has a genuine SpellForce feel where the thirst for power is now greater than ever. The Golden Fool is the most precious stone in Amun Kar&amp;rsquo;s game of stones where players must risk everything to regain it along with Carla&amp;rsquo;s reputation as the game of stones champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SpellForce 2: Faith in Destiny was released for PC in June. Joining forces with a group of diverse heroes and a dragon as trustful companions, players fight to gain information about this mysterious new enemy and thereby discover their own true destiny. Players assume the role of a young man who is supposed to release the entire world of Eo from the threat of a new and nameless evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
