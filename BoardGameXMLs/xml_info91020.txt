							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Tear For Jaspree</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PLAGUE OF BARSAIVE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before science, before history, an era of magic existed in our world&amp;rsquo;s dim past. Magic flowed freely, touching every aspect of the lives of men and women of the Name-giver races. It was an age of heroes, an age of fantastical deeds and mythical stories. In this Age of Legend, bold heroes from all across Barsaive band together&amp;mdash;ready to fight for life and freedom against the remaining Horrors and the oppressive Theran Empire, which seeks to bend the rebellious province again to their yoke. Through noble deeds and sacrifice, the heroes of the world forge Barsaive&amp;rsquo;s future, arming themselves for their daunting task with powerful magical spells and treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthdawn is a roleplaying game set in a world of high adventure, high magic, and terrible danger. Shards are a series of unrelated adventures and encounters for the Earthdawn game, intended as an inexpensive resource for Earthdawn gamemasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume contains the adventure A Tear for Jaspree, designed for three to five Novice characters of any Discipline. In this adventure, the characters discover short-sighted greed, confront one of Barsaive's most dangerous predators, and become the instruments of a Passion's wrath. In the process they encounter some unlikely allies, and meet a village with its own story to tell, one in which they get in trouble if they ask too many questions, but could also serve as a safe haven in the future. Requires use of the Earthdawn Player&amp;rsquo;s and Gamemaster&amp;rsquo;s Compendiums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
