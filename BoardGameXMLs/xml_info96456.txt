							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Dozen Unusual Phylacteries</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the SRD tells us, &amp;quot;An integral part of becoming a lich is creating a magic phylactery in which the character stores its life force.&amp;quot; Within the pages of A Dozen Unusual Phylacteries, Philip Reed describes 12 different phylacteries that are more than a simple box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMs can use the phylacteries in this PDF to make any encounter with a lich just a little more memorable. From an unmarked grave to a magical staff, the phylacteries in this PDF include game information, a description of the phylacteries' appearance and location, and the name of the lich that bound its life force to the object/location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF is only for those DMs that enjoy straying from the rigorous path of the past. Those that prefer to stick to a close interpretation of the rules on a liches' phylactery may not find all of the phylacteries described in this PDF useful in their campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
