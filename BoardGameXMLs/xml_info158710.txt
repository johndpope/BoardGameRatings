							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cat Chess</name>
									
			<description>Cat Chess mimics the way in which the neighbourhood cats manoeuvre around each other (see &amp;quot;The Unadulterated Cat&amp;quot; by Terry Pratchett and Gray Jolliffe), using the rules that only the cats seem to know, this is a quick game played in several rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are very easy to learn but deciding where to position your pieces might not be as easy as it might first appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a card (without text) indicating secret goals as to which pieces should be next to each other or in which order. Players take it in turns to place the pieces anywhere on the board that they like (one per space) and then, once they are all on the board, to move (or not move) any piece once that no one has yet activated. Once each piece has been activated then the game ends and players score a point for each goal achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no text making the game accessible to non-readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
