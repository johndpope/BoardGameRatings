			<description>The goal of the game is to score as few points as possible. This is achieved by answering questions about capitals, and by getting rid of ones cards before the opponents do so. There are five series of cards (matching five different colors), and the cards are all numbered from 1 to 6. All cards has a country, a flag, and the country's capital printed on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player starts by playing card #4 in any color. He/she also asks the player to his left if he/she can match the country with its capital. If the player doesn't know the answer, he/she adds as many points as the card shows to his/her score. Play continues with the next player playing either another #4 card, or a #3/#5 card in the color already played. If a player is unable to play a card, he has to draw cards from the deck (up to a maximum of three cards). Game ends when the deck runs out of cards. Players with cards on their hands add up their scores. The scores are adjusted with earned minus points from answering the questions about the capitals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game resembles The Game of Capitals from 1933, but this version adds some more rules, and expands gameplay to include card placement resembling that in &amp;quot;Sevens&amp;quot; (also known as &amp;quot;Ruter Sju&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Laying Out Sevens&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Fan Tan&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Crazy Sevens&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Parliament&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
