							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OPFOR: Zulu 6</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the world of Zulu 6: the world's deadliest covert special missions force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assembled from the ranks of the most elite special forces units from around the world, the 6 warriors of Zulu Team are the guardians of humanity against the evil faction known as S.C.A.R. (Soldiers of Chaos, Anarchy &amp;amp; Rebellion).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six of the world's top ten elite fighting forces are represented among the members of the Team: the Russian Spetsnaz, the French Naval Commandos, Israel's Shayetet 13, the U.S. Army Airborne Rangers, U.S. Marine Special Operations Command and the U.S. Navy SEALs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your side: one player controls Zulu 6 while the other controls S.C.A.R. The objects of the game: During each mission, Zulu 6 must use their elite combat skills to complete 2 mission objectives. S.C.A.R. must stop them with the use of overwhelming forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with the Zulu player choosing 3 of the 6 team members as his/her first assault team while S.C.A.R. player builds the game board by laying out 4 inch map tiles printed with a dirt path cutting through a jungle, placing each tile so that the path is continuous until the line of sight ends in a curve or a 3-way &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;. As the Zulu 6 team moves along the path, the S.C.A.R. player continues to build it. Some of the map tiles contain hazards designed to slow the Zulu 6 team members while others contain mission objectives such as a prison camp, a weapons facility and a downed spy plane. There are also map tiles that contain symbols that allows the S.C.A.R. player to place a number of his troops in that tile to keep Zulu 6 from completing its mission. The S.C.A.R. player also has the ability to spawn more troops to keep the danger moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat between the 2 armies is resolved using 6-sided dice (D6). Each Zulu 6 team member has a stat card that explains his special skill and lists how many attack dice he gets during combat as well as areas to keep track of ammunition spent during combat (10 slots) and wounds taken (3 slots). Each time a Zulu 6 team member attacks, a marker is moved 1 space along his ammo track. The same happens when a team member takes a hit. Every roll of 5 or 6 on a Zulu 6 die roll is a kill. Each S.C.A.R. trooper only gets 1D6 and a roll of 6 on the die is a wound on the target Zulu 6 team member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, Zulu 6 races to achieve mission objectives as S.C.A.R. sends wave after wave of troops at them. All the while, Zulu 6 receives 5 mission points for each objective achieved and for each S.C.A.R. troop killed and may use these points in trade for special actions such as healing a wound, an extra attack die, an ammo drop to reload weapons or even to call in reinforcements if a Zulu team member is lost in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 missions to complete that make up the core game, each with 2 objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With expansions coming soon featuring different mapped environments, daring missions, and new team members, you can take Zulu 6 around the world battling the evil forces of S.C.A.R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
