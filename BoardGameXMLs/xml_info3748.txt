			<description>[from the box]&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Define and Conquer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Needing just one more ring to win, you are contemplating the best tactic to invade that last territory.  Just then a juicy prize happens by &amp;mdash; an opponent's pawn carrying the ring you need.  It's a complex and delicate choice.  At times this rival has seemed capable of besting Webster in a war of words, and an ambush would surely bring retaliation.  On the other hand, your strategically saved Move Card just might help...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Staged on a battlefield of colorful, intertwining paths, Captivation is an engaging contest of word power and shrewd strategies.  Players invade neighboring territories seeking to capture prized rings through a display of vocabulary finesse.  The words will fly and the best laid plans fail on the precarious, fun-filled journey home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Define&lt;br/&gt;With an emphasis on practical but challenging words, the Captivation questions allow players to test, show off, and maybe even improve their vocabularies.&lt;br/&gt;The questions are carefully crafted to be deceptive, thought-provoking, subtly amusing, and, on occasion, outrageously funny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and The Game of Conquer&lt;br/&gt;But this is not strictly a word game.  Even the finest definer must constantly re-evaluate the ever-changing strategic situation.  Plotting the best course, out-maneuvering opponents, deftly utilizing Move Cards, and a little luck are equally important.  The mission is simple, but the path to victory spans a perilous field of shifting fortunes, startling surprises, and captivating fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
