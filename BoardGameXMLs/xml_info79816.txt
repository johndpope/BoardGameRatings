							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">India und Irrgarten</name>
									
			<description>India is one of the oldest boardgames of the world, better known as Pachisi or &amp;quot;Chaupur&amp;quot;. 2 to 4 players from 5 years up throwing a dice and move their three pawns clockwise along the fields on the board to their houses. The first player, whose three pawns arrived at the end fields, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Variations:&lt;br/&gt;Neutral fields: Nobody can capture an other pawn&lt;br/&gt;Chains: If you move one pawn to an other own pawn on one field, nobody can capture this two pawns&lt;br/&gt;Tandem: If you have two pawns on one field, you can move both together as one pawn, but then every other pawn can capture this two pawns as one.&lt;br/&gt;Barricade: Put four black pawns on the four neutral fields on the board. You must arrive these fields with the right number and displace the black pawn to any other field on the board as a barricade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea for the Irrgarten is from Greek mythology. It is a labyrinth like on Kreta, which was build by Daedalus for the King Minos. You start at the outer circle of the labyrinth. Who moved first through all five circles to the center, is the winner. There are 12 neutral black pawns at any point of the labyrinth. You throw a dice and move one of your three pawns forward or backward to the center. You must throw the right number to stop directly on a field of a black pawn. Now you can displace the black one and barricade the way of your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
