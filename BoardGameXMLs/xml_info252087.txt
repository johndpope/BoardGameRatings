			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you can talk to the animals, and they can talk back to you. Does this mean they have anything useful to say?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many systems and settings have means by which characters can speak to animals, but this does not necessarily make the replies they get back from the creatures in question useful, intelligent or even relevant. This provides 100 different responses from our furry and feathered friends that can show just how frustrating speaking to animals might well be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man, yes saw a... squirrel! Squirrel! Get the squirrel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover and one the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
