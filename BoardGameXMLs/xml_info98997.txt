			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using cryogenics to sleep past the fall of civilization or nuclear winter is a common theme in the Post Apocalyptic genre. Such characters could have vast knowledge of ancient ways, technology, and locations of ruins to loot. They may also offer scholars a rare first person glimpse into the culture of the Ancients. They may be worshipped by survivors, or killed for the &amp;quot;crime&amp;quot; of ruining the world, or killed for simply not being strong enough to survive the Post Apocalyptic world. In the game, they could be used as a plot device, someone for the players to try and find, revive, protect, and/or deliver to their home base. They might be fearsome foes, armed with a vast array of high-tech gear. One or more of the players might even by Sleepers. An alternate campaign start might have all players play characters in a Modern setting into which the Fall comes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
