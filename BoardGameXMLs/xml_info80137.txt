			<description>Pok&amp;eacute;mon Box: Ruby and Sapphire, or simply Pok&amp;eacute;mon Box, is a spin-off Pok&amp;eacute;mon game for the Nintendo GameCube console, bundled with a Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable and a Memory Card 59. It was released in Japan on May 30, 2003 and in North America on July 11, 2004, but only through the New York Pok&amp;eacute;mon Center and its online store. It is no longer available in either location. The game was released in some parts of Europe as Pok&amp;eacute;mon Memory Magic due to translation problems, and Europeans only could get the game by using points from Nintendo of Europe's loyalty program, or by buying the Pok&amp;eacute;mon Colosseum Mega Pak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is essentially a storage system for the Game Boy Advance Pok&amp;eacute;mon games that allows players to trade and store Pok&amp;eacute;mon that they have caught in Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, and LeafGreen onto a GameCube memory card. Players can then organize and interact with their Pok&amp;eacute;mon on the GameCube, such as allowing them to mate. Unique Pok&amp;eacute;mon can also be acquired. Another feature allows the games to be played on the television via the GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable. Options such as taking screenshots of the game are available in this mode. Another addition is the &amp;quot;Showcase&amp;quot;, where players can create and display game pieces of Pok&amp;eacute;mon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
