			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE TURKEYS COME HOME TO ROOST!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a maniacal film fan threatens the life of a director notorious for making bad movies, it's up to the brave agents of the Central Legal Investigative Taskforce to stop an atrocity of a non-cinematic kind. But can even Sally the Sleuth survive the wrath of the Turkey Avenger?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turkey Shoot is a ROLF! battle scenario inspired partly by the adventures of Sally the Sleuth as they appeared in the pulp magazine Spicy Detective Stories. It includes ROLF! stats for Sally, her sidekick Peanuts, and the boss Chief Brady... as well as stats for filmmaker Dr. Uwe Boll and the fearsome Turkey Avenger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also featured are a selection of Combat Maneuvers, Traits, and an esay-to-play Battle Scenario. As an additional treat, we've also included are some old time comics by Sally's creeator Adolphe Barreaux. We're sure you'll find them a perfect compliment to the level of quality that ROLF! is famous for! (Dr. Boll is nothing compared to us at NUELOW Games when it comes to making turkeys!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turkey Shoot is compatible with all versions of ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game, including the free ROLF!: Old Skool. If you haven't tried rollplaying before, this is a great opportunity to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
