			<description>From their site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffleboard doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a fair-weather sport. Enjoy it year round from the comfort of your own home or backyard picnic table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In singles - after all pucks are played, constituting a half round, the players proceed to the opposite end of the board and start play, with the color lead changing to blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In doubles - after all pucks are played at head of board, play starts at foot or opposite end - red leading, blue following. Color lead does not change until both ends have played a round. A round consists of completed play at head and foot of board- a half round completed play at one end of board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of play is to place four pucks within, but not touching lines of the highest scoring area. A puck, which stops in the area between farthest foul line and shooting area, is dead, and shall be removed before further play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is scored on 50, 75 100 point basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES &amp;amp; SPECIFICATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Solid 0.75 thick wood frame&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Playsurface is painted and screen printed graphics, using lead-free ink&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Game includes eight roller-bearing pucks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
