							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Knight At The Opera</name>
									
			<description>Horatio D'arven's new play &amp;quot;Jolene and the falcon&amp;quot; breaks women's hearts coast-to-coast. But they are not the only ones with a soft core, because the legendary Holy Order of the Bulky Knights decided to come and see the latest performance, too. And strangely nobody wants to sit next to them and their spiky elbow-guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Knight At The Opera is an abstract game for two to four players, utilizing mechanics like tile placement and area control to simulate the tumultuous processes at the opera house. Players will need to seat male and female audience members next to each other to score points. But perhaps the ladies will fall in love with one of the valiant knights in the end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
