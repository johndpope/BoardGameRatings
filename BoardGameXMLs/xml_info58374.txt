							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chelsea</name>
									
			<description>The London Borough of Chelsea is famous for its expensive houses and top of the range cars, and is home to many rich people. The children of six of these Chelsea residents have reached adulthood and are looking to find partners and set up homes of their own. In order to help their children, their parents start buying houses, vans and cars. However, their children have strong colour preferences, and also like their houses and vehicles to be colour-coordinated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the three to six players takes the role of one family, and aims to be the first to set up all their children for their adult life. This will involve repainting houses, repainting garages, buying and exchanging vans and cars, until your children are happily installed in their new homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chelsea is a simple, yet thought provoking game, which teaches children to plan a strategy and follow it through in order to succeed. Because it only has a small amount of luck, children are rewarded for good play, and thus encouraged to think about what they are doing. But most importantly, because Chelsea is a game which teaches, rather than a teaching aid disguised as a game, children will enjoy it, and play it again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Note] The emphasis on children as the target audience for this game does it a serious a dis-service &amp;amp; kills its appeal to a gamer. This is a fine light filler &amp;amp; suitable for adults to enjoy.[/Note]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
