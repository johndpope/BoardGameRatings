			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broc &amp;amp; Troc is a bafflingly simple game that grabbed us right from our initial tests. The game concept: it's Garage Sale day, and nine objects are getting all the attention. Each player is an avid collector who will try to get the majority in as many object families as possible. At the start of the game, 36 of the 45 Object cards are placed face-up on the table to form a 6 by 6 grid. Each card shows three different types of objects. Each player, on his turn, takes a card which he then places face up in front of himself; this continues until all of the cards have been claimed. At the end of the game, only the players who have sole majority in a family of objects (no ties are allowed) score any points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broc &amp;amp; Troc is a captivating strategy and observation game where good choices have to be made in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2006, Broc &amp;amp; Troc was re-released as Versailles.  The rules of the game remain the same, but the game now includes rules in four languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
