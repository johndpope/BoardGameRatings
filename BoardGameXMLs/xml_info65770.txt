							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Haribo: Die große Gummibärchen-Jagd</name>
									
			<description>Each player has up to four gummy bears of their color. They bring more bears gradually into the game and send them off for the trusted Gummy Bear home trying to run away from the hairy, scary Gummy Bear. This is done by throw of dice. The player throws not only for his own movement but also for the pursuer, the Hairy Gummy Bear. If the Hairy Gummy Bear lands on a field with one of the players' bears, these capured bears are put in the center of the board, he is not freed until another bear is captured.  The player who manages first to bring all of their color gummy bears safely home wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
