							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aristotle&#039;s School</name>
									
			<description>Players are students (Junior Members) of Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s school in Athens Circa 334 - 322 BC.  Players move about the Lyceum (Gymnasium and surrounding grounds) to acquire knowledge in a variety of categories and subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is composed of 27 tiles, called Lyceum Tiles.  The tiles are organised into a circular track in a random order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck. When a card is played, immediately gain its reward and then discard the card.  When the deck runs out the first time shuffle the discard and draw from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a set of action tokens.  There are 7 types of tokens: Material Cause, Efficient Cause, Formal Cause, Final Cause, Potentiality, Actuality and Aristotle.  Actions tokens are used during the game for additional movement, gaining points in various categories, affecting die rolls etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 Categories: Philosophy, Logic, Life Science, Physical Science, Humanities and Arts.  Each Category is further divided into 6 Subjects.  During play points are earned in individual subjects, however for final end of game scoring, it is the total points earned by subjects within a category that count. Every time you gain a point in a Subject, you also get a corresponding Action Token according to the subjects tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn consisting of 3 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Aristotle Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Aristotle starts the Game in Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Library and moves in a clockwise direction 2D6 spaces. &lt;br/&gt;     Whenever he lands on a space containing one or more students, they each get 1 point in one random subject (first roll a random category, then a random subject) &lt;br/&gt;     If he lands in a space containing no students, the top card of the deck is placed onto that tile.  The first student to land there gets that card, as well as the tile&amp;rsquo;s regular offering. &lt;br/&gt;     If you land on Aristotle, you gain 1 Cause Token of any type.  &lt;br/&gt;     If on your move you pass over Aristotle you gain 1 Aristotle Token. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Move your Pawn forward (clockwise around the track) one or two spaces OR you may move forward 1D10 spaces. &lt;br/&gt;     You may spend an Action Token to alter your movement. &lt;br/&gt;     When you land on 1 or more opponents pawns, you may steal 1 Token from any one of them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Learning &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Follow the instructions on the tile you have just moved to.  This will usually earn you 1 card or some Action Tokens or 1 point in one specific Subject or a choice on a list, or a roll on a table. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scores are tracked using paper and pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when players have gone through the deck twice.  &lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score in the most categories is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
