			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Race to space from your own backyard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete with neighborhood kids to build the coolest rockets and launch your entire squad before the others. Watch out for Dad, big brother Jack, and your dog Ace, who'll totally wreck your plans. Mom is always there to help, if you kids would just behave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rocket Squad is a card game for 2 to 6 players where you will lay down rocket boosters, build up rockets one box after another, and use your family to mess up your friends&amp;rsquo; plans. The first player to launch one rocket of each squad will end the game, but the player that has launched the most impressive rockets will score the most points and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle all the cards and deal 4 to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Your Turn&lt;br/&gt;You may play as many cards as you like to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Place a Booster on an empty Launchpad&lt;br/&gt;     Place a Fuselage bit on top of a Rocket&lt;br/&gt;     Use a Family Member to disrupt the game&lt;br/&gt;     Discard or keep cards in hand and redraw back to 4 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End &amp;amp; Scoring&lt;br/&gt;The first player to launch a Rocket of each color triggers the game end, with each other player getting one more turn.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest total of launched Rockets is the winner (tallest Rocket breaks ties).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
