							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strange Conversations</name>
									
			<description>Strange Conversations is a humorous social game for 3 to 7 players that tests players' abilities to convey hints about their secret identities to one another throughout the course of a simple role-played sit-down conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each game players find themselves in an interesting hypothetical setting and scenario having a conversation with a group of people with strange and often funny personality quirks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each round, each player is assigned a secret JOB and a secret character QUIRK.   For example, a player may be an olympic athlete (job) whose hands keep getting stuck to the table (quirk).   Or, a doctor (job) who offers other players back-handed compliments (quirk).  Or, a dancing instructor (job) who is hitting on other players (quirk).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With inspiration from a random scenario, players role-play a discussion and provide clues to each other about what their two qualities (job/quirk) are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no &amp;quot;turns&amp;quot; in this game.  Conversations are free-flowing discussions where players may ask and answer questions whenever appropriate.  Players drop creative hints about their identities through the use of verbal hints, including puns and keywords related to their jobs, hints to aspects of their jobs, and cultural references.  Players may also use physical gestures to help convey their identities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn the most points if they can signal what their jobs and quirks are to some -- but not all -- other players, and also earn points for guessing who other players are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
