			<description>At the beginning of the game, each opponent rolls the general/captain and places him in the captain&amp;rsquo;s area(Three circles). Then place the tie breaker die(clear with a small blue die inside it) in the tiebreaker area(5 circles) To start out each player rolls 2 of their dice and places them in the first row. Then the player can choose to either keep his/her row and try his/her luck or they can lower a die&amp;rsquo;s number by one and roll another die. The objective is to have a higher sum for each row than your opponent. The max capacity for each row is five die. At the end of the turn both players add up the die and the larger number is subtracted from the lower number. Next the Difference is taken away from the losing army. If a tie is to occur then the clear die with a blue die in it is rolled by each player and the sum of the two die is added to each player&amp;rsquo;s side based on the roll. Keep doing this until there is no tie. If you have a one in your row at the end of a turn change the one to a six before you add up. If you end up calculating before changing the one to a six the one stays a one for the remainder of the game. If you lose then you can roll the 20 sided die and re roll the captain. Place the same number of added die to your side of the military and try to beat your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to remember: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If you roll a one with your general, it stays a one&lt;br/&gt;     Lower each die one at a time&lt;br/&gt;     The game stops after you completely lose all of your die and roll the failure die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
