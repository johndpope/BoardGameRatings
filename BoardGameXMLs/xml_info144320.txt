			<description>Hand in Hand is a deck of 60 cards, each with two different brightly coloured halves that depict one half of a child that needs your help to be made whole. Similar to a deck of playing cards, there&amp;rsquo;s no limit to how many ways you can play with these cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the base game is suitable for 2-6 players aged 6+ and can be played in 15-20 minutes. By matching colours, players create a chain of children holding hands that can be &amp;ldquo;taken home&amp;rdquo; to score points. This is a great family game that offers positive, encouraging turns leaving everyone feeling like they&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to something good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
