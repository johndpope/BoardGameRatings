			<description>Medal of Honor (formerly known as Medal of Honor: Operation Anaconda) is a first-person shooter video game and remake to the original Medal of Honor. Developed by Danger Close, a team within the EA Los Angeles studio, and DICE, it is the twelfth installment in the Medal of Honor series and was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 12, 2010. The game is a reboot of the series, taking place during the ongoing war in Afghanistan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medal of Honor's single-player campaign uses heavily modified Unreal Engine 3 while multiplayer uses the Frostbite Engine. The game uses dedicated servers for PC and consoles. However, the server files have not been made public and are only available for use through specific Game Server Providers. It is the first game in the Medal of Honor franchise to receive an M rating from the ESRB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is designed to be authentic, as EA had hired several consultants from the United States military in order to give inspiration to the developers. Typical in-game objectives are similar to those issued in real life such as raiding terrorist hideouts, hostage rescues and undercover operations. The game is loosely based on parts of Operation Anaconda; specifically, the events surrounding the Battle of Roberts Ridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Medal of Honor (2010 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
