			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Labyrinth Lord/Mutant Future Free AD&amp;amp;D retro-clone. On 2 April 2015, gunmen stormed the Garissa University College in Garissa, Kenya, killing at least 147 people, and injuring 79 or more. The militant group Al-Shabaab, which the gunmen claimed to be from, took responsibility for the attack. The gunmen took several students hostage, freeing Muslims but holding Christians. The siege ended the same day after four gunmen were killed. The attack was the deadliest in Kenya since the 1998 United States embassy bombings. It had more casualties than the 2013 Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya. Garissa, around 200km from the Somalian border, was previously considered as &amp;quot;one of the safest spots in the region&amp;quot;, and housed both military barracks and police headquarters. Since Islamic Courts Union were routed by Ethiopian-led forces, Al-Shabaab has been in conflict with Kenyan-led AMISOM troops. Uganda has also faced Al-Shabaab attacks. Now with sample contemporary military characters and super hero mutant characters for Mutant Future as response teams ... Can you stop the impending anarchy and save the day ?!?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
