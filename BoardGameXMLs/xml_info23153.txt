							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder at the Six-Shooter Saloon!</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1877, the place, Toothless Turkey, Texas&amp;hellip;.and MURDER  is the name of the game.  We find ourselves back to the days of the &amp;quot;Old West&amp;quot; when a man or woman's best friend hung around the waist in a holster and the fastest draw became the law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what happened?  The usual crowd has gathered at the &amp;quot;Six-Shooter&amp;quot; for a night of song, dance and fun.  The weekly poker game is in progress and the honky tonk piano is in full swing. Boots are tapping as the gang is ready to kick up their heels for a wild and crazy square dance&amp;hellip;.when suddenly MURDER is discovered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems that the body of Miss Sara Leah (would be baker, also known as &amp;quot;The Cheesecake Queen&amp;quot;) was found lying dead in an upstairs room. Alas, the dear, sweet, girl was discovered with a rope around her neck&amp;hellip;.along with a tray of chocolate chip cookies at her side.  Sara had planned to open a bakery in Toothless Turkey, but unfortunately someone pulled the plug on her life-long dream&amp;hellip;.and her oven (which by the way, had a bun in it&amp;hellip;.and we're not talking cinnamon).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come join the suspicious looking hombres found around the saloon&amp;hellip;.Wild Bill Hiccup, Louigi Testosteroni, Annie-Orexia Oakly, No-Way Jose, The Virgin Bride and a host of others.  So saddle up and take a trip to the gun slinging old west to find Miss Sara's killer...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
