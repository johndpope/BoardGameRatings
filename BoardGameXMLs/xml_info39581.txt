							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Citizen X</name>
									
			<description>Citizen X takes place at the beginning of the 20th century in a small city east of the Urals.&lt;br/&gt;Due to an avalanche all citizens were separated from civilization.&lt;br/&gt;To make matters worse a horrible vision came true. Zombies attacking during the night  reduce the number of decent citizens.&lt;br/&gt;Does the attorney solve this mystery? Time works against the citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of the moderator is played by a DVD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;- Rules&lt;br/&gt;- DVD&lt;br/&gt;- 32 cards (16 characters, 16 weapons)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game each player starts with a character and a weapon.&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Werewolves game roles are called, but not by a game master, by the DVD.&lt;br/&gt;During night all characters have their eyes closed. Due to this players learn information about each other. Zombies try to overwhelm other characters.&lt;br/&gt;After this the day phase starts. The large group separates into groups of two that can exchange info with trustworthy people. Clever negotiation is important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
