			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a game in which you play fantasy adventurers at a speed-dating style dungeon-delving party hookup event. Everyone is looking to form up with a party to go adventuring, ransacking some old ruins, storming a wizard's tower, rooting out a goblin encampment, what have you. Going out to kill monsters and take their stuff, basically. You can't do that kind of thing alone, of course, and hanging out at Ye Olde Tavern has become a drag, so here you are. First Impressions is ideally played with an even number of players, but if you have an odd number, one player will just be sitting out for a couple of minutes before jumping back into the rotation. All you need to play are a timer, some paper and writing implements, and a bunch of counters or tokens, like pennies or glass beads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Following the speed-dating interviews, players give tokens to their favourite choices. The character with the most tokens becomes the party leader and selects the party of adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;A Super Exciting Bonus Throw-Down Alternate Ending! gives a mechanism for quick partner matching for a surprise combat. In the ensuing m&amp;ecirc;l&amp;eacute;e, the character in each partnership with the least tokens dies. If the partners have the same number of tokens, they are then considered to be an individual unit from that point on.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in repeated rounds until there is only one character / unit left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
