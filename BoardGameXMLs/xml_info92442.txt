			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &amp;ndash; Into the Inferno is an action adventure title for the DS. The game is based on the third season of the television series by the same name. Players control Aang and his allies as they attempt to stop the Fire Lord from taking over the Earth Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controls are almost entirely stylus-dependent. Movement is done by pointing at the destination, and attacking is performed by tapping the screen. There are many puzzles that require both on-screen players to complete. Each character has unique abilities related to either bending elements or physical prowess. There are two types of enemies that will attack the team &amp;ndash; melee and ranged fighters. Players can also participate in a network multiplayer volleyball mini-game. Up to four players can compete at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
