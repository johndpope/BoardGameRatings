							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silent Stalker</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A raised corpse augmented with powerful necromantic magics, the Silent Stalker is one of the most feared of the undead. Gifted with unnatural strength and stealth its pummels its foes to ground with its fists and then stomps them to death with its feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What truly makes it deadly, however, is its ability to regenerate. Once incapacitated, wounds quickly mend so it can rise and kill again. It&amp;rsquo;s also immune to many of the traditional defenses used to ward off the undead. Spells like &amp;ldquo;Turn Undead&amp;rdquo; have no effect on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Favored by wizards and sorcerers as a sentry, the only way to permanently defeat a Silent Stalker is to find and destroy the totem item made during its creation. As long as its totem is intact, nothing -neither sword or reason- will stop the Silent Stalker from carrying out its creator&amp;rsquo;s commands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
