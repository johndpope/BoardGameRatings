			<description>Hockey was a subtheme of LEGO Sports introduced in 2003. Hockey is unique from the others in the LEGO Sports family because several of the sets did not include actual Minifigures, instead hockey players are built out of TECHNIC pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LEGO Hockey is a dexterity game for two players played by moving around hockey players attached to wands and knocking the LEGO puck around until somebody scores a goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
