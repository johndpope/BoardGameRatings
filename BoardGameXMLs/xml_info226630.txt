			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strength Through Unity.  That's the motto of the Hub Federation Defence Force Militias.  Banded together after the collapse of the Conduit back to Earth Sector, the planetary defense forces of the six worlds of the Hub Federation have united to fight the fear and chaos they see as rampant in Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Space, Air and Land.  That's the motto of the Hub Federation Marines.

The book gives Referees and players details concerning the force's organization and history as well as its foundation built on the long traditions of the militaries which preceded it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hub Federation Ground Forces also provides full character career progressions through seven career tracks usable with almost any 2d6 science fiction role-playing game.  Chart your character's course and take your character through a full armed forces career!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hub Federation Ground Forces also includes information on all of the forces' equipment.  Everything from the full deckplans of the Shadowstrike-class assault carrier to the sidearms and melee weapons preferred by the troops.  The book also includes seven vehicles designed using the new Cepheus Engine Vehicle Design System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes?  Join the Hub Federation Ground Forces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
