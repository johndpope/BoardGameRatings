							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wico Command Control Bat Handle Joystick</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wico Bathandle, together with the Wico Redball, were widely used joystick controllers during the 80s era of gaming. They were both soft-response digital controllers with one button, but selectable if it should be the stick base button or the one on top of the handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the time, they were slightly more expensive than the commonly used TAC-2 and its siblings, and was therefore regarded as a luxury item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
