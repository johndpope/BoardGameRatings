							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zoodyssey</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Zoodyssey is the only family board game that combines the fun and excitement of going to the zoo with scientific understanding of some of the world's most endangered animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes about 55 minutes.  Players move along the paths of the zoo and collect Animal Snapshot cards.  Each card has a picture of a zoo animal, some Fun Facts about that animal, and a point value.  The more endangered the animal, the higher the point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player with 50 points worth of Snapshot cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course it's never as easy as it sounds.  A rhino may stop you.  A toucan may steal one of your photos.  Or you may run out of film.  But nothing will stop you in your quest to add snapshots to your collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the process, of course, you will come to a greater understanding of some of he magnificent creatures that share our planet.  And when it is over, you'll want to set-up and play again.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
