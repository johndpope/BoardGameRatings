			<description>Set Up:&lt;br/&gt;Place the a ring on a flat surface and put a column in each of the recesses. When each recess is occupied place another ring on top and fill in the same way. Alternate the column colours as you complete each ring. Repeat this process until all the columns have been used, you will be left with 4 spare rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;- The youngest player starts the game, play then continues in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;- On each go, players throw the coloured die. They then have to remove a column with the same colour as the die, from any ring except the top.&lt;br/&gt;- All removed columns are replaced on the top ring of the tower, when all the recesses to the top ring are full a new ring is added.&lt;br/&gt;- If the topples during a player's turn they are eliminated from the game, the tower is rebuilt and play continues with the remaining players.&lt;br/&gt;- The winner of the game is the last player in play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the last player to skilfully remove the columns from the lower levels of the tower to the top, without making the tower topple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt;11 rings, 60 columns, game die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
