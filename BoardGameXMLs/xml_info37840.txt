			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2-4+ players. Players are Truck Drivers. Set in the USA in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s. Heavy on CB Lingo. Players try to complete routes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck of cards with four suits: Rig, City, Haulin, and Smokey. Each card is marked with a number from 1 to 6, which affect how cards can be combined into melds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a meld is played, another player may disrupt it with a Smokey card. If the meld is not disrupted, the player who played it marks off one route as completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Winning: The first player to complete 5 Routes is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
