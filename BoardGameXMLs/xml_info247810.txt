Number of Players: 3-8. Play time: 10-45 minutes. MADE IN USA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Redonkulary&amp;reg; is Easy to Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player goes first as the &amp;ldquo;Donkster&amp;rdquo; (judge) and invents a word by combining one word part from each of the three randomly chosen cards. The other players then create &amp;ldquo;definitions&amp;rdquo; for the made-up word and try to convince the Donkster to pick theirs. The player who persuades the Donkster to choose their definition earns a point. The player with the most points after everyone has had a turn as the Donkster wins!
