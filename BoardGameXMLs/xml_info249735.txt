			<description>Your goal in Solo is to rid yourself of cards as quickly as you can. Most cards show a color and a number, and on your turn you need to play a card that matches the color or number on the card currently on top of the discard pile &amp;mdash; but many action cards await in the deck that change what you can do! You can force the next player to skip a turn or draw two cards instead of playing; you can reverse the direction of play, choose a color that the next player must play, or force everyone to give their hand of cards to a neighbor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solo Sonderedition is a 25th anniversary edition of Solo that contains two new action cards: &amp;quot;Gift&amp;quot;, which allows the player to give someone else two cards, and &amp;quot;Protection&amp;quot;, which prevents the player from suffering whatever negative effects might be directed their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
