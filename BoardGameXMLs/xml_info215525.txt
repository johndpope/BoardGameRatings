			<description>Fairy Rade is a card game for 2 to 4 players. Each player is the leader of a Fairy Parade, trying to trick unwary humans into becoming part of their procession. Play continues in a series of rounds, until one player has tricked enough mortals to be declared the new Fairy King or Queen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a series of rounds, players take turns leading a trick by playing one of the cards from their hand, and other players must play a card of the same suit if they have one. The highest ranking card played wins the trick, but there are surprises in the form of Royal Favor and Escape cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
