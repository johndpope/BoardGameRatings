							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Items to Find in an Occultist&#039;s Chambers</name>
									
			<description>This is a list of 100 different occult-related that players might find in rooms belonging to an occultist. The items are suitable for most settings where such may be encountered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items cover various different types. There is a distinct edge towards modern paganism and Wicca practices, as these most commonly use items, but there are some from other traditions too. These are all genuine types of occult and pagan items. Whether or not the items listed have any in-game value other than decorative is up to the GameMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each entry has the item, and may have additional details on them too, which can result in many more items than the 100 listed. They can be used as decorative items should the players be rummaging through the possessions of a suitable NPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. Bags (Drawstring bags, different materials, velvet, leather, cotton, silk, satin or plastic)&lt;br/&gt;10. Bath Supplies (Ritual bathing and cleansing salts, oils, soaps and lotions)&lt;br/&gt;11. Bell (Small, hand held)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
