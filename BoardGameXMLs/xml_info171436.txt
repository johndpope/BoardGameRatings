			<description>To Reign Supreme is a 2 player area control war game that uses 18 cards.  Each player battles to conquer 6 contested Territories, using the abilities of the territories to build their military and increase their wealth.  Battles are conducted via a card based mechanic that limits chance and increases decision based strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 5 Military Strategy cards and can choose 3 to use throughout the game.  Each player starts with the same 5 Military Strategy cards, differing only in card color, and must choose the three that best match their intended strategy.  The other two cards and the 2 Rules cards are used to track Wealth, Military, and Battle specific stats for their country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
