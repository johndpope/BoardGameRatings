							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Learning Curve: Apprentice-Level Characters</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems like forever that you wanted to become an adventurer. You've been practicing with your hand-me-down sword and you've made darned sure that your friends have practiced their spells, prayers, and lockpicking. WIth everyone's parents at the winter gala, it's the perfect time to strike out as a team and right some wrongs in the city. With a little luck, you can do it. But never, ever, let dad find out and drag you home early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning Curve allows players to adventure the way they should at beginner level--the hard way! With the rules in this pdf, you can now multiclass at 1st level in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or, if you choose, start your adventuring career as a half-level PC. There's also a brief discussion on how and why a GM might want to use these rules in his campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
