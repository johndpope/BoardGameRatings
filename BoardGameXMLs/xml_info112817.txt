			<description>Super Dany is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game that was released in 1998 to an exclusively European market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, this video game is a 2D platform game where the player controls a boy named Danny. He has to navigate through a medieval castle in order to defeat the villains. Eventually, he enters a television station where the final stages of the game take place. The player can be hit three times before dying. This game is very basic with a score being displayed but no time limit in place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Dany&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
