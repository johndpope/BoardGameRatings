							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Ruins</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ruined gatehouse, one tower largely intact, the other fallen down. A pair of stone doors leads into a dungeon, which use to be the front of a mine; the mines themselves still exist, but the way to them is blocked by a cave-in that would take days to clear: the silver ore within is mostly spent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time the wall besides the doors has crumbled, allowing things to slip in with ease. The doors themselves are bolted on the inside by a large, rusted, iron rod that has rusted in place. The doors inside are all old wood, stuck for the most part and not locked unless otherwise noted; also, there is no light inside, unless noted. And the air is stale, the walls damp and marred with black mold and the rich smell of the earth permeates the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
