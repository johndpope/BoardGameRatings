			<description>Magikon is a simple Role Playing Game published in Italian + French only by International Team in 1984. &lt;br/&gt;The guide to encounters includes 22 different kind of people with illustrations made by Mauro Moretti.&lt;br/&gt;The background: Every 1000 years, the shadow master organizes a competition between magician-knights to chose who will succeed to him as governor of the Magikon castle and the surrounding region.&lt;br/&gt;The players will explore the roads around the castle to find monsters, traps and villages. Every player has the same kind of background, so the team working is not necessary and usually, each player explores different areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
