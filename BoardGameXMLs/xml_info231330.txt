			<description>Fleet Commander: Pirates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Among the thousands of stars colonized by humanity, some of them are not under the empire's domination. Coalitions of &amp;ldquo;free worlds&amp;rdquo; try to defend their independence while systems away from dense clusters of civilization may be the secret home of groups living by violence and plundering. Call them pirates, rebels, or insurgents depending on your current alignment. Sometimes, one among them, a charismatic leader, manages to raise a fleet under his banner and runs the gauntlet of the established powers. Are you one of these leaders?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their fleets are composed of an eclectic variety of warships, captured from their enemies and sometimes customized to fit the condition of a guerrilla warfare. However, experienced Fleet Commanders have learned not to underestimate their capacities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Pirates mini-expansion, choose one of these charismatic commanders, build your fleet according to specific rules, explore new capacities like &amp;ldquo;stealth&amp;rdquo; and challenge the domination of the &amp;quot;Hegemony of Amycles&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;League of Phoebe&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
