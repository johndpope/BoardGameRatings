			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quick &amp;quot;jump out in time&amp;quot; card game for 3&amp;ndash;4 players. Cards representing gentlemen thieves are wandering around the table, and players take turns either playing a new treasure on their thief, or bailing out and taking what they have. As cards can be played either face up and face down, jumping out in time is crucial. The last player gets everything that's left, which normally is good but can be devastating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
