			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to shake up the status quo in your Supers20 game?&lt;br/&gt;Your players will never forget the time that you smashed the entire North American continent and left it for them to pick the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sixth Seal is a serialized adventure path for Supers20 - in which the United States is devastated by a massive nation wide earthquake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs must deal with the crisis - and with the chaos and anarchy that it unleashes. As civilization crumbles in the aftermath of the quake - the PCs hold the line against the criminals, gangsters and supervillains who are fighting for power amid the wreckage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sixth Seal was inspired by the mind-blowing Cataclysm and No-Man's Land events that ran through DC Comics Batman family of books in the late 90s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sixth Seal is an adventure path consisting of 4 complete Supers20 adventures with over a dozen fully stated out NPCs ready for your use in your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
