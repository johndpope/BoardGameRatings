			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cyclon:  High-speed cycle racing on the ever-changing plasti-tracks of the Cyclon. It's high-speed thrills and danger in the deadly motorcycle racetracks of the future. Racers may live the high life, but it can all evaporate in an instant in a burst of fire and smoke. The fire and smoke of a deadly wreck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this series of Adventures, two of the Players will be playing &amp;ldquo;story characters.&amp;rdquo; Each story character has a single rule that must be obeyed during character generation. One of the Players will be the Kid. The only thing the Kid character must be is young. And a second Player will be the Parent's old racing Partner. The only thing the Partner must be is on the same team as the Kid. Other than that, the Players have full control over who these characters are, from name to sex to chosen skills. Also, the Kid has a few added benefits in return for having the character's age dictated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Parent of the Kid is a famed Cyclon racer. One day, though, the Parent dies on the track in a ball of flames. The only things most dead racers leave to their family are debts and the lease on the racing seat that they rented from the racing company that controls their cycle. In that situation, most families sell the racing seat back to the sponsor company, using the proceeds to pay off the debts, and then live of the remainder. But, this family decides to hold onto the seat until the Kid comes of age and can race in the Parent's place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shammy Spark: The Kid's Parent was a famed Cyclon racer, but died on the track in a ball of flames. The Kid has come of age and now races the Parent's old racing seat. But Cyclon racing is an expensive proposition, especially for newcomers like the Kid. Somehow, the Kid is going to have to contrive to scrape together the funds necessary to keep racing, renegotiate a contract with hostile sponsors, and fend off a bunch of racers who would rather see the Kid fail. ...That Kid had better be clever. Or else exceedingly lucky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
