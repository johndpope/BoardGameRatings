			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Summary and Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have accomplished their immediate goal of tracking down the group responsible for a series of murders in Coryan, and have also found the proof necessary to free their patron, Senator Tensen-Balin, from his wrongful imprisonment. However, they are also aware that Elandr&amp;eacute; val'Assant&amp;eacute; is likely to be the cult's next victim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While attempting to save Elandr&amp;eacute;, the PCs are drawn ever more tightly into a mighty web of intrigue among the most powerful people on Onara. Before the day is done, they will be responsible for recovering one of the most sacred artifacts of the Mother Church, and will witness events which will throw the Empire into turmoil and literally reshape the world of Onara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
