							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King&#039;s Highway</name>
									
			<description>In order to improve trade, quality of life, and his militia&amp;rsquo;s ability to quickly respond to threats, the king has commissioned you and your team to complete highways between the towns and villages throughout his Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The king&amp;rsquo;s highway will be constructed with dice having highway segments on their faces. Players work from a communal pool of dice and take turns placing sections of the road to earn prestige. Of course, whoever completes the highway earns a boost of prestige. Be careful, though, completing the highway before all of its paths are finished will cause you to lose points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the king is too busy to pay attention to who did the actual work, whoever has the most prestige at the end of the project is given the credit, the glory, and the money!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
