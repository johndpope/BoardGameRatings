							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadowrun: Crossfire – Demo Box</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shadowrun: Crossfire - Demo Box is a trial version of the game that's perfect for learning the rules. We carefully picked out a subset of the full game that shows off Crossfire's feel and mechanisms in a small, elegant package. The demo box takes you through a shorter, tighter version of the &amp;quot;Caught in the Crossfire&amp;quot; mission included in the full game &amp;mdash; it's the quickest way for new players to learn how to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalyst Game Labs is giving the Shadowrun: Crossfire - Demo Box to select gamers at Gen Con 2013 in mid-August.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shadows of the Sixth World have every kind of danger you can imagine: ultra-violent gangers, flesh-eating ghouls, mages that summon spirits from toxic waste, backstabbing corporate raiders, hard-nosed police officers, and even dragons. You don't have much &amp;mdash; mainly your guts, your wits, and your friends &amp;mdash; but maybe that's enough. Between you and your teammates, you can sling spells, hack the Matrix, talk a tiger out of his stripes, and bring down a charging ork from a hundred yards away. Will that be enough to face down the worst the mean streets can throw at you? You're about to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowrun: Crossfire is a cooperative deck-building card game for two to four players set in the gritty, cyberpunk fantasy world of Shadowrun. Play a shadowrunner team and take on tough jobs such as protecting a client who's marked for death, shooting your way out of downtown when a run goes sour, or facing down a dragon. In each game you'll improve your deck with a mix of strategies, while earning Karma to give your character cyber upgrades, physical augmentations, magical initiations, weapons training and Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowrun: Crossfire - Demo Box includes two obstacle decks, a black market deck, a crossfire event deck, a mission sheet, 4 role cards, and 2 product information cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differences from Shadowrun: Crossfire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The crossfire card deck &amp;amp; obstacle decks are smaller than the full game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Demo box contains only 1 scenario (so the only way to play this version) and it is not included in the main Shadowrun: Crossfire game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- There are only four character cards (1 of which is the troll mage card which is not found in the base set, but was reprinted in Character Expansion Pack 1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Demo box does not contain any tokens, and requires the players to use something of their own (coins etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The rulebook is shorter and does not contain all the rules listed in the base game, but contains information specific to the Demo box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
