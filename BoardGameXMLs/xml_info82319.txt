			<description>In LIT, a teenager named Jake must make his way through his high school, which is overrun by shadowy creatures, to save his girlfriend Rachael, who keeps in touch with him through the school's internal phone system. The game also features unlockable content, including a much harder time-based challenge mode called &amp;quot;Dark Mode&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played from either a top down or a third-person perspective, the game sees players controlling Jake with the Nunchuk as they aim an on-screen reticule with the Wii Remote. The reticule helps aim Jake's flashlight and is the player's point of focus. The Wii Remote's motion controls are also used, with a throwing motion used to throw objects, and players shaking the Remote to recharge Jake's flashlight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the flashlight in addition to other sources of illumination such as lamps, flares, televisions and broken windows, Jake must carve paths of light through the darkness to safely reach the exit in each room. Along with being used in combat against the monsters that roam the hallways, this manipulation of light will also play a big part in solving certain puzzles along the way. However, Jake must be careful in managing his sources of light, as some sources of illumination work on a timer, while having too many electrical appliances turned on will blow a fuse, plunging the level into darkness and resulting in Jake being pulled into the shadows by the creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;LIT (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
