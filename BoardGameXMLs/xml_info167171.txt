							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Town of Salem</name>
									
			<description>Town of Salem is a browser-based game that challenges players on their ability to convincingly lie as well as detect when other players are lying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
