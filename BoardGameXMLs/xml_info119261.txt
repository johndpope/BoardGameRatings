			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forged by Envy - Tempered by Malice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illfrost: Quick Start Guide is a supplement designed to allow the DM to jump right into the game world of Illfrost with resources to give you the information you need to start your campaign with minimal preparation.  You will find enough resources here to give your players the information they need to create their characters and backgrounds with confidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illfrost is a gritty, hard edged Adventure Path which embodies the classic struggle between good and ill.  The setting takes place on the frozen continent of Lannithir, in the world of Olam, approximately one century after the fall of western civilization.  This campaign makes use of the game mechanics found in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 4th Edition, and is designed to take your players from 1st to 30th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Illfrost campaign setting is a vast world whose frozen reaches will truly test your players as they face new monsters, struggle to survive in an unforgiving climate, and face a dread so malevolent that it will leave them shivering in their fur-lined boots and eagerly coming back for more... if they survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge your players.  Challenge your game.  Challenge yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
