							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Charlatan</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Charlatan is the ultimate con man, able to step into myriad situations and pull a fast one over everyone from the average Joe to city guards, nobles, and, on a daring day, even some archmages. Some even have just enough magic in their bag of tricks to utter a bit of arcane mumbo jumbo to back up their words with a bit of razzle-dazzle. With some clever roleplaying, the Charlatan can impersonate a Magic-User, Cleric, or other magical class and get away with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anything is possible with the right amount of spin, a costume change, or a touch of magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But a word of caution. This class is built around the idea of talking your way out of a situation, not fighting your way out, so make sure you keep your wits about you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Charlatan is the next new class for Mazes &amp;amp; Perils &amp;ndash; a cross between a con man and a minor wizard who can get the job done or anger a crowd and escape with his life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 9-page supplement (4 pages of content) offers a fully formed class you can play as a PC or NPC in a Mazes &amp;amp; Perils campaign &amp;ndash; complete with new abilities to get in and out of trouble in a hurry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
