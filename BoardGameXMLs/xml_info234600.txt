			<description>Start your own zoo in 'My Zoo', a board game for the whole family! Each player has a zoo and needs to take care of placing an animal in its natural habitat. To get animals for your zoo you have to exchange animal cards in your hand to the market, based on the supply and demand. Players will have to fill their five enclosures with animals this way. Who will be the first to place a rare five star animal in the zoo and win the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a zoo with five enclosures of which there are different habitats avaible. The players need to place animals out of their collection into their natural habitat, but in order to do so they have to exchange other animals cards in their possession to the market. This way the players have to fill their five enclosures with animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The animals also have a special action when placed in a enclosure or brought to the market, which the player can use to sabotage other players. A player who places a rare five star animal into its zoo wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
