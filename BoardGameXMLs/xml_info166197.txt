			<description>Plotypus is a collaborative storytelling card game; it enables any group to tell an epic story with a riveting plot. Players draw setting and character cards for inspiration and narrate the story through eight pivotal chapters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Story phase, players advance the plot a few sentences before rotating narrator. The Storybook cards help focus the plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the hero is stuck in their normal routine. As the story continues, the players explore the hero's adventure and clash with the villain. The game ends when players have completed the storybook deck and described the hero in their new routine, having triumphed over their antagonist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
