			<description>Fire at Will! is a real-time card game. Two players take on the role of airship captains in a fictional civil war era steampunk universe. Players play cards from 6 randomized command decks and play them into action piles in order to score successful shots against their opponent. While speed is important, accuracy is vital - one wrong play could cause your cannon to blow up during the Scoring Phase!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire at Will! features both beginner &amp;amp; advanced modes - allowing new players to learn the patterns of the game gradually. Intermediate mode introduces Battleflag cards, which can be played to mess with your opponent and provide additional scoring opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Master Gunner cards add an additional layer to the game once you're ready. This set of 4 cards for each faction provide fun ways to mess with your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
