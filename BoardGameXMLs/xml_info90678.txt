			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 3 is the third release in Namco&amp;rsquo;s motocycle arcade-sim series. It is based on the 2002 Grand Prix season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the base features from the same remain unchanged in MotoGP 3. The number of licensed tracks has been increased to 15, and there are 41 motocycles to choose from. Players can choose from the same three game modes: Season Mode, Time Trial, and Arcade Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New play options include Legends Mode and Challenge Mode. Legends Mode pits the player against some of the tournament&amp;rsquo;s best racers in history, while Challenge Mode is a range of 100 difficult time trials and races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Namco has added a larger range of control options to the bikes, giving players more control over their ride specifications. These options include separate control of the front and rear brakes, manual transmission, and weight placement. Players can compete in 4 player races with friends using a multitap adaptor, or 2 player competitions without.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
