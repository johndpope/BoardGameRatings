			<description>A Checkers variant for 2, 3, or 4 players.  The game is played on a 14 x 14 grid of red and black squares, but with four squares in each corner taken out.  The central 10 x 10 grid is the field of play and is marked by a thin white &amp;quot;Haven line.&amp;quot;  Player pieces are in four colors and begin in the four sections outside of the Haven line, called &amp;quot;King's Havens,&amp;quot; on the black squares printed with checkers pieces.  (Each player has 10 pieces.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are essentially the same as English draughts, but for the complication of having four players.  Once players move their pieces into the field of play, they may not move back over the Haven line at any point on the board.  Promotion is achieved at the furthest row in the field of play from each player.  Rules are also provided for partnership play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central 8 x 8 square section of the board is highlighted so that it may be used for a standard game of Checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
