			<description>The active player reads out a question and three possible answers, then secretly decides which answer best fits him/herself. The other players then have to guess which answer the active player chose, plus they decide how sure they are about the result (by picking a chip with one or two hearts). Everyone who guessed correctly moves forward (on the heart-shaped game board) the corresponding number of fields (one or two), for a wrong answer they go back the same number. The first player who circles the board is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All questions of this Ego expansion are love-related. The game can be played with or without the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrates with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     ego&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
