			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day, your friends here at Healing Fireball Publications are proud to give you the latest rant from Ebenezer Killjoy with The Sages Must Be Crazy: Weapons of Annoyance. This treatise targets the most annoying of all the tricksters - the pests, those pranksters that draw enjoyment from the pain and discomfort that they cause in their victims, leaving them covered in welts. In its pages you will find a collection of 8 spells that torment their poor victims leaving them sticky, twitching or laughing uncontrollably as well as 13 magical and alchemical weapons designed to tease and torment. Product includes two versions - one with a parchment background and one in black and white, for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to lighten up your world a little because the sages must be crazy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
