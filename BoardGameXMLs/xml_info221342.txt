			<description>For as long as anyone knows, beings called &amp;quot;Puppets&amp;quot; have been an invisible part of our world. They operate in service of a force unknown, quietly manipulating the course of history. Hajiro Mina is an ordinary high-school girl and the protagonist of this story. One day, she has a chance encounter with one of these Puppets, setting her on a trajectory to meet three girls&amp;mdash;and ultimately changing her life forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
