			<description>Hexteroyd is an abstract strategy game for 2 players with a background theme of Asteroid Mining. It plays in approximately 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn placing and removing pawns (the Colonies) on an hexagonal board (the Asteroid belt) with 5 hexagonal cells (the Asteroids) per side.&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Colonies allow to have the controls of the cells through double-sided discs (the Mines).&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game is having control of the most valuable group of Mines (a Chain): the value of a Chain is given by the sum of the values of the adjacent Colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will participate in an Abstract Strategy Game Design Contest in the mathematics festival &amp;quot;Tutto &amp;egrave; Numero&amp;quot; in Cald&amp;egrave; (Italy) at the end of July 2011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's so special about Hexteroyd ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexteroyd is a kind of connection game but with several twists:&lt;br/&gt; - First and foremost, you don't need to connect distant parts of the board. You must connect points to... gain points !&lt;br/&gt; - The pawns you use are shared between the players and have a double role: they allow the players to make actions and they are the points themselves: positive if you connect them on the board, negative if you keep them in your hand.&lt;br/&gt; - You don't directly place the connecting pieces on the board: they come into play as a consequence of your playing a pawn, whether you place it on, or remove it from, the board.&lt;br/&gt; - Connecting pieces (the discs) aren't fix, they have a certain degree of variability as the result of players' actions: once they are on the board, they remain on their cell, but they change owner, therefore changing the connected pawns.&lt;br/&gt; Thanks to these characteristics, some parts of the board (usually the peripheral ones) are constantly subject to subtle but meaningful changes and the victory is somewhat uncertain till the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategic aspect of Hexteroyd originates in the different ways in which you can use pawns: if you tend to empty your hand, you will have more territory control but less mobility; if you keep them in hand you risk to lose points in the end if you can't get rid of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
