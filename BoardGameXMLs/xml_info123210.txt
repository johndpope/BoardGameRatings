							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The European Championship Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>A free print and play dice game based off Shaun Derrick's excellent World Cup Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving the footballing battlefield from the World Cup to the UEFA European Championships, 2-4 players can print off tournament sheets for Euro '96 in England, Euro 2000 in Belgium/Netherlands and Euro 2004 in Portugal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up is simple. Print off one A4 tournament sheet and the rules sheet. Grab six dice (preferably one red, one blue, one green, one yellow and two others). Find a pencil. You're ready to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teams in the tournament will be divided out between the players who will then choose the dice they want to roll and designate the dice roll results to the teams, scoring goals, defending, scoring penalties and competing to get their teams through to the quarter finals, semi finals and ultimately the final to compete for the Championship trophy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The European Championship Dice Game is designed to be highly portable with a short play time. Perfect to take on trips or to whip out during lunch breaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
