			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shinobi Village is an ensemble game, meaning that each scene features one or more characters from a known cast of characters who appear regularly in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes a single character will move directly from one scene to the next as though the &amp;quot;camera&amp;quot; was following them. &lt;br/&gt;At other times the &amp;quot;camera&amp;quot; will jump around a lot, showing the actions of many different characters. Everyone gets a chance to add something to every scene. As the group plays out different scenes you will eventually cover everyone in the village (or at least a significant number of them). Just like an animated serial television show, your knowledge of the island and its inhabitants will increase with every session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
