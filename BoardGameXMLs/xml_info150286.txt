			<description>G&amp;ouml;tzenDiener is a quick set-collecting card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of five types of cards representing objects of worship, numbered 1&amp;ndash;5, of various quantities. On a player's turn, he picks a card, then either keeps it or sends it to another player who cannot refuse the card. If a player gets a hand of four cards, he must discard all cards of any one type from his hand, applying the effect on those card(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either the deck runs out, someone has a hand of three identical cards, or someone discards a 5. All players then show their hands, earning points for the most common object of worship in hand and the runner-up, and being penalized for everything else, those objects being heretical symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
