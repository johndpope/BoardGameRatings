			<description>Defifoo purple is a trick taking game that takes place in five innings. The object of the game and scoring conditions vary in each round by drawing card &amp;quot;challenges&amp;quot;. The goal is to lose the fewest possible points after five rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are cards with five colors numbered 1 to 10 corresponding to five planets, some joker cards with two-colors that can change the planet and a Sun card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the round the challenge-card is drawn what shows the scoring for that round.&lt;br/&gt;Players play the cards following a suit. At the end of the turn, one that played the highest card wins the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with 1000 points. At the end of each round, we proceed to the number of points depending on the challenge of the round. The player who lost the least points after five rounds is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     64 cards, &lt;br/&gt;     a score book, &lt;br/&gt;     a little pencil, &lt;br/&gt;     a velvet bag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
