			<description>Nephite &amp;amp; Lamanite Wars is a wargame based on the wars described in the Book of Mormon. Due to the lack of specific technical details in the Book of Mormon, armies are fairly abstracted and cities are placed on the map at approximate locations based on the available information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes several scenarios including:&lt;br/&gt;Captain Moroni and Zerahemnah (Battle of Riplah)&lt;br/&gt;Captain Moroni and Amalickiah (Lamanite Conquest)&lt;br/&gt;Jaredite Destruction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate game also uses the map for a trivia game in which players are able to move along the road from the Wilderness to the city of Bountiful by answering LDS Gospel questions. Terrain hexes affect movement but movement points are earned based on the difficulty of the question rather than the movement amount listed on the piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was included in the 1974 LDS Seminary Manual and the scenarios were intended to be played as students read about the relevant parts of the Book of Mormon in the lessons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
