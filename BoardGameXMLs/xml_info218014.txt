							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orc Office Party</name>
									
			<description>Orc Office Party is a quick card game for 2-4 players per deck with games lasting an average of 15-30 minutes wherein players compete to survive in an office environment managed by dastardly orc supervisors.&lt;br/&gt;In this card game, players take on the role of an employee scrambling to survive the most hostile work environment, a company run entirely by orcs! Along with surviving the dangerous traps and time consuming assignments, players compete to see who can slack off the most and still remain employed at the end of the work week. Players begin with timecards, each one representing an hour they can slack off and still get paid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays 2 to 4 players with the base deck. It only takes about 5 minutes to learn, and only about 15 minutes for a single game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
