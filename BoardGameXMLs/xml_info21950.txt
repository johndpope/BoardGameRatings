			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destined to become a classic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The bottom line of Brainsweat is to earn the most points.&amp;quot; Points are based on correct answers but more so on fooling other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brainsweat variations: Scramble. Find as many words as possible in the mixed up letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: Seafscier--Fricassee (unscrambled word)-sea-ice-far-rice, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reverse: Co-players attempt to guess the word which has been defined or to create a convincing phony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilarious &amp;quot;Oh no what now&amp;quot; cards that add another dimension that can be friend or foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: I've never been to France, but I love French Fries. Add 5 points to my score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: The &amp;quot;Sturgeon&amp;quot; General has determined this game could be habit forming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes gameboard, 500 Brainsweat cards, 2 dice, 40 &amp;quot;Oh no what now&amp;quot; cards, 1 minute timer, 6 playing pieces, 6 pencils, score pad, answer pad, history of the game, scoring rule summary, and instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
