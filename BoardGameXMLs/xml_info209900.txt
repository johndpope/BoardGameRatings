			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Olara, and Stahlheim..those who see War as an art form!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a country that has never had a time without war. Olara has learned that the first borders to be violated in campaigns against the south are their own.  These people seem serious and dour to others but they've a rich culture that recognizes the need to live as if any moment could be the last. Imagine a country that combines the legendary fighting ability of the Vikings with the commitment to service that is expected in modern day Israel and you might be close to Olara's culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone fights, Even when a person excels in administrative service, they still practics at weapons. Mothers and sisters fight beside Husbands and brothers. While the country mostly fields infantry, there is a battallion of cavalry that is elite in shaintar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book you'll find some great new edges, powers and fighting styles along with some new gear and bad guys to help give a campaign that Olaran flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
