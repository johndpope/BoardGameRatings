							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Souls: Forgotten Paths Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The myriad paths of this sprawling world are legion, each one branching out into a thousand others. Many of these paths are peaceful, untouched by the wars that rage around them. This journey, however, will take you to far darker places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the paths, shattered and crumbling, which have fallen from memory and sight of the Flame. These are the paths, dismal and cursed, where traps and ruin lie around every corner. These are the paths, chilling and treacherous, which are paced only by the monstrous tread of things best left forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the paths you must walk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Paths is an expansion for Dark Souls: The Card Game. This expansion features exciting new encounters, powerful new enemies, and all-new rules for terrain and traps to ensure that every battle is a fresh challenge. Four distinctive, unique bosses and a brand-new exploration board provide thrilling adventure for even the most experienced players of the core game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid you in conquering these trials, this expansion also includes brand-new, powerful weapons and equipment as well as providing two completely new characters to play, the Pyromancer and the Thief, both of which bring their own play style to enhance your Dark Souls experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy of Dark Souls: The Card Game is required to play with this expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
