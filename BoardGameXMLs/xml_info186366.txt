							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trust Me! (Buy the Elephant)</name>
									
			<description>Deception is rife as players scramble to rid themselves of unwanted farmyard animals by any means necessary, including lying their heads off and turning themselves invisible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trust Me is a fast paced game for 3 - 6 players, which involves bluffing, playing wacky cards on your opponents, and most importantly, avoiding becoming the owner of an elephant. After all, what are you going to do with an elephant?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking its inspiration from the classic Russian card game Believe It or Not, Trust Me builds on well-loved mechanics by throwing new types of cards into the mix, leading to a crazier, more colorful experience. It requires little setup and can be taught in moments, making it the perfect type of game for young people, or to whip out at social occasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You had just better hope the animals are safely in their pens when the tornado hits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
