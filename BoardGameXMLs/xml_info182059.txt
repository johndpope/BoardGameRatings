			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally formed during World War II by David Stirling, the British Special Air Service [SAS] has consistently proved itself to be one of the best, most feared and respected Special Forces teams in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Regiment's Counter Revolutionary Warfare [CRW] team was formed in the 1970s following a terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. Governments from across the world started investigating how they could counter this new global threat of terrorism. In Britain, the SAS were chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very little was known about them until May 1980 when the SAS stormed the Iranian Embassy in London which had been overrun by terrorists who were holding 21 hostages. The assault, captured live on worldwide television, was an outstanding success and instantly catapulted 'The Regiment' and its role into the spotlight of the world's media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAS techniques have been used to train anti-terrorist teams of many nations and, during terrorist incidents around the world, members of the CRW team can be found acting as advisors to the 'in-house' teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrorist organisations, wartime enemies and even friendly units have all learned, at their cost, that you don't mess with the SAS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
