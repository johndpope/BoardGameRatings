			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d spent weeks trailing him, certain he held the key to recovering the lost operative. We had it all planned out &amp;ndash; the ambush, the capture and the interrogation. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be pretty, but time was short and we had to get Emma back. Little did we know that when we finally sprung our trap, we would be the ones held captive &amp;ndash; trapped in a situation none of us could have anticipated. We were lost in a hostile and alien place where the rules of reality no longer applied and all our careful preparations went out the window. Our myriad priorities coalesced into a single, vital goal &amp;ndash; to get back to the world we called home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tables had turned. The man we&amp;rsquo;d planned to take captive &amp;ndash; whom we&amp;rsquo;d spied on, tracked and attacked &amp;ndash; was now our captor. Worse yet, he was also our only potential ally, the only one who could help us find our way out of this place. No matter how unlikely it was that we could convince him to aid us in freeing ourselves, we had to try. The other alternative was unthinkable: that we might be trapped in this place forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Collection of Horrors is an anthology of Storyteller tools inspired by the Horror Recognition Guide that you can either use in conjunction with the Guide or as part of your existing Hunter: The Vigil chronicle. You can get a free introduction here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each story kit in the Collection of Horrors (which you can buy individually, as a bundle or as a subscription) contains variety of appropriate tools; usually an SAS scene, a character with a character sheet, and props ranging from maps and reports to print out and hand to your players, to short imbedded audio files that you can play at your gaming table. These kits represent a collection of evocative story tools that you can write a story around, drop into an existing SAS or even string together. They aren&amp;rsquo;t stories in their own right, but rather pieces that you can snap together into whatever shape you want. Using the Guide can add even more props and ideas to this anthology, but it&amp;rsquo;s not required to use the various story kits in the Collection of Horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
