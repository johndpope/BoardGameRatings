			<description>Flipping Zombies is a simple dexterity game in which you must flip bullets at zombie cards to kill them. The game is played by placing the zombie card on the table and the flipping bullet tokens (bottle caps or other tokens) from the edge of the table and trying to hit a targeted portion of the card. If you miss, the zombie deals hits to you. The game is won by killing all zombies or lost by losing all your health points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you will draw cards that may be items that can help you such as additional bullets, bandages to add health, or armor that will allow you to reload your ammo. There are several types of zombies including armored zombies and the dreaded chicken zombie!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
