			<description>From their web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tabuals is a deck of 43 cards; 36 of which are considered the core deck with each card depicting a pair of dice of varying combinations. In addition to the core deck, there are 6 additional cards called the Starred Doubles. Although the core deck already contains a pair of each double combintation (double 1's, double 2's, etc.), the Starred Doubles is a second set of doubles denoted by a star to the right of their sum (or rank). This extra set is only used in some of our games to change various game mechanics. Finally, the last card in the deck is the JINX card. This card is also only utilized in some of our games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many types of games that can be played with a deck of Tabuals:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Games &lt;br/&gt;Trick-Taking Games &lt;br/&gt;Casino/Betting Games &lt;br/&gt;Building Games &lt;br/&gt;Melding Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
