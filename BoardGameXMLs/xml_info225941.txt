			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just after the Holocaust you wouldn't think anything else could go wrong now would you? There you were sitting peacefully in your cellar, trying to have the nervous breakdown you've earned and the next thing you know you're setting out through the Portals to stop the Evil One rending asunder the fabric of Creation. Some days nothing goes right...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An amazing, all-action, animated adventure across the ages of Man to save civilisation. You'll be able to start playing it in minutes but you mightn't finish it for years?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARNING: This game could damage your social life. TIMETRAX is an addictive habit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's post holocaust and the game starts in your cosy cellar. The most powerful 8 minds in creation have had their key belongings stolen by the Evil One and placed in time. As they search they open the Time Portals and the Dark Ones are pouring into Earth History. You must find the items, return them and seal the portals by lining up the correct 4 Runes and casting a spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original C64 version was by Paul Clancy.&lt;br/&gt;Conversions were by Binary Design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
