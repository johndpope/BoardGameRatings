			<description>In May 2012, the Empires expansion for the game was announced to be released on PlayStation 3 on November 8, 2012 in Japan. As with other Empires expansion, the game is more focused on political and tactical battle system. It includes a new character named Xu Shu. The game was also released in North America and Europe on February 26 and 22, 2013 respectively, though the game only translates the texts while still using the original Japanese dubs. Like Warriors Orochi 3, the game will only be available through digital download in North America, while other regions will have it as retail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dynasty Warriors 7&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
