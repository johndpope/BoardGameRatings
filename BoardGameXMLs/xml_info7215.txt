			<description>To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational simulation of the Battle of Cambrai, 1917, the first great tank battle in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David Isby : From the Designers Notes&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As I write this I am sitting at my typewriter in my extremely comfortable office, a mug of hot, sweet tea by my right hand, and telling you what the Battle of Cambrai was like. That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond.&amp;quot; This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side. Each Game Turn is equivalent to 24 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;400 Die cut counters&lt;br/&gt;1 34&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; Map&lt;br/&gt;1 Die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
