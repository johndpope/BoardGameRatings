			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawkmoor Underworld Cutaway Map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many dwarven cartographers perished to bring you this underworld cutaway map of the mysterious Lost Realm of Hawkmoor. Revealed for the first time are the Halls of Hammerguard deep under Dragonbluff. See how the Sewer Pits where the wererats lurk are connected to the Tombs of the Ancient Kings under Castle Werthorp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far under Hawkmoor are pockets of civilizations such as the Twilight Citadel where underdwellers have built a great city. Deeper still is the city of the dark elves where few dare to venture into unless allied to those sinister and zenophobic beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is even rumored that a submerged city is home to one of the last remaining clans of shahada, the ancient race that spawned the sahuagin, the tritons, and the merpeople.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This large wall map is sure to inspire many adventure ideas and stir your imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
