			<description>gadZOOks! is a whimsical card game about managing a zoo and breeding adorable baby animals. Players must wisely use their limited resources to bid on new animals and outmaneuver their opponents. Each animal you add to your zoo increases the number of visitors your zoo attracts, and ultimately the most popular zoo wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is round based. Each round, players draw cards which might include money to bid on auctions or tricks to use against their opponents. New animals and powerful effects are then revealed and placed up for auction. Players get a chance to place blind bids on auctions that interest them and use their tricks to tip odds in their favor. Once everyone has played, the bids are revealed. It is important to bid wisely because losing bids are lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquiring pairs of animals allows them to mate, produce babies and increase your visitor count for FREE. However, savvy zookeepers always have extra cash on hand to protect their investments from the dangerous cards that come up for auction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;gadZooks! is fast and easy to learn which makes a great game for kids or non-gamers. However, there is enough nuance and strategy to keep more discerning gamers interested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
