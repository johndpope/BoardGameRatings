			<description>The fish are made of plastic and have a small magnet in their mouths. The fishing rod is also made of plastic and has a magnet at the end of the line. When it is a players turn he takes the fishing rod and drops the line on the box (the pond) and tries to capture a fish and drag it over to one of the holes in the box without losing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
