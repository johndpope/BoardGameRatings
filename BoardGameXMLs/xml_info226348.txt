			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malwarium is a Dixit-inspired competitive storytelling game. The active player secretly chooses a card from their hand and makes up a word, sentence, or quote that might describe it. Other players contribute cards from their hands to produce a pool of candidates (along with the active player's card). Players then choose which card was the active player's and points are awarded. Some spaces on the scoring track provide restrictions on how the active player may describe their card (if they are on such a space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
