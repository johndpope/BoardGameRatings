							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of the Manor</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pendragon Book of the Manor provides guidelines for players who want to personalize their particular corner of Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is your manor a place to generate income? Here are 17 ways to increase the income from your land, ranging from dairy or sheep or horse herds to logging the woodlands to establishing new fields for grain to gambling houses and torture chambers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is your manor a place to express your knight's personality? Here are 28 ways to express personality &amp;mdash; AND to gain Trait and Passion checks or rolls! &amp;mdash; such as an Almshouse for Generosity, a Guest House for Hospitality, Large Mews for Falconry, an Ornamental Pond for Romance, or many, many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't forget your Commoners! Replace their structures (Mill, Bakery, etc.) destroyed by war so they do not hate you and provide Developments (a Well, an Armory, etc.) so maybe they will even like you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Religious? You can build a church, abbey or nunnery if you are Christian, or a temple or sacred grove if Pagan!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And let us not forget your heart and home! Improve your Hall to be stone, or larger, or improve its comforts with painted interiors, glass windows, wainscoting or even a water clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes the latest version of the Pendragon Economic System to keep track of your manorial income and also has other chapters on Peasants, Other Expenses (Christening, marriage, knighting, funerals) and even Borrowing Money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
