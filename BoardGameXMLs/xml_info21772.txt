			<description>There are 44 Soccer cards with attractive artwork depicting different English football club kits from the 1950s.  Most cards have a number on them from 2-11, which corresponds to each position on the soccer pitch - for example, 9 is a center forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to place the cards you get to make attacks on your opponents goal.  3 cards are needed to make up a defensive or attacking formation.  Goalkeeper cards and free kick cards can help to upset the balance of your opponent's plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possible formations are set out on player aid cards - for instance:&lt;br/&gt;4,2,3 or 5,2,3 make saving(defensive moves)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and 5,7,9 or 6,10,11 make attacking moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves and the player with the most goals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are separate rules for play with 3 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the English teams in the First Edition set were in the First or Second Divisions at the end of the 1958/59 season, and never after that (Grimsby and Barnsley being relegated from the Second Division in that year).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
