							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Under Castle Modum</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adurite Empire ruled most of the area centuries ago due in no small part to its chain of mighty fortresses. Chief among these bastions was the formidable Castle Modum. This ancient refuge was said to hold mighty magic which may or may not have been the downfall to the castle. Long abandoned the area has always been rumored to house spectral forces and evil creatures. Recently strange lights have been spotted over the keep and the citizens are concerned that an ancient magic has been awakened. The call has come to your ears that adventure awaits&amp;hellip;.are you ready?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is based in the Filbar Campaign using 1st/2nd AD&amp;amp;D edition rules but can be modified for most campaigns and settings. It was designed for 1st &amp;ndash; 4th level characters but can be adapted according to the composition of the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
