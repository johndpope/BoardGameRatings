							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The 72 Curses of Caliph Asrar</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caliph Asrar is a powerful sorcerer who can grant your heart's desire. And he will...but first, you must prove yourself worthy. You must, for a single week, become a Royal Curse Tester. Each day you will receive a new curse. Each day you must deal with the curse with dignity and honor. Should you last those seven days, without going mad or losing face, the curses will be removed, and your desire will be granted. But those who do lose face, ah, they are to remain cursed for the rest of their not-so-natural lives. Is the risk worth it? Many would agree. Some would not. Are you willing to prove yourself worthy and gain your heart&amp;rsquo;s desire, no matter the cost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
