							<name  sortindex="5">The Secret World - To the Dark Tower Below</name>
									
			<description>Get access to an all new Dungeon in Tokyo, The Manufactory, underneath the massive Orochi tower. We are introducing the all new Challenge system! You can enjoy four Daily and seven Weekly Challenges which will offer great rewards. These Challenges may for example ask you to do specific Missions, take on Dungeons, complete Scenarios or take part in Player versus Player battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secret World has many tokens and currencies. From Sequins to Marks of Venice or Aurei of Initiation, to name a few. When Issue #12 launches all these types of tokens will be combined into a single type - Black Bullion. You will be able to acquire Black Bullion from most of the content in the game, like Missions, Dungeons, PvP or Scenarios etc, and you will be able to use these tokens to get your hands on almost anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are also introducing the new Marks of the Pantheon as an even more valuable type of token. You will be able to use these new tokens to improve Weapons and Talismans to all new heights of power! You will need Marks of the Pantheon to improve your Epic gear from 10.5 to 10.7. You can get these new tokens through the Daily Challenges or from defeating the toughest Dungeon bosses in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be able to battle brutal world bosses without taking part in any special event. The final challenge in the Lair system is no longer the Eidolon, but instead three huge bosses from each of the main regions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
