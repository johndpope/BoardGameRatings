			<description>The party game Top That Toast consists of two decks of cards: 50 Tone Cards and 200 Topic Cards. All players begin the game by drawing 5 Topic Cards. The oldest player in the group begins as the &amp;quot;Facilitoaster.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Facilitoaster begins the round by drawing a Tone Card, which determines the tone or style of the toast (some examples include &amp;quot;Humor,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sincere,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Tearjerker,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Roast&amp;quot;).  All other players respond by submitting a Topic Card, face-down on the table. The Facilitoaster then reads the Topic Cards aloud and chooses the Topic Card that, in his or her opinion, best matches the Tone Card and deserves to be toasted. The player who submitted that Topic Card then delivers a toast and thereby wins a Tone Card for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are additional competitive aspects of the game. In the event that 2 or more of the same Topic Card is submitted in a round, the Facilitoaster has the option to call for a Toast Off, where the players who submitted the same Topic Card each give a toast. The Facilitoaster will award the Tone Card to the player who gave the best toast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Top That Toast Tone Card is drawn, each player will give a toast based on the Topic Card that is selected by the Facilitoaster. Once all toasts are completed, the Facilitoaster chooses which player is awarded the Tone Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round, the role of the Facilitoaster rotates around the table. Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Tone Cards, that player wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
