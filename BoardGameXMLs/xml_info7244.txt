			<description>The goal of the game is to place as many as possible elements to the game field, which is a quad-grid 5x5 (but may vary). Elements are 2, 3 and 4 sided in all variations - 11 type of elements.&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the maximal element (with four sides) already placed in the center of the game field. Every next element can be put on the field, but only where the side of the current element can touch the side of an existing element.&lt;br/&gt;If the side of a just-placed element touches the game field border, then the set of the connected elements scrolls in the opposite direction (or directions) if the element touches two borders. When this scrolling occurs, extra elements are deleted from the element set (they fall).&lt;br/&gt;The player randomly chooses the element which must be placed, and also the element which will be next. In the computer version, these elements are randomly generated by the machine.&lt;br/&gt;Every successfully placed element is counted.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the current element can't be matched anywhere in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed by Jordan Tuzsuzov.&lt;br/&gt;Official internet site : &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://devet.tuzsuzov.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://devet.tuzsuzov.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
