			<description>In the party game Kalifiko, players try to get rid of all but one of their feature cards by playing them on an item where that feature fits &amp;ndash; or by convincing other players that it fits! Examples of feature cards include &amp;quot;Made in China&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Has existed for more than 100 years&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Produces heat&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Rolls&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, the first player chooses a random item and says it aloud. The other players can then ring the bell to be allowed to play from their hand a feature card that applies to this item. The first player to ring the bell can submit a card simply by reading it aloud. If everyone agrees that feature fits with the named item, the player discards the card and becomes the new first player, naming the next item to which players must fit features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, any player can call a vote if she thinks the feature doesn't apply. Whoever is proven wrong by the voters draws two cards, then players can hit the bell again to submit another feature card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no feature card is submitted for an item, the first player discards one of her feature cards and names another item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kalifiko includes five play variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
