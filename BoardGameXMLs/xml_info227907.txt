							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rotfather: Intrigas â€“ Takeda Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Translated from the rules: &amp;quot;The network of intrigues in Faux City is further complicated by the entry of Takeda, one of the Yakuza members! Master in influencing people, Takeda is able to make anyone change sides.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Mini-Expansion for The Rotfather: Intrigas adds a seventh character to the game. Takeda's abilities increase the &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; factor of the game, since its individual action serves more to disrupt the strategy of other players than to a direct advantage of the player who uses it. In addition, the increased number of cards allows for seven-player matches without major problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
