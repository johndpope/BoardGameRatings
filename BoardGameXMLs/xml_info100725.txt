			<description>Resident Evil 4, known in Japan as Biohazard 4 (バイオハザード4 Baiohazādo Fō?), is a survival horror third-person shooter video game developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4 and published by multiple publishers, including Capcom, Ubisoft, Nintendo Australia, Red Ant Enterprises and THQ Asia Pacific. The game was originally released on January 11, 2005 in North America, and on January 27 in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First hinted at in early December 1999, Resident Evil 4 underwent a long development time during which four proposed versions of the game were discarded. Initially developed for the PlayStation 2, the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him to create a new entry in the Resident Evil series. Nevertheless, it was decided to start development over again. The game was intended to be a Nintendo GameCube exclusive, but a PlayStation 2 version was announced before the game was released for the GameCube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resident Evil 4 was subsequently released in full for PC (Microsoft Windows) and Wii, and in heavily condensed versions for other platforms, including the iOS, Mobile phones, and Zeebo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Resident evil 4&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
