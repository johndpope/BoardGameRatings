							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Digital Safety Game</name>
									
			<description>Created by the Tallinn University Digital Safety Lab The idea of the game is to learn more about digital safety. The goal is to answer as many questions as possible and win after accumulating a required number of cards. The game is designed so the inquirer has to formulate a question and evaluate whether the answer is correct or not. Discussions and real life examples why this knowledge is important are encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At his/her turn, the player (inquirer) chooses and asks a question on the card from the next player (respondent). The inquirer evaluates whether the answer is correct or incorrect.&lt;br/&gt;In case of CORRECT answer the respondent keeps the card and places it in front of him/her, face up.&lt;br/&gt;In case of INCORRECT answer, the inquirer keeps the card and places it in front of him/her, face up.&lt;br/&gt;Player who first collects 3 cards from one category (same color) shouts out &amp;quot;I'm Safe!&amp;quot; and wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
