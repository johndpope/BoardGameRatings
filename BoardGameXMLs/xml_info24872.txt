			<description>This game was invented 1977 as &amp;quot;Organisms&amp;quot; by Sid Sackson. It was published in the Swiss newspaper &amp;quot;Tagesanzeiger&amp;quot; on October, 13th. 1982 as &amp;quot;Kampf der Gartenzwerge&amp;quot; and later in Spielbox 3/87 as &amp;quot;Krawall im Paradies&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 9x11 board. Both players have 21 tokens divided among 3 groups (6,7 and 8 pieces per group). Each group has 1 leader, 2 special pieces and 3-5 normal pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to capture 2 of the opposing leaders first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movements can be done space by space or by jumping as far as wanted, but the 3 groups should always stay together. Isolated groups member will be flipped over and are blocked until the end of the game. This can be a hard problem, because the normal pieces can only capture opposing people by isolating themselves, while the 9 &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; pieces don't have that restriction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
