			<description>A Game of Survival in the Zombie Apocalypse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The apocalypse has come. The dead have risen. Time is running out for the human race. Only a few survive. Against a rising tide of zombies, a small group of stubborn humans spitefully carries on, scavenging the ruins of the city looking for supplies to bring back to their fortified base where they hide from death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But for how long?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time, not the undead, is your greatest enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns, with each player moving first and the zombies appearing and moving in an end-of-turn phase.  Characters have several tracked attributes.  The map of the area is developed during play by placing cards.  Game time is limited to one hour.  Victory is collaborative and depends on accomplishing certain scavenge and survival goals before time expires.  A separate, optional, rating method is provided to determine &amp;quot;who on your team finishes on top&amp;quot;, in the case of victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game document includes several pages of print-and-play components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
