							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Granopoly</name>
									
			<description>Monopoly themed around the Village of Granville, Ohio to celebrate the Granville Bicentennial. Features many of the historic locations and businesses around the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic boardgame was inspired by Sam Kapland-Goland, created by Mrs. Jeanna Giovannell's 4th Grade Discovery Class of the Granville Intermediate School.  This version of Monopoly requires players to accumulate wealth by acquiring businesses while avoiding charges for the customers. Community Chest and Chance cards are replaced by Fate and Bicentenial Chest cards.  The In Court and Loading Zones spaces replace the Free Parking and Jail spaces.  A must for Ohio history fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
