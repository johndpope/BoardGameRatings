			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Panzer General III: Scorched Earth&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzer General III: Scorched Earth (2000) is a turn-based strategy computer game by Mattel based on the game Panzer General 3D Assault by Strategic Simulations, Inc., which was owned by Mattel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzer General III: Scorched Earth is set in World War II on the Eastern Front. It shares the same engine as Panzer General 3D Assault, although the graphics are improved. It is considered by some to be the eastern Front expansion for Panzer General 3D, which only deals with the western front. The game features four campaigns for German and Russian forces from Moscow to Berlin. Due to the success of Panzer General 3D, it kept the same leader management system. The player begins the game with a pool of leaders that grows as the game progresses. Each leader specializes in a particular equipment class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panzer General III: Scorched Earth is the last game in the Panzer General series. After the release of this game, the rights were sold to Ubisoft, which abandoned the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
