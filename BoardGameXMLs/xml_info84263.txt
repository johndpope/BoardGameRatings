			<description>Action Adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full throttle - and beyond! This month's Pyramid  - the PDF magazine for roleplayers - injects adrenaline into your veins with &amp;quot;Action Adventures.&amp;quot; Our most adventure-filled issue ever gives four scenarios, providing fast-paced frantic fuel perfect for your favorite action-tied RPG system - especially GURPS Action! This issue includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Blowups Happen,&amp;quot; an adventure that begins with a light-fingered maid and ends with heavy-duty explosives. Written by Stephen Dedman - co-author of GURPS Martial Arts Adventures - this scenario includes full stats for GURPS and is perfect for GURPS Action. Get your &amp;quot;bang&amp;quot; skills ready!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Night of the Megacarp,&amp;quot; a modern-day tale that comes straight from the direct-to-DVD section of your imagination. Can humanity survive nature's revenge? It comes with GURPS stats for the main threat and Action info, but the core is fine for civic-minded heroes of any system.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Operation Sun Dog&amp;quot; reopens a long-closed chapter of World War II. A mission to a former Nazi base isn't what it seems, and a straightforward operation becomes a fight for survival. It includes a description of the base, recommendations for Action, and enough systemless details that the players will treat every cough with suspicion.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Calamity Road,&amp;quot; a lighthearted outline that provides the challenge and the challengers, then sits back and lets the parts collide on the open road. No stats here -- just the recipe for a raucous race. Let the green flag wave!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Chase Cards,&amp;quot; a ready-to-use reference that makes running GURPS Action chases quicker and easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this Pyramid includes all the extras that make a death-dealing desperado smile: Murphy's Rules with Greg Hyland, Steven Marsh's Random Thought Table, and other odds and ends. Cover your ears; this issue goes to 11!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
