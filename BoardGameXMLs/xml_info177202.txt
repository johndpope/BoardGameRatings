							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Animal Winner Family Board Game</name>
									
			<description>The game comes with three decks of cards --- one easy, one medium, and one hard. Every card in each deck describes an animal. Each player in turn chooses a deck; another player draws a card from that deck and reads the description on the card. The listening player tries to guess the animal that is described. Correct Easy answers score 50 points, Medium 75 points, and Hard 100 points. A player must reach exactly 500 points to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
