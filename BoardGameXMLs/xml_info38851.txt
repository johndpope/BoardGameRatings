			<description>An old roll-and-move game from the 1930's, re-published recently in the nostalgic games series of Kosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a figurine that starts with 6 wooden disks in a large pannier on its back. Goal of the game is to get rid of them. First player who manages this wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player in turn rolls a die, and moves his figurine forward by the exact amount. Depending on the space he lands on, he might have to do one of the following actions: Give on of his disks to another player, remove it from the game, place it on the board, or take a disk from the board an add it to his load.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are two variants: In one, you start without disks and try to collect a given number; in the other, you have the choice whether to move you figurine forwards or backwards after seeing your roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
