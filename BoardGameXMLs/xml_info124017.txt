			<description>This two-person game is played on a six-by-six checkerboard with squares of six different colors. Each player has a marker and three blockers. Player one moves his marker and blockers, attempting to corner player two's marker. A die determines the distance a piece may move and the color of the square to which it may move. If player two's marker is not cornered after six turns, the roles are switched, and player two tries to corner player one's marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
