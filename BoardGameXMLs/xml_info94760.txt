							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dynera</name>
									
			<description>From deity &amp;quot;Description:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynera is rarely depicted by her priests (the Myrshae) in an artistic manner. When they do describe her, they speak of a &amp;ldquo;three-fold goddess,&amp;rdquo; who changes her form from a young maiden to a matronly woman to an aged crone. Dynera represents nature and all that it encompasses. Her priesthood works to teach people how to live in harmony with the world around them and to prevent its unnecessary destruction or abuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynera is the only deity that makes its home on the Material Realm. This goddess&amp;rsquo;s essence is contained within the earth itself, and manifests as the elements of nature. Her existence outside of the Far Realms does not grant her or her followers any greater power or vulnerability than the other gods. Spirits faithful to Dynera are returned to the Material Realm, reincarnated in whatever form she deems necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
