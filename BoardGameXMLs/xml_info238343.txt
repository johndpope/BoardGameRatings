			<description>A game that combines features of Settlers of Catan and Munchkin. You buy companies and set up start-ups in eligible industries, get profit or sell your company if right the moment has come. You may even try to make a corporate raid. Doing all that you have to acquire your business reputation symbolized by the Stars - special game chips - that's how you score your points. &lt;br/&gt; The game board represents 11 industries (agriculture, telecom, raw materials, etc). Each industry is marked with a die roll number. Each move players throw dices, the roll of the dice denotes an active industry in which players can bid for a company (private or public), start start-ups or sell their companies. Each player who owns a company in the industry marked with the number rolled or in a neighbor industry receives profit. &lt;br/&gt; There are three decks of cards: options, events and crises. Option cards give additional advantages to a player, event cards hit all the players (negatively or positively) and crisis cards may turn your profit into a loss. &lt;br/&gt; Main features:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;     A unique compound game board. Each time you will have a new game!&lt;br/&gt;     You won't get bored waiting for your turn, each move players interact with each other. &lt;br/&gt;     Each move you have to make decisions: how to invest in the industry (buy a company or set a start-up), when to increase your financial leverage, sell your company in a crisis industry or increase your share when prices plunge&lt;br/&gt;     Two game modes: a quick game (30 minutes, good for playing with kids) and a full game (1,5-2 hours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
