			<description>The rules of Alician Draughts were first described in the book &amp;quot;Les Jeux de dames non orthodoxes et autres jeux &amp;agrave; pions&amp;quot; in 1956.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard game of International Draughts is played using two boards, A and B. The normal array is on board A; board B starts empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each player makes a single move on either board following these three rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. A move must be legal on the board where it is played.&lt;br/&gt;2. A piece can only move or capture if the corresponding destination square on the other board is vacant.&lt;br/&gt;3. After moving, the piece is transfered to the corresponding square on the other board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original board (not the &amp;quot;mirror board&amp;quot;) decides the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player has no piece left on the original board, he loses even within a move. A move consists of up to three stages: Movement (which can be a jump in case of a capture), Transfer of the moved piece to the other board, Removal of any captured pieces. That is, if at any stage a player had no pieces left on the original board, he lost the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In practice, it is possible to play Alician Draughts on a single board, if the checkers have a piece of felt glued to their bottom. When a piece (men or king) is transferred to the &amp;quot;mirror board&amp;quot;, it is just turned upside down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite many similarities Alician Draughts is in fact a very different game. While in International Draughts more than 50% of all tournament games today end in a draw, in Alician Draughts a draw is impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
