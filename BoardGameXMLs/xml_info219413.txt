			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Dungeon: Arena is an alternative game mode for players to use with their collection of Super Dungeon models. In Arena, two players each take control of a mighty warband consisting of one Hero, one mini-boss, two spawning points, and the spawning points&amp;rsquo; associated monsters. These warbands then do battle against one another in a challenge known as a scenario. Each scenario has its own unique rules and victory conditions, which require a warband to use its abilities and strengths in new and clever ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Dungeon: Arena includes a beautifully illustrated rulebook, an intricately detailed double-sided game board, an Arena Champion model, and numerous cards, tokens and dice for players to battle it out head-to-head. As players construct their own warbands from any combination of Super Dungeon models or from a single warband box, Arena promises to be an exciting experience each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Dungeon introduced the world to the whimsy and charm of chibi-miniature board games inspired by classic video games, and it continues to be the leader in providing a fun and lighthearted family board game experience. Strongly supported with dozens of expansions which provide new Heroes, monsters, dungeon tiles, and gameplay options, Super Dungeon: Arena is sure to be fun, new edition for longtime fans and new fans of Super Dungeon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
