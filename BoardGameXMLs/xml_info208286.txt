			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mighty Protectors is a role-playing game simulating the lives and adventures of comic-book style superheroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A role-playing game is a form of interactive storytelling, in which the players take on the roles of specific well-defined individuals (player-characters, or PCs) and maneuver them through a continuing series of adventures which make up a story. It's similar to &amp;quot;let's pretend&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cops and robbers,&amp;quot; but with rules and a referee, known as the Gamemaster or GM, and as many other players as the GM feels comfortable with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventures which characters go through are set up by a separate, non-playing judge or &amp;quot;game master&amp;quot; (abbreviated GM). It&amp;rsquo;s the Gamemaster&amp;rsquo;s job to create the world wherein the players have their adventures. The GM presents situations to the other players, describing where the player-characters (PCs) are and what they can see (and even hear, feel, smell, and taste).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GM also plays the roles of any other non-player characters (NPCs) friendly or otherwise that the PCs interact with. The Gamemaster prepares the story beforehand (either by writing it and stocking it with their own characters, or by selecting and reading from a prepared adventure). The GM describes the scenes and events of the story as they unfold, and tells the other players the results of their actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GM also acts as the ultimate and impartial judge in any rules disputes. It&amp;rsquo;s the GM's job to keep the story running smoothly, the rules working fairly, and the players entertained-- hopefully to everyone's mutual enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take the roles of superheroes. Each player-character receives a set of statistics and abilities, then creates a costume and a name in order to fight crime and protect society. As the players gain experience, their abilities will increase, along with the difficulty of the tasks they will be called upon to perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPGs don&amp;rsquo;t typically have clearly defined winners and losers. Instead of competing with the other players, you are working with them as a team, to accomplish mutual goals. Individual characters may also have personal goals that they are trying to achieve, but overall, the goal of the game is to create entertaining stories together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Kickstarter page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new 'third edition' has a name, and not just a number: it&amp;rsquo;s called MIGHTY PROTECTORS&amp;trade; after the player group from the very first V&amp;amp;V campaign in our official setting &amp;ndash; the Mighty Protectors Multiverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mighty Protectors features a new streamlined and expanded revision of the V&amp;amp;V rules, an intro to the Mighty Protectors Multiverse (about which we've only provided scattered details before), and all-new artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
