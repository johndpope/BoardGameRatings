			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second generation, multi-level role assumption game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LEGACY game system consists of a series of rules SECTIONS which describe in clear and internally consistent structure the functions and interactions of a sentient organism within a specified environment. Players assume the role of either a Human of a Keya-Teu and proceed to initiate actions and activities using their assigned abilities, ENABLERS, and resources. The play is monitored and assisted by a game operator who receives instructions from the players as to their actions and activities and enforces the results of the players' actions and the effects of the simulated environment on the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this is called &amp;quot;Volume I&amp;quot; of Legacy in the rules, no other was ever produced. Packaged with the rulebook were a transparent overlay used for combat and several sheets of cards which needed to be cut apart: 16 green flora and fauna cards, 24 yellow artifact (equipment) cards, and 8 yellow technique cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;note&lt;br/&gt;The pages were three-hole punched and bound with a metal strip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
