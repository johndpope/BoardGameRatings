			<description>From the back cover of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Natalya Korolov spun the pen round her fingers as she thought. Opportunities like this were few and far between. It was too late to stop the chaos her erstwhile ally had wrought when he chose to strike off on his own, including this Mamoud-forsaken war, but she could limit future damage. He was a fool if he thought his newfound friends in Valeria could protect him. It was a delicious irony that the emergency powers that that ensured his contiued tenure would soon strengthen her position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;You're right, Chief. This is too good to pass up; but I want to maintain plausible deniability.&amp;quot; She traced a line on the map before her, crossing the Downing Range somewhere north of Ashington. &amp;quot;I hope the Treasurer has a pleasant flight.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Anton Rozam, her security chief, nodded. &amp;quot;Yes ma'am.&amp;quot; He thought for a moment, &amp;quot;Of course the Grand Marshal will be unhappy with Director, sorry, Treasurer Davi for allowing Republican aircraft so far into Mercantile territory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A thin smile crept onto Korolov's lips before her comm-line buzzed, &amp;quot;Yves Banderas on the line for you, ma'am.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terra Nova is engulfed in war and the United Mercantile Federation is, quite literally, looking to profit from the situation. The dominant economic power of the CNCS is using the conflict to make itself wealthy; Mercantile factories churn out equipment to replace that lost on the battlefield while the league's corporations use the chaos to crush their rivals. Meanwhile, the balance of power has tipped precariously, allowing shadowy organizations to influence the war effort against the league's enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the league's civilized and cosmopolitan veneer lies a ruthless heart that seeks to dominate allies and enemies alike. All's fair in business and war, and in the UMF, business is war. This sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A complete history of the United Mercantile Federation&lt;br/&gt;     Information on the league's unique government and the role of corporations&lt;br/&gt;     Details of Swanscombe Jerusalemism&lt;br/&gt;     Information on underworld groups like the Forzi Cartel and Zagreb's Rodinist terrorists.&lt;br/&gt;     Full write-ups and maps for all eleven Mercantile city-states.&lt;br/&gt;     Sample campaign set-ups&lt;br/&gt;     New character archetypes&lt;br/&gt;     New equipment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
