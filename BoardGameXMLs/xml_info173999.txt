							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle for Angmar</name>
									
			<description>A free fantasy wargame released by designer Alan Emrich for use in his Game Design course. The full game download is available on his website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scourging of the North was a campaign of retaliation by the Alliance of western Men and Elves against the Goblins from the Northern Wastes. This was a war intended to break the Goblin army and scatter it forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aimed at the great Goblin citadel of Angmar, with the northern snows fast approaching, whoever controlled that foul fortress would be in a strong position to survive the winter intact and finish the campaign of annihilation in the spring. The Alliance came very close to seizing Angmar, but a rallying of Goblins from across the Northern Waste to its defenses overcame the forces of the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle for Angmar is played on a map of the desolate Goblin lands where the 3-day battle was fought. It uses playing pieces that represent the military units that partici-pated in this campaign. Each player is a leader commanding an army of troops. The individual Alliance ground units represent approximately 250 Men or Elves and what was left of their equipment after the long march across the southern regions of Middle Earth. The Goblin units represent approximately 400 Goblin warriors each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General course of play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate turns moving units and attacking enemy units in order to achieve the victory condition of controlling the city of Angmar at the end of turn 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
