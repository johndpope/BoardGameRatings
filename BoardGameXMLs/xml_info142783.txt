			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fictional Rampage Wrestling Federation/RWF evolved over a period of ten years.  Starting in 2001 with a few wrestlers and a couple of interviewers, it soon took on a life of its own. None of us ever anticipated that it would develop into a full-fledged role-playing campaign with characters that seemed as real as the wrestlers we watched on television. Wrestlers like Jake Reed and Hammer feuded and competed for the RWF Heavyweight Title. Little Dutch Girl and her nemesis Barbie Benson, who considered herself the most beautiful person in sports entertainment, fought for the coveted Women's Title. And interviewers like Buffy Wade and Richard Wheed provided comic relief. There was even a little bit of romance between wrestling manager Mr. Shitaki and the chronically confused Buffy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flash forward to 2010 and Wild World Wrestling. We were thrilled to be given the opportunity to recreate the excitement for this great new wrestling game with the RWF Promotion Book. We hope you will get as much enjoyment out of the RWF as we have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks, and Ring the Bell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
