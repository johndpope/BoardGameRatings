							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>In an almost identical format to its predecessor, players answer multiple-choice trivia questions of increasing difficulty, with the option of quitting with their winnings up to that point. This adaptation has makeshift versions of the TV show's &amp;quot;Ask the Audience&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Phone a Friend&amp;quot; lifelines. Players rotate as host, and after everyone has taken a turn as host, winnings are totaled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the original ABC version of the world-famous game show, hosted by Regis Philbin from 1999-2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
