			<description>&amp;ldquo;When two forest fires collide... a ferocious storm unleashes its fury. You must stop the flames at all costs. Do you have what it takes to fight the biggest wildfire of this century? Or are you too busy cowering beneath your computer desk?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Solo card game. Also designed for 2 or more players to compete against each other for best score. Each player is in command of an Army of wildfire fighters &amp;amp; equipment. Protect structures from fire damage to accumulate points.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses two decks of cards. The Battle Card deck is a custom deck consisting of Fighter Cards (different kinds of firefighting crews and equipment), Aid Cards, Challenge Cards, and Leader Cards. The Flame Deck represents the fire and structures or victims using a standard deck of playing cards (including jokers.) The object of the game is to have the most structures once there are no more Flame Cards in the deck or all flames are extinguished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
