			<description>The game is played on a  4&amp;rsquo; x 3&amp;rsquo; board depicting a race track.  The track has grid spaces on it and players roll dice to move (one space for each number).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a car lands on a space with a picture on it, the player has to pick up the Viewmaster viewer and place a reel in it.  They then roll a die and advance the reel by the number shown.  Peering in the viewer, they will see a 3D scene that will either give them an advantage or a handicap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game came with four Matchbox cars; these are now very rare collectibles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
