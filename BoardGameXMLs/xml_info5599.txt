			<description>A clever deduction game in that you have to pin the 'crime' on another player to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of six houses contains a body... along with three clues: a hat, a gun, and a fingerprint.  Your job is to find the matching clues and, by shrewd trading, plant them in another house or another player's hand, and then implicate him in the crime.  Of course the other player's are trying to do the same to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six different Hats, Guns, and Fingerprint cards are included so that each game is different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
