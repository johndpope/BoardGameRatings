			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adding over 100 psychic spell options for Occult Adventures classes, the third release of the Book of Beyond series is here: Book of Beyond - Spells of Boon and Burden!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells of Boon and Burden was designed and written to expand both the flavor and mechanics of the psychic spellcaster classes introduced in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Occult Adventures expansion. In particular the aim of the this supplement is to make the psychic classes standout more clearly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane classes have long reigned over damage with spells of fiery destruction and divine casters present themselves as the game&amp;rsquo;s premier healers. While loaded with flavor it became clear to Lost Spheres that the psychic classes weren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;the best&amp;rdquo; at anything in particular and as a whole were missing a signature class strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allusions to the power of ki and lifeforce manipulation exist in the initial spell lists but nothing that really stood out as &amp;ldquo;this is the identity of psychic magic.&amp;rdquo; The concepts were there, including undercasting (allowing to expanded versatility). However the opportunity to awaken the full potential of the psychic magic universe seemed still looming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spells presented in this book expand the psychic role as life force manipulators, mentalists, and agents of cosmic balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells of Boon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boons are special spells available to psychic mages to grant rapid beneficial abilities to allies at a similar cost to themselves. Spell casters who are immune to the condition that a boon inflicts are not able to cast that boon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells of Burden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psychic magic for the Pathfinder Roleplaying game more directly than its arcane and divine cousins interacts with the balance of individual spiritual forces and their relation to the world around them. Spiritual concepts of personal balance have been a staple of philosophy of societies both real and imagined for years yet seldom find expression in game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
