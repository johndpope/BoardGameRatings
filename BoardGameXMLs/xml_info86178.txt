			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Santalicious Christmas Murder Mystery Party! A fun Christmas-spirited murder mystery party for 8-16+ guests ages 13 to 112! There is an expandable Elf character that can be expanded to as many optional characters as you need!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery Synopsis: It was time for the annual pre-Christmas meeting at Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus's home in the North Pole. This was the bustling time of the year when the Christmas workers needed to stop working for a moment and come together to discuss how Christmas was unraveling. The meeting attendees arrived as planned at Santa's home. They enjoyed appetizers and engaged in fun Christmas trivia questions while waiting for the meeting to begin. They had fun with an exciting game of 'What Christmas Thing am I' followed by a challenging game of Christmas Taboo. Mrs. Claus served a delicious dinner along with an entertaining Christmas Scramble challenge. The meeting was productive and the Christmas spirit was soaring high until to everyone's shock...a murder occurred! The Christmas characters all rallied together to figure out whodunit before this scandalous murder ruined Christmas! After everyone accused who they believed the murderer was...everyone came clean with their involvement in the crime and...the murderer confessed! While the group awaited the North Pole P.D. to arrive and arrest the accused, the group played a fun game of Christmas Charades. Overall, Christmas had its issues behind the scenes - but the nice boys and girls got their presents on Christmas morning according to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;home page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.mymysteryparty.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.mymysteryparty.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
