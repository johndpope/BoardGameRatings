			<description>Have you played the game and expansions so many times that by now you've memorized all the possible funny combinations? Does the game simply not excite you like it used to anymore? Or perhaps you're just looking for something a little bit different?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any of this sounds familiar to you then Cats Abiding Horribly is exactly what you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revitalize your games with 150 new, uncensored, unofficial and anti-politically-correct cards. The deck contains 110 white, 40 black + 10 blank bonus cards that mix in seamlessly with the original game and expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Printed on high-quality casino cardstock with a linen finish, you are guaranteed to enjoy this expansion for a very long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
