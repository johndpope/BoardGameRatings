			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand why we did it, you&amp;rsquo;ve never been in a Fire Giant slave camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Imagine living your life contented in a village, when the Fire Giant armies come rolling in. They destroy the walls, murder your neighbors, and eventually round up your family to work in the mines. 14 hours a day in the blistering underground heat, digging up the precious gems and minerals that fuel their war machine. If you drop from exhaustion, your fellows have to leave you there, or else you both get kicked into the magma to burn. You&amp;rsquo;d want to destroy them too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So you sneak a few of those precious stones into your quarters after your shift. While the halfling keeps watch at the door, the elves assemble the rocks into a giant&amp;rsquo;s likeness. The dwarves inscribe runes in the right places, and the druids provide a dark blessing. And suddenly, the creature you&amp;rsquo;ve built sits up and glows a brighter red than the lava under your feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How were we supposed to know it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stop with the Fire Giants? We cheered as the immense heat increased its power, enough to tear down the hidden city. But then it ripped through the slave quarter, tearing off its own rocky flesh to use as flaming boulders. I barely managed to escape before it shattered through a fault line and collapsed the entire coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We did what we did. I&amp;rsquo;m not sorry for it, no matter how much your judges leer at me. But I promise you this: We just made one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Only the Gods know why Magma Giants now roam the land.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
