			<description>The board shows a star surrounded by 2 x 3 orbits. Each player has 6 meteors (tokens). They start outside of the board and are moved from orbit to orbit to the star in the center with the help of a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the die roll is high enough, the meteor is gravitated by the star in the center, but if the roll is too low, it will drive off the center. But the chances for being gravitated can be increased by building stacks of meteors (up to 4 meteors of any player's meteors can be stacked).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the game is the player, whose meteors reach the center first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
