			<description>Loop-the-Loops is played on a piece of paper on which one player draws five intersecting loops (or more if desired), in any way they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then on their turns start at an intersection and color the lines, going past two intersections and ending at a third. It is possible to switch to another loop at an intersection. The first player can start at any intersection; after that each player must start where the previous player ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the coloring reaches an intersection which can't be moved from the player's turn ends and the other player may start anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a played finishes a loop they score 1 point (or 2 points for the last loop if there are an even number of loops).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the November 1982 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
