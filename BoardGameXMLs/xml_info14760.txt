							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Word-Sport</name>
									
			<description>Word-Sport was designed to be played in an exciting tournament setting.  Players race to create words on the table (no board).  When a player has used all tiles, he calls &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot; and everyone takes another tile.  This game sets itself apart from other similar real-time word games in that points don't come from the tiles used.  Instead, speed is most important.  Also, play is very flexible since all words do not need to be in a cross-word style grid.  You can have &amp;quot;stray&amp;quot; words or even multiple cross-words.  In a four-player game each player will have 25 tiles in their words.  Winning times have been recorded at under a minute and a half.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
