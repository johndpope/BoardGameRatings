							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malls &amp; Morons Corebook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malls &amp;amp; Morons is a role playing game about teenagers in the mall, and the various misadventures they have as they avoid bullies, adults, and peer criticism in the eternal quest to gain coolness and influence among their peers. It is both a serious game and a comedy game, in that the rules themselves are not a farce and designed with a serious eye towards playability, while the game atmosphere and desired style of play is comedic. It is a light hearted game where the serious issues are ignored and the players will find themselves reveling in humorous antics of fights, breaking things, stealing things, insulting people, defying authority, and vandalism; plus other things we cannot and will not mention on a public site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
