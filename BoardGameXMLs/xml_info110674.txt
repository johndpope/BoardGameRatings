			<description>In a display of 8 open cards and a stack you place your filly and then move it around the display for the number given on the top card of the stack. Then you decide on a card in the row with your Filly, you can take the top card from the stack, too. Or you pass. Cards taken are placed in your personal stack, you must not look at the stack during the game. Gaps in the display are filled from the stack. When the stack is finished, your personal stack is scored. You score 1 point, for 2 identical cards, 2 points for 3 or more identical cards, task cards that you can meet score 1 to 3 points depending on the number and kind of symbols. For task cards not met you lose 1 point. You win with the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
