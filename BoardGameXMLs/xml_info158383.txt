It combines the rich story of the single player Ultimas with the deep multiplayer experiences of Ultima Online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will adventure in an interactive world where their choices have consequences, ethical paradoxes give them pause, and they play a vital part in weaving their own story into the immersive world and lore surrounding them. Play options will include solo, friends only, or open multiplayer via the Selective Multiplayer system. Players can specialize in a wide range of combat and non-combat skills, provided by a robust, classless skill system, and full-featured crafting and housing mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
