							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Recycling</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple web-published paper &amp;amp; pencil game intended to teach the benefits of recycling wastes of different kind to children and their families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a sheet for each player. Some dice and eraserable pencils are required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, roll three dice. Each number is associated to a different material (1 = plastic, 2 = paper, 3 = glass, 4 = aluminuim, 5 = special stuff, 6 = organic waste), and each material has a different special effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each die you can choose either to keep it or discard it. In the latter case, you get to activate the related special effect - i.e.: paper makes you roll 2 more dice, while glass makes you adjust the value of another die,... - . Mark a X on the Waste track (negative points!) for each die discarded in this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, for each die you kept, mark a X on the related &amp;quot;building track&amp;quot;. When the 5th X of a building track has been marked, you have managed to build the Recycling Plant for the related material, thus you won't mark X on the Waste track anymore for using the related special effect. You also score some points depending on how many other players have preceded you in building the same Recycling Plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player has built 4 Recycling plants, the game is over and whoever has the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
