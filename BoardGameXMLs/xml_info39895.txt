			<description>From the back of the box:  For years, you've enjoyed the &amp;quot;antics&amp;quot; of Radio From Hell&amp;quot; on your radio sets.  There have been countless hours of family fun as everyone gathered together around the radio for breakfast and Kerry, Bill and Gina from 6AM to 10AM every morning.  The only bad part was having to say &amp;quot;Crap-ola, we're out of orange juice.&amp;quot;  And &amp;quot;Oh why does the show have to end at 10AM.  I wish we could have Radio From Hell with us all day and at night too.&amp;quot;  Well, now you can with the Radio From Hell Home Edition.  We've boxed up all the excitement of a broadcast and turned it into a fast-paced boardgame.  That's what you're holding in your hand right now.  So quit staring at it, get your wallet and buy one for yourself and give one as a gift.  Then take it home and play.  The Radio From Hell Home Edition: a great way to waste time when you should be doing something else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENJOY!!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on one of the most critically-acclaimed morning shows in the country, Radio From Hell: Home Edition lets you take the role of any of the four members of the show and compete to see who has the most listeners after a week of broadcasting.  Cards let you take listeners from other hosts, help segments get closer to being completed for points, or for whatever special ability is on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
