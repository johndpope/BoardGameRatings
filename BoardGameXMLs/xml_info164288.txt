			<description>WIXOSS (pronounced as We-Cross, from &amp;quot;Wish Across&amp;quot;) is a Japanese trading card game published by Takara Tomy. It is the game that the TV anime series Selector Infected WIXOSS is based on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players each use a randomized Main deck (with black card backs) and a LRIG deck (with white card backs) that's always available in its entirety to defeat opponent's avatar called LRIG. It is done by destroying (or &amp;quot;Crashing&amp;quot;) all seven cards of their Life Cloth and then dealing the final strike. Players can attack either with their LRIG or summoned beings called SIGNI that come from the Main deck. &lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the game, players can &amp;quot;Grow&amp;quot; their LRIG with cards from the LRIG deck, getting access to more powerful SIGNI and various LRIG abilities. Both decks also have cards with one-shot effects: Arts (in the LRIG deck) and Spells (in the Main deck). These cards, as well as Growing a LRIG, require spending a certain amounts of Ener, which is represented by cards in your Ener Zone. You can put cards from both your hand and your side of the field into your Ener Zone once a turn. It is also the zone where defeated SIGNI and crashed Life Cloth cards go to. Some cards also produce additional effects called Life Bursts if they are crashed from the Life Cloth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
