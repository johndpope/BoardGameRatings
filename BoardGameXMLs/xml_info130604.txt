			<description>A short childrens/party game of speed and memory. Each player is dealt six cards and puts them down next to each other in memorized order. Then each player turns over one card, looks at the other players cards, and the first to turn over a second card identical to one already turned over wins the duel. This person loses the card. The game is over when one person has no cards left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
