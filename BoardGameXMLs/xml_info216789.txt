			<description>Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;GoRoGo is new Go variant game for two players played with each 10 ordinary black and white pieces and 5 additional  neutral ones. Each player has two of the neutral pieces, and one starts on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Go, the game is played on a grid, but the board has only a 5x5 grid with 25 intersections and 40 paths. The purpose of the game is to obtain more of your opponent's pieces, not to claim an area majority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since there are only 25 pieces, the game is over after 24 moves at most. A player cannot pass, nor play a neutral piece last. If they don't have a legal move, they lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The neutral pieces are both black and white. That is, on Black's turn, a neutral piece is a black piece. Then on White's turn, it is a white piece. This allows moves that are normally prohibited in Go, such as 'Kou'. A player can attack into an area that in Go would be protected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GoRoGo is a GO game but not GO. It means that the tactics are GO tactics but the strategy isn't GO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
