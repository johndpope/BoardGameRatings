			<description>Rules to recreate battles of the American revolution period based on the warmaster rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were published in Wargames Journal magazine Number 6. There are several scenarios and a campaign system in numbers 7 and 8 of the same magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several scenarios are available: Guildford courthouse, Brandywine (4 players) and 3 small actions from the same battle, Camden, Monmouth, Germantown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requirements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will require these rules, several six-sided dice (d6), suppression markers, tape measures, a 4x4&amp;rsquo; or 4x6&amp;rsquo; playing area with appropriate terrain, and suitable miniatures. Typically is used 6mm miniatures on 40x20mm bases (unit faces long side) but the only real requirement is a standardized basing scheme. You may wish to use inches instead of centimeters with 15mm or larger figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows a ugo-igo pattern of alternating player turns. Games end when one side achieves its objectives or breaks due to mounting casualties.&lt;br/&gt;Each side operates several units. A unit represents either a company (60 men) or a battalion (600 men) and normally comprises three stands (or bases) of troops that always remain in contact. &lt;br/&gt;Officers and generals are represented by individual bases. Their role is to give their units or groups of units (called brigades) orders. Each officer and general has a command value assigned&amp;mdash;a higher command value indicates a more capable officer and general.&lt;br/&gt;The crux of the game is the activation system. The player with the initiative (i.e., whose turn it is) identifies an officer or general and the unit(s) the officer or general wishes to order. &lt;br/&gt;Shooting is resolved with a single die roll (but many dice!) while melee requires a single competing die roll. Units can be suppressed or routed and stands can be killed. Over time, mounting casualties reduce the combat effectiveness of a unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
