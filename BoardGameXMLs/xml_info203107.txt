			<description>From the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin play as a PC you need to make a god. There are three simple steps to making a god - your archetypes, your domains, and your character. Note that you don't have to go down these like a list. You can easily make the character of your god and pick archetypes and domains that fit their concept, or pick your favorite domains then backtrack to find archetypes that would allow you to have both of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that Godsrealm does not have character sheets like most other role playing games. This is because the system is both so overwhelming simple that character sheets are redundant, while also being so complex no one sheet of paper could encompass it. For instance, a level one character has quite literally four things to write on their character sheet most of the time, not including a description of their god. However, an established god must try to keep up with all of their races, what they have created and uncreated etc. As such, it&amp;rsquo;s best to just have a couple of sheets of paper to take notes as the game goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
