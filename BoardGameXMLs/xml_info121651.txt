			<description>Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, released in Japan as Crash Bandicoot Advance 2: Gurugurusaimin Dai Panic!? (クラッシュ・バンディクー アドバンス2 ぐるぐるさいみん大パニック!??) is a platform game published by Universal Interactive Studios (Konami for Japan) and developed by Vicarious Visions for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in North America on January 7, 2003, in Europe on March 14, 2003 and in Japan on December 4, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced is the eighth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series and the second Crash Bandicoot game to be released on a handheld console. The game's story centers on the exploits of the main character, Crash Bandicoot, as he rescues his friends from the hypnosis of the main antagonist Doctor Nefarious Tropy and his ally N. Trance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced is a platform game in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot, who must free his friends from the hypnosis of the main antagonists of the story. Much of the game takes place in a dimensional bubble that Crash and his mentor Aku Aku are trapped in. The inside of the bubble is displayed as a map littered with portals to different levels. Connecting the portals are dotted lines which Crash can use to travel between portals; initially, only a few dotted lines are visible. The goal of each level is to find and obtain any Crystals and Gems hidden in the area. As more Crystals are retrieved from the levels, more dotted lines will become visible on the map, allowing for further exploration. Gems allow access to special levels necessary for full completion of the game. When the antagonists of the game have been defeated and enough Crystals have been gathered to return to Earth, the game is won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
