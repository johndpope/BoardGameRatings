							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return to Swampy Creek</name>
									
			<description>From the Cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Misadventure #1 treats you to down home style! The tiny hamlet of Swampy Creek, Arkansas lies near the boggy haunts of the fabled &amp;quot;Swampy Creek Monster.&amp;quot; Part man, part beast, and part swamp muck, the terrified locals' tales of sighting this legendary beast packed people into drive-ins by the trunk-load back in the 1970's when they were committed to celluloid as the box-office smash The Legend of Swampy Creek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This, of course, led to Legend of Swampy Creek II, but the public's appetite for out-of-focus, grainy, darkly-shot, alleged bog-monster footage was seemingly sated by the first instalment in the series. In recent years, fading public memories of its Monster have led to declining tourist dollars for Swampy Creek, and in an effort to refill the town's coffers, its leading citizens banded together to fund and construct a gleaming symbol of hope and future prosperity for their once-famed burg: a dirt track for stock-car racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not everyone looks to the impending tests of man and machine with unadulterated, rapturous joy. To some-the ancient, the untamed, the unfathomable-it is an unspeakable intrusion of the known into the unknown, and the price of such trespasses is to be paid in blood. This is the tale of when the Legend of Swampy Creek is reborn to settle the account. Mud and guts, auto racing and monster chasing await all of the poor innocent bystanders, victims of circumstance and hapless chumps that are plum fool enough to meddle with the macabre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting 15 page adventure with a full colour cover and 5 quarter page interior black and white illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
