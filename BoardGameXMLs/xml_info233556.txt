							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blight: Richard Pett&#039;s Crooked City (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vast and sorcerous city, poisoned by alchemy, extending its empire through necromantically-powered industries, the City-state of Castorhage is gritty, often-horrific, and heartless. The city-state has begun exploring realms beyond the normal world, heedless of the dangers, and unaware that these other worlds are exploring the city-state in return. Ruthless factions, many of them quite monstrous, wage a hidden war for control of the city, its bizarre &amp;ldquo;technologies,&amp;rdquo; and its cruel empire.&lt;br/&gt;Two books in one, The Blight: Richard Pett&amp;rsquo;s Crooked City is everything you need for a campaign set in Castorhage, the city known to most simply as the Blight. Set in the Lost Lands campaign setting, this book consists of The Blight Campaign Guide &amp;mdash; which includes the Cyclop&amp;aelig;dia Infestarum, a huge collection of new monsters, NPCs, and other resources for the setting as well as a ten-chapter gazetteer to the city&amp;rsquo;s individual districts &amp;mdash; and also includes the Levee Adventure, a nine-part series of adventures that introduce your players to their first taste of the Blight and its rotten and degenerate urban confines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your players to a truly novel city-setting, where adventures are utterly different than the ordinary fare of traditional fantasy. The Blight: Richard Pett&amp;rsquo;s Crooked City provides countless hours of adventure for your game and the seeds to endless  &lt;br/&gt;campaigns spawning from its grimy, crowded environs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve just entered the wrong side of town . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning!&lt;br/&gt;This product contains materials that may not be suitable for all audiences. &lt;br/&gt;It is recommended for use by individuals age 13 and older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
