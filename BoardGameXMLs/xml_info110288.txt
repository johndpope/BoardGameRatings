			<description>For many years, Geh aufs Ganze! (Go the Whole Hog!) with its ZONK! has been one of the most successful game shows on tv in Germany based on the American game show Let's Make a Deal. Players are candidates in that show, sohw must always decide which portal they want to open or which envelope it should be or choose between portal and envelope or risk all that they have won before on the Big Deal or be content with a 1000.- DM. Being greedy or unlucky only gets you the Zonk! Players can try to actively influence the candidate in his decision by offering money or other bribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
