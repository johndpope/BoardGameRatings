							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ramar of the Jungle, The New Jungle Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is a spin and move game where the object is to capture valuable animals in the jungle. The game board is filled with face down animals and by spinning a spinner and then moving your playing piece onto one of those animals you capture it. The game continues until all of the animals have been captured. Turning over each animal reveals a value attached to that particular animal. The player who captures the most valuable animals wins the game. When a player lands on an animal, his playing piece remains on that spot until his/her next turn and other players cannot land on or move over that spot, They must use their roll number to move around the opponents piece. The designers name appears to be Dexter Wayne but research is still being done on that fact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game for ages 7-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
