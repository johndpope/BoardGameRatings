							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I.Q. Derby</name>
									
			<description>This is a trivia game with a horse-racing theme.  It's complete title is &amp;quot;I.Q. Derby - &amp;quot;It's Official&amp;quot;&amp;quot;  There are six categories and the box encourages you to &amp;quot;Get In The Saddle And Test Your I.Q.!&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;The fastest general trivia game around!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I honestly know little more about the game, as the box is very uninformative and the only copy I have is still in the shrink wrap.  I could find no other copies, nor any mention of the manufacturer on the internet.  it was made by &amp;quot;KAGE/GAINER INTL., ft. Thomas, Ky. 41075.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
