			<description>GREG is a mathematical puzzle game for iPhone that will enhance your mental flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of GREG is to sum the numbers written on the tokens in the grid to reach a given number as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;Every time the game timer reach the end all the tokens become hotter until they become black and burn. The game ends when a single token burns.&lt;br/&gt;To cool down the tokens you must use them for a correct sum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GREG features an unique algorithm that increases the game difficulty as the user reaches higher levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GREG has been developed on a solid concept of gamification.&lt;br/&gt;Every time you play you earn gold which is used to purchase special items to help the user in the game.&lt;br/&gt;It also features different types of leaderboards, exciting achievements and an innovative multiplayer mode via Bluetooth LE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
