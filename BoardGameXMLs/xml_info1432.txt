			<description>The great escape game.  The playing board is built up as the game is played.  Beginning from the Start piece in the centre, more and more pieces of the maze are added, while players follow various paths through the pieces.  They try to lay down pieces that will speed their own movement out, and place pieces in the path of opponents that will block or detour their progress. Amount of movement and ability to lay one or two tiles is dependent on the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breakout has a standard game plus two game variants.  All play differently every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
