			<description>&amp;quot;Solatorobo -And Then To CODA- (ソラトロボ -それからCODAへ-,  Soratorobo -Sore Kara CODA e-)  is a 3D Action RPG game developed by CyberConnect2  and published by Namco Bandai. It is the spiritual sequel to Tail Concerto and considered the third of the Little Tail Bronx series. It was released on the Nintendo DS in October 28, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solatorobo's gameplay focuses on using Red Savarin and his mech for movement and combat situations. Using DAHAK, Red rides it while using it to throw crates, repel missiles and slams enemies into the ground. Players needs to use the A button before they can get into a throwing chain combo. Red can also step out of his mech to pull down switches, swim and attack enemies using his sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red also has special ability that he can use called &amp;quot;Trans Up&amp;quot;. This ability transforms Red from his Dog race form into his human form, while increasing his attack, speed and defense capabilities. He also can use this ability while riding DAHAK, transforming into its human-like shape and acts as Red's armor. In this form, Red also gains access to special movies also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hiroshi Matsuyama recently stated that some characters from both Tail Concerto and Mamorukun series will appear in the game as guest characters and the game has a total of 80 quests.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Solatorobo&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
