							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spurs and Sprockets: Landships</name>
									
			<description>Landships is a stand alone game for 2-6 players. It includes 6 new Spurs and Sprockets decks and introduces a new set of rules that includes the Fire Away, projectile attack. Players may combine it with the basic Spurs and Sprockets decks or the Revolutionary decks. The game decks also include artwork used with the new Fire Away rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spurs and Sprockets is a perfect information, abstract strategy game. Players each have the same eight tiles/cards that they take turns placing into a grid, in an attempt to link three or four in a row. There is no board in Spurs and Sprockets so the grid grows organically, based on the placement of tiles. The grid also varies in size and dimensions based on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Spurs and Sprockets game comes with 48 tiles/cards and rules for many different ways of playing, ranging from a simple Tic-Tac-Toe-like game where players gain 8 points for four in a row and 3 points for each set of three in a row, to a game where every placement of a tile/card may result in an attack and removal of another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
