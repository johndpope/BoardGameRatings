							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conflict 2000</name>
									
			<description>Conflict 2000 :Modern Combat Rules takes the rules used in Stellar Conflicts &amp;amp; Uprisings, and uses them to depict combat between modern forces, from the 1970's up to 2000 (and beyond).  Using hidden counters, tactical movement and simultaneous combat, Conflict 2000 keeps all players actively involved during the game.  Conflict 2000 incorporates rules for vehicles, artillery, engineer support, leadership and experience, all of which can be of vital importance in determining the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to use miniatures from any manufacturer, Conflict 2000 players can choose between the 25mm scale, for more detailed, personal combat, or 15mm for platoon-level action with more vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the Tactical Command website): &amp;quot;The main strategy of the rules system CONFLICT 2000 is to give a feel for the modern forces and their basic combat configuration as for troop&amp;rsquo;s equipment and armor vehicles. We at Tactical Command Games firmly believe that the acronym (METT-T) Missions, Equipment, Troops, Terrain and Time, will dictate situations on the modern battlefields. So with that in mind go ahead and have fun playing the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
