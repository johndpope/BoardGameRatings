			<description>Subbuteo Penalty Shootout is a football (soccer game). It focuses on penalty taking.  The attacking player flicks his Player to shoot the ball into the goal. The defending player operates the goalkeeper on a stick to defend the penalty kick. After taking 5 penalties each, the player with the most goals is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A self contained game, it is designed to encourage younger players to build their skills ready for the full Subbuteo game. Promotional version available in conjunction with Nestle Yorkie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
