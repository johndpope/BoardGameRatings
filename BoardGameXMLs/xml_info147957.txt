							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Meeting Room</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 32 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a Meeting Room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Work with these barbarians? Never!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting room is a single room map of a circular meeting area with six hallways leading towards the center room. This product includes image files for your virtual tabletop (VTT). This product also includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the middle of the meeting room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting room is intended for use in fantasy games. Its architecture and style makes it a good fit for historical games set in ancient Greece or the Roman Empire as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting room can be used as a location for a tense negotiation between two sides. They fiercely hate each other, but have been brought here to parley either for peace or perhaps an alliance against a greater threat. The player characters need to act as a neutral third party and mediate the dispute. If they succeed, they will have a better reputation with both groups. If they fail, it could be a bloodbath with both sides trying to kill each other in the meeting room. In that case, the group needs to fight their way out alive. If they do make it out alive, their reputation takes a hit with both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
