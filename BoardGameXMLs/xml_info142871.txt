			<description>Worlds War One is a 2-5 player nation-building, resource managing, war game set in an alternate steampunk history where the first world war takes place in outer space! Each nation features unique strengths and weaknesses that players must learn to leverage in order to make the strategic and tactical decisions necessary to ensure victory. Victory points may be gained though activities such as trading, destroying an opponent's planet, or saving another player's forces from destruction. As it is never clear who the victor will be until the very end, tension builds and builds until a fast and furious finale - a no holds barred, guns blazing, fight to the bitter end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists of 5 phases:&lt;br/&gt;1. Discard (down to 10 cards)&lt;br/&gt;2. Produce (planets produce resources of their color, draw 2 cards)&lt;br/&gt;3. Trade (cards in hand, resources, etc., with other player(s), or 3 of the same color resource for 1 of any color to the bank)&lt;br/&gt;4. Diplomacy (read: ATTACK!!!)&lt;br/&gt;5. Industry (put into play Troops, Developments, and Planets)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins the game by gaining 10 Victory Points, or by having the last surviving Homeworld.  A player can win a victory point in one of five ways:&lt;br/&gt;1. Destroy a planet&lt;br/&gt;2. Trade with another player (Until player has 9 VP's, then no VP's for trading)&lt;br/&gt;3. Defend a planet&lt;br/&gt;4. Produce 10+ resources&lt;br/&gt;5. Have 3+ unique colored planets in play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins as 1 of 5 homeworlds, following the Worlds War One theme:&lt;br/&gt;1. Germania Prime&lt;br/&gt;2. The British Trade Conglomerate&lt;br/&gt;3. The United Planets of America&lt;br/&gt;4. The Asiatic League of Interstellar Expansion&lt;br/&gt;5. The Intergalactic Russian Empire&lt;br/&gt;Each homeworld has unique troops, developments, handicaps, and strengths--know your history in order to dominate the future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
