			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexatome is a role playing rules system, that is, it provides a set of rules needed to play role playing games. By role playing game standards Hextome's framework may be regarded as lean and sleek comprehending only those rules needed to smoothly run the game. Its rules aim at the players' freedom rather than complexity, but may be easily extended and adapted to specific personal needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexatome is as light-weight as a rules system can be and still encompass an RPG.  Characters are noted as being a &amp;quot;role&amp;quot; that is played like an actor takes on a role.  No setting is provided, no resolution methodology is provided, and in fact only the character sheet guides character creation.  The rules note that 6d6 are needed for play but their utilization is left up the GM, suggestion opposed actions are simply &amp;quot;diced for&amp;quot; with equal chances of success or failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is provided as an HTML file along with a downloadable one-page (A4-sized) PDF character sheet.  The character sheet notes &amp;quot;Character&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Appearance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Aims/Goals&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Relations&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Equipment&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Wounds/Injuries&amp;quot;.  ALso noted are six Attributes:  &amp;quot;Agility&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Presence&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Soul&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Physique&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Perception&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Mind&amp;quot;.  A central hexagon connects the six Attributes.  Among the Attributes, only &amp;quot;Perception&amp;quot; is sub-categorized--namely &amp;quot;Sight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hearing&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Smell&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Taste&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Touch&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
