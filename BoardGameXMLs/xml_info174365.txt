			<description>There are three elements to magic: fire, water, and wood. Each has its weakness. Fire burns Wood, Wood absorbs Water, and Water extinguishes Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to become the most powerful wizard by gathering as many Magic Stones of your element as you can, while avoiding the Magic Stones that your element is weak against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But do not let other wizards know your element, or they will use their magic to thwart you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What's your Magic? forces you to conceal your affinity, while trying to deduce what affinity your opponents are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wizard with the most points at the end of the game, calculated by [stones in your affinity - stones your affinity is weak against], is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you may cast a spell using the stones in your tableau and then you must use a card in your hand to move the fairy that many times around the central decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
