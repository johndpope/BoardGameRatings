			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 14 long years since the virus took over. You and your only friend are stranded on an island, overrun by zombies. Avoid zombie attacks, backstab other survivors and fight to be the last remaining survivors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives seven cards from the Prime deck and two survivors with ten health each. Each round, a player can discard a Set (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 of a Kind), a Run (3-7 consecutive cards), or Scavenge cards and finish their turn with 7 cards in hand. The next player in turn must respond to the play by matching or raising the Set or Run to avoid a zombie attack (indicated by the amount of zombies visible on the table). If Scavenge cards have been discarded, the players must respond accordingly. When a survivor is killed, they turn into zombies, increasing the amount of zombies in an attack. The game is over when there is only one player with survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In essence, Strandead is a trick-taking card game. Players must choose their plays carefully, in order to survive the next attack and backstab other players in turn. Every survivor has a unique ability that can shift the game in their favour. An ever-growing number of Zombies continue to make the attacks more vicious as the game progresses, leading to a fast paced, hectic and unique experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strandead is designed for 2-4 players, with an average playtime of 20 mins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
