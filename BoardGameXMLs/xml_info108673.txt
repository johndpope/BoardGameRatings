			<description>F&amp;uuml;nf Tierfreunde (Five Animal Friends) is a memory game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 25 tiles. Each tile shows one of five baby animals: a foal, a piglet, a kitten, a baby dog and a baby goat. At the beginning of the game, these tiles are arranged in a 5x5 grid. On your turn, you roll two dice, which show the five animals and a question mark. You then have to turn over two adjacent tiles that show the animals shown on the dice. If you roll a question mark, you may choose what animal you will turn over. If you turn over a correct pair, you gain a friends token. The tiles are turned facedown again, and are covered with a cloud token. Until another successful pair has been turned over, the two covered tiles cannot be used again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the game when you have collected four, five or seven friends tokens(depending on the number of players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
