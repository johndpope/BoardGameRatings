							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ti-Kop: The Sea Folk</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ti-Kop are an aquatic humanoid race found beneath the sea and along the shores of the World of Conclave, mostly concentrated in the Southern Sea area. Ti-Kop is a transliteration of their name for their species (which translates as The People) from their clicking, popping language. Humans also refer to them as &amp;lsquo;gloppies&amp;rsquo; in mimicry (perhaps mockery) of the sound of their speech. There are many varieties of ti-kop and, unlike humans and tlaxu, these varieties are distinct sub-species rather than divisions based on superficial differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
