							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earl Gillespie Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>This very basic baseball card game is of interest only because it may be the first whose marketing was based on the fame of a broadcaster rather than a player &amp;ndash; in this case long-time Milwaukee Braves announcer Earl Gillespie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards in the 48-card deck are simply turned over one at a time by the batting player, and each produces only the result of a play. The cards are notable, however, for including both detailed play results (Line Drive to Left, Runners Hold) and the corresponding scoring notation (L-7). The rules include a sample score sheet filled out with a full game of proper notation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
