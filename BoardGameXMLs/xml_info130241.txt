							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skirmish Word Game</name>
									
			<description>This game could be described as Battleship with words.  The board is a bi-fold, with a ribbon connecting the two sides to provide support for tenting on a table.  Each side of the board has two areas - the lower portion contains a thin ledge on which to place the letter tiles and a coordinate system.  The upper portion has the coordinates as well as holes which can be filled with either light or dark pegs, depending on on the result of a query.  The letter tiles, which come in two shades, are imprinted on a quadrille rule themselves, for better alignment with the coordinate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays by each person placing a word made from their color of tiles, in secret, on their side of the board, and then the players take turns calling out coordinates. A player records a &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; with a light peg, and a &amp;quot;miss&amp;quot; with a darker one.  The first player to guess the other's word is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
