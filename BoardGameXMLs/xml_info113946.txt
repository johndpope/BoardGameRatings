							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corporate Mayhem</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Corporate Mayhem is a fast and raucous board game about ambition, opportunity, betrayal, amoral excesses, premeditated criminal behavior, and runaway greed in the corporate world!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of the game of Corporate Mayhem is simple - to gain a million dollars and then cash out to a life of easy living, ahead of everyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In principle you could achieve this by a long, methodical process of honest hard work and diligent saving.  This might enable you to enjoy the fruits of your labor - from your wheelchair at age 90.  But instead, you could more quickly amass your personal fortune by being an opportunistic, devious self-promoter who is adept at finding shortcuts, loopholes, and weaknesses in the system and in other players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware! Your path to the easy life can be blocked or destroyed by poor judgement, bad luck, or deliberate backstabbing by a jealous rival.  And even if you manage to elude pitfalls and cleverly claw your way to the top, you can in the end (as in real life) be undone by fate itself.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
