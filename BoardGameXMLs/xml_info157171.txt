			<description>Alex Builds his Farm: A game for children 7-10 in which the player helps Alex on his farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Playmobil&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alex is a lively and cheerful little boy who loves nature and animals. He often goes running along the forest paths with his dog Oscar. All the animals in the forest know him. Alex is also a great dreamer. Sometimes he sits under a tree and turns the pages of his favourite book: The Big Farming Book.&lt;br/&gt;He sits there enjoying the sun, cooled by a gentle breeze. On such occasions Alex sometimes falls asleep and dreams of a magnificent farm with cows, funny little hens and affectionate horses. One day, Alex and Oscar went running in a field at the edge of the forest. In the middle of the field stood&lt;br/&gt;a scarecrow to keep the crows away. When Oscar and Alex passed close to the scarecrow they heard a strange noise. Alex was surprised and looked all around, but couldn't see anything strange or unusual. Just as Alex and Oscar were about to continue their race, Alex heard the noise again. It was as if someone was calling him: - Psst! Pssst! Alex, it's me!&lt;br/&gt;It was the scarecrow! Alex couldn't believe his eyes.&lt;br/&gt;- But...! You can speak! said Alex in surprise.&lt;br/&gt;-Yes, of course I can speak, said the scarecrow. But I only speak to children who like animals and nature. Like you, Alex!&lt;br/&gt;The scarecrow had a big smile. He looked nice and funny at the same time. He spoke again:&lt;br/&gt;-You know what Alex? I often see you sleeping under a tree in the forest. Did you know that when you dream in the middle of the forest, your dreams can come true?&lt;br/&gt;- Er... No, I didn't know that, said Alex.&lt;br/&gt;-Well, because you're a good little boy and you love nature so much, I'm going to tell you a secret: when you wake up, all you have to do is concentrate very intensely on your dream and do everything you canto make it come true!&lt;br/&gt;- That's easy! said Alex.&lt;br/&gt;- Yes! But above all, you mustn't forget to have fun! Other&lt;br/&gt;wise, it's no longer a dream!&lt;br/&gt;- Thanks, Mr Scarecrow! That's a great secret!&lt;br/&gt;- Bye, bye!&lt;br/&gt;As soon as Alex had finished talking with the scarecrow, he and Miro ran faster than ever in the direction of a large oak tree, the most majestic tree in the forest. Alex was keen to see if the scarecrow had been telling the truth. He sat down under the tree and shut his eyes. He listened to the birds sing&lt;br/&gt;ing and the sound of the wind in the trees, but Alex couldn't manage to fall asleep. He was far too excited by the&lt;br/&gt;scarecrow's secret! So he picked up his favourite book, the Good Farmer's Handbook and started to look at the pictures one after the other. Little by little, his eyelids shut and he fell asleep. And dreamt... He dreamt of his family, and a magnificent farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User addition:  Alex Builds his Farm is a Playmobil videogame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
