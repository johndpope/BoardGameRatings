			<description>The future is always uncertain - it is full of unfulfilled promises, and terrible predictions that never come to pass. No plan ever survives contact with the enemy, and the future is the enemy of all our lives - a march through the darkness that will eventually end in our deaths; maybe tomorrow, maybe fifty years from now. Still, people keep on planning, as if they can control the future; and usually, things more or less work out in the long run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fastlane isn't about the long run. It isn't about the future, or the past. It's about the NOW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter where you go, there's always people willing to devote themselves to feeding their carnal appetites, indulging their whims, burning their candles at both ends knowing full well that at any time they can burn out. These people don't think about the future any more than necessary - either by choice or through circumstance, they just try to make it through each day, one at a time, consequences be damned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is best played with a roulette wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
