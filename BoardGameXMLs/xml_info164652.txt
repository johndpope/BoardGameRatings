			<description>In the middle age the most important quest was for the nobles to rule the biggest areas and get as many influence as possible. Sometimes the marriages with other noble families didn't bring the expected result, so armies were sent to get the coveted lands. Enormous armies rumbled through Europe and nobody had a chance to escape. Sometimes the warlords sacreficed even their own soldiers to get their coveted victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's task to get the most valuable areas from their enemies. They have to send their armies and care about the defenses achieving their goals. The player with the most valuable areas wins the game. The rule contain 45 puzzles with growing difficulty. On your turn you have to place a soldier from your own stock onto the board. If you move to a location which is occupied by an enemy force, you can attack it, if your soldier has the same or higher rank as the enemy's soldier. Every player has 14 soldier and your goal is obtaining as most point as possible at the end of the game by getting the most valuable and biggest areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
