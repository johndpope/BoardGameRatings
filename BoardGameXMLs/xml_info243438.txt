			<description>Pirates Chase Game is a simple spin-and-move game for 2 players. One player plays the part of the Pirates (who controls 3 ships) and the other player is the Cargo Ship Captain (who controls 1 ship). The object of the game is for the Pirate player to land exactly on the same space as the Cargo Ship with on of his ships, thus winning the game for the pirates. If the Cargo Ship is able to make it once around the board without being sunk, then the Cargo Ship Captain player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
