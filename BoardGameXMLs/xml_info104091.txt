							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Babylon 5 Wars: Wars of the Centauri Republic</name>
									
			<description>Hundreds of years before Babylon 5 was built, the Centauri Republic was known as the &amp;quot;Lion of the Galaxy,&amp;quot; controlling dozens of worlds and dominating its region of space. While the people of Earth were still launching space shuttles, the Centauri fought a war with another Galactic power, the Orieni Imperium. Two starfaring nations could not be more opposite in their goals and politics, and conflict between them was inevitable from their first meeting. When the Orieni War finally began, it would change the face of the Galaxy forever! This book includes a complete history of that war, including backgrounds, maps, technology, and over 40 different ships used during the conflict. 92 pages. Showdowns-8 and Variants-6 will support this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
