			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the black 3-ring binder that holds the core rules for Lords of Space are all the rules needed for play. In Lords of Space, each player take on the role of a Planetary Leader (or PL) sometimes cooperating and sometimes at odds with the other players. The GM in Lords of Space, called the Overlord, has essentially godlike powers over the game. He or she acts as an intermediary in almost all player interactions; takes the role of the populace of each civilization; creates media stories (some based on player action and some not), manages large scale space battles (with the help of a small amount of charts and tables); determines the success or failure of missions, research projects, attempts at exploration based on written plans submitted by each player; and even plays the role of each player's trusted team of advisers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More opened-ended than most RPGs of the era, about half the binder is dedicated to helping the Overlap with the various fine points of game play. The game comes with a small set of Appendices that assist the Overlord with adding chance elements into the outcome of events. Also included are the various forms that each player needs to track their military, government spending, missions, etc. This core set includes Scenario One: The Galaxy of Cerberus, which itself comes with a small packet of Overlord Secrets to spice up game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;J. A. Gregory seems to be solely responsible for this product and he even goes so far as to dedicate the game, at least in part, to himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
