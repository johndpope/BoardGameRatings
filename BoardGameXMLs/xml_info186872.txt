			<description>Elephant Gift Exchange is the most fun you can have playing one of the crappiest games there is. You know those lame Christmas gift exchange games you are always plagued with at Christmas parties. We give you a super charged, fast paced version of that crappy game but in a simple 5-minute game with hilarious present cards. Presents range from pop culture taboo items to a multitude of adult humor items. You will spend more time laughing about what present you just had then you will playing the actual game. Additionally we include one blank card so you can add your own family members and terrible gifts to your game. Pass the cards, laugh with each other, and whoever has the winner gift &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; the game once all the foolish presents are opened.  Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One card in the game is labeled as the &amp;quot;Winner&amp;quot; and one as the &amp;quot;Loser&amp;quot;. Roll the die, pass your crap however the die tells you to then, when the last player opens their present by turning it face up (unwrapped) the game is over. Whomever has the &amp;quot;Winner&amp;quot; card is the winner of their great, exciting, and fantastically crappy game. If no player has the &amp;quot;Winner&amp;quot; card, then the player with the &amp;quot;Loser&amp;quot; card is just the big loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
