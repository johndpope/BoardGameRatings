			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freedom Needs You!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are times when superheroes like the Freedom League just aren't around: that's where you come in. You're the first line of defense when a super-villain rampages through midtown or a clone army attacks the city. You hold the line and keep the city, the nation, and the world safe, and you do it without super-powers or some fancy costume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agents of Freedom details &amp;quot;agent&amp;quot; level characters and adventures for Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds, including suggested power levels for four different styles of game, how to create agent characters, details on skill use and feats, and agent archetypes like the Dashing Spy and Hard-Nosed Commander. It also includes plenty of agent equipment, from weapons and gadgets to suped-up vehicles and secret headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agents of Freedom features three heroic agencies and one villanious one for the Freedom City setting:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The STAR Squad: the Freedom City Police Department's Superhuman Tactics and Regulation division; top cops charged with the task of arresting super-powered criminals, most of whom aren't inclined to go peacefully!&lt;br/&gt;     AEGIS: the American Elite Government Intervention Service, the U.S. government agency dealing with super-powered threats. Learn about their history of conflict, their elite agents, and their secret headquarters and equipment, as well as the agency's current agenda.&lt;br/&gt;     UNISON: the United Nations International Superhero Oversight Network, gathering information on threats to the world. Read the checkered history of the agencies that came before and where UNISON is going.&lt;br/&gt;     SHADOW: the Secret Hierarchy of Agents for Domination Over the World! The clone minions of the sinister Overshadow give your agents legions of foes, and the members of the organization's ruling Penumbra offer masterminds for endless plots, from the sorcery of the Crimson Mask to the terrorist front organization of Overthrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also use all the information in Agents of Freedom to supplement your Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds superhero games set in Freedom City, with allies for your heroes and new villains for them to fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by award-winning author Scott Bennie, Agents of Freedom has everything you need to run your own super-agent adventures and campaigns, including an introductory adventure - &amp;quot;Return of SHADOW&amp;quot; - for a new Agents of Freedom series. The world thinks SHADOW is no more, but true evil never dies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So suit up, agent! Freedom City and the world need you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
