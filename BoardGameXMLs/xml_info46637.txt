							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monastyr</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Monastyr is a Polish role-playing game set in a dark fantasy world of Dominium. Its setting features a fantastic equivalent of the Age of Enlightenment. Most often, the game plays in a cloak and dagger mood and involves plotting, intrigue, but also struggle in the name of honour. The game has been inspired by such authors as Alexandre Dumas, p&amp;egrave;re, Michael Moorcock and H. P. Lovecraft. It is published by Wydawnictwo Portal (Portal Publishing House) and it is currently available only in Polish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not shy from dealing with serious issues such as religion or race. The players have to play humans, and they are all followers of a certain monotheistic religion. The human countries, tied together with that religion, are involved in a long struggle against all other races (elves, dwarves, orcs, etc.); their religion dictates that all of those races are doomed and beyond salvation, and must be exterminated for their own good. Magic is also considered a sign of a devil or demons, so there are no (overt) mage characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The corebook, Monastyr, does not describe the lands of non-humans, instead it concentrates on the human empire, which, while united by a single faith and church, is composed of over fifty separate countries, each involved in various struggles, political or military, with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monastyr mechanics are based around the 3d20 system.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Monastyr,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
