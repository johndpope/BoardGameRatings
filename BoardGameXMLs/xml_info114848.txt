							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroic Vehicles</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Plug-In system for the Fuzion game system, which essentially adapts the Vehicle rules for the HERO System into Fuzion. This Plug-In also utilizes a few of the rules options presented in The Ultimate Vehicle, or at least uses mechanics which make options from TUV usable, making that book much more relevant to the Fuzion system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of its generic nature, the Heroic Vehicle Plug-In should be usable for all types of vehicles, from automobiles to starships, from flying carpets to giant robots, and from flying skateboards to the Death Star, from motorboats to time machines. Even all-new vehicle types, never before seen, can be created. The scope is really limited only by the user&amp;rsquo;s imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it should be noted that only the vehicle itself is detailed in this Plug-In. Weapons and other equipment should be built with a Powers Plug-In, as noted below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
