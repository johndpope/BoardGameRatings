							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ben 10 Alien Force Challenge</name>
									
			<description>This game comes in a plastic suitcase, with a quite large board, 120 cards and two dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a kind of roll and move game, but special rules make the playing time longer and the gameplay more exciting. On certain places of the board there are specific 'challenges' or random 'challenges' according to the card the player takes. Challanges can be solved by a 12-sided die, and even 3 helper cards can add a bonus. For every solved challenge the player gets so called 'Omnitrix' cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to use a 6-sided die for moving, but only the numbers 1, 2 and 3 can be found on it, and if they roll 3 then they may move backward, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends for a player when he/or she reaches the center of the board, however the winner is the player with the most Omnitrix card. So it's a good strategy to move back every time if possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story according to the prologue from the rulebook is that Ben Tennyson and his team (Kevin Levin and Gwen Tennyson) look for a 4th person to the team. The players compete for this opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
