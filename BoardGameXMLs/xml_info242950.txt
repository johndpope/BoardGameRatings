			<description>A small memory game consisting of just nine cards showing fours geckos each. The geckos on each card have different colors, and every color is on exactly six of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shown face up so the players can memorize the geckos, then they are turn face-down. &lt;br/&gt;A color is chosen randomly, and one player asks the other to either turn over four cards showing a gecko of that color, or two colors not showing a gecko of that color.&lt;br/&gt;If the other player manages to do that, they get a point, otherwise not. Then it's the second players turn to randomly choose a color and ask the first player to show or not show geckos in that color.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after all points are distributed. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
