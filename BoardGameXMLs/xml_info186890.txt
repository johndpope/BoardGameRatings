							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Who&#039;s the Princess?</name>
									
			<description>A fantastic educational game from the multi-award winning Chimp and Zee range of games and puzzles. Each child plays the part of a princess, who needs to collect a pair of shoes, a tiara, a ball gown, and an invitation. Once all the items are collected, the player places them in their own coach, in order to be the first to go to the ball but each player needs to watch out for the wicked queen. The first player to collect all 4 cards and get back to their castle space is the real Princess. This game is great fun for children and easy for parents to explain. This game can help children learn through play. Easy to set up you can start playing in just a few minutes and everyone has a chance to win. Only takes ten minutes to play and is even great fun when it's not your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who's the Princess was created to help children with colours, shapes, matching, and co-ordination along with developing the ability to play together. The game is presented in a quality cardboard carton complete with carry-handle and glitter printing. This game is for 2 - 4 players and suitable for ages 3 years and over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
