							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jane&#039;s Deception</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctor Elias Poole was a freelance researcher who worked by and for himself, making breakthroughs on his own and then contracting out to whichever foundation or corporation required those breakthroughs. He&amp;rsquo;d had a few setbacks, but lately things had been looking up. He had made a series of minor advances that gave others a framework to build upon; and he&amp;rsquo;d met Jane, a beautiful young woman who hung on his every word and denied him nothing, including her passion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But since he had made his discoveries, he had started to reflect more on the future ramifications of his work. Lacking others to talk to who would understand, he tried discussing the subject with Jane, who would just give him a blank stare, tell him not to worry about it, and start doing those things she knew always&amp;hellip;distracted him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast-forward to this morning: Jane finally blew up at Doc, saying he should just keep at his work and not worry about what comes after. That's when he finally put his foot down; he would stop work on his research altogether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She really didn't like hearing that...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jane&amp;rsquo;s Deception is a cyberpunk adventure, set in the near future (anytime within the next 25-75 years) for use with David Black&amp;rsquo;s The Black Hack. When an acquaintance in the scientific community is killed, and his data stolen, the heroes find themselves in a struggle to get it back from the con woman who stole it before she can sell it to the highest bidder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
