							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arthurian Ghost Knights</name>
									
			<description>'Arthurian Ghost Knights is a game of conflict for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  The players represent deceased Arthurian knights, fighting evil spirits for glory at Stonehenge.  Each turn, you draw a card, then play a card from your hand.  If it's your color, you simply place one of your guards at any trilithon.  If it's an opponent's color, you place one of her guards at a trilithon, and gain glory for &amp;quot;helping&amp;quot; her, and get to place a sword (bar) on the altar stone.  If it's black, it's Morgan Le Fay's, and you may do either, but getting no reward for &amp;quot;helping&amp;quot; an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four times during the game - two random times in the first half, two random times in the second half - there will be a struggle round followed by a scoring round.  During the struggle round, you use the swords you have on the altar stone, each coupled with a card, to forcibly alter the situation at the trilithons, jockeying for positions that will gain you the most glory:  If you play a card of your color, you add one of your guards to any trilithon.  Playing a card of an opponent's color lets you remove one of her guards from any trilithon.  Playing a black card (Morgan Le Fay) lets you do either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the struggle is done, the scoring occurs.  At each trilithon, the player with a plurality of guards gets one glory for each guard she has there - double if you're alone there.  In a tie, everyone gets their respective glory there.  If you have a guard at each of the five trilithons, you get 5 glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the fourth scoring round (or someone gets lapped!), the game is over.  The player with the most glory wins!  (There are a couple of tie-breakers.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arthurian Ghost Knights is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
