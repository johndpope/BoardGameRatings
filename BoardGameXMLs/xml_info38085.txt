							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orkworld Quest</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card &amp;amp; Dice game for 2-4 players. Based on the Orkworld RPG by John Wick. Each player controls a Tribe (Gathum) of Orks.&amp;quot; Solo play rules are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Use Metal or plastic figures to represent your Population. 1 Figure = 1 Ork.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also uses a custom deck of cards composed of nine types of cards: Foe, Weapon, Armor, Tribal Item, Personal Item, Personal Modifier, Tribal Modifier, Battle Event, and Non-Battle Event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players attempt to build their tribes into effective fighting forces in order to defeat Foe cards played on the tribes by other players. Defeating a Foe card increases a Tribe's Fame Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to taking casualties in battle, other circumstances will affect the population of the players' tribes. Each turn a hunting roll is made to determine whether conditions will result in any increase or decrease in population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: The first player to accumulate 25 Fana (Fame) points and survive is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
