							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Tsushima Strait (1905)</name>
									
			<description>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students. The game is designed to be played on a 5x7 foot table or any similar flat surface. Free print-and-play paper miniatures (flats) are provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simplified order of battle only includes Battleships and Armored Cruisers; the impact of Destroyers and Torpedo Boats is represented abstractly. The Japanese fleet consists of four Battleships and eight Armored Cruisers. The Russian fleet is composed of twelve Battleships and three Armored Cruisers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Battle of Tsushima Strait was one of the most decisive naval battles in history . . . Of the 45 ships in the Russian fleet, only two destroyers, a light cruiser, and six other smaller vessels survived the ensuing battle, while the Japanese only lost three torpedo boats. Japanese casualties were approximately 600 compared to the 6000 Russians killed or wounded.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
