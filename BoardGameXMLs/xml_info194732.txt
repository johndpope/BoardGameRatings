			<description>User summery:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This complicated and atypical game was published as a series of rules segments on an off-forum site (no longer available) prior to being compiled into two major forum posts for the official contest entry.  The final postings used &amp;quot;ASCII art&amp;quot; to represent a character sheet and an action table layout, as well as including links to an off-forum site with PDF versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are defined by three scores (Attributes) in Extrovert, Introvert, and Essence.  Characters also have Motifs (very vaguely like Skills) and Tools.  Action resolution involves an interplay of dice rolls, modulo division, and action table reference.  Characters compete against each other to gain &amp;quot;transcendence&amp;quot; into a hypothetical tenth chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was the winner of the Iron Game Chef 2002 competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
