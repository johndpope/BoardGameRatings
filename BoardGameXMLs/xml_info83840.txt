			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zarrakan is a diceless narrative role-playing game (RPG) with no set genre that focuses more on storytelling than detailed rules. There are no experience points in Zarrakan that reward individual characters for being the center of action in lieu of teamwork. EX: It is perfectly acceptable for a character to hang back, and do nothing but use healing skills on its fellow party members. It does not matter that the character is not the center of action since it won&amp;rsquo;t be missing out on experience points. Plus, the character&amp;rsquo;s healing skill activities would enable the rest of the party to concentrate on other tasks not related to healing. Please keep this information in mind when creating and playing Zarrakan characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a free demo version of the Zarrakan rules, including the core mechanics necessary to run the game, but with few examples and no setting information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
