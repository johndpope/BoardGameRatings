			<description>Road trip is an unusual counting game in which the only choice is how many dice to roll.  Each player has stones of one color, which are arranged in a line of alternating colors.  If playing with two players, each player has two colors.  Whoever's color is first in line decides how many dice to roll (one to five), rolls the dice and counts down the line.  If the stone matches the first stone in line, it is captured.  If not, the two stones switch position.  The winner is the first person to capture six stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road Trip was first published as a Cheapass ad in the 1999 program book for ShoreCon, a gaming convention in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
