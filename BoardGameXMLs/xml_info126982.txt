			<description>Statistical soccer game from the master of such quick replay games. Based on statistics culled from both the indoor and outdoor soccer leagues in America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team is rated for each year and a simple dice roll decides the result. This way you could play a season in one evening, I think that was the aim of the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
