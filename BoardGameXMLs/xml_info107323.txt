			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game presents the player with the ability to put together a virtual puzzle. There are a surprising number of modes in this game. Picture Puzzles is the basic mode. Within this you can choose Classic (the pieces are all spread out) or Turbo (the pieces are all arranged in orderly rows. You can also choose between Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert. The number of pieces can be altered from 12-1000. Even the puzzle pieces' shapes can be changed. Another mode is Dynamic Puzzle in which the main image shifts over time. Xbox Live Vision Camera allows you to create your own puzzle. Weekly Puzzle provides a new puzzle each week. Gamers can save the game so that they can pick up where they left off later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player is also available with this game. This can be played with up to 4 players either co-op or competitively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
