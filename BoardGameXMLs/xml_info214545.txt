							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conan: Xavier Collette Guest Box</name>
									
			<description>Xavier Collete Guest Box - a guest artist expansion for the Conan game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;B&amp;ecirc;lit sprang before the blacks, beating down their spears. She turned toward Conan, her bosom heaving, her eyes flashing. Fierce fingers of wonder caught at his heart. She was slender, yet formed like a goddess at once lithe and voluptuous. Her only garment was a broad silken girdle. Her white ivory limbs and the ivory globes of her breasts drove a beat of fierce passion through the Cimmerian's pulse, even in the panting fury of battle. Her rich black hair, black as a Stygian night, fell in rippling burnished clusters down her supple back. Her dark eyes burned on the Cimmerian.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Robert E. Howard, Queen of the Black Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion lets you bring alternate versions of Conan the Barbarian and B&amp;ecirc;lit, as envisioned by the amazing and highly praised artist Xavier Collette, to your tabletop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of Conan is King Conan! Tall and unbowed, aged, yet wise, he remains a mighty warrior, leading his men from the front as he cleaves through his enemies! This Conan may not be as mobile as his younger self, but he remains a strong fighter who can count on the men he leads to shore up any weaknesses with the Commander skill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B&amp;ecirc;lit the Princess is a very prominent character in Conan&amp;rsquo;s life as well as a fan favourite. This incarnation gives you a more experienced and lofty B&amp;ecirc;lit, a true Queen of the Black Coast. She has one of the highest skill counts in the game, can support her allies and retains much of the combat prowess of her other incarnations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Two miniatures (King Conan and B&amp;ecirc;lit) and their two character sheets (one side in French, the other in English).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
