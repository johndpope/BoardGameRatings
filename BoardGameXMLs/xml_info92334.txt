							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pinball Quest</name>
									
			<description>The game is short, with six linear stages of gameplay. The player controls a ball-shaped character in the castle scenes and controls flippers used to shoot the pinball in the other scenes, at which time the pinball has no control over itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many scenes the objective is to shoot the ball into an opening or kill an enemy by striking it with the ball. Accomplishing these objectives allows the player to advance to the next stage of the game. Upgrades that add abilities to the flippers and/or ball can be purchased during castle scenes with gold earned throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game also features three more traditional pinball tables. Golf, circus, and Americana are the themes to the tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pinball Quest&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
