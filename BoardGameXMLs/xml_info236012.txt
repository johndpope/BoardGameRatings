							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Macintosh SE</name>
									
			<description>The Macintosh SE is a personal computer that was designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from March 1987 to October 1990. This computer marked a significant improvement on the Macintosh Plus design and was introduced by Apple at the same time as the Macintosh II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It had a similar case to the original Macintosh computer, but with slight differences in color and styling. An enhanced model, the SE/30 was introduced in January 1989; sales of the original SE continued, with an update following in August of that year to include a SuperDrive. The Macintosh SE was replaced with the Macintosh Classic, a very similar model which retained the same central processing unit and form factor, but at a lower price point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifications&lt;br/&gt;    Processor: Motorola 68000, 8 MHz&lt;br/&gt;    System Bus Speed: 8 MHz&lt;br/&gt;    ROM Size: 256 kB&lt;br/&gt;    Data Path: 16-bit Level 1&lt;br/&gt;    RAM Type: 150 ns 30-pin SIMM&lt;br/&gt;    VRAM Type: Built-in&lt;br/&gt;    Standard RAM: 1 MB&lt;br/&gt;    Maximum RAM: 4 MB&lt;br/&gt;    RAM Slots: 4 (in pairs)&lt;br/&gt;    Standard Hard Drive: 20 MB&lt;br/&gt;    Int.
