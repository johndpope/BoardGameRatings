			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I've come to believe that the recent temple desecrations are being performed by the Hidden Ones, in order to stir up sentiment against the Fomor spirit cults. And it's working. If someone doesn't do something, we're going to see lynch mobs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situations like the one quoted from above can be a bit of a trick to set up believably. It's often even more of a trick to make sure that the players care about them; many Guides have spent enormous amounts of time creating intricate scenarios nobody was all that interested in. This is a way to put together such situations that faces down both of those concerns. You'll need the record sheet for power plays, and a blank piece of paper (which can be the back of that sheet).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
