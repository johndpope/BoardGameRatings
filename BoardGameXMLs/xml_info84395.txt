			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Signed &amp;amp; Numbered Limited editions of The Dying of St Margaret&amp;rsquo;s, The Watchers in the Sky, and the brand new monstrous adventure, The Dance in the Blood. Signed, numbered and designed by the author, Graham Walmsley, these are truly a collectors item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bundle includes all three of the authors bone-chilling Purist scenarios,  only for the most stalwart and, some may even say, foolhardy, of Investigators:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Dance in the Blood &amp;ndash; In a forgotten corner of Northern England, between the rolling hills  and tranquil dales nestles a village plagued by terrible secrets and  subterranean horrors.&lt;br/&gt;     The Watchers in the Sky - A madman feeds the birds, paranoid they are watching him. Later, the same strange birds stare from the rooftops, warping the laws of physics and chemistry. And, when the Investigators dissect one of the creatures, they find something monstrous inside.&lt;br/&gt;     The Dying of St Margaret&amp;rsquo;s - On the remote Scottish island of St Margaret&amp;rsquo;s, Investigators take jobs at an all-girls private school. Each is searching for an acquaintance who disappeared from the school.  But what they discover will drive them to the edge of insanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This bundle of three adventures is limited to only 50 Signed &amp;amp; Numbered copies, including PDFs of each limited edition plus PDFs of the original releases, and is available exclusively through Pelgrane Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
