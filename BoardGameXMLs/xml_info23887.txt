							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rage! Game</name>
									
			<description>The Rage! Game is very similar to the better known game Aggravation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board game is a cross made of two plastic halves, and when put together it forms a track of many dimples along the perimeter.  Each player has 4 marbles that they move along the track from their starting position, trying to get them into home, after traversing the board.  There are 5 dimples in the middle of the board that you can use as a short cut, but you need to roll specific numbers to use it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on another player's marble by exact count, you move it back to its starting position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
