							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fringe Wars</name>
									
			<description>On a desolate fringe-world, miners discover powerful technology buried in the ruins of an ancient alien civilization. Soon the wasteland erupts in conflict as desperate factions vie for control of the region.  Mercenaries from far-away lands converge on the wastes: tech-wizards, warriors in robotic armor, zog-riders and archaeologists, all eager to be hired and join in the impending struggle.  Battle is coming.  Rally your forces and outgun the opposition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fringe Wars is a fast-paced board game where 2-5 players lead small, competing factions hell-bent on controlling the wasteland and procuring the alien artifacts it holds.  Players use hero cards to recruit and deploy troops, and fight for control of key locations.  Hero cards can be used in combinations to make actions stronger, and deciding how to use each card is vital to winning.  Players attack each other and the vicious beasts that live in the wasteland to take control of territories.  The player who is able to obtain the most alien artifacts through the heated battle is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
