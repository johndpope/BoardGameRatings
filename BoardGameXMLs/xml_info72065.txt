			<description>Hostile Stars is a tabletop miniatures wargame of tactical starship combat.  The game covers fleet scale battles with ships being grouped into squadrons led by flagships.  Players choose to allocate Reactor Points to perform movement and combat actions.  The movement system is based in 2 dimensions with some 3D considerations and the combat rules cover a variety of weapon types.  There are additional rules governing how ships are affected by the gravity and atmosphere of nearby planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hostile Stars is designed for use with Dark Realm Miniatures but may be used with any starship minis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules, ship stats, and player aids may be downloaded for free from The Dark Realm Miniatures website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
