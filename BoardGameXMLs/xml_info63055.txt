			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet Some Brand New Bad Guys...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure you love to terrorize and destroy your players (who doesn't?!). But sometimes do you find that the zip of mass mayhem isn't quite as zippy? Well, fear not! We know EXACTLY what you need - BRAND NEW BAD GUYS!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first installment in a long-awaited line of supplements for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible Roleplaying Game, the Book of Bad Guys #1 is a big, bold collection of ten completely original, brand-spanking-new Bad Guys ready to crawl up out of the sewer, swamp or nightmare and onto your gaming table. You won't find tired, warmed-over old critters like werewolves and zombies, either, but ten never-before-seen and totally creeperific baddies designed to terrify, possess, torment, devour and otherwise bring harm to your players. Armed with this supplement, you'll be prepared to unleash such terrors as the &amp;quot;Black Thought,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;Ravenous Shadow,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;Vine Killer&amp;quot; and the sinister, diabolical (and ever-popular) &amp;quot;Leroy Jenkins!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
