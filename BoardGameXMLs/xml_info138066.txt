			<description>A family game based on the Swedish television show with the same name, hosted by Harald Treutiger. The goal of the game is to advance to the final act where you get to see if you got what it takes to win the elusive gold bar. You do this by drawing cards that have all kinds of weird statements on them, put money on if they are either true or false and then roll dice to tell who was right. This is mixed with some contextual statements like for example &amp;quot;will the phone ring during the game session?&amp;quot;. Though usually it's mostly a game of plain luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
