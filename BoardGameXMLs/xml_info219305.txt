							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Krilling Field</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Krilling Field, up to four players compete against each other to become heir to the Blubbulous Throne and ruler of the ocean. It's a card game played on a randomized map, where the object is to discover defensive outposts and fortify them against the onslaught of the Deep Krillord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protecting your home is a wonderful thing to do with friends, but King Blubbulous only has one throne to give to a heroic whale, so you might as well sabotage your fellow whales along the way. There are over 60 abilities and organisms to aid you in your quest, from swordfish assassins to deep-ocean ectoplasm. Or, if being a hero isn't your style, aid the Krillord in usurping the Blubbulous throne and bring terror to the Krilling Field in his evil name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Krilling Field takes between thirty minutes and one hour to play, and every game has completely rearranged terrain, with players altering the shape, size, and order of the playing field at will. While it is possible (but unlikely) to exhaust the multitude of unique locations in a single game, it takes most players between five and ten playthroughs to discover every card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Krilling Field includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Player Whales&lt;br/&gt;Twelve Blubbulous Pearls&lt;br/&gt;Eight Non-Player Ocean Denizens&lt;br/&gt;Fifty-six Munition Cards&lt;br/&gt;Thirty-six Ocean Cards&lt;br/&gt;Thirty Deeps Cards&lt;br/&gt;One Ocean Indicator Card&lt;br/&gt;One Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
