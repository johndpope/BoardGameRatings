							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mana War</name>
									
			<description>Mana War is an original card game created with the spirit of simplicity, inclusion, and creativity in mind. There are 50 cards in the game (5 suits: Sun, Water, Fire, Rock, and Leaf; 10 of each). There are no numbers or values to the cards, no text to read or instructions to follow on the cards themselves. In fact, the games are so simple, the rules for the 4 included games each fit on a single card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning one of the Mana War games ranges from completing a grid of cards with unique rows and columns by yourself to a team effort of wit and luck to bluffing your way to be the sole winner in a cut-throat battle of memory and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of Mana War was to create games which are so simple to learn, a small child or a drunk person could pick it up easily. This was achieved by having incredibly simple game components and designing game rules which challenge players to think logically while only needing to remember basic colors/shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
