			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight amazing pregenerated characters ready to conquer the world! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Righteous Heroes is our fourth set of 8 society-legal (with one exception), fully fleshed-out, ready-to-play pregenerated 1st level characters created specifically to shine in a Righteous Crusade Adventure Path. These characters are ideal for any campaign delving into demon-haunted wastelands, as the stalwart sentinels of law and goodness stand against the tide of evil and charge forth toward mythic glory in turning back the forces of darkness once and for all! Superstar author Neil Spicer proudly presents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Briathos Tassiel, aasimar purifier oracle&lt;br/&gt;    Caric Solnebren, human oathbound paladin of the Goddess of Valor&lt;br/&gt;    Emerina Vestelle, tiefling infiltrator inquisitor of the Goddess of Dreams&lt;br/&gt;    Illemandir Ziruul, half-elf arctic druid (menhir savant)&lt;br/&gt;    Jilani Safiro, human wildblooded empyreal sorcerer&lt;br/&gt;    Loric Solnebren, human sanctified rogue&lt;br/&gt;    Norgrym Hammerfell, dwarf crusader cleric of the God of Strategy&lt;br/&gt;    and last but not least, the mysterious Tessara Artinesse, elf synthesist summoner (banned in society play but awesome for your home game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built using the 20-point-buy method for use in organized play scenarios as well as home campaigns, with scaling notes for 15-point builds, these characters are not just a pile of stats. Each pregen is as much about story as combat, but rest assured that when it&amp;rsquo;s time to thrown down, none of these pregens will be stepping to the sidelines. Print these heroes out and double-dip them in the stuff adventures are made of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each PC also includes a backstory, roleplaying tips, special equipment, and links to the published campaign, including a campaign trait selection from AP player&amp;rsquo;s guide. Each also lists specific level advancement information for their first few levels, with further suggestions for developing the character&amp;rsquo;s long-term mechanical build. We haven&amp;rsquo;t even mentioned the fantastic character portraits courtesy of Tanyaporn Sangsnit, Lance Red, and Colby Stevenson, or the included foldable paper miniatures for every character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of our products are geared for the hardworking GM, but this one is for every gamer out there. If you are a player, these PCs should provide endless opportunities for adventure. If you are a GM, you can use these pregenerated characters as NPCs, cohorts, allies, or rivals. Even if you mostly play or run organized play &amp;ldquo;society&amp;rdquo; adventures, with a few tweaks these PCs will work for you, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out this fantastic 31-page character accessory and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
