							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dream Star</name>
									
			<description>This is a fortune telling game for girls. The Dream Star is an electronic star whose points are aimed at the card stacks of the game's 5 categories - Love, Style, Achievement, Coming Soon, and Surprise! A player waves her hand over the Dream Star causing lights on the points to spin around like a roulette wheel and eventually point at a category. The card reveals your future (Will you live in a foreign city? Marry a famous actor? Receive a special email?), and also tells you how many spaces to move on the track. The first player to reach the finish space with a card from all 5 categories wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
