			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re having an awful dream. That must be it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday afternoon while walking through the park a crazy, old white haired guy in a lab-coat jumped out from behind a tree and told you that you were the most important person in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you tried to walk past and ignore him, he said some things; things that he could not have known. Then, while he had you confused, he showed you his car: a silver DeLorean with crazy gizmos attached to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time you snapped out of your haze, crazy labcoat-guy already had you strapped into the passenger seat and had started the engine. Then, the car took off into the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last thing you remember is one of the car-gizmos shooting something into the air, then an explosion . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now something sharp keeps jabbing you in the small of the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
