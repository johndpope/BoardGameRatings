			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 48 inch by 30 inch, floor plan of an Ice Wall, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take out their power and that ice wall will crumble.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice Wall is a single external view map of a U-shaped fortress built into a rocky hill or mountain and covered with snow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the internal map, you could use our SciFi Tiles and/or Airlock 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice Wall is intended for use in near or far future science fiction games. It could also be used in modern games as a high tech base or a super villain&amp;rsquo;s high tech lair in a super hero game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice Wall can be used with our Ice Base Nivayohce as a defensive fortification protecting the base ([In front of the base). It could be also used with our The Protocusor as a defensive fortification trying to defend the downed starship as crews try to repair the vessel (Located behind the map overlooking the ice field the starship crashed into).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Break the Wall: The orders have come in and its war. The ice wall has to be crushed so that the next stage of the invasion may proceed. The attackers are bringing in a full contingent of land vehicles and terrestrial capable fighters with their main target being the two generators that supply power to the lasers and fortress. The most critical units are the bombers to try and bomb the generators into oblivion and the special forces which will try to land near the fortress entrance and infiltrate the facility to sabotage it during the thick of combat. The attackers need to defend these units till they can get to the base against ten laser turrets and the ice wall&amp;rsquo;s own land vehicles and fighters launched from hangars inside the fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters can get involved by being a part of the ice wall defense team or being a part of the attacking force. If they are defending the ice wall, they can man laser turrets or drive land vehicles or fly fighters to enter the battlefield and fight the enemy. If they are part of the attacking squad they should be part of a bombing squad trying to knock out the generators or perhaps special forces paratroopers trying to land and sabotage the generators in the middle of the chaos and confusion of the massive battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
