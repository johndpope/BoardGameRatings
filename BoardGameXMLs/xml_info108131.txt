							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Chicks 4.1: Ladies of the Night Naked and in Distress</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time to set out the battle map - the one you're going to be staring at for the next few hours.  Why not fill it with some Hot Chicks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hot Chicks 4: Ladies of the Night, we introduced you to 48 unique and individual women practicing the world's oldest profession, dressed to draw attention and make money.  Now, those same 48 women are having a very bad day.  In &amp;quot;Hot Chicks 4.1: Ladies of the Night Naked and in Distress,&amp;quot; we see the &amp;quot;Ladies of the Night&amp;quot; bereft of their clothing, in poses and with expressions that indicate a situation of menace or danger!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideal as victims to populate dungeons, potential sacrifices, window-dressing for sadistic megalomaniacs, or even as figures of PCs having REALLY bad days, these 48 high quality Paper Miniatures (in the 25mm scale) will keep gamers' eyes glued to the battle map for hours at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing motivates a group of PCs to give it their all like a bevy of Hot Chicks, Naked and in Distress!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
