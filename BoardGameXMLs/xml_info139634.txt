			<description>In Scoralet, each player receives a small tray with a 5x5 grid of felted spaces.  Between the players on the table are placed square wooden tiles with letters on them.  Each player in turn calls out a letter and the other players pick this letter from the central pile and place it in one of the spaces on their tray.  Their goal is to spell out as many 3, 4, or 5 letter words as possible, left-to-right or top-to-bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all 25 spaces are filled.  5 letter words score 15 points, 4 letter words score 10, and three letter words score 5.  2 letter words do not score.  Smaller words within larger words also may score their own points, so long as the larger word is not simply a plural of the smaller.  In that case, only the larger plural word scores.  Proper names of people or places do not count unless agreed upon prior to the game's start.  Highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The distribution of the letter tiles breaks down for each player in the following manner:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a-3, b-2, c-1, d-2, e-3, f-1, g-1, h-1, i-2, j-1, k-1, l-2, m-1, n-2, o-3, p-2, q-1, r-2, s-2, t-2, u-2, v-1, w-1, x-1, y-1, z-1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This totals 42 tiles for each player.  Prior to start, the pile must be made of this many tiles for each player, and no more.  84 tiles for two, 126 tiles for three, 168 tiles for four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print ads from 1936 referred to this game as the &amp;quot;successor to Anagrams.&amp;quot;  Two editions were sold, a two-player edition for 50 cents and a four-player edition for 1 dollar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
