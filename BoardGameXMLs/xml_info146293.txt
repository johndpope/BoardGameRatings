			<description>This is Gosei; I&amp;rsquo;m a mentor to Zordon. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a deep sleep for thousands of years and have awakened because a great evil has now emerged and coming! The evil Insectoids are coming to conquer Earth &amp;ndash; it up to you Power Rangers to defeat this great evil.&lt;br/&gt;Admiral Malkor, leader of the Insectoids and his two henchmen Vrak and Creepox have hidden your Power Cards. You must find them Rangers in order to defeat their army of evil Insectoids to save earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting the Game&lt;br/&gt;Choose one of the five Megaforce Rangers or Robo Knight Character pawns. Place it in Gosei Command Center Space in center of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the Villain Power Levels up and place the Villains in the pawn holders. Place each evil Insectoid Villain in their Battle Space on the board, matching the Villain pawn with picture on the board.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle and place a Power Card face down next to each of the Villain Battle Spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn Summary&lt;br/&gt;Roll the die and move your pawn the number of spaces shown on the game board. You may not land on the same space twice during your turn. Players may share spaces on the board, but not Battle Spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Objective of the game is to defeat the evil Insectoids to obtain your Power Cards to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;Under each of the Insectoid&amp;rsquo;s pawn is a number. When you move your pawn on to this space secretly look under see the Villain Power Level. Roll the die; if number rolled is higher than Villain Power Level you win the battle! Take the Power Card (if able).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go Go Megaforce!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
