							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duel in the Desert: Rommel&#039;s Campaign in North Africa</name>
									
			<description>This strategic/operational level game, first published in The Wargamer Magazine (#51), is a double-blind simulation of Rommel's campaigns in North Africa during 1941 and 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neither player can see the map or units of his opponent.  The game begins with Rommel's breakout into Cyrenaica in 1941 and continues until either the Allied Torch landings in Nov. 1942 or one side gains a decisive victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is handled as in some naval games... by calling out hex numbers of the paths each unit travels.  When an enemy is spotted, a marker is placed to indicate location, but not strength.  A unit is revealed only when it ends its turn adjacent to an enemy unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control of El Aghiela, Tobruk, and Alexandria determine the level of victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules, 1.0 Introduction (p. 20):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;... Any simulation game must be a compromise between accuracy of simulation and simplicity of play. This game emphasizes limited intelligence, supply, and maneuver. It is also designed to be fairly simple to play. As a result, historical accuracy in other areas may not seem as great. A complete accurate simulation would be a much larger game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: 30 km per hex&lt;br/&gt;Time: 1 month per turn&lt;br/&gt;Counters: Some counters represent more than one (similar) historical unit over time&lt;br/&gt;Zone of Control: Yes&lt;br/&gt;Stacking: Yes (generally 5 brigades)&lt;br/&gt;Supply: Yes (line, source, net; supply units)&lt;br/&gt;Combat: CRT (Combat Results Table)&lt;br/&gt;Intelligence: Yes (ULTRA rules for allies, &amp;quot;Intelligence Reports&amp;quot; scheduled for both sides)&lt;br/&gt;Initiative: die roll (1-4 Axis, 5-6 Allied)&lt;br/&gt;Special Rules: Tripoli off-map box, Rommel leader benefits&lt;br/&gt;Optional Rules: British Armor Coordination, Tobruck Minefields, Alexandria Garrison, Disbanded Formations&lt;br/&gt;Tables &amp;amp; Charts: CRT, Column Shift SUmmary, Die Roll Modifiers; Reinforcement/Supply/Intelligence schedule&lt;br/&gt;Tracking Sheet form: Armor/Infantry replacement points, Intelligence notes or guesses.&lt;br/&gt;Counter Manifest: Yes except enemy unit indicators&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
