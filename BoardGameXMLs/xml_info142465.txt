							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elk Fest: Log Jam! Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Part of Mayfair Games Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #4, the Elk Fest: Log Jam! Expansion adds 4 log jam tiles to Elk Fest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Up: Set up Elk Fest normally.  Temporarily put one of the riverbank pieces roughly at the half-way point between the two starting riverbanks.  Mix up the Log Jam tiles and place them, log side up, by the corners of the riverbank.  Return the riverbank piece to its starting position, leaving the tiles in place in the middle of the play area.  You are now ready to begin normally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: When a log is hit by a stone the log remains where it lands (just like when a stone hits another stone).  Your moose can use a log to cross over the water just like a stone.  However, before moving the moose onto the log you must immediately &amp;quot;roll&amp;quot; the log over and place it roughly where it was positioned.  There are three possible results of a rolled log:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Logs (2 tiles): If you move onto a log, you must move your front feet to a stone by the end of your turn otherwise your &amp;quot;elk gets wet&amp;quot;.  You may not use the stone the you came from for your front hooves.  If you start your turn on a log, you must be off the log entirely before the end of your turn, otherwise your &amp;quot;elk gets wet&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;    Shaky Stones (1 tile): You may treat this like any stone, but as soon as you have left the tile, the stones are washed away and the tile is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;    Bear (1 tile): You can't enter this tile.  This tile remains in play bear side up and may be flicked instead of a stone as a blocker.  If it falls off the table the bear goes into hibernation until the next game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
