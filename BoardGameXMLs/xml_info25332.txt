			<description>These character/story based trading cards were made for spooky girls who have no interest in those angry little characters the boys seem to gravitate to. 16 orphaned girls each have their own unique story of how they became orphaned; each lost an object during their difficult time, developed a magic spell and adopted a pet monster. The girls are all somehow later involved in another tragic death. The cards have point values and there is a game that can be played regardless of how many cards have collected. 8 evil puppet cards are included in the full set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.therss.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=41&amp;amp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.therss.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=41&amp;...&lt;/a&gt;;osCsid=f295fa51966c4cc1ccb021aaff82597f&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.therss.com/creepychristine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.therss.com/creepychristine/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
