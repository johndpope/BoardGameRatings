			<description>From LateForTheSky.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STURDY, FRIENDLY, CURIOUS, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY... MEET THE BEAGLE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sturdy and merry little Beagle is one of the most popular dogs in the United States.  A member of the Hound Group, Beagles are scent hounds, developed primarily for tracking game.  Since they lived in packs for hundreds of years, they naturally enjoy the company of other dogs and humans.  Beagles are intelligent, but as a result of being bred for the long chase are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train.  Despite this, their happy-go-lucky nature and gentle disposition make them a wonderful family pet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEAGLE-OPOLY IS A GAME OF TAIL-WAGGING FUN!&lt;br/&gt;COLLECT YOUR FAVORITE BEAGLES AND PLAY HARD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increase your rent by buying Toys for your dogs and upgrading them to Big Bones.  Sounds easy enough until you get fleas, have an accident on the carpet, or worse yet, get sent to the kennel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRAB YOUR TOKEN AND ADVANCE TO GO BEAGLES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows!  You may soon be Best in Show... or marching in the Dog Parade!  Whatever happens, keep your wag on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
