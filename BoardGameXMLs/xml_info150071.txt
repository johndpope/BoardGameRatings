							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Wolf in Cheap Clothing</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A Wolf in Cheap Clothing&amp;quot; was my entry for the 2013 RPG Geek 24 Hour RPG Design Contest. The name just sort of popped into my head after I was done designing the game and realized I didn't have a title. I think the name is a nice fit for this Mystery/Noir/Detective setting. What originally got me thinking of this setting was a discussion about those old Charlie Chan movies, which I loved as a kid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wanted to be able to keep characters from being too min/maxed, thus the &amp;quot;assign a die&amp;quot; mechanic seemed like it might work. I'm not sure if other RPGs have ever used a similar mechanic. Flashbacks and Accolades are obviously similar to bennies, or hero points, two mechanics which I'm somewhat familiar with. The difference I liked about flashbacks was that they are really additional background story plots that are conceived during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I really wanted to attach an adventure (job/assignment) within the rules, but the time constrictions kept that on the drawing board. All in all, I spent about six or seven hours on the game design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
