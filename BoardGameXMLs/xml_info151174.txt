							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Modern Path: Arcana of the Modern World</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the Modern Path to a walk on the magical side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcana of the Modern World explores the different ways to incorporate the use of magic in a modern-style RPG genre. Building on the foundations of the Modern Path: Heroes of the Modern World. To compliment the Modern Hero class, there are new feats, traits, trainings, &amp;amp; difficulties; along with new magical Archetypes to customize the spell caster that you want to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major update to the just about all the old material and added:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     ARCANE OF THE FORBIDDEN - This setting is where magic is extremely rare and difficult to cast. This type of setting is typically what you would find in a modern &amp;ldquo;horror&amp;rdquo; setting.&lt;br/&gt;     ARCANE HEROES  - This setting is where magic is more common and what is normally found in the core rules of a fantasy based system. This section expands on the archetypes found in &amp;ldquo;The Modern Path &amp;ndash; Heroes of the Modern World&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     ARCANE OF THE MIND - This setting is not so much of a magic setting but rather a system of unique mental powers called &amp;ldquo;Psychic&amp;rdquo; abilities. Very similar to the more powerful psionics found in many fantasy settings but adjusted to provide a modern approach.&lt;br/&gt;     ARCANE OF THE SPELLCRAFTER - This setting is an alternate spellcasting system where magic is broken down into its basic form and can be applied in almost any configuration the user wishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
