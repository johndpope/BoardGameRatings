			<description>Let&amp;rsquo;s put in order the highest number of toys exactly recalling where they have been placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the chest of drawers on the table. Place the 6 toy tiles facedown in front of the drawers. Take a set of 12 shoe tiles.&lt;br/&gt;The current player takes a tile from the toy table, showing it to all, and puts it into any of the drawers. The turn passes to the next player, who will do likewise with the constraint of storing the card in the drawer below the previous one. The last two toy tiles stay on the table and will be considered as they were put on the floor.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle toy cards and assemble a card deck. Turn over all the cards, one at a time. All together the players should try to remember where to find that toy: place on the card a shoe tile with the colour of the drawer or with floor face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now check the actual position of the toys: did you recall where all toys have been placed? You won!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
