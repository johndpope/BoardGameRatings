			<description>Jintol is an abstract 2-player game and is played in 2 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the first round with an identical set of tiles ( 1 player black - 1 player white) and 3 action cards ( picked from a set of 8).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn each player places one of these 2x2 tiles on a 5x5 grid and/or plays an action card (depending on the type of card). When playing a tile, it is mandatory to cover at least one uncovered square of the 5x5 playing grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players keep placing new tiles until the 5x5 grid is completely covered with tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player counts how many squares of his colour are on top.&lt;br/&gt;The board is then cleared and the second round is played. While the tiles can be used again played cards cannot but each player can pick 3 new cards and if the player has any unplayed cards left he/she can use these as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the highest combined score of the 2 rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: JINTOL was invented by two mathematic geniuses from Keio University. It is a new game which requires intelligence and strategy skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
