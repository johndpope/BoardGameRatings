							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">River o&#039; Blood</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Got Mojo?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mighty Miss, Ol' Muddy, whatever you want to call it, the Mississippi's one Hell of a long river. Some folks say it's the artery of the nation, but that was back before this blasted Civil War that's been dragging on for 16 years now. North and South are divided on this mile-wide lady just as much as they are all across the continent. But that's just one small part of what's made this vital waterway a river of blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The River o' Blood boxed set comes packed tighter than gamblers on a riverboat casino with everything you need to know about the Old Miss and the people and predators who ply her currents. It features a 128-page sourcebook including the Tombstone Epitaph's Guide to the Mighty Mississippi, complete statistics for many of the boats that float over and even under the river's surface, and lots more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's also a double-sided, full-color poster with a street map of New Orleans on one side. The other side's got a diagram of a typical riverboat that's set to scale with our Weird West miniatures, making it perfect for playing on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, there are also two 32-page digests. The first, &amp;quot;Trouble A-Brewin',&amp;quot; is a full-length adventure set in the steamy Big Easy. The second booklet contains the long-awaited voodoo rules, which give you all the details you need to roleplay your own cunning voodooist in Deadlands: The Weird West. It gives you the lowdown on the loas (the voodoo gods) and all sorts of brand-new spells that any conjure doctor would be proud to call her own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, if you're looking for mojo, kid, step on in. You've come to the right place!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
