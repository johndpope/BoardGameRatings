							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Care Bears: Which Bears Where?</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple memory game for children. Six Care Bear cards are placed face down in the middle of the table and the players are dealt seven cards face down to form a pile. The six center cards are then turned face up for five seconds and then turned face down again. On a turn, you flip over the top card in your pile and then try to turn over the center card that matches it. If your right, you set the card aside. If your wrong, you place the card at the bottom of your pile. The first player to match all seven cards in their pile is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
