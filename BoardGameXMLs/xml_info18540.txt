			<description>POINT ZERO - The UNICEF Strategy Game is a roll and move and tile placement board game simulating the development of an under-developed region of the world by UNICEF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is divided into four regions, one for each player, representing a village in the African Bush, the Amazon Basin, the Sahel Belt or South East Asia. An information card for each area provides details of the kind of assistance required and the types of trained personnel required to provide it - this varies from region to region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to move their &amp;quot;Community Leader&amp;quot; around the outer circuit of the board the number of spaces determined by the roll of either one or two dice. In so doing the players collect (and on occasion lose) a variety of Community workers, Medics, Technicians, Teachers and Social workers. The directions in the spaces also initiate good or bad events in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At various points on the board these helpers can be used to develop part of their village. The player developing the Sahel Belt, for example, will need to construct a safe water supply, Milk Processing Plant, Health Care Center, School etc... Construction requires then right compliment of experts and may also cost points which are earned through completing circuits of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The construction undertaken and equipment purchased is represented on the board by a series of jig-saw pieces which are placed within a frame that is positioned over the game board. The pieces can be added into the frame in any order, but successful redevelopment of a village will require a total of 11 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player that is first to have successfully reconstructed his or her village by covering the developing area with 11 reconstruction pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
