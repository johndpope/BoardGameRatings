			<description>Prolog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the battle, stranger! You landed in a country with a dark past. The land before you is a battlefield of fierce struggles for possession and power, led by the ruthless nobility. On whose side will you fight? Will you command a powerful army of soldiers? Engage bandits from the underground, to weaken the enemy with raids? Or will you unite a group of scholars to force your opponents to their knees with the power of knowledge and avert the approaching danger of the undead?&lt;br/&gt;It's in your hands! Manage your resources, play powerful action cards, and gather the most diverse troops under your banner!&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Adellos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adellos is a turn-based tactical strategy board game for 2-4 players. Each player controls a medieval-fantasy nobleman, who hires various units and tries to overcome the other players. Each player has a different faction (Royal Army, Scum, Clergy &amp;amp; Undead) and the players have ten different units with unique skills to choose and control. They also have to manage their gold income and the flow of action cards that each player can use on their and enemies turns for effects that influence the game. Everything takes place on a symmetric battle map and every nobleman has a specific and unique skill that can influence the game from the start.&lt;br/&gt;Turns are played in two phases. During the first phase, players gain the resources their units provide. In the second phase, players hire units, move, attack, or play action cards. Every action costs a specific number of action points. The players start with three action points and an amount of gold, depending on their nobleman. Players can increase their action points throughout the game to build up huge turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
