							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show Log Cereal Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Reach into this package of log cereal and fish around.  What did you find?  If you're the first player to locate the pieces you need to complete your own comic strip puzzle based on one of eight actual TV episodes, you win.  But if anybody finishes the History Eraser strip first, this game never took place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a blank comic strip in front of them. The counters are placed in the box, thus creating a Log Cereal Box. The History Eraser strip is placed in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, a player reaches in to the Cereal Box and pulls out a counter. If it is the same colour as your comic strip, you add it to your strip. If it is a History Eraser counter, add it to the History Eraser comic strip in the middle of the table. If it is none of these things, place it back into the cereal box and shake the box well.&lt;br/&gt;If you pull out a log, various things might happen. All players might have to slide their comic strip to the person on their right or left. Or you might be able to take one counter of another player's comic strip and put it back into the box. And so on.&lt;br/&gt;One really annoying rule - if you draw one of your comic strip counters, before you add it to your strip you must quote a line from the show indicated on that particular counter. If you cannot or will not do this, you don't get to keep the counter - it goes back into the box.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete their strip, wins.&lt;br/&gt;However, if the History Eraser comic strip is completed before any player's strip, then the game is lost by all players.&lt;br/&gt;For die-hard Ren &amp;amp; Stimpy fans only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
