			<description>from ganakagok.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GANAKAGOK is a fantasy set in a dark ice-world, a mountain of ice looming up from a plain of snow, upon which live the Nitu people, a tribe of hunters and fishers who revere the Stars that perpetually shine down upon a world where the Sun has never risen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ganakagok, the characters are men and women of the Nitu who know that the Dawn is coming, and who begin to take action in anticipation of the rising of the Sun, to herald the Dawn or to oppose it. As the game progresses, the Dawn comes inexorably closer and closer. At the end of the game, the actions of the player-characters will have determined the fate of the world, the people, and the individual characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a tarot-like deck of cards created by me and designed by my friend Dave Petroski to inspire the in-game situation and constrain the consequences of character action. The impact of their use in play is to create a story that feels mythic to the players, giving the actions of their characters a kind of dream-logic and inevitability that is literally awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
