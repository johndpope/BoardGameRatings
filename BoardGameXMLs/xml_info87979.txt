			<description>The Space Game (TSG) is a 2D single player game created for the Casual Collective by Critters. The goal is to build a base in a remote solar system without being destroyed by Space Pirates, enemies that attack throughout the game. This is done by building a multitude of buildings, such as the Solar Station which creates energy, the Mineral Miner that retrieves building materials (minerals) from asteroids , and defensive laser cannons. All buildings are connected using Energy Relays, which transport energy from one place to another. Careful balancing of a mixture of buildings can be necessary on dome levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
