The steel troopers are exceptional professional soldiers equipped with the best weapons made by mankind, they are military efficiency embodied. Their task: lead the White Stars armies from the frontline and pierce the enemy lines to deal fire and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steel trooper units are the base on which the White Stars army is built. In their standard configuration, the five fighters are equipped with laser rifles, giving them one hell of a range to wipe the enemy before he even gets into shooting position.
