							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Postmodern: Fantastic Classes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the iconic fantasy classes has been stripped down to its barest essence and then reconstructed according to the structure of the basic Modern classes. Each is reconstituted in such a way that an individual player could use each class in its classic form, if they wished, but can also take advantage of the adaptability of Modern base classes to create a character who fills the class&amp;rsquo;s archetypal role in new and interesting ways. Also the classes can be used as advanced classes and can be used with or without their arcane and psionic elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fantasy classes' core abilities have been stripped out and are presented as talent trees. This provides players and GMs alike with more opportunities to incorporate arcane, divine, and psionic abilities in their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also presented are guidelines, along with several Plus feats, for replicating the progression of many of the original fantasy classes and prestige classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: BFG's [Talent Tree Compendium] may be required to make complete use of some of these classes, and a handful of feats are referenced from BFG's [Iconic Combat Feats].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
