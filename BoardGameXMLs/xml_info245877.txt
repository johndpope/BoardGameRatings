							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mort the Chicken</name>
									
			<description>The chickens live peacefully in an alternate universe, where chickens are the dominant species. Mort the Chicken is the star of his own television show. In another universe, cube-like creatures called The Boolyon are spying on the chickens. The leader of the cubes, General Cubicles, notices that the chickens have stacks of hay, and Cubicles mistakes them for kidnapped citizens of their universe. While Mort is filming his own TV show, the cubes reach their universe via a well and kidnap all the baby chicks, scattering them across the chicken universe. Mort, being the only one brave enough to stop the cubes, jumps down the well and starts his adventure to save the baby chicks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
