			<description>The object of the game is to complete a score card by answering trivia questions from five different categories throughout the game board and be the first to cross the finish line with the completed score card.  But watch out! You must avoid setbacks and potential tragedies brought on by your opponents while they try to complete their score cards and cross the finish line before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This gave is a bit like a mix of Trivial Pursuit and Taboo in that you are allowed to ask your teammate for hints to the question.  They are allowed to give you just about any hint they can think of, as long as they don't say any part of the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
