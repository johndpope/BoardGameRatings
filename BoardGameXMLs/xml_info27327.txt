			<description>Get Rollin! is a dice rolling game.  Each of the four players has an eight space track on the board, a playing piece and five six-sided dice.  A large bell is placed in the center space of the board.  The leader for a round rolls one die to determine the target number.  Immediately after that all players begin rolling all of their dice as fast as possible.  Any time a player rolls the target number they must place any dice with that number in the center of the board and call out how many dice along they are toward getting all five with the target number.  They then continue to roll the rest of their dice.  When a player gets all five of their dice to match, they ring the bell and win the round moving one space on their track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
