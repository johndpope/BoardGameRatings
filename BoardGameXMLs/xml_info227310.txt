			<description>Publisher summary&lt;br/&gt;In Ex Libro, players choose characters from novels, trying to find objects or characters held in another book. That other book, the setting, is controlled by the gamemaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Judge Comments&lt;br/&gt;Clever idea encouraging people to read and roleplay. The idea that you play your character and use quotes from your book while the GM navigates you through their book is fascinating. Weaving stories are what these games are all about. This also gives people tastes of books one might not know. This is my favorite. It&amp;rsquo;s simple and easy to play. My top pick from the list. - Satine Phoenix&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
