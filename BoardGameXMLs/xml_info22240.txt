			<description>The board is one of the most simple: 4 squares in a square. The further material: 13 Dice with different letters on each side. The game is always played in two rounds. In the first one, player A is the &amp;quot;builder&amp;quot;, player B the &amp;quot;killjoy&amp;quot;, in the second round they change roles.&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;builder&amp;quot; begins drawing one die at random and throwing it. His task is it now, to stack the dice on the four squares, building towers as high as possible. There is only one rule for building: the letters of the next die on the stack must be further in the alphabet. The killjoy at his turn draws another die at random and throws it, but is trying to keep the towers low. It is free to both, on which of the four fields they put the die.&lt;br/&gt;If it is impossible to put a die, the player can take the upper die of one tower away and lay it beside, so he can put the drawn one on the top. Therefore he should remember the letter on the die under the topmost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after thirteen draws and the towers are counted: each tower counts the square of the number of dice it consists of: 25 for a tower 5 dice high, 16 for 4 ...&lt;br/&gt;After two rounds the player with the higher score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Name &amp;quot;Jenaer Turm&amp;quot; is derived from a real tower in Jena, Germany, which is 26 stories high. The game was part of an edition of small games for the exhibition &amp;quot;Gott w&amp;uuml;rfelt nicht&amp;quot; in G&amp;ouml;ttingen 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
