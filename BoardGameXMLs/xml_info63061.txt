							<name  sortindex="1">Arkham Now: Revisiting the Legend-Haunted City</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARKHAM NOW updates to modern times the famous and fabled city of Arkham, about which so much has been written by many talented and diverse hands. A conscious effort was made to make this book as timely as possible; rents, mortgages, salary rates, and the like are left purposely vague since these things change as years go by this is no longer a city frozen in time, but yours to move into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most residents believe there is only one horror lurking in this legendary haunted town the urban sprawl slowly eroding Arkham's old New England beauty. Rushing by neon signs and mega-marts on a quest to obtain even more material possessions, no one has time to notice the more disturbing, underlying qualities of the city, the grotesque vegetation sprouting in some places, the sometimes odd taste from the reservoir's drinking water, the disturbingly high rate of birth defects, the too frequent child abductions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who begin to make inquires are usually scoffed at by citizens, rebuffed by local and state officials. The truly brave have continued to put the pieces together, posting their thoughts on the Internet. Many of these individuals drop off from cyberspace eventually often due to the effects some of these discoveries can have on one's mental health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though they would never admit it, many of the long time residents of Arkham know there is something not quite right about their town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
