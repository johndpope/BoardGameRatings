			<description>From the Game Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who plays Kwa-D&amp;ocirc;?  Spirited, Fun-loving players have been challenged by the historical beauty and design of Kwa-D&amp;ocirc; for over 400 years!  Kwa-D&amp;ocirc; is an exciting, easy-to-learn matching game ideally suited for up to six players - ages 8 to 100+ years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players capture points by &amp;quot;matching up&amp;quot; cards whose brightly patterend images reflect the seasons and months of the calendar year.  There are 48 playing cards in the Kwa-D&amp;ocirc; deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point cards consist of consist of colorful red and blue scrolls, wild birds and animals, and a mystical dragon.  The dragon is the highest point card in the game.  Players strive to &amp;ldquo;match&amp;rdquo; these valuable point cards during their turn, thus preventing opponents an opportunity to score.  Most games can easily be played in less than an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An illustrated rule book and score pad are included with each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
