			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Martial Artist is a new class and martial arts system for the Center Space or other OGL games. It is the second of a four volume series--each presenting new psionically themed classes and races. Volume 2 presents the Martial Artist class and rules for using the new martial arts maneuvers system. This volume does not require Volume One to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume Two includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An update of the Martial Artist class. Martial Artists choose one of four paths:&lt;br/&gt;        the unarmed expert who uses their body as a living weapon, the weapon master who specializes in a single weapon&lt;br/&gt;        the oathbearer who focus their minds on a single task&lt;br/&gt;        and gunslinger who combine ranged weapons with acrobatics. Regardless of their specialty, all Martial Artists use rigorous mental and physical discipline to push their bodies and minds past the normal limits.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    A new point-based martial arts maneuvers system. Martial artists gain maneuvers which enhance their attacks or skills as they advance in level. Other classes can learn maneuvers as well through feats.&lt;br/&gt;    Three new races: the multi-armed insectoid Kecheck, the blind Uhr, and the monsterous Vokt. &lt;br/&gt;    Two new skills (Focus and Psitech) and several new feats.&lt;br/&gt;    Three prestige classes (Alliance Psiwarrior, Kecheck Blademaster, Uhr Ascetic, and Vokt Guardian).&lt;br/&gt;    New psionic technology items.&lt;br/&gt;    Suggestions for using the system with other 3.X/Pathfinder games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
