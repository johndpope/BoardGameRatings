			<description>This undated but likely mid-20th century title has an unusual mechanism based on two midway-style spinning wheels, one red for pitching and the other green for batting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each wheel has four large fins in the middle that players use to spin the wheel, vertical teeth on the rim between each of the 40 wheel segments, and a flexible metal strip mounted to a post on the corner that slows the wheel and eventually comes to rest between two of the pegs. There is also a thick cardboard field and plastic pegs to mark runners, balls, strikes and outs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fielding player spins the pitching wheel, which includes 12 strikes, 13 balls, 6 fouls, 1 foul pop out, and 8 hits. Balls and strikes may lead to strike-outs or walks, but on any hit result, the batting player spins the red wheel. That wheel in turn has 12 ground outs, 14 fly outs, 8 singles, 3 doubles, 2 triples and 1 home run. Most results have specific consequences such as tagging up, advancing runners or double plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
