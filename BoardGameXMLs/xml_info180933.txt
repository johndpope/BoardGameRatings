							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Marble Game</name>
									
			<description>Imagine a high quality old-school style wooden table game that creates a 4 sided hockey-soccer field with pinball style paddles for each player. This 4 player family/party game is fast. Not just in the speed of play, but in the rapid fluctuations between triumph and anguish that each player endures as they quickly lose or gain Marbles. Be the first player to get rid of your marbles to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;Our &amp;ldquo;Secret Sauce&amp;rdquo; is the spontaneous laughter that always results from Blowing on the Marble. For example, while the main action in the game is whacking the marble with the pinball paddles towards another opponent&amp;rsquo;s goal, the rules allow players to assist or prevent the marble from scoring by blowing on it. So, when players are blowing at the marble against each other, it ALWAYS creates laughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
