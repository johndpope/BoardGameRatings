			<description>Adventures in Toothland is an educational game that can be used to teach young players about oral hygiene, or can pose challenges to even the most experienced of dentists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic object of the game is to collect points via Tooth Brush cards, Cavity Crasher &amp;quot;super hero&amp;quot; cards, Tooth Truth trivia cards, and the Healthy Tooth Award, while trying to fob off the dreaded Sweet Tooth card on another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three different levels of play. In the most simplistic, players simply collect Tooth Truth cards and ignore the trivia questions on them. In the standard game, players must answer the Tooth Truth question appropriate to their age and dental experience in order to win the card. Finally, when all players are of the same age group/experience, the players can choose the difficulty level of the question they wish to answer and receive points according to that difficulty level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also worthy of note are the metal movers used in the game. These are characters cast as lead figures, shaped like different types of teeth, and given names such as &amp;quot;Sir Incisor&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
