			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT IS THIS BOOK?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the rules and instructions for a tabletop roleplaying game about Viking settlers in Iceland. You will need one or more friends with you in order to play. I recommend four or five people altogether for the best experience. You will also need some paper, pencils and at least two regular dice (ideally, you should have a pair of dice for each player minus one). This chapter will explain how to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT IS THE GAME ABOUT?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is about the trials, tribulations and adventures of the first settlers of Iceland, as described in the Icelandic Sagas. The so-called Saga Period lasted roughly from 875, when the first permanent Norse settlers arrived, until 1085, when the first local bishop established a church in the south of Iceland. In truth, the majority of the family sagas take place in the hundred years between 930 (the year of the first national assembly) and 1030. If you want to know more about Iceland and its inhabitants in that period, you can read the chapter titled Iceland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
