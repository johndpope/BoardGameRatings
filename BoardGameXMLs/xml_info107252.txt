			<description>from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you await flight control clearance for departure, you wonder if the pioneers of space exploration felt the same icy chill, awaiting lift-off of their crude 20th century space shuttle missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully briefed on the mysterious waves of alien encounters in a dimension uncharted by human life forms, you alone must defend the solar system for the good of mankind. Suddenly, the reality of the mission sparks a rush of energy through your body. At every turn you encounter deadly alien spacecraft. With the fireworks of explosions encircling you, you blast the aliens with your laser beams. In a last effort to escape certain death, you quickly grasp the joystick and firmly place one hand over the warp trigger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instantly you are hurled through a kaleidoscope of color for a moment that seems to last an eternity, a moment that is exciting beyond belief, a moment that is...JUNO FIRST!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;-spectacular graphics and sound&lt;br/&gt;-laser beam and warp controls&lt;br/&gt;-one or two players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
