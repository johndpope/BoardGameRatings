			<description>Complete Basic Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover (spelling corrected):&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To Challenge Tomorrow is the future of roleplaying. It's the first and only roleplaying system to provide pure mechanics for use in any setting which are versatile, believable, consistent and simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your favorite roleplaying setting, rip out the second rate mechanics which so often plague otherwise great games, and plug in the elegant flexibility of To Challenge Tomorrow, a game system which emphasizes character development and roleplaying without sacrificing realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And once you've discovered the joy of roleplaying without arbitrary restrictions and mechanical glitches, you can move on to try out some of the dozens of To Challenge Tomorrow settings, such as London by Night for Victorian roleplaying, Challengers for superhero roleplaying, EsperAgents for psychic espionage and many, many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new fourth edition To Challenge Tomorrow rules are completely revised and updated. The mechanics have been further streamlined, and for the first time To Challenge Tomorrow is completely compatible with Ysgarth, our groundbreaking fantasy system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open the door to a thousand brilliant adventures... play To Challenge Tomorrow.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
