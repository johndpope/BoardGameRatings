			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE THREE OF them chartered a ship, the Calling Gull, to cross the storm-laden sea from England to Ireland at first light on the fourth day of their stay in Scotland. They had picked up a few clues from examining Laird Connor&amp;rsquo;s room in the Scottish Castle -- Edward had discovered a few letters secreted away that shone new light on Kevin&amp;rsquo;s connection to the Laird, wisely he kept them from Anna.&lt;br/&gt;It was on the last day of their crossing to Ireland that he shared the contents with Sebastian and Jane as they sat in Edward&amp;rsquo;s cabin, the ship rocked gently on the now calmer waters as the crew busied themselves with their night rota.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ye&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering why I&amp;rsquo;ve called us together only now,&amp;rdquo; he began and took a swig from a nearby rum bottle. &amp;ldquo;Or why I've been so quiet for this trip?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jane nodded and rested her chin in her hands, she clasped them together under it. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d thought it was an aversion to sailing perhaps. The storm on the crossing has been particularly vicious, frightened me at times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I admit,&amp;rdquo; Sebastian added. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t much care for it, but go on, you look  like you have something heavy on your shoulders, my friend.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blood Father is the third of three parts of &amp;quot;Wayland's Secret&amp;quot;, a story set in the universe of &amp;ldquo;Ultima Forsan&amp;rdquo;, a game setting developed for the Savage Worlds rules.&lt;br/&gt;Attached to the novel there's a roundup of gaming information for those readers that would like to start playing straight away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
