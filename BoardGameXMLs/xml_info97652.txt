							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1066: Battle of Hastings Card Game</name>
									
			<description>It is October 14th 1066 - late afternoon. On Senlac Hill near Hastings the Saxon Army under King Harold II is fighting the invading Normans under William, Duke of Normandy. The battle is not going well for William. Twice he has attacked and twice been repelled and it looks as if he cannot break Harold&amp;rsquo;s Lines.&lt;br/&gt;He calls his nobles to him and promises them gold and land if they will defeat the Saxons and Kill Harold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is time for his Counts to make a name for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in  Player turns which proceed clockwise from the start player until the game ends.During the game the active player is the ACTIVE NORMAN and will use his Normans to attack the Saxons. One of the other players will be the ACTIVE SAXON and will do his best to defeat the efforts of the ACTIVE NORMAN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards represent the Saxons and the Normans and show via red blood drop the number of wounds they have. Blue circles show how many fatigue points they can take. Gold number is value if defeated by a Norman. Green Diamond is speed. The sword and Shield symbols show the number of Attack and Defence cards they draw&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is conducted by playing an ATTACK card which might be blocked by a defence card or cause 1 or more wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is for the Players to defeat as many Saxons as they can whilst defeating the efforts of the other players. The game ends when Harold is killed or the NOrmans are exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
