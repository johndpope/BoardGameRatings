			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a year, wizards from all over the realm come together to fight for the title of Archmage. The winner of this tournament is crowned the most powerful sorcerer in the entire world and becomes the head of the Council of High Mages. Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Tournament for Kids is a fantasy deck building game of magic combat where players fight to defeat each other using spells, monsters, and relics. The game comes with thirty three different sets of cards composed of six copies of that specific card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During play, each player starts the game with nine copies of the Spirit card, which is his starting deck. Cards are purchased from the twelve active stacks of cards and placed in a player&amp;rsquo;s discard pile. Once a player&amp;rsquo;s deck runs out of cards, the player shuffles his discard pile together to make a new deck. The changing sets of cards means that every time you play Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Tournament for Kids, it is a brand new but balanced game. Spells cards allow a player to manipulate, heal, and damage monsters, your opponent, and yourself. Monsters are brutal attackers and valiant defenders that you can summon to your side during a battle to protect you from rampaging monsters and attack your opponent. Relics are ancient artifacts that give a player a special power that can be used each turn. Each player starts with thirty Life and if you reduce your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Life to zero, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Deck Building Game Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     12 Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;     15 Spell Cards&lt;br/&gt;     6 Relic Cards&lt;br/&gt;     Spirit Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
