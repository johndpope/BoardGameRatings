			<description>Trivia game from an age when smoking and board games could be related. Unusual large triangular box. Published by a cigarette maker, intending that pub landlords might leave the game in the bar for customers to play. Game equipment:&lt;br/&gt;1 Magnetic Playing Board&lt;br/&gt;A set of 5 playing counters (and 2 spare sets)&lt;br/&gt;896 Question and Answer cards&lt;br/&gt;4 Winner's Medals&lt;br/&gt;1 cord to hang the board on a wall if required&lt;br/&gt;The board looks like a cross between Pictionary and Ludo. It is intended that teams of 4 people play. When your team gets to answer a question, they can choose A Snip (easy), A Cut (medium) or A Cut Above (difficult). The subject they get is determined by the colour of the space they are on. The sujects are:&lt;br/&gt;Purple: General Knowledge&lt;br/&gt;Blue: Sport&lt;br/&gt;Red: TV and Films&lt;br/&gt;Yellow: Music&lt;br/&gt;If you are correct, your marker moves forward either 1, 2 or 3 spaces on your track. The winning team is the first to get to the end of their track. And, Yes, the team get real-life metal medals, each with a ribbon cord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
