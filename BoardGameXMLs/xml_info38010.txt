			<description>&amp;ldquo;Solo card game based on the stories in Known Space by Larry Niven. The player is playing to defeat the Kzinti and save the Human Race.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Situation: The Warlike Kzinti are attacking human Space. The Pacifist Humans at this time have inferior technology, however, the Kzin have a Large Empire to control &amp;amp; their military traditions of Honor result in Hasty attacks by overconfident, small forces in search of personal glory. If the Humans can hold out, they can improve their technology and gain the advantage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck of cards and a board consisting of a twelve space track. The first space on the track represents the Earth and the last space represents the Kzinti Home Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Victory: If the Kzinti Expansion Marker (KEM) ever reaches earth, the Kzinti win. If the KEM reaches the Home Worlds, the Humans win.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
