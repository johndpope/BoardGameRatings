			<description>From the introduction of the rules set:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These rules were written in response to requests to provide a simple, fast-play set of wargames rules to fight the table-top battles that arose in the BALKAN LEAGUE MATRIX GAME (see Wargames Illustrated 66). The rules are intended to be used with 15mm model miniatures (although they can easily be adapted for use with other scales) and owe much to the work done by Phil Barker and Richard Bodley-Scott in De Bellis Antiquitatis, Chris Kemp in Not Quite Mechanised, and Tim Price in Simple Combat Resolution Using Dice (S.C.R.U.D.) (see WI64).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game uses 6-sided dice. Some sort of casualty marker needs to be supplied by the players, along with miniatures and terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME SCALES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground Scale&lt;br/&gt;1mm = 5m (1:5000)&lt;br/&gt;1cm = 50m (1:5000)&lt;br/&gt;1m = 5kms (1:5000)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Scale&lt;br/&gt;The sides take alternate bounds or turns&lt;br/&gt;1 bound or turn = 1/2 hour&lt;br/&gt;A pair of bounds or turns = 1 hour&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Figure and Vehicle Scale&lt;br/&gt;1 model figure = 250 real soldiers (approximately)&lt;br/&gt;1 model vehicle or artillery piece = 24 real vehicles or artillery pieces&lt;br/&gt;1 stand = 1 battalion-sized unit (approximately)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set appear in Wargames Illustrated #78 (March 1994)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
