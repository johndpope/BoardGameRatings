			<description>Based on the movie, this game's object is to discover your opponents' identities, find the Will and return to your home space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your move, you roll two dice (black and white); you move as indicated by the white die (1-6), adding the black die (1-3) if you choose to.  Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each &amp;quot;Dip&amp;quot; rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the &amp;quot;cancel dip&amp;quot; die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
