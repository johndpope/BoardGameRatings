			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a crew of thieves, outlaws and scoundrels, come together for one purpose: to discover and claim the fabled treasures that lie within the Ziggurat Tomb of Nab&amp;ucirc;-N&amp;acirc;zir, the Zodiac Emperor of ancient Babylon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have no names. As wanted and mistrustful rogues, the others knowing your identity is a liability you cannot afford. You are known only by your masks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome the challenges that lie within the Ziggurat Tomb you will need Might, Wits and Sorcery. The rewards that await you are of both material and metaphysical nature - the question is not what will you find, but how will you be changed for the finding. You have cut the back-alley deals and executed the cunning plans necessary to bring you all undetected to the great entrance to the Ziggurat Tomb. It is impossible to scale the walls on the outside, guarded as they are by fell sorceries, strong winds and the worshipful eyes of the denizens of the &amp;lsquo;Zodiac City,&amp;rsquo; the tent city grown up around the Ziggurat since it&amp;rsquo;s rediscovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only way in lies before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
