							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Dozen Distinctive Articles of Clothing</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to demand, Philip Reed has expanded on the wardrobe selection with this sequel to the popular A Dozen Unusual Articles of Clothing. In this 6-page PDF players and DMs will find 13 clothing items, including the spider's gloves and the blackguard's intimidating cloak, any one of which can be used to make a character stand-out in a crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fluff-heavy PDF will be most enjoyed by those players and DMs that enjoy roleplaying the small stuff. After all, it's not as if the archer's greatcoat is going to be of much assistance to those players that are focused on swinging the biggest damn sword they can get their hands on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
