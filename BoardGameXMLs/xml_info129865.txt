			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sniper and the buffalo hunter may be satisfied with sitting still and taking a deliberate shot at an unsuspecting target from long range, but not the Rifleman. Having experienced the vagaries of war (such as the sudden wild charge of cavalry or the nighttime sneak attack of bushwhackers), the Rifleman knows that what once was a battle of distance can suddenly be up close and personal, and the weapon good for dealing death from afar can quickly become a hindrance spelling the wielder&amp;rsquo;s doom. Rather than give up the weapon he loves, by necessity the Rifleman has learned how to use his longarm to pump lead quickly and accurately into any enemy, whether close up or far away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Becoming so skilled at wielding his favorite longarm, the Rifleman makes every move with such flair and flamboyance that it elicits awe and wonder from onlookers, and more than a little trepidation from enemies. The marksman who wants to become famous as a great Rifleman knows that his reputation must extend as far as the eye can shoot. Therefore, he practices night and day with his chosen longarm, until he can fire it with style and elan at any target, at any range. Rapid-fire speed, pinpoint accuracy, and the ability to wield his normally long range weapon with equal skill at close quarters, is the unique brand of the Rifleman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rifleman can&amp;rsquo;t be satisfied with just taking a few pot shots at long range, he is trained to pump a barrel full of lead into his enemies, near and far. More important than volume and range, however, is style. He learns to wield his favorite longarm with flair and flamboyance. A marksman who strives to become a famous Rifleman wants his reputation to extend as far as the eye can shoot, so he practices night and day with his chosen longarm, until he can fire it with style and elan at any range. Rapid fire speed, pinpoint accuracy and the ability to wield his long range weapon in close quarters are the unique brand of the Rifleman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
