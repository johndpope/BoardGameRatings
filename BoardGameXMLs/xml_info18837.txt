			<description>Object of the game: Be the first player to reach the Glory Land space. &lt;br/&gt;     Players spin and move along the track. You start with 5 &amp;quot;Beat the Devil&amp;quot; cards in your hand. These include either or both counter cards or &amp;quot;Bad&amp;quot; cards. You play a &amp;quot;Bad&amp;quot; card on the player to your left which is used to slow your opponent down either by losing a turn, moving to a &amp;quot;Troubled Space&amp;quot; or waiting until the appropriate counter card is drawn or played. Counter cards include Faith, Healing, Praise, Armour, Word, Repentance and Jesus, which get you out of &amp;quot;Bad&amp;quot; cards played against you or &amp;quot;Troubled spaces&amp;quot; such as doubt and Disbelief, Devil, Sin, Sickness and Disease and Financial Disaster. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
