			<description>A game played on a vertical pyramid-shaped board.  Each player has 6 pegs on their side of the board, and six magnetic (polarized) pieces.  Visually, it is impossible to tell the &amp;quot;north&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;south&amp;quot; poles of the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four variants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1:  Start with all pieces on the vertical board.  Players take alternate turns removing and then replacing two of their pieces at a time onto different pegs.  The objective is to repel or knock off and thereby capture your opponent's pieces.  A piece may be flipped before placing it onto another peg, but it may not go back on the same peg from which it was removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2:  Starting with an empty playing board, players being to alternately place their pieces, one at a time, on the pegs.  The objective is to be the first to get all six pieces on your pegs.  Of course, you may want to knock off as many of your opponent's pieces as possible on your way to winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 3:  Starting with an empty board, be the first player to get three pieces in a line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 4:  Starting with an empty board, be the first player to get three pieces in a triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
