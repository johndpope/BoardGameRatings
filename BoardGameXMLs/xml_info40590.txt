			<description>The Big Score! is a game designed to teach the basics of credit scoring to beginning loan originators, underwriters, and loan processors.  It can be played by 2 - 8 individuals or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins at &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; with 400 credit score points.  Players then move around the board to each category and must answer questions: minimum 50 points/maximum 125 points in each category.  Each question is worth 25 points.  Players may encounter either Credit Scoring Advances or Obstacles on their way to each category or while in a category.  Advances gain points; obstacles lose points.  The first player to have accumulated the most credit score points (900 being a perfect score) from EACH category must make their way to &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot; to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is produced by the United Guaranty Corporation, a member company of American International Group (AIG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
