							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LEGO Island</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A decidedly surreal early sandbox game, LEGO Island was created by a core team of academics and game professionals. The game was designed with regard to research from MIT and Harvard regarding multiple intelligence and learning through exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place of LEGO Island, where the player assumes the identity of one of seven characters. The player is then placed on the island with no goals or responsibilities. The player can complete activities for NPCs, or they can simply explore the island and its bizarre inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite being released in an unfinished state, the game was considered a commercial success by the publisher, partially due to its decision to lay off the development team the day before release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
