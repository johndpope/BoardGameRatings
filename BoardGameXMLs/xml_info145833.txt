							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Before Dishonor: The Battle of Santiago Harbor</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;We saw what probably has not been witnessed since the days of the Armada, ships coming out for deadly battle, but dressed as for a regal parade or a festival day. From their shining black hulls, with huge golden figureheads bearing the crest and coat-of-arms of Spain, to the tops of their masts where fluttered proudly the immense silken flags&amp;hellip;to the brightly colored awnings over their decks, they bespoke luxury and chivalry, and a proud defiance.&lt;br/&gt;--George Edward Graham of the Associated Press as he witnessed the sortie of the Spanish Fleet from the Santiago Channel, July 3rd, 1898.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Before Dishonor is an introductory level wargame simulation on the naval actions that occurred near Santiago harbor during the Spanish-American War. The game design is meant to be simple and highly playable, yet one that portrays the historical challenges facing the combatants. Historically the US failed to bottle up the Spanish fleet, and was forced to undergo a lengthy blockade while the US Army fought the Spanish garrison for control of the city and port. The capture of key fortifications and the heights at Kettle and San Juan Hills compelled Admiral Pascual Cervera to sortie on July 3rd to prevent his ships from being sunk at their moorings by US artillery, or capture when the town surrendered. The US navy would sink all of the fleeing Spanish ships with little loss, scoring a lop-sided win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Death Before Dishonor is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One sheet of 50 single-sided counters.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One 8.5 by 11 map.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    This set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will also need a one ten-sided die (D10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
