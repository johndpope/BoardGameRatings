							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Forest of the Giants</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the first, the forest wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect for these sad, old ancients. They got washed ashore, after all. No choices. Good hearted ents came and stayed with them, but times later the giants died and the ents - caregivers by nature - were left out of whack with the rest of the world. The ents got put to work as smuggler helpers, making the Forest of the Giants feared and shunned by just about everybody. That&amp;rsquo;s good for smuggling, but it can&amp;rsquo;t go on. Essential equipment to sort this thing out? You&amp;rsquo;ll need an Ent Tongue Organ for sure to calm these guys down. They&amp;rsquo;re trees, don&amp;rsquo;t forget. Gestures and rustling will never get you far. And look for the grave of the last ancient. Rumor has it Sharinti or some other librarian might be there. They&amp;rsquo;re smart. They talk ent. They will help&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
