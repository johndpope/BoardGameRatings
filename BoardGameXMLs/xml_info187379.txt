			<description>User Description by zefquaavius&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars is to Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space as Weird Worlds is to Strange Adventures in Infinite Space: A reimagining of the game system, upgraded, modernized, and fleshed out with still more weird things to discover&amp;hellip; and kill you. Explore space; trade, buy, and sell items; encounter intelligent and belligerent species, all on borrowed time and money. As with its predecessors, combat is real-time and tactical, while everything else in the game is &amp;quot;turn-based&amp;quot;, but with all actions being measured in days. Furthermore, the series tradition of short gameplay continues; however, the trend of the game sessions taking longer also continues; so, rather than a typical game being the 15 minutes of Strange Adventures, or the 45 minutes of Weird Worlds in its longer play modes, the shortest play mode of Sea of Stars takes about 60 minutes. The biggest difference from its predecessors, visible right out of the gate, is the fully 3D navigation and ship models (the combat is still locked to a 2D plane, though).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this game's development was crowdsourced through Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
