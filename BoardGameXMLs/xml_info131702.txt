			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quite spacious room, this office is obviously the place of work for an important or at least powerful person. Beyond the heavy double door leading in a large exotic carpet, of various reddish hues, covers the polished marble floor leading forwards towards a massive hardwood desk. A desk that downright dwarfs the fine chair in front of it. To either side of the entrance massive bookshelves cover the walls, filled to the brim with various books. Behind the massive desk, covered with scrolls, books and writing implements stands an equally massive, wheeled hardwood chair with leather cushions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An observant person might realize that these pieces of furniture are arranged to intimidate anyone sitting on the wrong side of the desk. At the back of the desk and at its sides the walls are dominated by large ceiling high stained glass windows, which are supposed to make visitors feel even smaller. The fine glass table to the side of the door and the chairs surrounding it provide a curious counterpoint to this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
