							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caesar III</name>
									
			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Caesar_III,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities in Caesar III try to accurately reflect the life of Roman citizens- the lowest plebs live in tents and shacks, while the richest patricians live in villas. Staple foods include wheat, fruits, vegetables, and pork, and wine is required for some festivals and houses. Citizens wander the streets in their various garbs and can tell the player their name and how they feel about the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city is viewed in a two dimensional isometric view with a fixed magnification level, and can be rotated ninety degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to services such as market goods, entertainment, hygiene, education, and taxation are represented by &amp;quot;walkers,&amp;quot; which are people sent out from their buildings to patrol the streets. Any house that is passed by a walker is considered to have access to the services of the walker's building. All movements of goods and coverage of walkers are accurately reflected by citizens walking the streets: a player can watch a farm's crop progress, and when it's ready a worker will push a full cart from the farm to a nearby warehouse or granary; then return with an empty cart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
