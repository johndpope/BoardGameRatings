			<description>This is a memory game in which players move around a board which contains twelve face down chips (four sets of three each). Each time a meeple steps onto a square, the player shows the other side and places it onto the square he or she came from. The memory layout thus changes constantly. If a player knows the location of a complete set, he or she calls it (and gets the set if he or she is correct). New chips are placed and a new turn starts. Whoever collects 15 chips first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
