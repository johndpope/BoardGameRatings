			<description>In this game the players try to build food chains ranging from algae and muck up to raccoons. According to the instructions, all of the possible combinations actually exist in nature.  The cards for this game each have an animal, a description of what that animal eats(smaller animals or algae) and a number from 1-5.  There are also cards for algae and muck that do not have numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of 7 cards.  Each turn a layer must either start a new food chain by playing any card in front of themselves  or add to any one existing food chain by playing a card that the smallest creature can eat and/or a card that can eat the largest creature in that chain.  The player takes control of any food chain they add to.  The player then draws back up to 7 cards.  This continues until all of the cards have been played.  The winner is the person controlling the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
