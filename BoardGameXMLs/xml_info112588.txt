							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Modern Clan Cappadocian &amp; Related Bloodlines Primer</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A non-canon fan supplement for Vampire: The Masquerade that presents one of the extinct clans in an alternative way that makes them an allowable clan in the modern World of Darkness setting. This is an alternative take on an earlier supplement: Modern Cappadocians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The author would like to thank everyone who has been helpful in bringing this document to light, especially Telgar for sparking an idea I had been working on awhile now about how I could bring back the Clan of Death, and to Mr. Gone, for assisting me in the creation of these official-looking pdfs. Without his assistance, I would still be stuck doing everything in Microsoft Word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, this document consists of clan spreads of Clan Cappadocian and a Sabbat-allied bloodline of male Lamia Antitribu, that I have dubbed Morbus, which is borrowed, and partially converted from a bloodline of the same name from Vampire the Requiem. As always, the documents within are entirely a work of fanfiction and are not intended to replace the clans and bloodlines published in 20th Anniversary Edition Vampire the Masquerade, Vampire the Dark Ages, Dark Ages Vampire, and Vampire the Requiem, published by White Wolf Publishing, a subsidiary of CCP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
