							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">On The Seven Seas: Wargaming Rules for the Age of Piracy and Adventures c.1500-1730</name>
									
			<description>(From the rule book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the Seven Seas is a set of wargames rules covering the high adventure and low morals of the world of the pirate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Drake and his sea-rovers to Blackbeard, the Barbary Corsairs and the Wo-k'ou of the Far East, pirates have haunted seas across the globe, preying on port and vessel alike. Now you too can recreate the exploits of pirate captains or the naval commanders that hunted them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want skirmish between crews on uncharted islands and in the alleyways of Caribbean ports or ship-to-ship duels that culminate in bloodthirsty boarding actions, the rules offer a quick-to-learn basic game. These small forces of buccaneers, commanded by captains and kept in line by trusted lieutenants, can also be sealed up with ease for larger engagements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay centers on two driving motivations that epitomize the pirate life - Fear and Greed. Cunning captains will have to balance these two elements, instilling fear in their opponents with bloodthirsty reputations, while keeping their own crews in line with the promise of loot and wealth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
