			<description>FLIMFLAM: The brain bending game of fact &amp;amp; fancy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 500 fact cards with four true facts on each card. Players either read the fact as is, or alter some detail to make it false. Other players then play a FACT or BLUFF card, depending on whether they think the Hoaxer read the card as printed or made something up. Players move around a board based on whether they answered correctly or were flim-flammed. Successful Hoaxers move one space for each person they fooled. First to the finish line wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
