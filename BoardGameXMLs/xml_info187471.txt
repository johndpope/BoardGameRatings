							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bogeyman vs. Knightmare</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Team: The Bogeyman VS Knightmare for Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds Will Haunt Your Players' Dreams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Team: The Bogeyman VS Knightmare provides two characters for your Super-Powered by Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds games: the villainous master of sleeping horror, the Bogeyman, and a hero, the renegade nightmare, Knightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bogeyman was born from existence's first nightmare, and he has haunted the thoughts of every sleeping mortal since. From his home Dream Dimension, this king of night's terror marshals armies of nightmares to plague humanity, seeking a way to increase his power by making the waking world like his own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knightmare was once one of the Bogeyman's most trusted agents, until this nightmare attempted terrorizing the dreams of a being whose sleeping thoughts were too benign even for his experienced talents to overcome. Instead, Knightmare was forever changed by the experience and forever after pledged to undo the evils he had previously perpetrated--he became a defender of mortal dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are two new advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
