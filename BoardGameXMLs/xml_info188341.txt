			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ritual magic is interesting and accessible even to non-spellcasters, but as a concept, it is currently underdeveloped. There are too few ritual spells, and many opportunities not only to provide you with more spellcasting utility, but also to weave magic into your story in a way that is holistic and does not imbalance your campaign. This product contains a handful of new rituals, as well as guidelines for using rituals, rewarding players, and providing a deeper subtext for magic within your campaign setting. It also includes rules for casting ritual magic without the requisite ability at the cost of potential consequences and risks, as well as a new occult tool set!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
