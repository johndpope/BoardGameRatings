							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hush!</name>
									
			<description>Hush! is a children's game with no strategy involved, so everyone is equally good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player turns over one of the hidden tiles. If it is a strawberry, then he or she can take it. If it is a bird, the collected strawberries are &amp;quot;saved&amp;quot; and put aside. If it is a scarecrow, the player must say &amp;quot;HUSH!&amp;quot;, and all other players must put back all strawberries they haven't saved yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all tiles are taken, and the winner is the one with the most strawberries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important hint from the rules: If someone has not learned to count yet, the players can stack all strawberries and compare height instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;54 tiles with pictures of strawberries, birds and scarecrows&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
