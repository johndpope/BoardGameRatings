							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fortune Cookies and Nuclear War (Card Edition)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortune Cookies and Nuclear War is intended to be played by two people, in roles as American and Russian negotiators, over the course of a meal in a Chinese restaurant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws up five demands for the other then secretly designates three items from each list that they intend to accomplish or block, respectively. Negotiations commence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The session is concluded by narrating an epilogue based on fortune cookie messages. Instructions are included for scoring -- and for how the bill is to be paid!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
