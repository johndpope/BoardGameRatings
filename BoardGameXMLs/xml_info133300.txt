							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Freddy the Fox</name>
									
			<description>A card game like Authors, Quartetts or Happy Families but with some novel touches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards, which are beautifull illustrated, feature sets of four cards. There are 45 cards in total, and the sets are numbered 1 to 4. There is also a Freddy the Fox card which should be given to another player during play (if you get the chance). The collecting of sets is traditional: Ask for a card from a set that you already have one card in. If the player askled has one, he hands it over. If he doesn't then he can call &amp;quot;Exchange&amp;quot; and the asker and asked choose one card to give to the other (face-down of course). This is the only way to get rid of useless cards from your point of view and, of course, to get rid of Freddy if you happen to hold it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 other cards called Trophy cards. They have a fold in the centre and can be stood up like an arch (a very nice touch). When you lay down a completed set, you take the trophy card that relates to it. The Trophy cards all have a points value, some sets worth more than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the sets have been found, each player adds up their Trophy card scores, but getting -50 to the holder of Freddy the Fox at the end. The first player to score 250 or more, wins. This may take several games to achieve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
