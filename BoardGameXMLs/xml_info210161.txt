			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breathing new life into a tried and true core mechanic can be tricky, but this game is not as centered on cards as the past States of Siege titles have been. Instead, Federation of Sol is a game that is ruled by the roll of the dice. This, along with its premise and goal, gives it a different feel; while other SoS games are primarily driven by surviving the onslaught of the deck, Federation of Sol is about not only withstanding outside pressures, but about driving outward and keeping what the Federation claims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Federation of Sol, humans (with you as their acting leader) have achieved the technology necessary for interstellar travel, giving us the capability to expand our empire beyond the solar system. However, it turns out that we are not alone in the universe! Four rival alien races &amp;ndash; the Snakes, the Roaches, the Bots, and the People Eaters &amp;ndash; are not too thrilled at the Federation's advancement into what they believe is their territory. Top that off with the lurking threat of a band of fearsome space pirates, a race to achieve the best technology, and the ever-shifting tides of diplomacy and war, and Federation of Sol is a game that &amp;ndash; both literally and figuratively &amp;ndash; takes place on a galactic scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many things can go wrong on this journey. If an extraterrestrial ship is in Sol by the end of one's turn, the Earth is conquered and the humans will be lost to their new overlords. If Federation Stability drops to zero, anarchy will reign supreme. If all of the aliens achieve technology beyond what humanity could ever dream of, then mankind will be utterly outclassed and unable to progress outside of the solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even with all of these ways to fail, the humans are determined, and if we take over the exoplanets in the various enemy territories, we will have an established foothold in galactic affairs for millennia to come. However, to do this we must build ships and stations, maneuver those ships to other worlds, research new technologies, spy on the advancements of our rivals, and keep up morale. Meanwhile, the political tides of the aliens are always in constant flux; perhaps if they do go to war, that could be used to our advantage....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
