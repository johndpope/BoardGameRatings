							<name  sortindex="1">Flipsiders: Slumber Party</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slumber Party</name>
									
			<description>One in a series of sixteen Flipsiders games designed to resemble pastel colored audio cassettes. The game contained a metal gameboard that would flip out with the snap of the wrist. A storage compartment at the top of the game would hold the magnetic pawns. A spring-loaded switch would spin the wheels of the cassette to generate random numbers and events during play. The game would hang from a blister pack on display at the store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time you hit your opponent she gets closer to bedtime. The object is to stall bedtime as long as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
