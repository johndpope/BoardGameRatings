							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spin-O</name>
									
			<description>Simple game in which players spin a top and attempt to hit tiny balls into the scoring area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in turn, spins the top in the circle in the center of the box, attempting to spin so as to keep the top going as long as possible. While the top is spinning the player will drop the six colored wooden balls through the hole in the platform so that they may roll down the sides of the platform and strike the spinning top. The balls will bounce off the top in a lively manner and will fall into holes thus scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the top jumps out of the center the SCORE DOES NOT COUNT. The player loses his opportunity to score during that play. Try to spin the top so as to keep it spinning, and keep it in the center circle. A grand total score of 3000 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
