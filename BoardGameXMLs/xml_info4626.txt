			<description>Game set in Scotland, the theme is unimportant.  There are 10 suits with 9 identical cards in each suit.  In addition there is a &amp;quot;Coat of arms&amp;quot; for each suit and four &amp;quot;Castle cards&amp;quot; for additional points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round you draw a face-up card that you must play immediately, then you can play from your hand.  The goal is to form sets of 6 cards with your partner.  Bonus points are awarded for having the coat of arms or a castle in your set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add a few capture rules, and that is the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
