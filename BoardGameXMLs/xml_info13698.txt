							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Circle Gammon</name>
									
			<description>Circle Gammon is Backgammon for 2-4 players and is played on a circular board. The board has 24 spaces and each space has a number 1-6. Apart from the shape of the board and the number of players involved, the main difference is that you may start bearing off your pieces immediately. On a turn, you roll the dice and either move your piece(s) counterclockwise around the board (as per the rules for backgammon), or bear off a piece if the number on the space it occupies is equal to one of the die rolls. A captured piece must be returned to the board on a space whose number is equal to one of the die rolls. The first player to bear off all his pieces is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
