			<description>Are you ready to cultivate the most delicious fruits?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pajarracos is a fast game where players play the role of farmers competing for reap the most delicious fruits at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;This might be an easy task except for the hungry crows swarming around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to be as fast as possible on sowing fruits while trying to keep the crows away from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you can do one of the following actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 - Sow fruits. Play as many fruits from the same type as you want.&lt;br/&gt;2 - Crow attack. Play as many crows as you want over other players sows.&lt;br/&gt;3 - Protect the sows. Play as many scarecrow as you want on your turn. You can play them either to defend a sow from a crow attack or to put&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;safe the sows from further attacks. But no so fast... You can not protect a sow in the right moment when is being attacked by a crow. &lt;br/&gt;4 - Replace hand. You can discard and draw as many cards as you want. Up to 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a sow is being attacked by a crow...&lt;br/&gt;On your turn. If one sows are being attaked by crows... you need to play a scarecrow to scare away the crows. In case of more than one sow is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;being attacked... you'll need one scarecrow per crow.&lt;br/&gt;If you doesn't play a scarecrow, each crow eats one of the fruits in that sow and remains there till it is scared on a further turn or eats the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;whole sow, when it goes to the discarted pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game end is triggered when the draw pile runs out. Then players play only with the remaining cards on their hands.&lt;br/&gt;When a player can not play a card the game ends immediately and crows doesn't eat in that turn and fly away. So it's time to counts points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
