							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Town Called Showdown</name>
									
			<description>The wild-west town of Showdown holds an annual shootist competition - luring the fastest guns in the west. When the six-shooters go off, which gunslinger will be left standing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Town Called Showdown is a card and dice game for two to four players. Steeped in theme, tension builds as the gunslingers either pace their way down a street (two player) or in a saloon (3-4 player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the tension level, Players can play from their hand of five cards. Gear up with weapons and health that give your gunslinger the edge when the shoot-out happens. Bystander cards are played as they gather in anticipation of the shoot-out; some are there to help the gunslingers by adding bonuses and dice to their pool, others to hinder by removing benefits or changing die results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the eventual shootout happens, players fire using their &amp;quot;six-sided shooter&amp;quot; dice - adding and subtracting for bonuses from bystanders and modifiers. Hit your opponent enough times to remove him or her from the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gun down an opponent to earn a victory star. The player with the most victory stars at the end of three shoot-outs is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
