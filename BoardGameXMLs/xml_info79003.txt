			<description>Growlanser III: The Dual Darkness (グローランサーIII, Gurōransā III?)  is the third installment to the popular series Growlanser created by Atlus, and one of the two games released in the United States in Growlanser Generations. As the back cover of the game says, it takes players back to the time and planet where the series began, a world in which the sun's power is fading and the land is dying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though similar in some ways to its immediate predecessor in the series, some notable changes to the gameplay were made. Four characters are now used during battles instead of eight, and the most powerful spells require cooperation between two different characters. Additionally, movement through the land now happens on an overland screen rather than on a map with pre-chosen destinations, and interaction in towns has also become more like most other RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six main characters to use during the course of the game: the protagonist, Slayn Wilder, who has amnesia; Annette Burns (voiced by Jennifer Stigile in the English version), daughter of the president of Xironia Federation, who seeks to stop the war over the world's remaining food; Hugh Foster (voiced by John Haas in the English version), an amiable fellow with a mysterious past; Monika Allenford (voiced by Jackie Powers in the English version), half-human and half-Featherian, who has a hard time fitting in anywhere; Viktor Hugo (voiced by Dean Williams in the English version), a Russian-inspired inventor and mechanic; and Yayoi Tachibana, a shrine maiden from the East in pursuit of a mysterious fugitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other characters from Growlanser II can be used, provided you have a save file from said game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On December 7, 2004, Growlanser III, along with Growlanser II: The Sense of Justice, was released under a single title in North America, titled Growlanser Generations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Growlanser III: The Dual Darkness , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
