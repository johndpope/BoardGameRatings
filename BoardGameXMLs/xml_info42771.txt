			<description>Bilderw&amp;uuml;rfel Zookinder (Picture Dice - Zoo Children) is a matching game by Selecta is similar to a cross between a jigsaw game and dominoes, and this one uses cubes rather than tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is for children to find a picture that matches with a picture on a cube already played. As play continues, the row of pictures grows slowly. This version of the game is more challenging than the tile versions as the player must find the right side of the cube to place to form the complete picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bilderw&amp;uuml;rfel is one of a series of similar but not identical play games by Selecta including Picture Snake, Picture Worm, Picture Bingo, Picture Chain,and Picture Dice. All these games feature beautifully-finished large wooden tiles or wooden cubes in the case of Picture Dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
