							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tank Girl Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A board &amp;amp; card skirmish level combat game for 2 players representing a battle between Tank Girl and friends vs Water and Power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is conducted on an 8x8 grid using chits, figures or miniatures to represent units.  Terrain types (sand dunes, road, rough, impassable, destructible), which affect play, are added to the board at the players&amp;rsquo; discretion.  Units start on the back two rows of the player&amp;rsquo;s side of the board.  Units have a designated hit value, certain skills/characteristics and may gain specific benefits from special cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck.  Cards types are move, attack, defence and special.  Move and attack cards have an associated range.  Special cards have differing effects dependent on which unit they are applied to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fate Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Draw 3 cards.  Max hand size = 5 cards.  Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Play (discard) a move card to move one of your units. The move card has a number indicating the number of spaces the unit moves. Moves can be diagonal or orthogonal. &lt;br/&gt;         Instead of moving just one unit in any direction, you have the option of moving 2 or 3 units forward the indicated number of spaces using a single move card. &lt;br/&gt;         Units cannot move through other units.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Fight Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Play (discard) an attack card to have a unit attack. The attack card has a number indicating the range of the attack. Attacks can be diagonal or orthogonal. &lt;br/&gt;         Every attack does a base of 1 damage (target loses 1 hit). A unit reduced to 0 hits is killed or incapacitated and removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;         Your opponent may play Defence cards to negate your attack.&lt;br/&gt;         Units cannot attack through other units.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to knock out the opposing player&amp;rsquo;s leaders is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
