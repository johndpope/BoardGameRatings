			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a an ambitious miner hoping to unearth enough buried treasure and gems to be able to buy the luxury yacht of your dreams.  Controls are via A and D or arrow keys to steer your drilling vehicle left and right.  You can only travel for so long before your fuel runs out, and the depth to which you can drill is determined by the strength of your vehicle.  The game lasts 25 turns and between turns you can upgrade your equipment, buy nitros (W or up arrow to activate) or buy a drone to retrieve treasure (mouse to aim and click to activate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
