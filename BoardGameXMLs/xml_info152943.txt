			<description>Pack your bags for a journey across the globe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel from continent to continent and visit different cities on your way around the world. But hurry up and choose the quickest route. First to return to their hometown is crowned Globetrotter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives one Destination card to determine his or her starting position, or &amp;quot;hometown&amp;quot;. Another 15 Destination cards are then dealt to each player. The goal is to plan a round trip from your &amp;quot;hometown&amp;quot; via the 15 destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid the traveler, train stations, airports and harbors are available as a quick travel option if a player has a corresponding Compass card. The Compass cards can help or stall your trip in a number of ways, including changing the outcome of the game. A player is never safe until he or she has returned home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2-4 players and takes you on a different path around the world each round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
