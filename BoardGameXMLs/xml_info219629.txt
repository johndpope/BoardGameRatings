							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Planet of the Nephilim</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A FULLY-ILLUSTRATED 116 PAGE LABYRINTH LORD/MUTANT FUTURE CAMPAIGN &amp;ndash; PLANET OF THE NEPHILIM &amp;ndash; An adventure for 5-6 modern Labyrinth Lord / Mutant Future player characters of 10-12th level totalling 60 levels. The crew of the Galaxy Voyager have crashed landed on the planet Nephilim. The giants there genetically have weak senses and are officious, oafish, ignorant dullards. They are also insufferable cowards and sexually licentious (despite, surprisingly, their low-birth rate and ruthless State-enforced biological infanticide campaigns for 'Those Unfit For Life'). Their low-birthrate and survival unto adulthood combines with their cowardice to make them reluctant to close for combat. However, they will always attempt to capture human earthlings due to fascist government directives and they fear their tyrannical police state more than their natural and selfish instincts. The capture policy is because the planet of Nephilim has spied Earth and its tiny Earthmen across space and are greedy for Earth's water and resources but lack the sufficient technology in space travel to get there. The fascist giant government sees it as imperative to capture the lost humans' small spacecraft to use their miniaturisation and macro- and retro-engineering on to gain space flight They have gluttonous appetites that will distract them easily. Average Nephilim may lift their own body weight and carry it at normal movement encumbrance Giant society has a fiat, non-precious metal and paper currency and does not favour the use of precious metals or jewels to enhance themselves which they see as garish and effete. The giants speak a form of English that is distinctly flavoured unto itself with a slur. S.I.G. is a world government and there are different races of Nephilim of different colouration and racial abilities. Nephilim live to the age of 140 years but suffer dementia by 120 years. Nephilim is ruled over by a tyrannical bureaucracy known as 'The S.I.G.' (&amp;quot;Signals Intelligence Group&amp;quot;). S.I.G. members, known as Inquisitors, wear sharp and stylish black leather coats and leggings with paramilitary insignia and trench coats. The S.I.G. has the fascist and corporatist leash on life and death over the other Nephilim inhabitants of the planet who are too slovenly and stupid to stir or revolt. Instead they revel in being subjected to despotism where oppression is a cultural meme. Surveillance is central to this society where each Nephilim is constantly informing on the activities and suspected activities of his fellows. An old Nephilim witticism goes: &amp;quot;Why didn't anyone on Nephilim see last night's Inquisitor-General's report on the synth-box? Because they were all out checking in their neighbours' windows to see if they were dutifully watching the broadcast ...&amp;quot;. The levels of suspicion created by Nephilim society is positively overheated and paranoid. Includes sample character personalities from the television series ready for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
