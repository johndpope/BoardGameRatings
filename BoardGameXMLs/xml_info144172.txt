							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hawkeye Football Game</name>
									
			<description>Using American Football fundamentals, players simulate an Iowa Hawkeye football game with charts, dice, and an exact replica Kinnick Field game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-Play:  The defensive player secretly selects one of three defensive formations (running, blitzing, and passing) and marks it with his d6. Then, the offensive player verbally selects one of tweleve running or passing plays. The defensive player exposes his formation, and the offensive player rolls 2d10 to reveal the outcome of the play from the play chart. Play results include, but are not limited to: incomplete pass, interception, sack, penalty, touchdown, no gain, or a yardage gain of another dice roll. Game time and score are tracked on a separate charts. Special team results are also covered on a field goal, kick-off, and punt chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:  2 play charts, 1 exact replica of Kinnick Field game board, 1 field goal and penalty chart, 1 official time chart, scorepad, 1 line-of-scrimmage marker, 1 ten-yard marker, 3 colored markers, 2 offensive dice (d10), 1 defensive die (d6), 1 rules folder, and 1 Hawkeye button (1st issue Collectors Edition only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules do not cover the sport of American Football; therefore, basic knowledge of the sport should be known or referenced with a NCAA college football handbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
