			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Us, our settlement, the AI and the quantum information field, here, at the end of the world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a roleplaying game about a weird place at the end of the world, the settlement, and its inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take the role of both a focus character in the settlement as well as an autonomous applet of the artificial intelligence controlling the omnipresent quantum information field. The focus characters are people, or anything that seems to have a free will and is able to act, who know that the end of the world is coming and they need to prepare for that. How that is done, everybody needs to decide for himself. They can be humans, fantastic characters, mutant animals, robots, ethereal creatures or anything in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artificial intelligence controls the quantum information field and alters it to better represent its vision of the world and to provide interesting twists on the fates of the settlement's inhabitants. It also awards achievements to the inhabitants for doing particularly grand, interesting, clever or stupid things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their quest to prepare, a lot of threats and complications will come the characters' ways and they will have to struggle to achieve their goals. However, the ways of the quantum field are tricky and the truth will most likely not be obvious. Things can be retroactively different than thought of before, people and threats can appear out of nowhere, sudden links can tie objects far apart together. It's a mysterious world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the settlement itself is a weird place. Of course, the inhabitants don't think that but when compared to the players' world, it shows some peculiarities. It literally resides on the edge of the world. The sun is about to set, maybe forever. In this very last stage of the world, the light always comes from the sides, producing harsh shadows and golden glitter. The structure of the settlement seems to be more vertical than horizontal, leading to steep falls, wooden ladders, glass elevators and some vertigo. Everything appears a bit softer than it should, even the harsh bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the settlement, the characters, the artificial intelligence (AI) and all the rest have more curiosities to offer, which are for you to find out about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your characters save their souls, will they find peace and fight for what is worth it? Will the sun set forever? What are the hiccups of the quantum information field and what role does the AI play in all this? What is this place?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only you can know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
