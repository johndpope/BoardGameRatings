			<description>The purpose of 'Square Game' is to gain control of the most squares by the time the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;In the game players take the pieces and place them in the play space (this is referred to as the board although there is not a physical board). When a player places a piece on the board they perform the action indicated on the piece. When a player places a piece to complete a square they capture the area. &lt;br/&gt;Players move and play pieces creating or breaking squares until no further moves can be made and the game comes to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
