							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughterween: A 2-Page Quick-Flick</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slaughterween is a quick-flick that takes place on at a Halloween costume party. Little do the party-goers know, there's danger lurking in the darkness. 25 years ago, a &amp;quot;nerdy&amp;quot; young man was humiliated by his barely-older babysitter and her friends at a Halloween party, resulting in the boy's mind snapping. He killed or disfigured them all and has spent all these years planning his escape to make others like his tormentors pay. Upon escaping, he goes back to his old home... only to find another Halloween party going on. Let the fun (and bloodbath) commence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This flick is designed to be printed out on a single sheet of paper or cardstock (front and back). As such, we have included a version without a background to make it easier on your printer's ink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
