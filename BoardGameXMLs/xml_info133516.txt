			<description>In-Game Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will England fall?  It appears so to King Harold. While fighting in the North (against his brother Torstig and Harald III, king of Norway) Harold's arch enemy, William of Normandy, has landed on the south coast near Hastings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle in Northumberland ends with the deaths of both rivals, but Harold must now drag his weary troops far to the south.  Can he possibly defeat the Duke of Normandy as well?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the upcoming battle, the future of the English speaking world is at stake.  The age of feudalism is nigh, the Crusades will encompass the western world in a few short years.  Will an Anglo-Saxon king or a Norman king lead England into this metamorphic period of world history? Relive the Battle of Hastings and find your destiny!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
