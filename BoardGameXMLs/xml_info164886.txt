			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From its very beginnings, the idea of the Mythos has pervaded role-playing gaming to one extent or another, overtly influencing innumerable authors, developers, and game masters. At its core, the idea behind the Mythos is that there is a vast body of pre-human &amp;mdash; even alien in the most fundamental sense &amp;mdash; history, science, and cosmology, that people periodically perceive glimpses of these cosmic horrors, that those who do quickly find ways to rationalize or forget about them, and that those who seek to delve into them suffer madness, death, or fates even worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d-Infinity Volume #6 Contents&lt;br/&gt;Editorial: &amp;ldquo;The Mythos&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Fiction: &amp;ldquo;Their Blood Is the Sea&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Dice: &amp;ldquo;Mobile Apps&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Prop Room: &amp;ldquo;The Allure of Innsmouth Gold&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Cthulhu Live: &amp;ldquo;The Ageless&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Swords of Kos Fantasy Campaign Setting: &amp;ldquo;Heroes and Heroines of Kos&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Basic System/Labyrinth Lord: &amp;ldquo;Six Mythos Spells&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Basic System/Mutant Future: &amp;ldquo;Artifacts of the Wastelands&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Basic System/Mutant Future: &amp;ldquo;Enter ... The Living Building&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Pathfinder System: &amp;ldquo;Putting H.P. Lovecraft In Game Terms&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Chevauchee: &amp;ldquo;The Saga of the Wyrm&amp;rsquo;s Son&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Board Game: &amp;ldquo;Dagon Rising&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Cardstock CharactersTM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d&amp;infin; (&amp;ldquo;d-Infinity&amp;rdquo;) is a multi-platform gaming supplement that covers a wide variety of rules systems and includes content that can be universally applied to many different sorts of table-top, live-action, and role-playing games. It includes both material that can be applied to all or many sorts of games and items that are self-standing and which can be played on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features of each thematic volume include new rules, stats, and bonus content tying in with several different game systems; paper miniatures; and interviews. Rules systems supported include Pathfinder, OGL v.3.5, 4th Edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; system, Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls, Labyrinth Lord, Mutant Future, Call of Cthulhu, and Cthulhu Live. It is jointly published by Armorcast, Dagon Industries Inc., Dark Threads, Flying Buffalo Inc., Mindgame Productions, OffWorld Designs Inc., Skirmisher Publishing LLC, and the United States Marine Space Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that the most enjoyable gaming periodicals are not just devoted to single games or even the products of a single company, but also include content that makes a reader interested in other games, material that can be applied to all or many sorts of games, and items that are self-standing and which can be played on their own. For that reason, this publication includes many voices and exclusive material compatible with many rules systems and the products of many different companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
