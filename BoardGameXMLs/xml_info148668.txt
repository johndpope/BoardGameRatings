							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turbo Rally Card Racing</name>
									
			<description>Using your own 1:64 scale diecast cars, race opponents along rally themed card tracks that you create. The cards are expandable so you can challenge unlimited players and build courses as simple or as big as you can imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, flip one track card over, and follow the signs as you race through jumps and obstacles toward the finish line. The first player to reach the winner's circle wins one of five trophies. Trophy winners earn performance upgrades like run-flat tires, off-road tires, turbo and driver agility cards that give boosts for one race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPM (Radical Performance Maneuvers) draw cards give players opportunities to boost ahead, burst through obstacles or sabotage opponents. Each player start with three RPM cards that can be played on theirs or an opponent's turn. Players earn more cards by landing on designated RPM track spaces. Multiple card combinations can be played to enhance effects or counter one another. RPMs last for one turn and include NOS, off-road tires, run-flat tires, green lights, tire spikes and sideswipes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most trophies after five races is the tournament champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
