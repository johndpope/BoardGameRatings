							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island Survival</name>
									
			<description>A competitive game where all players compete to be the first off an island by collecting the oars to a raft they have to build.  Meanwhile they have to try to maintain resources on the island to stay alive such as food, water and shelter.  Players battle it out till one person sails off or everyone else is dead.  Can you survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Island Survival pits you against your opponents.  As you find food, water and shelter you also collect items left from previous castaways that help you survive.  In your search for items to survive you will come across pieces of a raft.  There are eight pieces in all and as each piece is uncovered everyone must assess their health and pay the price for their missing essentials (food, water and shelter). Once all 8 raft pieces are found, the first person to take possession of both oars is able to sail off the island and win the game. Of course, you can always take your hand made weapons and hunt the other players. Last man standing always gets off the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a turn-based card game with combat decided by dice rolls and strategic card playing.  As you role play one of six unique characters, you will find new ways to survive the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
