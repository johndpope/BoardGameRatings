							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alien Poltergeist</name>
									
			<description>A Psycho Thriller aboard an unlisted space station possessed by an alien poltergeist. Fear is behind every door in this truly terrifying haunt. Players blindly move through the maze like station and are subjected to torturous illusions, paranormal attacks, ghostly creatures, blood curdling events and disturbing scenes. These scenes are windows into the poltergeists psyche and begin to reveal it's psychological make up (this is a random build). As you begin to learn about the Poltergeist you can prepare by collecting items and imagery to help exercise it. When 3 sub-personality traits are revealed, the exorcism is triggered, the poltergeist reveals it's true form and it's core personality trait (picked random from 10). The 3 sub-personality traits plus the core makeup the unique attacks and defenses of the Poltergeist. Players must use their own personality make ups to battle the Poltergeist plus anything else they can find on the station. Players win by successfully exercising the Poltergeist by attacking it's weaknesses revealed in the psychological make up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
