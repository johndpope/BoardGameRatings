							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder in the Forum</name>
									
			<description>This two-player abstract strategy game plays out an angry disagreement within the forum of a provincial town in Roman Britain. Two groups of citizens have come to blows over missing taxes, and pursue each other across the forum plaza and in its surrounding corridors. All pieces move orthogonally, with the aim being to trap their enemies while avoiding capture themselves. Capture is by blocking. Once trapped, hapless citizens are quickly dispatched (removed from the board). A Magistrate and two forum guards have wavering allegiances, and swap sides each time citizens are murdered. The two guards can also take part in capture. The winner is the player to eliminate all the opposing player's pieces. Leather board and wooden gaming pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
