							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Richie Rich</name>
									
			<description>Richie Rich is based on the comics of the same name.  In this board game, players assume the roles of the titular character and his friends.  Their objective is to deposit jewels at the bank and return home.  Standing in their way are thieves and the pranks of Richie's cousin, Reggie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their pieces along the track by rolling a die.  They may move forwards or backwards.  When they land on a space, they must follow the instructions on it: for example, Reggie makes players lose a turn, while short-cut spaces let players move their pieces further ahead.  Thief spaces, however, stop a moving piece in its tracks and hold it there.  Players must draw an Invention card each turn to obtain one with a number that matches the thief's to escape the criminal's space and continue moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to land exactly on the Finish spot wins and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
