							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Where in the World is Jefferson Sancarlos</name>
									
			<description>Catch Sancarlos and his Henchmen! There&amp;rsquo;s a new thief on the planet: Jefferson Sancarlos. He and his gang of B.I.L.E. (Boys and girls involved in Lewd Enterprises) Henchmen are stealing every romantic and symbolic landmark, building, and natural resource they can grab. The only way to stop Sancarlos and his crew is to get the Chef and the ACNE detectives on the case to cook up a plan to catch them. Join the ACNE detectives and start returning the stolen loot by catching Sancarlos and his Henchmen. To win, be the detective to retrieve the most valuable stolen treasures! This game is not related to any other thieves who travel the world and is designed as a parody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player serves as the game's moderator, called The Chef, unless only two people are playing. Players choose one of six ACNE Detective profiles. Players create eight columns of cards by placing one of the eight B.I.L.E. Henchmen at the top of the grid, with four Stolen Location cards under him or her. Extra Location Cards are set aside and not used. After The Chef reads the character background aloud for each of the Henchmen, the Detectives, in turn, pick an Evidence card, which will ask for one of the following: Location, Connection to Jefferson Sancarlos, which B.I.L.E Henchman stole a particular location, and whose ACNE Detective Territory the Location is in. That player then selects one of the Location cards on the bottom row of the grid, and attempts to identify the Evidence point requested for that Location. Each Location card has a number of prison years on the back. If a player guesses the correct answer, he/she keeps the card and notes the prison years collected. Detectives want the highest number of prison years possible, to put Sancarlos' Henchmen away for that many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all four Location cards under a Henchman have been collected, the player taking the last location captures that Henchmen. The game ends when the first player captures his/her third B.I.L.E. Henchman or when all Henchmen have been captured. Each player adds up his/her prison years. For each Henchman captured, the player earns a bonus of 50 prison years. The ACNE Detective with the most total points (prison years) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
