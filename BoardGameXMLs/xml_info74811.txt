							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Paladins&#039; Plague</name>
									
			<description>From the front cover overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leaders of Elturel are concerned about the plagueland a few miles outside the city, which has recently begun spewing out even more twisted monstrosities than usual. The paladins have put out a call for adventuring companies to send their best and bravest explorers to venture to the border, if not into the plagueland itself. The expedition's charter is to bring back any information about the horrors within and what might be causing the increase in Spellplague activity. This is a risky assignment, offering adventurers the chance to make a name for themselves by braving one of the most dangerous and least understood threats in all of Faerun: an active plagueland. This adventure is a two-round continuous-play Living Forgotten Realms Battle Interactive set in Elturgard for characters levels 1-17.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Notes:&lt;/b&gt; This adventure is combat-intensive. Players who do not enjoy difficult combat encounters are less likely to enjoy this adventure. All of the characters in the party must be within a single level band (1-4, 4-7, 7-10, 11-14, or 14-17). It is recommended that at least three characters be members of the same Adventuring Company. This adventure takes place after the events of the various SPEC2-1 adventures, but playing the adventures in order is not required. This adventure may only be run at Wizards Play Network (WPN) Public Play events. It is not sanctioned for Private Play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
