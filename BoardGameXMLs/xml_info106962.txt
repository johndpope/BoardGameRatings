			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jealousy smolders inside Master Shake like chocolate in a fondue pot. Frylock has been admitted into Jersey Pines, South Jersey's most prestigious and exclusive public golf course. With Meatwad as his caddy, Shake aims to crack some heads and sink some putts, defeating Frylock at his own game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do battle against Carl, the Mooninites, MC Pee Pants, the Plutonians and other classic villains. Drive your electric golf cart like a real jerk, with complete disregard for your own life. Race against the Frat Aliens in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Hear the actual voices of your favorite cartoon characters, recorded in incredible digital quality. Learn how to finally hit a sand wedge properly. Only you can ensure that Master Shake is triumphant over evil, and the mandatory dress code regarding collared shirts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
