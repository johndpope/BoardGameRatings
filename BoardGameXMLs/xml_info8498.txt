							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lord of the Rings: Battle of Destiny</name>
									
			<description>This game is played in two parts. First, you must cast the magical stones to divine your personality, strengths and weaknesses. Will your destiny take you to Mount Doom to destroy the ring so that Good will prevail, or will you guard your precious band and give it to Lord Sauron to rule the world? One stone will give you faith in hard times and can give you the ability to glimpse into the future, while another will give you true power should you listen to your intuition. Fate awaits your roll. After your character is divined, you must battle to either control or destroy the One Ring. Once found, you must take the One Ring to Mount Doom and fulfill your destiny. Along the way, your power may change as Gandalf aids you in your struggle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
