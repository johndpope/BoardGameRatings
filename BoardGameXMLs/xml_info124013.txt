Write new orders&lt;br/&gt;2. Declare charges&lt;br/&gt;3. Normal moves&lt;br/&gt;4. Artillery fire&lt;br/&gt;5. Musketry fire&lt;br/&gt;6. Melee&lt;br/&gt;7. Morale Checks&lt;br/&gt;8. Compulsory Moves&lt;br/&gt;Units move from 4&amp;quot; to 18&amp;quot; depending of type and terrain and the range of weapons goes from 0&amp;quot; to 18&amp;quot; for infantry and 0&amp;quot; to 60&amp;quot; to artillery (with special ranges for canister and howitzers)&lt;br/&gt;Combats are resolved with D6, either for melee or fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
