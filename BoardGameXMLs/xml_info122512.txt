			<description>The goal of the game is to build the best buildings in his village like church, school, town hall, fire fighters, homes and businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player chooses his village and receives a color pawn.&lt;br/&gt;In turn the player draws a card and cards allow you to either acquire a building or to move his pawn. Different buildings scores differently.&lt;br/&gt;The first to reach 100 points wins. Otherwise the game ends when all the buildings are placed and the player who has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
