			<description>From back of the box&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the farthest reaches of the galaxy, only the RIMRUNNER can protect the Insectoid colonies from the wrath of the deadly Arachnoids...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;On the very edge of known Space, far from the systems of Man, the Insectoid race trave lbetween the stars, colonising uninhabited and long dead planets, despite constant attack from the hostile Arachnoids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To protect their colonies the Insectoids use force shields designed to repel any large metallic objects - such as Arachnoid stormtroopers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To maintain these protective bubbles at full power the force shield generators use vast quantities of energy and need regular recharging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet this need an elite group of Insectoid warriors was created. Using reptilian mounts, known as Runners, bred for speed and endurance, the warriors patrol the colony perimeter, recharging the generators and destroying any hostile lifeforms or Arachnoid probes that have penetrated the shield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus was born the legend of the RIMRUNNER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;You must maintain the force shield generators for the alotted time period. You will then be reassigned to a new colony.&lt;br/&gt;Each colony is equipped with four space Runners which will be sent out as they are needed.&lt;br/&gt;Any generators that require recharging will flash red on the locater. You are not able to recharge a generator while riding, only while on foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
