			<description>Savannah is a highly tactical drafting game about scarce resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;The African summer sun is burning down, heat shimmers over the wide land. Food becomes scarce and the fight for survival begins. Herds and prides of numerous Savannah residents get a move on the draining water holes, trying to get an edge on the last food resources with cunning and trickery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the Game&lt;br/&gt;Players are trying to maintain the balance between animals and resources in the Savannah. The resource that a player collected the least of is crucial for end game scoring (a player's score is equal to her worst-scoring resource, not her best). The player whose least collected resource exceeds the least collected resources of the other players wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Course of the Game&lt;br/&gt;One game consists of a set number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;One round consist of the following four phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Dawn &amp;ndash; choosing Animal cards (drafting)&lt;br/&gt;(2) Noon &amp;ndash; placing Animal tokens (add to play area)&lt;br/&gt;(3) Sunset &amp;ndash; resolving the course of the day (scoring)&lt;br/&gt;(4) Night &amp;ndash; preparing the next round (clear play area)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a certain number of rounds, depending on the player count. 4 rounds in a 2&amp;ndash;3 player game and 3 rounds in a 4&amp;ndash;5 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player counts separately each of the food resources and determines the lowest result of these. Compare this result with the result of the other players. Winner of the game is the player with the highest number for this comparison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
