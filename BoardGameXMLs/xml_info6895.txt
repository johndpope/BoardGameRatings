			<description>The Game of Family Knowledge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a party game intended for play by families.  Each team tries to answer questions about their own family; the best ones are those where one player has to write down his answer to a personal question, then everyone else tries to guess what his answer was.  Good for a light fun time at a family get-together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
