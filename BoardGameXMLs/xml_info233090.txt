			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Esmeralda County is a card game consisting of two decks of cards of Wanted Criminals, and Citizens. Games last between 30(for lesser numbers of players)-90(large groups of players) minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object the Esmeralda County is to gain points by capturing the highest profile criminals in the Wild West. The game consists of 6 rounds, with each round showing new Wanted Posters and a draft of Citizens. On a player's turn they play a card by placing it face down beneath one of the Wanted Posters or beneath a Citizen that is beneath a Wanted Poster, in this case, the Citizen above is revealed and has a special ability. This continues until players have no more Citizen cards left in their hand. Citizens that are still face down have the option of paying the reward for the criminal, and capturing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 6 rounds, players count up the profile numbers of the criminals they have caught and the player with the most points is not only the winner, but the most respected lawman in the West!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
