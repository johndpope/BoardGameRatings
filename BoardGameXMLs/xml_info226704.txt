							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WARLOCK: Rules for the Universe of 1999 - 2000</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several years ago, the first copies of a new game called Dungeons and Dragons appeared on the market. Fantasy fans and gamers in general were enthralled at the possibilities. Most of them became hooked on the game, due to its unusual and imaginative nature. You could actually do unusual things: slay dragons, rescue the downtrodden, and just grab loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When our group first started playing the game, our overall reaction was that it had great ideas, &amp;quot;but maybe we should change the combat system, clarify the Magic, and redo the monsters&amp;quot;. Warlock is not intended to replace D&amp;amp;D, and, indeed would not exist without that classic game. What we have tried to do is present a way of expanding D&amp;amp;D without the contradictions and loopholes inherent in the original rules and with various supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The item is available as a single (combined) PDF file, or as separate files in PDF and/or DOC format, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Title Page&lt;br/&gt;        Introduction&lt;br/&gt;        Combat Rules&lt;br/&gt;        Cleric Rules&lt;br/&gt;        Magic User Rules&lt;br/&gt;        Illusionist Rules&lt;br/&gt;        Spellsinger Rules&lt;br/&gt;        Thievish Rules&lt;br/&gt;        Stronghold / Hireling Rules&lt;br/&gt;        Magic Item Rules&lt;br/&gt;        Character Sheets (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;        Expedition Report (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;        Known/Research Lists (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
