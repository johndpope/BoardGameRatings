			<description>The playing field is a checkered board, 8x8 or 6x6(for learning or fast games). The pieces are double-sided discs with directionality. Pieces can capture each other chess-style, and be promoted from minions to masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece shows arrows pointing at the direction it can move - up-down or left-right. Every time a piece moves, it rotates 90 degrees when it lands, changing its direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic pieces, called minions, must move to a square of a different color. So if they start on a black square, they must land on a white square. Promoted pieces, called masters, may land anywhere along their line. Pieces cannot jump each other, and they capture by landing on an enemy-occupied square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Promotion occurs, when a minion piece lands on a corner space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when all minions are gone. Winner is the player with the most masters on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
