			<description>Frenetic is a fast and furious word game of the elements. Players race against the clock with just 45 seconds to form as many words as possible using the element symbol tiles, adding together the Atomic numbers of each tile used to create a word. For example Ba na na = banana = 78 points! Amazingly there are over 10,000 words that can be created using combinations of the element symbol tiles from the frenetic periodic table game board. Fun, frantic, action is guaranteed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score 1,000 points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for 2 or more players from 8+, frenetic offers wide appeal with everyone playing all the time and combines skill, strategy as well as an element of luck at a frenzied pace. Quick setup with easy to follow how-to-play booklet will have you enjoying frenetic with family and friends instantly, with the frenzied game play lasting anything from just 15 - 45 minutes. Beware how addictive it becomes! No need to be worried you don't have to be techies or a genius to play and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
