			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&amp;rsquo;s Resource supplement by John Bennett&lt;br/&gt;A hard people live in the village of Macrimei, nestled between desolate, windswept hills. Its people raise shaggy ponies and large hunting dogs. Dung fires warm the homes built from the ruins of an ancient city buried deep below whose remnants can be seen in the tumbled stones scattered about and the large red obelisk looming over the village square. Said to be home to Macrimei&amp;rsquo;s god, the Red Obelisk has attracted the attentions of a band of raiders and an evil wizard, who dwells in a mysterious black tower, seeking to claim the secrets buried beneath Macrimei for their own. Now, the villagers of Macrimei live in a sullen fear as the raiders capture people from the surrounding area to excavate a large pit into the ruins below. Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For free samples head over to Raging Swan's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
