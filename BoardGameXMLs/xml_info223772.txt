							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Water: The deckbuilding water-cycle game</name>
									
			<description>Water is an introductory deckbuilder based on the water cycle. Game play is symbol based to enable younger children and language independent play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Water, players build their deck by purchasing cards from the river using rain and snow tokens. The game ends when all the snow tokens are removed from the cloud, so strategy of when to buy and when to collect comes into play. Other deckbuilding mechanisms such as getting rid of weaker cards help new players lean the basics of this mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thematically, cards can move rain or snow between the cloud, a player's reservoir, and other players' reservoirs. Cards can also change the state of the water from gas in the cloud to liquid or solid in the reservoirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
