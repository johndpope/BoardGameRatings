			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the far future, rich eccentric Clayton Douglas creates a distant planetary colony using elements of technology and architecture from 1920s through 1940s America. Decades of increasingly corrupt and ineffectual Mayors follow Douglas' death, eventually culminating in the administration of the tyrannical Mayor Hoodler. Hoodler creates an oppressive police state designed to ruthlessly control society, forcing total conformity to Douglas' original vision. The characters exist in this dystopia amidst cybernetic detectives, mutant mobsters, alien-touched drug lords, vat-bred blue-collar workers, and human hybrids that can see into an alternate dimension known only as the Jade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring a comprehensive yet easy-to-use game system inspired by the critically acclain\med Cartoon Action Hour system that uses only two six sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dozens of locations scattered across the ten boroughs that make up the City, as well as information on the boroughs themselves, from the bureaucratic City center to the slums of Watersdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed information on the people of the City: the races, organize crime, revolutionaries, and even the mysterious G-Men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;tons of information for Narrators, including discussions about genre, advice for running games, adventure seeds and sketches, and a complete adventure to start you off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lavish art and layout to get you into the tech-noir mindset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
