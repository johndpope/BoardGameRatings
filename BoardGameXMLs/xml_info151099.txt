							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every era and every culture has legends, long believed, of a fairy folk that lives long years, collects knowledge like sweet acorns, and possesses a casual magic beyond the greatest efforts of men. Elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tall, graceful, beautiful, skilled; creatures of the forest, occasionally visiting the realms of lesser races. And while most (with notable exceptions) hold to the standards of good and the preservation of nature, there are those who become jaded with the weight of long life, and seek purposes somewhat less noble, pursuable only by those of their eldritch otherness. For their ways are not the ways of other races, and their power is the power of ages, with no limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented here are several options for your elven character, including two variant races, and numerous feats, flaws and equipment, to revitalize an intriguing race as old as fantasy gaming, as old as civilization itself... Easily introduced into your Pathfinder-compatible campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
