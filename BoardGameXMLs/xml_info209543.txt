			<description>Claim: The Search for the Gold Nugget is a card game in which you play as a prospector mining for gold and trying to strike it rich! But you will have to compete with other prospectors to find and hold on to the elusive gold nugget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claim is a deduction and bluffing game for 2-4 players. It plays in around 20-30 minutes, and is appropriate for all ages. Players start with three cards in their hand and their own Secret Stash card out in front of them. In turn players will play cards to try to find the gold nugget card hidden in the deck or hidden by other players. Players will try to keep the gold nugget hidden from other players in either their hand or under their Secret Stash. The player who is holding on the gold nugget when the deck runs out and the game ends wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gold rush is on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
