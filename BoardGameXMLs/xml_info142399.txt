			<description>From box bottom:&lt;br/&gt;Here is a chance to test your memory!  The object of the game is to find the 15 numbers, starting with No. 1 and continuing through in sequence to No. 15.  To start: all the counters are placed face down on the board.  In turn, lift a counter and check the number on the bottom.  If it is not number 1, replace it, trying to to memorize the numbers and positions of replaced counters.  Then try to find nr. 2, and so on.  When the counters are found in the correct order, they are placed, right side up, in their proper places on the edge of the board.  You can play alone or against an opponent.  Simple rules with a score card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
