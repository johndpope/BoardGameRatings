			<description>A trivia-game in which you throw two dice in your turn. You move your pawn the number op pips on the dice and answer a question from the topcard of the deck in the color of the place your pawn is on. The player on your left asks the question.&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 categories:&lt;br/&gt;orange = general&lt;br/&gt;blue = architecture&lt;br/&gt;red = culture/sports&lt;br/&gt;purple = economics/geography&lt;br/&gt;green = history&lt;br/&gt;yellow = free choice of category&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you answer the question right, you get a marker of the color of the question asked. You now may throw the dice again for another turn. You can only ever have one marker of each color. When your pawn gets to a color you already have a marker for, just answer the question but no further markers are earned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you answer the question wrong, your turn is over and the player to your left is the next player to throw the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you reach the finish (spot 160) you have to have collected a marker of each category. The other players decide in which category your final quaetion is asked. When aswering right you win and when aswering wrong you get another shot next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
