							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nations At War: Compendium Vol 1</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NaW Compendium gives you three campaigns, Normandy, Operations Cobra and Arnhem.  It's a game of risk and reward as players must learn to conserve their forces. The more lives you spend during one scenario, the fewer they'll have to start the next. However, the more objectives players complete earn them more points which they can use to outfit and re-fit their forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You receive from the campaigns a combined 13 scenarios plus an additional 15 stand alone scenarios and another 15 scenarios from our Line of Fire magazine for a total 43 scenarios in total as well as two redesigned maps. NaW Compendium Vol. 1 is the joining of two previous released expansions titled Airborne, Operation Cobra and all the NaW scenarios from Line of Fire magazine. We have cleaned up the scenarios, redesigned and updated the maps and put everything into our new NaW series style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
