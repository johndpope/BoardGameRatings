							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tracks: The Unique Railroad Quiz Game</name>
									
			<description>A trivia game about railroads. Players roll a die marked with the letters T, R, A, C, K, and S and answer questions in the corresponding categories: T=Early Railroad History, R=Lingo, A=Famous Names and Places, C=Technical Data and Reporting Marks, K=Passenger Trains and Logos, S=Pot-Pourri (sic).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Correct answers are worth 5 points. Whether a correct answer is made or not, a player's turn is over after they answer.&lt;br/&gt;The game can end one of two ways. First, if a player can roll the letters in the same sequence as the title on their turns (and successfully answer the corresponding questions), they win the game upon the completion of answering the last question. Since this will prove to be rather rare, the first player to reach 50 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game questions can also be used with Trivial Pursuit or other trivia games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's box includes the aforementioned die, 500 cards with 3,000 questions (500 from each category), rules, a category summary sheet and a surprisingly large amount of information on the cover artist (in spite of the game including no information on the actual designer of the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
