							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The SKETCH System Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SKETCH games are designed for one-off, single night adventures, for when gaming groups are taking a break between campaigns, or if a few players want to do a fast off-the-cuff adventure with no intention of getting involved in a long campaign. Of course, the rules can be used for long campaigns if you really want, but the simplicity of the rules and character creation is such that a game can be set up in minutes and run in just one night. The rules are simple and easy to use, requiring only the use of one six-sided dice for all aspects of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, if you find yourself stuck for an evening&amp;rsquo;s adventure and need something to play at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice or you want to playtest a new campaign setting you&amp;rsquo;ve designed, then a SKETCH game is your answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
