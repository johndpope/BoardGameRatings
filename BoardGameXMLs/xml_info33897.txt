			<description>This is a two player trick taking game by Michael Schoessow (who also designed the award-winning piecepack/Ice House game Alien City) that can also be played with four players by adding an additional deck of cards and playing in partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First each player draws for a poison suit, cards are dealt and then each player secretly selects their profit ranks. Game play consists of two phases, (1) cards are played into the pond, and (2) the trick taking phase. Players attempt to win tricks containing their profit ranks while avoiding cards in their poison suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
