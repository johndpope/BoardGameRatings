			<description>With this release Adlung Spiele has made a card game version of the old game &amp;quot;Kim's game&amp;quot;. The deck consists of 60 cards and on each card there is a different picture, eg. a city, a mug, a bike etc... One player places a number of cards on the table (the more cards, the more difficult). The other players study the cards for 30-60 seconds, then they close their eyes. The dealer turns one card over and on the count of three the other players can open their eyes and try to remember what's pictured on the flipped card. The first player to shout out the correct picture on the flipped card gets it. Get the most cards and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can of course be played with anything (a standard deck of cards, toys, kitchen utensils etc.) but it's more fun with a dedicated deck and since it is packed in a real small box it can be taken everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
