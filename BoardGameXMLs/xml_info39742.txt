			<description>This is a three dimensional (you can also play flat in just 2 dimensions as well) crossword game.  Players take turns building their words, much like Scrabble with no board and in 3 dimensions.  Connectors are used when you plan to go vertical (which also changes the orientation 90 degrees).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
