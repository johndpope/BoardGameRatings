			<description>The object of the game depends of the hero played by the child:&lt;br/&gt;Peter Pan: save as many children or remove hook&lt;br/&gt;Hook: capture a maximum number of children or remove Peter Pan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will move one checker according to the illustration of the card he plays.&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the clan he represents, he will try to bring this character of his hero or away from each other. It must reflect the specific character displacement (2, 4 or 8 possible directions, the right to capture another character or not).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To retrieve a child captured, only the Duel is possible only once per player per game. We then use all the cards of two players to do battle. When all cards have been played, the one possessing the highest number wins the Duel and the child may choose to switch sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the following events:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Peter Pan is captured&lt;br/&gt;     Hook is captured&lt;br/&gt;     All the lost children are out of the game (as they were captured or saved)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
