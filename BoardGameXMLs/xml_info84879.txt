							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DownsideUp</name>
									
			<description>The name of the game is DownsideUp. It is played and scored like rummy, but with a vengeful twist.  Players are dealt a hand of cards, with the goal being to rid yourself of all the cards in your hand. You can do this by playing cards to the table, in groups of three, either in sets (groups of cards with the game value from different suits) or in runs (three or more consecutive cards for one suit). Once a person lays down a group of cards, other players -- including the player who played the original set -- can now &amp;quot;lay off&amp;quot; cards to that group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique components of this game are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Negative Cards - When you think your opponent has amassed too many points and is about to win the game, take revenge and play your negative cards to take points away for your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Discarding your card Downsideup - If you have been watching which cards your opponent is collecting and you think your discard is going to help them, then play your discard &amp;ldquo;Downsideup&amp;rdquo; to keep your opponent from seeing that card, but remember where you put it so you can play it again later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.    Wild Cards - When your opponent lays down the card you have been waiting for to complete their run or set of card, use a wild card instead to play those cards to score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
