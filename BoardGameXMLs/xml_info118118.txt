							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mogogol</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever wanted to play a swashbuckling frog, an amphibious acrobat, or a toadly priest in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game? Then perhaps mogogol is the race for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For eons the amphibious frog people common to the dismal swamps of the realm were known for malicious cruelty, greed, and cowardice. Their acts were so despicable and loathsome that they truly earned the nickname bog-bullies. It seemed entirely unlikely that any good could come from these stupid and ugly muck dwellers, but something strange happened only two centuries ago that would dawn a new race of impeccable good. A curse, some say it was. Others blame a highly infectious brain disease. Whatever the cause, a small family of bog-bullies, known as the Mogogols could do no harm. Driven by an insane desire to do good deeds, and lead by other manic tendencies, this race left the dismal swamps and embarked on a remarkable journey. When hard times befell other bog-bullies, and even other frog-like races, when all others turned their backs, the Mogogols were there to lend a flipper. Nearly two hundred years later, the mogogols emerged as a unique race in their own right; the descendants of the Mogogol family and hundreds of other frog-like people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
