			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; Dice game for 2 players. Each player controls a nest of newly hatched baby sea turtles trying to make their way across the beach to the sea.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chess board or other 8x8 grid. One edge of the board represents the ocean shore. The row on the opposite end of the board is the Nest Row, where the players' nests are located. Each player starts with six baby sea turtle tokens in the player's nest. There are three predator tokens - the crab, gull, and raccoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The player who gets the most of his turtles off the map &amp;amp; into the Sea wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
