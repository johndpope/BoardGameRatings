							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mini Torpedo Game</name>
									
			<description>Cheap and cheerful game featuring a plastic board with a 'gun' in two corners. Each player takes 3 balls and 2 ships and sets up his ships in the notches for FLAG SHIP and 2nd SHIP as shown on the box. Then each player takes 3 torpedoes (ball-bearings) for his gun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player places a ball inside his torpedo as shown on the box. He moves the torpedo to the right or left to aim the shot in the desired direction and then presses the trigger to release the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in turn, gets to shoot three times, trying to knock down the ships of his opponent. Knocking over a FLAG SHIP scores 30 points, knocking over the 2nd SHIP scores 10 points. The player with the highest score wins. A perfect score is 40.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
