			<description>One year after the events of the original game, the world continues to embrace and explore the cube worlds that resulted from the opening of the planet's core. One day King Jibral and Zola encounter a mysterious evil three-headed dragon shadow called Balaur emerging from one of the cubes. Zola has a bad feeling about it and after informing Shu and the party, they find themselves on another adventure to discover this new threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue Dragon Plus is a real time strategy game. Its gameplay style is similar to that of Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings, also for the DS. It can be played entirely with the Nintendo DS stylus. Like in Revenant Wings, battles initiate once the party comes in contact with the enemy, and the characters can attack automatically. Characters can also engage in Shadow Battles when an enemy with a shadow is encountered. Magic can be used when characters use their skills by summoning their shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Blue Dragon Plus&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
