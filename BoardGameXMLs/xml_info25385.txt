			<description>Zzzymble is a card game with five suits, containing the numbers 1-9, plus various special cards that affect gameplay. Players are trying to play their cards into a 5x5 grid. Cards may not be played adjacently (orthogonally or diagonally) to another card that match either number or color. When the grid is full, players sum card values remaining in their hands. Over a number of rounds (playing to 100 points), the winner is the player with the fewest points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A planned forthcoming expansion is called &amp;quot;It's as Zzzymble as Zzzat.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
