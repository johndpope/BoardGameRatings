			<description>The rabbits eat delicious vegetables in the garden. In front of the garden fence they discover big carrots. In the middle of the garden there is a hole. Caution! Don't fall down there! First there is a thin chain that is laid around all players' pawns which are placed around that hole on the board. Each turn the player throws the die and moves as many fields to the outside as the die shows. When a rabbit reaches the chain it is pushed forward in an outside direction while opposite rabbits located in the opposite direction are pushed towards the hole and may fall into it when the thrown die shows enough eyes. The winner is the player who has at least one rabbit left at the end.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
