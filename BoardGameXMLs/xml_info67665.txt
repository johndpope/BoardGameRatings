							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms &amp; Encounters: The Plunderers</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You enter a large T-shaped room. Large panels of plain gray granite form the walls floor and ceiling. In the center is a raised dais atop of which sits a massive statue of an obese three-horned, four-armed, monkey-like creature. Large gems glitter in each of its eye sockets, and its long forked tongue slithers from an eerie smile. Hammered into the side of the statue, several iron spikes spaced a foot apart ascend in 1-foot increments to the statues shoulder. Ancient runes scar all four walls, however they are worn beyond accurate deciphering. A pungent odor of wet dog taints the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover The Plunderers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive The Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 27, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
