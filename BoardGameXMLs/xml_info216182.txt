							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nailbiter Football</name>
									
			<description>The flagship title of Nailbiter Games, Nailbiter Football is a simulation designed for the solo player.  Instead of resolving a game through an extended play-by-play process, you will experience all the scoring, drama, tension and heartbreak of a pro contest through a series of game highlights and crucial turning points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player will compete against a Ghost Coach who calls plays based on a roll on a Play Selection Chart based on down and distance.  There are 14 Offensive plays to choose from, and three special Defensive plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of each possession is determined by cross referencing the roll of two six-sided dice with the appropriate chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
