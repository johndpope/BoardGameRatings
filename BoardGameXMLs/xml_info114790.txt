							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Kerberos</name>
									
			<description>The captain of Les Jaeger, Kerberos, also known among his subordinates as the God of Blood, is an inhuman creature that feeds on death to satisfy his immortal appetite. He regularly competes with the Colonel for the position of primacy amongst Azur Alliance agents. He comes out on top much of the time due to his monstrous powers and millennia of experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Azur Alliance Warrior - Lv. 50&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 5 | Dm 4 | Df 9 | Ar 1 | LP 15 | Re 10 | Mo 8/12 | AP 3/4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Independent: Kerberos can't receive Arbiter Orders.&lt;br/&gt;Blood Puppets: If Kerberos is in your group, Azur Agents receive +1 attack. If Kerberos dies, all Azur Agents are automatically removed as casualties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oo - Bloody Wings (Special, Movement)&lt;br/&gt;Kerberos moves 16 in. in a straight line. During this movement he is considered to have Flight. This consumes one Blood Counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ooo - Midnight Bless (Ki, Attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 6 Attack. Consumes one Blood Counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ooo - Sanguinis Vitae (Ki, Attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 3 Attack. If this deals damage, put two additional Blood Counters on Kerberos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KERBEROS Lord Of Blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood Counter: At the beginning of the game, put a Blood Counter on Kerberos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Power of Blood: Before any Attack or Defense roll (normal or special) you may spend a Blood Counter to roll an additional die and choose the result you prefer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regeneration: During Kerberos' activation you may choose to exchange a Blood Counter for Healing Lv. 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood Absorption: If Kerberos damages an enemy after an attack or charge, he obtains a Blood Counter. This ability doesn't affect Gears, Summons or Undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
