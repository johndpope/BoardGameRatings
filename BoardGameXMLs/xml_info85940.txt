			<description>Back of the Game Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The primary objective of the game is to create large, lively medieval towns.&lt;br/&gt;     The settlers interact with each other in a completely natural way and have wants and needs of their own.&lt;br/&gt;     Female settlers appear for the first time in the series: Men and women fall in love with each other and marry.&lt;br/&gt;     The lively, detailed game world is rich in animal and plant life.&lt;br/&gt;     The settlers' busy life is presented in lovingly rendered animations that show what is going on in a transparent way.&lt;br/&gt;     The world is divided into four climatic zones with changes of season and weather which influence expansion and resource gathering.&lt;br/&gt;     The game's instant accessibility and gentle learning curve ensure long-lasting fun; even in advanced game missions, new features are introduced.&lt;br/&gt;     All interventions by the player are reflected in the behaviour of his subjects and made transparent through the animations in the game world.&lt;br/&gt;     Starting with a small settlement, the player builds up flourishing towns, maintains trade relations, and claims land and villages. This requires diplomatic skills.&lt;br/&gt;     Mining, gathering resources, and food production result from wise planning and the various occupations of the settlers.&lt;br/&gt;     Goods transport is optimised through skilful road planning.&lt;br/&gt;     Upgrading buildings step-by-step improves the effectiveness of the economy and towns.&lt;br/&gt;     By hiring travelling entertainers and organizing fairs, the player acts as a matchmaker by enabling male and female settlers to get to know each other.&lt;br/&gt;     The player can build walls to protect his towns from enemy attacks. In military actions, the player must prove that he has built up his empire in such a way that it can defend itself effectively.&lt;br/&gt;     Missions featuring noble knights with various skills accompany the player through the epic storyline penned by Jeff Grubb.&lt;br/&gt;     Dynamic single player campaign&lt;br/&gt;     Freeplay mode with a multitude of maps&lt;br/&gt;     Numerous multiplayer options via LAN and Internet&lt;br/&gt;     Includes a map editor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
