							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TV Play-along Wheel of Fortune</name>
									
			<description>The first handheld electronic device made to play Wheel. No puzzles are stored in the device's memory. Players could use the device during syndicated episodes from August 31, 1988 through &amp;quot;at least&amp;quot; September 1, 1990 to read puzzles directly from the television screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device can be used to play using either of the two VHS tapes available. Point the device at the television set while the VHS tape is playing and the device will be programmed with a puzzle. Puzzles can also be programmed manually using the keyboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to three players can play the standard game that is based on the television series. There is also a &amp;quot;Jackpot&amp;quot; version for an unlimited number of players where the puzzle solver gets a jackpot that starts at $1,000 but is reduced $100 for every letter guessed. In either version, the winner is the person who has the most money after a predetermined number of puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
