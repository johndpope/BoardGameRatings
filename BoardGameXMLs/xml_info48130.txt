			<description>Cover/Jacket Text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a fantasy role playing game, you become a main character in an adventure you create.

In this volume, an Elvish Dictionary provides pronunciation and grammar guidelines for the Eldarin tongues, Sindarin and Quenya. Listed translations of Elvish and English words and phrases let you decipher the silver speech of Elven Lords and create authentic names for the Eldar and their enchanted sites. A Glossary of Terms lists Middle-earth definitions, identities, and places in an accessible index. Your campaign comes alive with the secrets of the Ainur, the whereabouts of Hild&amp;oacute;rien and the lineage of Thranduil - all at your fingertips!
