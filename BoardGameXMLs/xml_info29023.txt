			<description>Original introductory wargame, released in early 80&amp;acute;s in Brazil, from a small company called JOG. The games was quite simple, last just with 5 turns&amp;lt; The game had a small map and eleven counters. The main idea of JOG was to introduce the hobby in Brazil, but by 1982, the company was broke and the JOG remains only in the memories of veteran wargamers. Polonia (or Invasion of Poland) was the first of a game series which included another wargames (France 1940, Barbarossa, Ardennes, etc), but there were errors in order of battle, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But JOG and their other games created the first generation of wargamers in Brazil, and now many of them, recognize the great importance of this initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
