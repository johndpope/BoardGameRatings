			<description>Careful is a dexterity game similar to Villa Paletti and Jenga.  In the set-up, players build a bell tower five levels high using the plastic colored support posts and floors provided, as dictated by the color dots on the floor levels.  Supports are not placed on the top floor; a heavy plastic-enclosed bell structure is placed in the centre of this level, which sounds when the tower becomes unstable.  Then comes the deconstruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of spinning the spinner and removing a pillar of the color spun from any floor of the tower. The floor levels have channels cut in them that makes the movement and removal of the support posts a challenge.  Players may manipulate the tower as necessary to remove the pillar, but all pillars removed on a turn that are not the spun color must be replaced before removing the objective support post.  Play continues until the tower falls; the player causing this to occur receives no points for the round whilst all other players receive points based on the color and number of supports taken on their turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play a number of rounds equal to the number of players playing.  The player who accumulates the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
