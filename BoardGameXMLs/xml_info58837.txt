							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Later Blue Tome of Amaxathroth the Cursed</name>
									
			<description>Website Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Amaxathroth the Eternal! He was a cursed wanderer, an immortal scribe, whose bitter words yet linger in these later ages to blacken hearts with greed and sorcery. Enter now the decayed final aeon of Amaxathroth's world, and walk its demon-haunted ruins, its fetid cities of rogues and vermin. Of the splendors of past ages little now remains, but wonder in awe at the fanes of Magak, the sorcerers' spires of Harumetha. This is a time of sorcery, rot, and ruin, and it will have its claws into your heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Later Blue Tome of Amaxathroth the Cursed is a 144-page mini-supplement for Ron Edwards' Sorcerer and Sorcerer &amp;amp; Sword, currently available as either a full color PDF or black and white print paperback. It is a lush portrait of a demon-ridden world of corruption and decay, written by Reason and richly illustrated by artists including Scott Purdy, Chris Huth, and Eric Lofgren.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
