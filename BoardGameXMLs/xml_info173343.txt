			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a set of 28,  8 x10 inch Battlemaps of Modern Trains, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;Please note, these were made more for playability that accuracy of scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If this ICBM gets to the launch site and is armed with a biological, chemical or nuclear warhead, millions may be at risk. Sneak on to the train, ride to the launch site, and then destroy both the missile and the launcher before they can arm the ICBM.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trains and Subways Modern includes twenty-eight pages of the interiors of trains and subway cars with a gravel and plains exterior for above ground train pages and a walkway platform to step down to the subway cars for underground subway pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trains and Subways Modern is intended for modern or near future science fiction games. For older steam engine trains, use our Trains Wild West product instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missile Smuggling: For this adventure, it is suggested the group play as spies or Special Forces for the military. The government has been alerted to an enemy threat. A train is carrying an ICBM from a storage silo to an unknown launch site. The government fears that the ICBM is going to be armed with a biological, chemical, or nuclear threat once it reaches the launch site. The government or military orders the group to sneak onto this train and get to the launch site. After arrival at the launch site, the group is to destroy the launching apparatus and the missile. But they don&amp;rsquo;t stop at a location, but instead find themselves running parallel with another train. The enemy has manufactured a curious new weapon, a massive train rocket launcher intended to be used as a mobile missile firing platform. The enemy attempts to move the ICBM from the first train to the rocket launcher train with a crane on a train car, arm it, and then launch it with the train rocket launcher. The group has to blow up the second train while dealing with enemy forces on the train trying to stop them. (Note that this set has a missile carrying train car but not a crane or rocket launcher train car).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
