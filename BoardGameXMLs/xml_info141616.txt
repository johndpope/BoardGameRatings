							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cultist: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ia, Ia! The dark gods of Dungeon World are beholden to you. You know their ways, and you speak their secrets. Those who would listen will find themselves trapped in your spell, brought to linger upon your every word. There is this power you have over the common people, this power that twists their hearts and minds. If you observe the rites and manipulate the whims of those dark things from deep below, you will obtain power unimagined, strength unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those others, those ones who do not bend so easily to your will, those 'heroes.' They whisper ill of you, but none know the darkness as well as one who has been born of it. They need you, though you know it pains them. Without your guidance, they would all be lost. Sometimes, they even believe you when you tell them that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For you are Cultist, and your words have more power than those of lesser beings. When the dark things sing the song that ends the world, you will sing along with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cultist is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game. It uses the Cult mechanic to give you suicidally loyal followers who will do anything you ask of them, creating a class that plays very very differently from any other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in this playbook is the True Friend, a parody playbook of The Cultist with 80% of the same mechanics, but an entirely different feel and fiction behind it. The True Friend recruits friends to help him out and make him The Real Hero. Please enjoy this bonus gift, just for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
