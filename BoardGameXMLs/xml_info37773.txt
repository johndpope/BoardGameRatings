							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Spiel des Lebens Kartenspiel</name>
									
			<description>The highs and lows of an entire life in just 20 minutes: great advancement or even the total bankruptcy. An exciting life begins with each new shuffle...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The life cards are divided into 4 colors (green/love, blue/education, orange/life, pink/luxury). Each color includes 10 numbered cards and a joker. The joker can be used for any other number. At the end of the game you gain life points for the sets of cards you have made during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 possibilities to form a set &amp;ndash; cards of the same color in number order (4,5,6,7) or a group of the same number (3,3,3). In addition, each life card shows a picture. If these images match your lifestyle cards, you get extra points when playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the Game: to win the most life points by playing life-card sets and achieving your own lifestyle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
