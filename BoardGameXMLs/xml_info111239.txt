			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 5th-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 10, 15, or 20 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Note: This is a direct sequel to the Living Spycraft serial, SPA5-03: Nest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Situation At Hand&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Former U.S. Senator Lawrence Johnson is a dedicated Agency operative who&amp;rsquo;s worked as a double agent for nearly twenty years: first for the KGB, then briefly for the siloviki, and now for a shadow cell formed by disenfranchised splinters of former Soviet governments &amp;mdash; or so he thinks. In reality, this shadow cell is part of a much larger organization known collectively as &amp;rdquo;The Franchise.&amp;rdquo; As revealed in the Living Spycraft serial, Nest, The Franchise is now the focus of most Living Spycraft agents&amp;rsquo; interests, with everyone racing to discover the organization&amp;rsquo;s true masters and motives. Now, they may finally have their chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a recent appointee to the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, Lawrence Johnson is in a prime position to accelerate Franchise efforts to undermine democratic action in former Soviet countries, both through conventional espionage and support of rebel military factions. He is also able to regularly and covertly communicate with the outside world, sending reports to the Agency about his encounters with The Franchise. Most recently, one of his reports indicated that he was about to finally be accepted into the Russian shadow cell&amp;rsquo;s command structure, which would give him the information needed to begin filtering additional deep cover operatives into the organization at the ground floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
