							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Balancing Act Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Balancing Act Challenge is based on the Canadian government's Canada's Food Guide To Healthy Eating, which organizes nutritional needs into four food groups: grain products, milk products, vegetables &amp;amp; fruit, and meat &amp;amp; meat alternatives. The object of the game is to be the first player to collect the required number of each food group's Serving Cards. There are challenge squares that would allow players to challenge each other for food-serving cards. If a player lands on the Canadian flag, they may move anywhere on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
