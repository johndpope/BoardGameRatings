							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Seize the Crown</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seize the Crown: Two sons were born to an Emperor &amp;ndash; one light and one dark. The light son was the Emperor's favorite, and the Emperor had no shame in showing it. And so, as they grew up, the younger, darker brother seethed with jealousy. Until one day the dark brother decided that he would make himself Emperor. Through dark machinations, he saw his brother exiled and his father isolated. And then, on one fateful day, he directed his army to attack the palace. The Emperor has chosen to make his final stand in his throne room, from whence he once ruled his empire with a firm hand. He expects to die there, and soon. But the light brother has learned of the dark brother's ill intent, and he has returned from his exile at this pivotal moment. Only, will he reach his father in time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Adventure, three of the Players will be playing &amp;ldquo;story characters.&amp;rdquo; Each story character has a single rule that must be obeyed during character generation. One of the Players will be the Emperor. The only thing the Emperor must be is old enough to have two fully-grown sons. A second Player will be the Brother. The only thing the Brother must be is young enough to be the son of the Emperor. A third Player (if there is one) will be the Emperor's Advisor. The only thing the Advisor must be is allied with the Emperor. Other than that, the Players have full control over who these characters are, from name to abilities to chosen skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
