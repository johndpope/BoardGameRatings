			<description>Parody of Italian politics in the '80s.&lt;br/&gt;Each player leads a party: one is the only honest party (never gets money, but can denounce the politics of the other players; he wins if at least 12 are arrested), one is a party that doesn't care any more about shame, corruption, etc. (he wins if no other player wins within 12 turns) and each other party is &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; (can do favors, get money from illicit sources, etc. but gains point on the &amp;quot;shame-meter&amp;quot;: higher the shame and more likely is that the voters will vote for another player during the next elections; besides if the shame becomes too high the player is eliminated. They win gaining enough votes OR enough money).&lt;br/&gt;During each turn the players draw 2 cards each (cards can give money, give votes, move a party on the &amp;quot;shame-meter&amp;quot;: scandals give points, distractions, e.g. the Soccer World Cup is held in Italy, reduce the shame, etc.), then players vote to elect the President, receive money, face scandals, etc.&lt;br/&gt;During all the game negotiations can be done and they're never binding (sometimes you can be VERY mean, if you want to).&lt;br/&gt;Actions are resolved by either voting (each player has an importance based on the number of electors he represents, of course) or with dice rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
