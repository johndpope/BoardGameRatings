			<description>Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poetry:&lt;br/&gt;Herbs and Spices - Bob Liddil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player's Aid:&lt;br/&gt;Little Shop of Poisons and Potions - Bob Liddil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher's Page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorcerer's Apprentice strives to be useful, as well as entertaining. We are after all a gamer's magazine specializing in (but not limited to) Tunnels and Trolls. Of all the comments that have come in the mail over the last 9 months, the most consistant favorable response has been toward Professor Griswald Grimm and his Little Shop of Poisons and Potions. Encouraged, the author (me), and the Professor got together of producing a FRP Player's Aid which would allow the purchase of potions for magics of posions for (nefarious) reasons unknown... So we decided to give you, SA readers, first critical look, by publishing an issue solely dedicated to the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
