			<description>This game is filled with temptation cards, all attempting to make Pinocchio do wrong. But have no fear - Jiminy Cricket is on hand to guard him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card game consists of 35 playing cards - 11 Jiminy Cricket cards, 11 Temptation Cards and 13 Pinocchio cards.  The object of the game is to hold 4 Pinocchio cards together with 1 Jiminy Cricket card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five cards are dealt to each player and then players discard and draw cards until the winning condition is met.  Players then receive 30 points for the winning hand, 5 points for each Pinocchio card and negative 5 points for each Temptation card.  Jiminy Cricket cards do not score but cancel a Temptation card.  First player to 100 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
