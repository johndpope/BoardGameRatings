							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Attack</name>
									
			<description>Attack is a strategic game very likely related - and very similar too - to famous French game L'Attaque, nowadays known as Stratego. This Swedish version was designed by Count Sigvard Bernadotte (a now deceased uncle of H.M. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden), and he also did all the artworks. It was published by Swedish Alga during the World War II and the playing pieces is dressed in contemporary bluish grey or light brown uniforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has some differences compared to L'Attaque and Stratego (see its reimplementation Batalj for closer details) but the game play is similar. Place yor army the way you wish and the battle commence. Move your pieces and attack the enemy, highest rank wins the many individual skirmishes, with the usual exception of the Spy, who will beat the opposing General. The winner is the player that has managed to either wipe out the opposing force or make the opposer unable to move his/hers pieces further. There is no standard or flag in this game, but both sides has four mines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
