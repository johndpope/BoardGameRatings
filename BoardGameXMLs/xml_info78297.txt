			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Max Payne is a third-person shooter in which you play as the title charachter - undercover cop whose wife and baby daughter were murdered. Being framed for a crime begins your story of strolling through New York, seeking for truth and revenge. The story evolves with a litle help of comic-like cutscenes with spoken dialogues, and is really one of the best stories I've ever seen in a game with quite a few unexpected turnovers. It sucks you in and doesn't let you sleep until you finish the game.&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is also well made - it was the first game to present &amp;quot;bullet time&amp;quot;, which is fabulous and adds a lot to the game experience and yet you only have it in limited amounts, so you must use it very wisely. During the game, you get to own lots of different weapons, everything from a lead pipe and baseball bat to beretta, desert eagle, pump-action shotgun, colt commando, sniper rifle, grenades, molotov cocktails and many more. But although you own various weapons, you need to be careful while walking around since a shot in the head will get Max killed so try to sustain only minor damage and then search for some painkillers which will restore your health.&lt;br/&gt;The game lacks a multiplayer mode, but there are some new game modes unlocked when you complete the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
