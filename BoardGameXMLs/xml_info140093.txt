			<description>Strike Fighters: Gold is a multi-faceted flight-simulation game that features one of the most versatile combat aircraft of all time &amp;ndash; the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. The core of the game is traditional combat flight-simulation &amp;ndash; the player takes command of a thundering jet fighter and engages in aerial dogfight with enemy fighters while seeking and destroying ground targets. The game is set in the 1960s &amp;ndash; when aviation technology was still primitive, but advancing at a rapid pace. Some missiles and guided weapons are available later in the game, but true to history, they remain somewhat unreliable and inaccurate. Most air battles involve visceral, in-your-face gunfights, and the player&amp;rsquo;s skill at outmaneuvering his opponents remains the key to victory and survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Jet combat simulation game set in the 1960&amp;rsquo;s when aviation technology was still primitive but advancing at a rapid pace.&lt;br/&gt;     Fly 10 legendary fighters from the early jet age, each meticulously rendered to every detail. Choose from F-100D Super Sabre, 4 versions of A-4 Skyhawk (A-4B, A-4C, A-4E, and A-4F), and 5 versions of F-4 Phantom II (F-4B, F-4C, F-4D, F-4E, and F-4J).&lt;br/&gt;     3-D virtual cockpits with working gauges and dynamic lighting effects.&lt;br/&gt;     Engage in blood-draining, G-pulling, action-packed dogfights against 10 different types of enemy, including MiG-17 &amp;lsquo;Fresco&amp;rsquo;, MiG-19 &amp;lsquo;Farmer&amp;rsquo;, MiG-21 &amp;lsquo;Fishbed&amp;rsquo;, Su-7 &amp;lsquo;Fitter&amp;rsquo;, Il-28 &amp;lsquo;Beagle&amp;rsquo;, Tu-22 &amp;lsquo;Blinder&amp;rsquo;, and An-12 &amp;lsquo;Cub&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;     Random mission generator for maximum flexibility and replayability.&lt;br/&gt;     3 new campaigns featuring high-flying combat action over fictional Middle Eastern sands.

Download thousands of user-created skins, aircraft, terrain, missions, campaigns, and editors already available on the Internet for the original Strike Fighters: Project 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Archived Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike Fighters Gold is an updated version of Strike Fighters: Project 1. It includes more ground objects and three extra campaigns called Desert Thunder, Quick Sand, and Rattle Snake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The F-104G and C-130 Hercules were removed from this version due to a licensing dispute with Lockheed Martin although the F-104G was later available for free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Strike Fighters: Project 1&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
