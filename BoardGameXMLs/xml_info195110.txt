			<description>Each player has a set of four pawns that start in his or her side of the board. The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &amp;quot;Ziel&amp;quot; section. Movement is determined by a die. All players move clockwise around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns. Whenever a pawn arrives on a space as the result of a die-roll, it advances by the number of spaces shown on that space. If a pawn arrives on a red space, it advances into an inner ring. The pawns have to circle the innermost ring, till they manage to enter their &amp;quot;Ziel&amp;quot; section. Captured pawns are returned to their player's &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; section. The winner is the first player to move all pawns into the &amp;quot;Ziel&amp;quot; section.&lt;br/&gt;This game was published about 1930.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
