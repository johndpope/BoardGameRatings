			<description>This game attempts to simulate a boxing match. Like a real boxing match the winner of each round is based on the number of points scored in that round. The winner of the game is determined by who wins the most rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three spinners. The first spinner is used as a timer keeper to break each round into 6 parts (minutes:seconds) at 3:00, 2:30, 2, 1:30, 1 and 0:30.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second spinner is used as such and indicates what happens with the punch. The third spinner is used as such too, and indicates the referee's decision when one is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
