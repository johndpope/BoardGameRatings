							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Second Down</name>
									
			<description>Second Down is an American football game produced in the UK and targeted for younger players.  However, it features a nifty method of play-calling.  The offensive and defensive players each have a set of play cards.  The defense card has a grid of colors on it; the offense card has holes representing the play.  After plays are chosen, the offense card is placed over the defense card and the results is determined by the colors showing through the play holes.  For some results a die is rolled for further resolution.  Overall, a simple but clever system to showcase the play-calling aspect of the sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
