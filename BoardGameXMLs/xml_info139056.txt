							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Board Football</name>
									
			<description>Game found in The New Book of Games, circa 1950.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this game a large board must be drawn like the one in the image. The football is a counter, which at the beginning of the game is placed on square 14 for the kick-off. The two players, or sides &amp;mdash; &amp;ldquo;Rovers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;United&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; throw the dice alternately. Rovers add the value of their throw to the number of the square on which the ball lies, and move it on to the square indicated; thus, if the ball is on 17 and they throw a 4, the ball is moved to 21. United subtract the value of their throw from the number where the ball previously was: thus if it is on 8 and they throw 3, the ball goes to 5. A goal is scored when the ball enters square 1 or square 27.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a goal has been scored, the game is restarted, and the side which has lost the goal kicks off. If a throw leads to a number over 27 or less than 1, it is a goal lick, and the other side places the ball on the square in front of goal, and throws. If 1 is thrown while the ball is in a touch-line square, the ball is out of play and not moved, the other side taking a throw immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A time limit, say five or ten minutes, must be fixed for the game before starting. When elapsed, the side with the most goals, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
