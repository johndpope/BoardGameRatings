							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buried Treasure</name>
									
			<description>From a hand dealt from a standard deck of cards, each player &amp;quot;buries&amp;quot; three cards by placing them face-down on the table. Then players create and add cards to four tableaus, by suit. Face cards allow players to take, or, in some cases, to lock-up, cards from the tableaus. The pips in each tableau count towards the players' score, multiplied by the number of cards of that suit the player originally buried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buried Treasure was published in the book Card Games Around the World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
