			<description>Solar Struggle is a Arcade Action Spaceshooter. The whole game world is in 3D, but the action takes place on a 2D plane which makes the action and controls really easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take control of one of the nine space ships. Experience the thrilling story of a young pilot in 11 missions and assert yourself against tons of enemies in the skirmish mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;    High-definition graphics&lt;br/&gt;    Thrilling story in 11 missions&lt;br/&gt;    Challenging skirmish mode&lt;br/&gt;    9 different ships&lt;br/&gt;    36 unlockable awards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story:&lt;br/&gt;Till the year 2016, the budgets of all the government space programs have been reduced to a minimum. To forward the space exploration, a private group of companies started comprising the consortium. The consortium was able to demonstrate amazing success within a few decades. It quickly assumed a monopoly position in the development and production of space equipment. During this time mankind overcame the differences it had and united to a world government in 2087. The armed forces of the former governments joined to serve as police and security forces of the new world government. The first success of the new world government was the establishment of a permanent Mars colony in 2094. The consortium took actively part in. Today it&amp;rsquo;s the year 2169. Mankind has long since penetrated to the far-thest corners of the solar system. A gold rush has set up mining colonies whereever it has been possible to mine raw materials. The consortium has thus developed into the largest economic power in the solar system. It controls a large part of all mining operations and earns revenue from the sale of ships and technology to the colonies. But the general prosperity also attracts individuals who seek to enrich at the expense of the honest workers. The huge distances between the planets make it extremely difficult to the military to retain control. Therefore, unfortunately, again and again tragic events are happening&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
