							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Froggy Phonics</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The fun way to practice phonics skills!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an educational board game with a frog theme. It is actually two study tools in one package since the two-sided board can be used to play two different games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One game teaches beginning and ending consonants and the other game teaches beginning and ending blends. Both designs use a similar mechanic with players using a spinner to determine the required letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the colorful board, 16 frog tokens, the spinner, and rules. Froggy Phonics is designed for 2, 3, or 4 players and can be used for team play in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to correctly place four frogs on the letter-coded lily pads is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For grades K-2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
