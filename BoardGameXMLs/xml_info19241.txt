			<description>The game board (14&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot;) resembles a pool table (six pockets) and players place pawns on the game board &amp;quot;pockets&amp;quot;.  By rolling dice that match the pocket, players may draw from the &amp;quot;Ball&amp;quot; deck and keep the card unless a &amp;quot;Scratch&amp;quot; card is drawn.  If a &amp;quot;Scratch&amp;quot; is drawn, players must return a previously won &amp;quot;Ball.&amp;quot;  When all the &amp;quot;Balls&amp;quot; are drawn, the round is over and points are scored based on the total value of the &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot; cards won.  The winner is player with the highest total after five rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations included provide rules for 8-Ball, Rotation and 9-Ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
