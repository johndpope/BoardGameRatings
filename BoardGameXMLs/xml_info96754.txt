			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This setting is written as a somewhat tongue-in-cheek reworking of common fantasy elements, and would work well for a humorous game - but could also be used in a more serious way. It's a world where people are flawed, from the gods on down, and the darker side of human (etc) nature tends to shine through. So players can either join in with that or try to shine out as examples of virtue. Whether to play it lid-off (high-energy) or lid-on (gritty) is up to the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;The Nugget rules are available as a free download from the publisher's site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
