			<description>This is Game #21 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is loosely related to Reversi and Othello.  In this game players enter pieces onto the board, and sliding other pieces down.  Players remove a line of enemy pieces that are part of a custodial capture between two of a player's piece, one being slid and another one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game differs from Reversi and Othello in that players place all their pieces on the board, and instead of converting over when part of a custodial trap, the enemy pieces are removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
