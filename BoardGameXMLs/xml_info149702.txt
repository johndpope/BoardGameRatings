							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Door</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a Strange door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Hex, Square and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Puny humans have come to our den to be second meal of night! We eat well now!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The door is a single terrain map of a hilly, swamp terrain with a mysterious wooden door built into the largest hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The door is intended for use in fantasy settings. As a terrain map, it can also be used in wargaming fantasy scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The door can be used as the entrance to a burrow or den. Or it could lead to another world or dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a wargaming scenario, one idea is to use the door as a place for reinforcements to appear for the defending side. The attacking side needs to get to the door and close it to stop their reinforcements from coming in from another world, plane, or dimension. Each turn the door remains open, the defender gets a low cost unit for free that suffers no terrain difficulty with cliffs or swampland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troll&amp;rsquo;s Den: A rash of night kidnappings has plagued a town close to a marsh. The group is hired to investigate these abductions. They may find some tracks leading to the marsh during the day. Alternatively while on watch at night, they spot tall, shadowy figures that abduct some villagers and follow them to the swamp. The bog is filled with the bones and skeletal remains of the previous victims. Its up to the group to quickly stop the trolls in the bog from getting to the door that leads to their den. If they are too slow, they&amp;rsquo;ll need to break down the door to the troll&amp;rsquo;s den and fight them in their home to save the villagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
