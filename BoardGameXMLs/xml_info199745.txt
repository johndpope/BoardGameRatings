			<description>Four trains full of happy animals are chugging off on an adventure. The player who collects the most animal cards, by matching colors, wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play starts by removing the 4 Engine cards and then dealing out 4 Train cards face down to each player. The remaining cards form a draw pile. One at a time, players match a colored train card from their hand to the same colored engine or train card on the table. Then they replenish their hand to 4 cards. If a player gets a Moose Caboose card, they can match that to the same colored train card in play. After it is played, the player scoops up all the train cards from that engine. The game ends when there are no more cards left or when no one can make a play. Whoever has collected the most train cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
