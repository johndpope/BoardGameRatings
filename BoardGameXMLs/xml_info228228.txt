			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players with the theme of Technological Advancements of the next 1000 Years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common set of Victory Tokens (VT), Research Tokens (RT) and Energy Tokens (ET).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 small decks with each deck representing a century. Each card represents a new technology, event, discovery, or social change. When played, cards will cause players to gain VT, RT, ET, steal cards from other players, increase hand size etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 10 VT and is dealt 2 cards from the 21st Century Deck. (Disaster cards are discarded and redrawn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Resource Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Gain 1 Research Token and 1 Energy Token&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Discovery Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw 1 card from the current deck (the oldest deck that still has at least 1 card in it). If the deck runs out go on to the next deck.&lt;br/&gt;     Pay 5 RT to draw an extra card. &lt;br/&gt;     Whenever you draw a disaster card reveal and play it immediately. Resolve the disaster and continue drawing. When Disaster cards are played, they are removed from the game. &lt;br/&gt;     Every player starts with a pick ability of 1. For every increase in pick ability (as a result of card play), you may, when drawing a card, draw an extra card, pick 1 of your choice and place the others back on the top of the deck. (Disasters don't count against your pick limit). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Implementation Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play 1 card from your hand to the table. &lt;br/&gt;     Pay 5 ET to play an extra card. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Progress Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Max hand size is 4 cards. Discard excess cards. (If a card is discarded it goes to the bottom of its deck). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the Apotheosis of Technology card (in the 30th century deck) is revealed.  The player with the most Victory Tokens at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
