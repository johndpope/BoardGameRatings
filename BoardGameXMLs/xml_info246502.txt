			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thousand years ago, the world died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, out of the ashes of the great nuclear-biological Devastation comes a new world. A world where intelligent apes hunt humans for sport. Where subterranean mutant cyborgs serve great disembodied brains and plot world domination. Where apocalyptic cults try to finish what the bombs started. Where frightful artificial intelligences command armies of robot servants, and entire nations of clones lead peaceful and productive lives, unless you&amp;rsquo;re not of the right clone-lineage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where mankind and his newfound fellow intelligent species try to pick up the pieces and rebuild civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is also a world where a force for good, knowledge, and science works to help restore that which was lost, to guide this new world onto a path of justice and learning. That force is called Project Oasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Oasis is a post-apocalyptic role-playing setting for use with Mutant Future&amp;trade;, Apes Victorious&amp;trade;, and other science fantasy RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains a complete overview of 30th century North America, including new creatures and equipment for both the Mutant Future&amp;trade; and Apes Victorious&amp;trade; games, more than a hundred adventure hooks, plus a giant poster map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
