			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t read a Comic Book? Most of America&amp;rsquo;s children have read at least one Comic Book in their lifetime. Most Comics have Super Heroes / Heroines to do the adventures in the book. With the increasing human connection of these characters to normal life is becoming uncanny. Primarily Image Comics and Top Cow Comics are making characters that many people can relate to. Many of the DC and Marvel Heroes / Heroines have no real &amp;quot;home life&amp;quot;. The books are primarily just watching them fight the monthly bad guy. Where as Top Cow and Image have&lt;br/&gt;Heroes / Heroines that have a &amp;quot;real life&amp;quot;. The writers give them hobbies, favorite bands, normal life problems, a very human quality to them. So I am wanting to capture some of that quality in this game. I mean, there is nothing wrong with the Bad Guy of the month idea. It should actually be used to make the game a bit more interesting. But each character should have some human qualities to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
