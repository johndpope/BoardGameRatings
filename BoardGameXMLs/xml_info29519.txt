			<description>This is a quiz game based on a German TV show where (if successful) a competitor could win up to a million Deutsch Mark (the currency before Euro).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spinner decides who is Captain of the team. Then every player  spins to see on which &amp;quot;Action field&amp;quot; to put his pawn to.&lt;br/&gt;Those fields may be questions but also the beginning of a Terminator round. With the latter one players can exchange their Captain. Furthermore there are actions like &amp;quot;spin again&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;go directly to next round&amp;quot; (with higher cash reward).&lt;br/&gt;The money is usually distributed to equal parts amongst the players, only the Captain is getting more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difficulty of the trivia questions rises every round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
