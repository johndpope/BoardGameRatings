			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drunk one night in his study, master wizard Archibald, much like Cher in the way he has only one name thanks to his notoriety, mused about his compatriots, those who slice and stab with their sharp bits of metal and wallow in tier envy whenever they gaze upon himself being totally awesome and stuff. The next morning, he woke up with a terrible hangover, Constitution having never been a strong point. To his surprise, his body was covered in sheaves of paper musing about how he could help his allies stay alive by harnessing one of the few things they actually do do correctly: hit things with sharp bits of metal. In typical Archibald form, his musings were backed up by highly technical documents detailing exactly how to make those musings a reality. With a shrug, Archibald collected his drunken ravings. This bears some investigation, he thought, right after I prepare and cast that hangover spell...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical hits really are what a good number of martial characters live and die by, but, all too often, the critical hit is made the realm of the min-maxing Strength-based melee, whilst more Dexterity-based characters simply don't get enough bang for their buck to even care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement, the first in the Annals of the Drunken Wizard series, introduces forty-five new weapon special abilities that tear down critical hits, traditionally an enterprise of the two-handed fighter, and rebuilds the system with options that make critical hits an event for characters of all sorts, allowing players to sacrifice their spike damage for improved survivability, the ability to throw around status effects, the ability to regain low level spell slots, or perhaps the ability to simply do something ridiculously silly instead because the character is a flavor build!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     45 new weapon special abilities&lt;br/&gt;     All spells and feats linked to the online Pathfinder System Reference Document&lt;br/&gt;     13 random tables that integrate into (and link to) tables found in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Player's Handbook for easy use of this ruleset&lt;br/&gt;     Intralinking so you're always one click away from the page you want&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
