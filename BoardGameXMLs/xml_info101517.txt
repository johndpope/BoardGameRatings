			<description>Everyone knows the classic memory game for children, in which two cards at a time are turned over until all of the matching pairs are discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With &amp;ldquo;Wonder Memory&amp;rdquo;, this idea has now been expanded in the form of an app for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. &amp;ldquo;Wonder Memory&amp;rdquo; is the classic matching picture game adapted for the Apple platform &amp;ndash; including charming pictures illustrated by hand and accompanied by the soft sounds of the piano. The app can be played by single or multiple players. Besides the &amp;ldquo;Classic&amp;rdquo; version of the game, the &amp;ldquo;Living Pictures&amp;rdquo; game mode is particularly enchanting for young players. When a matching pair is successfully uncovered, the pictures spring to life with delightful animations. And with the &amp;ldquo;Sound Mode,&amp;rdquo; players can search for matching pairs based only on sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wonder Memory is the latest app released by the Berlin-based developer wonderkind, whose &amp;ldquo;Toddler&amp;rsquo;s Seek &amp;amp; Find&amp;rdquo; has already held the top position among children&amp;rsquo;s apps in 25 countries world-wide. With Wonder Memory, wonderkind is raising the bar with another educational app featuring hand-drawn illustrations and intuitive navigation perfect for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Three game modes: Classic, Living Pictures and Sound mode&lt;br/&gt;     Beautifully hand-drawn graphics with charming pictures&lt;br/&gt;     Soft piano music&lt;br/&gt;     Single- and multiple-player modes&lt;br/&gt;     For the little ones: pictures spring to life when a matching pair is found&lt;br/&gt;     Lovingly designed animations with cute sounds&lt;br/&gt;     Six different difficulty levels based on the number of cards used&lt;br/&gt;     Available HD version for iPad/iPad2&lt;br/&gt;     Child-friendly navigation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
