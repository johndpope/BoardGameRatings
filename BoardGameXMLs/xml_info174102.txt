							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ladybug Lunch: Ant Antics</name>
									
			<description>It's springtime in the garden. The sun is shining, the birds are singing and flowers are blooming. All appears well, apart from those pesky aphids. However, all is not quite as it seems. Other dangers lurk just around the corner - or should that be underground? The warmer weather is bringing ants, from their colony and into your garden, bearing gifts... aphid eggs; eggs that they have been keeping safe during the cold spells of winter. Now the time is right for the eggs to be brought to the perfect location, ready for hatching. Unfortunately, that perfect place just happens to be your beautiful flower!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual, the first player who clears his Garden of parasites is the winner, but this time the parasites are harder to eradicate... and there&amp;rsquo;s always a surprise or two in store!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
