			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes you choose what god to worship.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, the god chooses you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For reasons unknown to mortals, some few people do not ask, and yet attract the attention of the divine. They are granted abilities the likes of which even the most faithful of priests cannot match. Labeled as witches, or diabolists, or even occasionally as prophets, they are often outcast by normal society and religions. For, after all, what could be more dangerous than someone blessed of the gods, yet not conforming to the established order or faith?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In extreme cases, Powers have been known to invest in the most unlikely of people. A Paladin might awaken to discover abilities granted by the gods of Rot, or an Assassin to find the healing touch gifted by the lords of Order. Though the purpose of this gifting is beyond the ken of the receiver, the Powers always move to a greater, unfathomed purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These gifted, or cursed, are The Mystics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
