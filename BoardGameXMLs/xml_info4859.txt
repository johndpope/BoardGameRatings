			<description>The game starts by dealing out the entire deck of alphabet cards to the players, who place them face-up in front of themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After seeding the tray with a 4 or 5 letter word, a free-for-all ensues, where each player may play 1 or 2 of their letters to change the current word to another valid word (LIVE to LIKE, for example). Players who cannot create new words may steal letters from in front of other players, replacing them with any of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to get rid of all their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational (and the &amp;quot;Keep Quiet&amp;quot;) part of the game comes from the optional use of sign language alphabet symbols to replace the letter cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
