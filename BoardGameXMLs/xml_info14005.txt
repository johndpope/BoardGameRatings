							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manage Your Own Team BASEBALL!</name>
									
			<description>A very simplistic approach to portraying &amp;quot;Baseball&amp;quot; in which kids(or very patient adults) could even play out an entire &amp;quot;Season&amp;quot;, if they should desire to. There are NO 'dice' involved and any 'Actions' are dictated by the draw of a CARD.&lt;br/&gt;You 'line up' your 'Players'(of which they are cardboard counters with their &amp;quot;Position&amp;quot; printed upon these) and proceed through YOUR &amp;quot;Batting Order&amp;quot; with the aid of the CARDS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CARDS have 'Results' printed upon them for EACH of the various 'Player Positions'. Whichever 'Player' is UP, is cross-referenced to the CARD that is drawn, and that 'Result' is what THAT 'Player' obtained. You can CALL your &amp;quot;Team&amp;quot; whatever you like, and you'll need a 'Scorepad'(piece of paper &amp;amp; pencil/pen) as none was provided. There are even some 'Runners' counters to mark which 'Base' they happen to occupy during the course of an inning. The &amp;quot;Playing Field&amp;quot; consists of a colorful cardboard 'insert' of a &amp;quot;Baseball Diamond&amp;quot; within the Gamebox and should remain there during play. It has '2' &amp;quot;Player Lineups&amp;quot; columns(one for each of the 'Home' &amp;amp; 'Visitor' Teams) that denote just which &amp;quot;Player&amp;quot; is 'Batting' in what order, and if THAT 'Player' is up to Bat(to be able to check the proper LINE on the CARD drawn). The Games could even progress quicker than indicated, with the &amp;quot;quick-draw&amp;quot; CARD play, if someone truly wanted to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
