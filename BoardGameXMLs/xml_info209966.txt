			<description>This is really a baseball card game, but uses a cardboard box insert, folded into a six-sided ballfield with images of cheering crowds in the stands, as justification for the 3D sales hook. Even the player pieces are flat cardboard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card game itself is basic: shuffle the deck and turn over the cards one at a time. Each card reveals the results of an at-bat: a hit, a walk, or an out. Players take turns revealing cards, moving runners on the board and scoring accordingly, until their third out; then the other player has his turn. As usual, the player with the most runs after nine innings wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the cards are very plain and printed on thin yellow stock, they provide unusually detailed color commentary: &amp;ldquo;Third Baseman Makes a Diving One-Handed Catch of Line Drive for an Out&amp;rdquo;; or &amp;ldquo;Ground Ball to Shortstop: He Throws High and Pulls First Baseman&amp;rsquo;s Foot Off of Bag. Batter is Safe.&amp;rdquo; There are supplementary instructions on each card for what happens to any runners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
