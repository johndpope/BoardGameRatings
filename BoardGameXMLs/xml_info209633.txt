			<description>Despite being issued by the Electric Game Co., this game is made strictly of cardboard and wood and uses no power, probably because it was published in 1945 when wartime restrictions still reserved metal and batteries for military use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a wooden frame with the cardboard playing surface mounted at the bottom except for the 3&amp;quot; nearest the players, where it tilts up to the top, forming a ramp. There is a football field across the far end, with peg holes each 10 yards into which is mounted a cardboard &amp;quot;football&amp;quot; wheel marked 0 to 10. This is placed and spun to show the current line of scrimmage (a 4 resting on the 20 yard line = 24).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five holes spaced around the board, each surrounded by results for 11 different plays. There also are small circles, each labelled with one of those plays (pass, punt, trick, end, lateral, field goal, etc.) and a yardage result. The offensive player calls the play and a wooden football player is placed on the corresponding circle on the field. The offensive player then spins a wooden top down the ramp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the top goes into a hole, the results are read from that hole. If the top hits the man, the result is the yardage in that circle. If it hits the man and goes into a hole, the hole result modifies the circle result. If it misses, it means no gain, missed pass or field goal, and a poor kickoff or punt. Play and scoring proceed according to normal football rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
