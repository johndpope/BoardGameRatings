							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation: Killer Comet</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never before has the G.I. Joe Team faced such an awesome force as in OPERATION: KILLER COMET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is it, Cat? What is it that's fishy about G.I. Joe Team leader Hawk?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only you would know. As the newest member of the Team, you have uncanny instincts and agility - that's why your codename is Cat. For you, this adventure begins on the set of the latest G.I. Joe movie. COBRA has hatched a plot to rule the world...by threatening to create a collision course with a comet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lifeline, Dial-Tone, Alpine, Gung-Ho, Duke, Roadblock, Bazooka, Dusty, and Lift-Ticket - you've got great personnel behind you. But it's up to your instincts to catwalk your team through a web of COBRA Ferrets, mirage-filled deserts, and the savage assassin Storm Shadow. Your goal is the heart of the COBRA command center and the dreaded Terror Drome...from which no ally has returned. Be careful, or you'll run out of lives as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
