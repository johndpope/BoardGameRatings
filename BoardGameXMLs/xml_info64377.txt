			<description>Each round is begun by the current player drawing and reading a topic card. All other players write down a true fact about themselves which relates to the topic. Players are free to write fairly mundane, generic facts (&amp;quot;I like food&amp;quot;), but that's not the point of the game. Instead, players are encouraged to dredge up more interesting factoids about themselves. When everyone's done, these facts get tossed together and read aloud. The player who drew the topic card tries to match each fact to the correct person. Before the facts are read, players can wager on whether or not they think the guesser will match them up correctly. On a correct match, the guesser rakes the wager over to his side. On a wrong match, the guesser has to fork over a like sum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
