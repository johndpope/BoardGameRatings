			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;In a nondescript dwelling, down a dusty hallway, past rooms of unclear purpose, there is a door... a door that looks like many others, except for the ancient maroon tint of the aged wood, and, of course, the glowing runes emblazoned on the stones that make up the door-frame. Should you know its purpose, should you know the correct sequence to touch those runes, you might gain entry to a Storeroom of wonders, shelves and bins and racks beyond counting. Place your torch in the rusty sconce, and enter...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Purple Storeroom is a series of tightly-focused supplements that cover topics that do not fit into our larger offerings. They are the pieces that just don&amp;rsquo;t fit anywhere else or they are the little things we work on to take a break from bigger projects like Purple Mountain, Legendary Treasures, or Lands of Porphyra. They have been stored here for safe keeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gels introduces a trio of engineered lifeforms. A tripled of oozes that have been alchemically altered to serve other purposes. The new lifeforms are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Aerogel&lt;br/&gt;     Embalming Gel&lt;br/&gt;     Taxidermy Gel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
