			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartooner is a game about creating your own animated cartoon. You and your friends will collectively become a Cartoonist tasked with making a funny cartoon show come alive &amp;ndash; you know, one of those with little birds thinking they saw a &amp;ldquo;puddy tat&amp;rdquo; and rabbits dressing in drag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not included: 4-6 players, a carrot and 40 minutes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's start with the beautiful artwork, because we are talking about Cartoons! The artwork is approached with the Ecoline technique for the background and characters are digitally rendered! It is our modern interpretation of the unmistakable style of animation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We took equal care also in the manual and the text, making Cartooner suitable for all fans of the genre Looney Tunes and Hanna-Barbara cartoons are popular for. But the rules are flexible enough to stage your own cartoon stories born from the fruits of your very own imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this ambitious project, we have focused heavily on simplicity, allowing the player to focus more on creating an environment of play suitable for the style of Cartoons! The result is a streamlined manual, full of funny quotes, and the only things that are missing to play are: 4 to 6 players, 2 six-sided dice, a carrot and 40 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
