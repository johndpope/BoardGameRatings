			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Demna Is Coming.  Demna Is Coming to You.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of the Earth of 2018, there are many people awakening to discover that they have tremendous powers of the mind.  These people can suddenly read minds, manipulate mass without physical contact, even control the actions of others or cause spontaneous fires.  This awakening can be a terrifying thing, both for those who discover they have a new ability and for those around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only is this awakening a frightening event, it automatically makes the new Psionicist a target; evil Corporations, Government agencies, even supervillains and aliens will be hunting them down and trying to take them for experimentation or reprogramming.  They may find themselves forced to act as soldiers, spies, and/or assassins, or worse, be ground up into genetic material to make OTHER people into nigh-mindless slaves with near-limitless power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately for these people, there is Project Demna; a world-wide organization that locates new Psionicists, trains them, and gives them a chance to live the life they choose for themselves.  Many of them become operatives of Project Demna to repay the moral debt.  Project Demna breaks up illegal Psionic recruitment and experimentation, assists law enforcement when incredible powers of the mind turn to criminal activity, and lobbies governments for laws and regulations to protect those who have Psionic ability.  It all seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who dig too deep into Project Demna, though, discover criminal financial practices and teams of assassins.  Worse still, there's a vast, world-ending threat heading for the Earth, and Project Demna may be the only thing that has a chance to stop it, or even to just slow it down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are the protectors of those who awaken to power.  They are the eyes and ears of the Destiny Council.  They are the shadowy figures at the back of the halls of power and the perpetrators of some of the largest financial crimes in history.  They are mankind's last hope against a ravenous space monster.  They are Project Demna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
