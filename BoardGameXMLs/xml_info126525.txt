			<description>On the eve of a competition between all the world's dim sum chefs, the chefs themselves have gone missing! When you wake up &amp;ndash; you being one of those top dim sum chefs &amp;ndash; you find yourself trapped in a cage with the other chefs. A giant in front of you says, &amp;quot;Feed me!&amp;quot; This is your chance to get out. You need to make dim sum to fight for your survival&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Giants and Dim Sum Chefs, you use cards to make dim sum, with each player having a card placed in front of them each round &amp;ndash; but repeats are not allowed, so you'll need to use strategy to interfere with opponents. Use all the cards in your hand, and you win your freedom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
