							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ronda Magica</name>
									
			<description>Ronda Magica takes you into a wonderful world of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magicians move on the field of play as if dancing. Each time a player succeeds in setting six magicians in a circle such as is illustrated on one of his or her cards that player places this card on the table. The winner is the first player who is able to lay down 5 cards. The use of magic counters greatly increases the excitement. An unfailing concentration and well though out tactics are needed in order to be the first home. (from the back of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leather like playing board and high quality components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
