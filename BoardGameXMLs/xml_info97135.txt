			<description>The dead have risen to consume the Earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been one month since the dead rose to consume the living. Barely surviving the betrayal at Dalesbury, you&amp;rsquo;ve been forced onto the road. Supplies have dwindled and resources have proven scarce, as most towns have already been looted and the Living Dead control the major population centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you discover a survivor community with running water and electricity, is their open welcome a true reprieve from the constant fight for survival, or an ulterior motive for something darker? And what of the rumors of a major survivor camp called Sanctuary? Is it truly a haven from the Living Dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You quickly learn that not everything is as it seems, and the true test of survival is not battling the Living Dead, but unraveling the plots around you before it is too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War of the Dead is an ongoing campaign for the award winning Savage Worlds role-playing game that takes you from the first days of the outbreak, and all the way into a world war torn and forever changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in War of the Dead: Chapter Two are rules for less-than-lethal weapons, new NPCs, and the second 13 adventures of the 52-adventure campaign. War of the Dead also takes full advantage of the Savage Worlds system, and includes pulse pounding chase scenes and mass battles against the Living Dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to count your ammunition, find shelter, and keep your allies close. The Living Dead are closing in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Publishers website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
