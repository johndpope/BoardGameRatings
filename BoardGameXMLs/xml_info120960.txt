			<description>Designer Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I need 20 ccs of everything. Stat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not so much the case load, the overdoses, and the severe lack of disrespect that walks into this hospital everyday that makes me want to take a bottle of pills to each and every inbred patient here at Mercy General. And it's not so much that health care is a joke, a whole lot of guess work, and the antibiotics du jour that drive most of us to binge drinking, sleeping around, and moonlighting. It's not the free clinic days, the group sessions, and the unending paperwork that convinced me that being a doctor isn't really want I want anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s not even the way this place is organized with the mirco-managed precision of a Chinese-Italian fire brigade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What it really comes down to is this: with $250,000 in student loans, what else am I going to do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
