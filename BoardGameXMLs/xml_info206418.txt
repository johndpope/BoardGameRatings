							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Mists:  Swords Against Sorcery</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery gaming has never been so fast and visceral! In Red Mists, you play an adventurer in the mold of Conan, the Gray Mouser, Moonglum, and Fafhrd. Your hero ventures forth to do battle with evil sorcerers, bestial man-apes, and winged horrors, all the while plundering long-forgotten vaults and rescuing captive lads and lasses. Red Mists focuses on the steel-wielding heroes of the genre, portraying wizards and sorcerers as foes to be feared and hated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are defined as much by their predilections for slaughter, debauchery, and self-preservation as they are by their thews, reflexes, and instinct. Mechanics are simple, evocative, and fast in play. Creating a character takes a matter of minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
