			<description>It was the latest family board game for the 1988 Olympics. Each player represents the team manager of one country's athletes (UK, Spain, China, Australia, USA, Soviet Union, USA, Japan and Germany: West). You control the resources of the team including finances, experts and dice rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a series of 48 dice throws (different colored dice are used to represent different events that may happen simultaneously). For example, the first throw moves athletes in the marathon and decathlon and throwing the javelin. Some of the events require skill (through using expert cards) and some are merely dice throwing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counters are moved around a large board representing a 400m track with all the field events too. The marathon takes place around the edge of the board but ends in the athletics arena. There are luck cards and money to be won too. All helps to build a solid team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the team manager with the most gold medals from the 16 events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
