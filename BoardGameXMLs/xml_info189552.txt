			<description>Stuck on a dying world, a handful of people take their only chance at survival, a junked space ship.  All they need to do is keep it together and working to reach their new home.  How hard can that be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Deathtrap is a cooperative game that can be played solo or up to 5 players. Players will control the movements and actions of one or more of the 5 crew members, each having their own unique expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the ship starting damaged, the crew is already behind. Each turn consists of 4 phases:  Crew phase, disasters spread phase, new disaster phase, and advancement phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crew Phase:  Each crew member uses their allotted actions to move, activate ships systems, or fight disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disaster Phase: Any unstopped disasters will spread causing more problems for the crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Disaster Phase:  Each turn a new disaster will be determined (where and what type) randomly by a die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancement Phase: Advance your energy level and distance to destination meter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
