			<description>Smog is an educational game illustrating the complex problem of air pollution.  Each player attempts to manage his city better than the other players by growing his city (with families and industry), keeping his city out of debt, and improving (or not worsening) the air quality of his city.  Players' cities are all adjacent, so the industries of one city may affect the air quality of an adjacent city as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
