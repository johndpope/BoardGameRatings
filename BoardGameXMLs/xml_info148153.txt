							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mine Shaft</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mine Shaft is a full-color, 48 x 30 inch, floor plan of a Mine Shaft, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a disaster! An explosion in the lower levels has several of our miners trapped down there. The hoist is damaged too, so we can&amp;rsquo;t recall the main elevator to get down there that way. Hurry up and help before they run out of air!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is an exterior of a Mine Shaft. The entrance to the area is a mountain pass to the west or the main railway that runs through the center of the map. Mountains surround the rest of the area. The main railway leads to the headframe, the main external housing of the center mine shaft. The hoist is located to the east of the headframe and provides the motor that moves the mine elevator up and down. This product can be used as an expansion to our Mine Processing Plant map&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product can be used in any time period after the Industrial Revolution. The techniques used suggest 1900s or later, but it would certainly be possible for this facility to exist in a steampunk or higher tech late 1800s era setting. This map can be used in modern settings or in lower technology worlds in near or far future Sci-Fi settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An explosion in the lower levels causes miners to become trapped below. They are running out of air and time. The hoist isn&amp;rsquo;t working, making recalling the main elevator difficult. The group needs to rescue them. They can try and fix the hoist to bring up the main elevator. This may or may not work, depending on if the main elevator itself was damaged and how extensively. If this fails, they need to procure climbing gear and do things the hard way. They&amp;rsquo;ll need to bring shovels and picks to try and clear debris from the collapsed tunnels and free the miners as well as repair equipment to get the main elevator back online. But what caused the explosion? Can the group save the trapped miners in time before they run out of air?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
