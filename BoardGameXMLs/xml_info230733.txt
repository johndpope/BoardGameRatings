			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;ジレンマホールデム～投資家達のジレンマ～ (Jirenma Ho-rudemu ~Toushika Tachi no Jirenma~) is DILEMMA HOLDEM ~The dilemma of investors~, a variation on the Poker game Texas Hold'em. The game has a deck of 40 cards ranked Ace to 10, in four suites; Fuel, Bio-chemistry, Securities, Grain. Every card also has a Bonus or Penalty. Some cards have a special ability, activated when in a player's hand or when showing as a table card. Otherwise, text on cards is for flavour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game also has a secondary pot, the Bank. The winner of a round gains a bonus from the bank, the losers (players who didn't fold, still active in the round) pay penalties to the Bank. The bonus and penalties depend on table cards. Therefore, in this game, players are allowed to fold whilst others check, since a player may want to get out of the round when they see the penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bank also serves as the game timer. There are three Banks made at the start of the game. Each time a Bank is depleted, the next Bank starts but the minimum bet is raised. When the third Bank is exhausted, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The text on the cards is fairly simple (for example: 'you don't have to pay the penalty as the loser' or 'the bonus values for Grains is doubled this round&amp;quot;. So whilst a player might use a crib-sheet, this would give away their Poker hand. Using paste-ups on the cards would be better for foreign players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Themed on investors. Game mechanics based on Texas Hold-em poker. One major feature is, in addition to players' bet, you may gain bonus chips or pay penalties depending on your hands and/or community cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;『投資』がテーマのゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;テキサスホールデムのルールがベースになっています。&lt;br/&gt;プレイヤー同士が賭け合うチップの他に場札次第でボーナスやペナルティが発生するのが特徴です。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
