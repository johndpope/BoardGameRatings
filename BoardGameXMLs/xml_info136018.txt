							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Europa: Lernspiel für Jung und Alt</name>
									
			<description>A small trivia game containing 98 questions about Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card contains a question on the front and an answer on the backside (which is not the answer to the question on the other side of that card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and evenly distributed to all players. One player asks a question from one of his cards; now all other players try to find the right answer on the backside of their cards. If a player has the card with the right answer he gets one point and is the next player to ask a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most points. The game also contains rules for solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
