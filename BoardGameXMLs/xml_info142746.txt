			<description>Picture an ancient legend....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long ago a group of greedy villagers attempted to steal powerful magic and treasures from a long abandon temple. For their crimes, the unnamed God of the temple cursed them to transform, one by one, night after night, into a hideous beast that hunted the other Villagers and devour them. The curse was only ended when a single Villager remained to tell the cautionary tale. (Ancient legends don't have happy endings!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cursed is a quick, casual game for 3 to 8 player, ages 5 and up. The game focuses on heavily on Bluffing and features a unique cooperative/competitive gameplay style, in which players take turns becoming the &amp;quot;Monster&amp;quot;, well the other players battle against the Monster as a group in an attempt to fend it off for the night. The next night, the next player in line becomes the Monster and the battle begins again. The game ends when the Monster eats the last 2 Villagers and the Curse is broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game revolves around dice rolls and a small amount of card playing. Each &amp;quot;Villager&amp;quot; rolls a single die in the open, for all to see, well the &amp;quot;Monster&amp;quot; rolls an equal number of dice privately. The Monster knows if they can beat the Villagers at a glance, but must decide if he/she want to Bluff the Villagers into fleeing, tempt Villagers into a hopeless and costly battle, or simply flee if the Villagers are clearly too strong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add into this mix Ward Cards, magic powers that aid or hinder either side, or even disrupt the battle completely in some strange way, and which can be played be either side to keep the game endlessly unpredictable. These cards are costly though, and beyond the 3 you get at the start of the game, must be paid for WITH YOUR LIFE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
