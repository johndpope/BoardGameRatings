			<description>Spongebob Squarepants makes his inevitable, though short-lived, entry into the world of collectible card games.  Deep Sea Duel is the name of the entry-level starter deck for the game and at least one expansion was released to expand the game.  In the game, players attempt to talk customers in different locations into trying a nice Krusty Krab Krabby Patty.  You win the game either by &amp;quot;katching&amp;quot; 4 customers each from different locations, 4 customers from the same location, or a mixture of both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins by drawing a hand of 5 cards, taking a card from the separate Location deck, and placing it in one of 4 slots in the middle.  The &amp;quot;potential katcher&amp;quot; (active player) may then play a &amp;quot;Katcher&amp;quot; from their hand under a location to attempt to katch it.  (They may play up to 2 Katchers under two separate locations, but both are played at the same time.)  The opposing player can attempt to stop the katch by playing a strategy card from their hand, or playing a Katcher of their own from their hand.  Players go back and forth in this &amp;quot;Showdown&amp;quot; until one does not want to, or cannot, respond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last Katcher played by each player is compared, and the one with the highest &amp;quot;Patty Pouch&amp;quot; wins.  If the potential katcher won, they take the Location card.  If the opposing player wins, they have stopped the katch and the Location card remains on the board.  Once a turn is over, both players may discard up to 2 cards if they wish, and then both draw until they have 5 cards in hand each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
