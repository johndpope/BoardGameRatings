			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From out of the dark and forbidding heavens a great meteor, black as night itself, carved through Abaddon&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, calved into massive sections and rained down upon the world in great shards. It obliterated cities, shattered the living rock, sent tidal waves swamping over islands and drowning the coasts, ignited volcanoes and set the ground quaking for more than a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 85% of the sentient population of Abaddon was killed in moments and no sorcery, no prayer, no force of arms nor cunning with the builder&amp;rsquo;s craft could stand against the destruction. Those who survived found themselves in the ruins of civilization, surrounded by the corpses of their nations, overwhelmed by death and living beneath a soot-black sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their suffering did not end there. The meteor was a black, hellish thing, infused with vast amounts of necrotic energy. The survivors watched in horror as the power of the meteors fragments and its dust began to raise the dead and few of the remaining cities survived the onslaught of their own deceased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deaths, the trauma, the spiritual and necromantic energy, all released together, changed something fundamental on Abaddon. A rarity and a curiosity before the cataclysm psionic abilities began to manifest amongst the survivors and those few children born of these years, a reaction to the failings of magic and prayer and a sea-change of the mind, one that allowed some to survive this apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
