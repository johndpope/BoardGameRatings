			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After many unfortunate events, Robot has finally realized that Kitty just won't get along with anyone.  So, he launches him into space and decides to take a trip to the Ice Cream Planet for some tasty treats.  When he arrives, however, things are not at all well...  Can Robot explore the planet and discover what has happened to all the ice cream?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the finale to the Robot Wants series, Hamumu has yet again changed the world and upgrades to make the game that has the most action of the series.  The goal once again is to explore a Metroidvania style planet and defeat bosses and aliens to discover what happened to all the ice cream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
