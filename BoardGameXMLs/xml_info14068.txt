			<description>From the publisher/designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CYBERWRAITH offers the excitement of doing battle with Big Brother himself as the 2 &amp;ndash; 4 players vie with each other to be the first to delete every government file maintained on them, (and thus eliminate the associated taxes, of course).  Players work the market in computer hardware and software striving to acquire the fastest, hottest machine with which to hack into the government&amp;rsquo;s systems; deal with lawless company behavior; and cope with ever-changing Federal alert conditions.  Every file deleted reduces a player&amp;rsquo;s tax burden, putting more money into their hands each turn with which to upgrade their equipment and carry on the battle even more effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
