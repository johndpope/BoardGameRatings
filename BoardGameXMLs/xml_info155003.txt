			<description>Each player gets a train consisting of an engine and 3 cars. The players start at the station of their color and have to visit all other stations, where they leave a car on a sidetrack. Then they have to get the engine back to their home Station to win the game. When the player rolls a 1 or 4, he may adjust one of the two railroad switches. This is important because other trains can only be overtaken on parallel tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in the 1930s or 1940s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
