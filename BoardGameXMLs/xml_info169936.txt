			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overruled is a 2D multiplayer brawler like no other where the players change the rules as they play, directly influencing the dynamics and direction of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge up to three friends with both local and online multiplayer to a battle &amp;ndash; the person with the most points at the end will win the game! But the rules are yours to play with and with over 20 change &amp;lsquo;em up cards, you&amp;rsquo;ll never know how the battle will go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t incite the enemy as they are the master of your fate! You could be playing Deathmatch now, but one of your rivals might decide to change it to Swag Bag. Or King of the Hill. Or Capture the Flag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone dead? Double the respawn timer. Not doing so well by yourself? Turn on teams. Got the swag bag? Double the points you earn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ever-growing diverse cast of characters will keep you company as you and your friends battle for victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
