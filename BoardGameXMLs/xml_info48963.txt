			<description>From the front cover:  Murder most foul! A small ruby, a leather button, and a lute string are your only leads. Can you follow them to the heart of the Assassin's Knot?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If you want someone murdered, go to Garrotten.&amp;quot; It is a common saying in Restenford. The small, peaceful town of Garrotten is rumored to be the headquarters of the deadly band of assassins. Perhaps there is nothing to this talk. Perhaps it is true. There has never been any reason to find out. Until now...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The baron of Restenford is dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The firsts day following his death. Restenford was a hornet's nest of activity. No one was allowed to enter or leave. The castle itself was sealed to outsiders as soon as the murder was discovered. Wild rumors hinted that the body was left in a condition that made magical restoration impossible. That evening came an urgent summons from the reclusive sorcerer, Pelltar, whose council continued late into the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By mid morning of the next day, you were well on your way to Garrotten. Three slender clues are all that remain - three possible chances to unravel the tangled web of intrigue that doomed the Barron of Restenford. The sun is warm, and the land around you is full of life. By nightfall, you will arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
