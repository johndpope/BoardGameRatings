			<description>Become the best castle builder in this original and addictive game where you must at the same time create a castle accurately while protecting it from all the annoying baddies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Unique concept, engaging and addictive game-play &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 18 levels in normal mode, 15 for the King Mode (Extra Hard), and 4 rounds of &amp;quot;Protect the Castle&amp;quot; mode (Survival)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Upgrade your castle-building equipment and collect items to get rid of the villains &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 30 trophies to unlock (achievements) &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 20 atlas pages to unlock (character descriptions and tips) &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Funny characters and events with cartoonish graphics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story and Concept&lt;br/&gt;Monarchs come to you with a specific castle request, and your job is to build their dream palace piece by piece before the deadline without making mistakes. In the meantime, enemies come in and try to break your castle. They will try to burn it, explode it or even steal the pieces but you must get rid of them with the right items to reclaim control! &lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Protect the Castle&amp;quot; mode, you must keep the pre-made castles intact as much as possible by dealing with swarms of enemies attempting to take over... thankfully you have unlimited items in this frantic mode since the enemies are unlimited, too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
