			<description>This game is similar to a jigsaw puzzle in that you have to take colored pieces and fit them together to make a whole. Instead of the pieces being differently shaped, however, the pieces are differently colored. Each side is colored differently, and to solve the puzzle you must put the pieces together so that each edge touches another edge of the same color. For example, if the top edge of a piece is red, the piece that goes above it must have a red bottom edge. There is no restriction on what colors are on the outside of the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start, all the pieces are mixed up in the &amp;quot;workspace&amp;quot; to the left. The solution goes on the right grid. The puzzle is solved when all the pieces are correctly assembled in the right grid. To move a piece, simply click on it. The piece will be moved to the center. Then click on an empty square to place it. You cannot rotate the pieces. You can make as many moves as you like, and there are no restrictions about where you place them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
