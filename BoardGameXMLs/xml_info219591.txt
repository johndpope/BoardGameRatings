							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wonderful Weapons and Exotic Equipment</name>
									
			<description>A collection of weapons and equipment options for those that want a little bit more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wondrous Weapons and Exotic Equipment contains a small compilation of weapons that fill a few of the niches that are yet to be filled up, the trick weapons of Bloodborne and some minor defensive upgrades such as the Buckler, the Tower Shield, Thieves Mail for those that wish to stealth and be well defended and two bits of equipment that allow Barbarians, Monks and Wizards to have some semblance of defensive garb that isn't really armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
