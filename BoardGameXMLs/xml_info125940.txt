			<description>A tabletop adventure game where 2-4 players take the role of a Hero and pursue 1 of 10 fantasy quests.  The board is a modular tile based system with a Castle, Forest, and multi-level Ruins.  Each Hero can gain skills and items along the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes can buy and sell gear, use magical items, fight a variety of creatures, and gain skills to give themselves advantage in various situations.  Variety and re-playability are accomplished through the random board layout, &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; random creature encounters, &amp;quot;smart' random treasure, Event cards that do not require luck, and role playing elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day and night add variety to events, locations, encounter behavior, and treasure.  Poisons, curses, blessings, secret rooms, Hero abilities, and treasure chests add additional variety.  All this ensures no two plays are the same.  A new story unfolds each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has light role playing elements.  No Game Master or writing is required.  All information is written on the cards and only a single d6 and various markers are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIP thread: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/24779218&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/24779218&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
