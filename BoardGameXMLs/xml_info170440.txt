							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle For New Providence</name>
									
			<description>The event takes place in 1690, the golden period of the &amp;quot;piracy&amp;rdquo; and describes the pirates attempt to save New Providence by the English navy sent to conquer it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is created on the analogy of the so called &amp;quot;board game&amp;quot; which must be larger and have more complex rules. It is designed for two to four players but with a little effort it can be played individually. This will need the player to make moves alternately on both sides. This way he can try and clarify the various constructions and tactical maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is built of two interrelated parts. In one you will be admiral of the navy. On one side are the English ships that need to transport military units in order to to take over New Providence. On the other side is the pirate fleet trying to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;If the British army is successfully transferred to the island it will have to face the pirate band's to repel their attacks and conquer in time three forts that have strategic importance for the conquest of the island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
