			<description>Inspired by games from Crokinole to Catacombs to Taktika, Conflickt: Field of Slaughter is a two to six player dexterity game of strategic and tactical combat with a fantasy war theme.  Asymmetric in design, each player leads a faction of warriors (melee, ranged, and special units) with unique colors and properties in both team and free-for-all battles to rout the other armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players of Conflickt can command the Humans (yellow), Goblins (green), Elves (blue), Orcs (red), Dwarves (orange), or Undead (purple).  Each option plays differently, with varying numbers of warriors and unique special units employing awesome powers that can completely change the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any relatively smooth table can serve as the eponymous Field of Slaughter.  Strike quickly and strike true, or death awaits from an enemy with a better plan!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
