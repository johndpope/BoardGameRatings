							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 â€“ Nieuport 17</name>
									
			<description>The Nieuport 17 was a nimble fighter, first released in March 1916. Its excellent maneuverability made a big impact. It soon equipped all of the French fighter squadrons, served as a top British fighter for a year, and was even copied by the Germans! The &amp;ldquo;sesquiplane&amp;rdquo; design (a &amp;ldquo;half&amp;rdquo; lower wing) gave excellent climb and visibility, but was a weakness in stressful maneuvers. A favorite of aces, the Nieuport 17 was produced in France, Italy, and Russia and used by all Allied armies until late 1917.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nieuport 17 (Baracca)&lt;br/&gt;Francesco Baracca was Italy&amp;rsquo;s top ace of World War I, with 34 kills, several of them in this Nieuport 17. His &amp;ldquo;prancing horse&amp;rdquo; symbol was later adopted by Ferrari.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nieuport 17 (Charles Nungesser)&lt;br/&gt;The flamboyant pilot, preferred Nieuports, even after his squadron switched to SPADs. He survived World War I as France&amp;rsquo;s #3 scoring ace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nieuport 17 (Thaw/Lufbery)&lt;br/&gt;American volunteers and French officers fought side&amp;ndash;by&amp;ndash;side in the &amp;ldquo;Escadrille Lafayette.&amp;rdquo; Cards for two of them, Raoul Lufbery and Bill Thaw, are featured in this model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
