							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Higher Digi-Quate</name>
									
			<description>Higher Digi-Quate is an advanced version of Digi-Quate. Like Digi-Quate, it was invented by a National University of Singapore lecturer and it is game of forming mathematical equations on a square grid board. Players have hands of 10 tokens showing numbers and mathematical operators. Each turn they try to form an equation, intersecting crossword-style with equations already on the board. Covering special squares on the board gives bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;The feature that distinguishes Higher Digi-Quate from Digi-Quate is that it adds three dice to the game, a green D10 (numbered 0 to 9) and two red D6s (numbered 0 to 4). The board is larger and there are now bonus squares with pictures of a green D10, a red D6 and two red D6s. Placing an equation that covers these dice bonus squares allows the player to roll the dice and their score may be multiplied; there's also a small risk that the score may be multiplied by zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digi-Quate is a game invented by a lecturer from the National University of Singapore. Players draw 10 tokens or tiles with numbers or mathematical operators on them and try to form equations on a square grid playing board. Subsequent play intersects with already played tiles, crossword-style. Covering special squares on the board gives bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
