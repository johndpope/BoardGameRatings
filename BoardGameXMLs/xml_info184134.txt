			<description>Aurea - A Role-playing System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aurea is intended to be a generic, universal role-playing system.  Characters have twelve attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Physical Speed, Size, Comeliness, Reaction Speed, Willpower, Intelligence, Mental Fitness, Mental Speed, and Learning) that range from 3-12 each.  Alternately, characters can be generated with a 120 point buy.  Characters then have points distributed from a pool to various skills, ranging from zero to seven (basic competency) and increasing to 18 and beyond.  Skills increase in score by repetitive successful use.  Skill success and combat are resolved according to a resolution table that maps difficulty class against skill level on a resolution table, yielding a percentage.  Characters then roll percentile dice and attempt to roll under the table number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though the system is intended to be generic, all weapons and armor listed are for traditional fantasy equipment, and an appendix is given for magic and psionics systems.  A final index offers numerous optional rules that replace the standard rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aurea is a generic system, which means that it should be applicable to every possible world-setting. It has been used in a variety of medieval fantasy worlds, a realistic medieval world, in a cyberpunk setting, two classical era settings, in the China of Judge Dee, in a Cthulhu-like setting and a couple more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
