			<description>From the Avalanche Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the First World War, the United States continued to build huge new battleships despite a pressing need for destroyers and merchant ships. In Britain, Royal Navy planners wondered just what their American allies were up to, because such a fleet could only have one potential adversary. Britain also made plans to construct new ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea of Troubles is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on the war plans of both sides. Most of the scenarios take place in the Caribbean Sea, using the map from U.S. Navy Plan Gold, but some actions are also placed in European waters on the maps for Jutland or Mediterranean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces, the same pieces that originally appeared in our now out-of-print U.S. Navy Plan Red. The Americans get the huge 1919 program battleship mounting eight 18-inch guns as well as four examples of the South Dakota class with their dozen 16-inch guns apiece. There are also the Lexington class battle cruisers in their original configuration with 14-inch guns, and the 1914 design for a fast commerce-raiding armored cruiser armed with 10-inch guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Royal Navy adds the remainder of its R-class battleships not seen in Jutland, plus the huge battleships of the N3 design with nine 18-inch guns each, and the ungainly but powerful battle cruisers of the G3 design. Plus the Royal Canadian Navy makes an appearance with three dreadnought battleships and a flotilla of destroyers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over three dozen new scenarios featuring brawls between huge fleets of battleships, plus of course background articles on the ships, the fleets and the war plans of all potential participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a stand-alone game; ownership of Mediterranean, Jutland and U.S. Navy Plan Gold is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: This product acts as a successor to the now out-of-print Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Red.  As a result, both countersheets that ship with this product are still labeled 'US Navy Plan Red', although the scenarios for that product, set along the United States Eastern seaboard, are now deprecated in favor of scenarios set in the Mediterranean and North Sea.  Additionally, while 'US Navy Plan Red' was a boxed-set and limited to a few scenarios that could work with the components included, as a module book 'Sea of Troubles' is not so constrained.  There are more than 2 dozen scenarios in this product that cover more than just 'Plan Red', along with articles on the ships and historical flavor for this period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan Red was released in a second edition in 2013. It has a completely revised scenario book with 14 battle and 20 operational scenarios, and updated special rules. Sea of Troubles is out of print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
