			<description>This is a roll-and-move-game. The players start at home (numbered houses). Then they have to go to the fire station, where they get a blue card with their mission order. On the way to their mission location they don't have to mind any obstacles, but on the way back to the fire station, if they land on a red spot, they have to draw a red mission card. The blue spots mark traffic jams where movement is only one spot per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player back to the fire station wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;The last player has to tidy away the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
