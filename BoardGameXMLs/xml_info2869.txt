			<description>A weird spin off off of Backgammon.  Each player starts with 12 playing pieces on their side of the board. The first player to move all 12 of their playing pieces across the board and off the other side wins. Moves are made by rolling 3 dice. After you roll you decide which die determines which column you can move a piece in and use the other two dice to determine how far by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. Triples and Double are a big help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
