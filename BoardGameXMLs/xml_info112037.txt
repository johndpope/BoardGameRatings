			<description>The mouse is clever and the elephant is strong and they play tug-of-war, but they need both muscles and brain to pull each other over the finish line. The terrain cards are laid out, the tug-of-war card is placed under the middle card, flag just beneath the starting post. One player has the mouse cards, the other the elefant cards, duck cards win against 8, 9 and 10 and loose against all others. Each player chooses a card and places it face down, they are revealed at the same time, the higher card wins and the player may move the tug-of-card along one terrain card. Who can move the tug-of-war card over the finish line, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
