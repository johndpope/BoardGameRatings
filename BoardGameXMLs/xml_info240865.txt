			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of 100 different things that could be found by players using a metal detector. These could be simply scene dressing discovered whilst players are looking for something more specific, or they could be used as possible plot points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the items found may be junk, some may be valuable and some have the potential to be dangerous. Even the junk may prove useful to inventive players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;77. Ring Pull (From the old style pull tabs that were completely removed to just the ring from the more modern stay on tabs)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
