			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fruits of the Urban Jungle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you wish that alchemy in your game had a little more &amp;ldquo;oomph?&amp;rdquo; Have you ever been disappointed that no matter what it is that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to craft, all it takes is gold, time, and a skill check, with no concern as to what ingredients you&amp;rsquo;re using or how they&amp;rsquo;re prepared? Have you ever GM&amp;rsquo;d for a player who always seemed to want to wander off into the woods (or the merchant district) in search of rare and exotic reagents and compounds for his next magical experiment, and struggled to come up with an exciting and suitably fantastic material for him to find?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then this is the book for you. Successor to the critically-acclaimed A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: The Secret of Herbs and Weekly Wonders: Urban Herbs is a stand-alone product that continues its predecessors' unique approach to the sorts of low-cost special substances that can be created with the Craft (alchemy) skill. Presented herein are five new urban-themed herbs with very special properties, as well as everything you need to know about how to use them in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are the cobbleweed, a nauseating and tangled grass, gloryfleurs, a magical flower capable of producing a variety of alluring scents, razor vine, a fast-growing bramble known for its sharp and jagged barbs, streetshroom, a psychedelic (and sometimes poisonous) mushroom, and wall creepers, an ivy-like plant with a number of practical uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
