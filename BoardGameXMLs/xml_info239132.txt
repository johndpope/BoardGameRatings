							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ravaged Wasteland of Crifoth</name>
									
			<description>A Brutal Post-Apocalyptic Fantasy Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crifoth was once home to the great kingdom of Ossland. A kingdom of splendor, great magic, and vast metropolises. Archmages unraveled the fundament of the world atop their lofty towers, and marketplaces bustled with wealthy commerce. But now, a century since its fall, little remains to hint at Ossland&amp;rsquo;s glory. Pastures turned to badlands, cities turned to rubble&amp;mdash;the eruption of Mount Kest extinguished the vast majority of life and buried Ossland beneath molten earth. This eruption was not spontaneous&amp;mdash;it was the result of something more sinister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A foolish mistake made by King Alain Lothaire of Ossland brought a fiendish evil into the world. A desperate bargain brought the kingdom to its knees. King Alain, desperate to win his war against the dwarves, was manipulated, and invited an Archfiend into the mortal world. This Archfiend, Burpoross, wrought destruction on the land. His vile presence snuffed out all life and corrupted everything it touched. Tidal waves, earthquakes, and the eruption of Mount Kest sealed Ossland&amp;rsquo;s fate. This was the Fall of Humanity. Evil had won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A century of torment, carnage, and bleakness passed. Burpoross and his fiendish minions established strongholds as they carved their way across the landscape. For most, the only refuge was to flee into the sands to the south, just beyond the Archfiend&amp;rsquo;s grasp. For others, it was submission to his rule, in hopes that he would spare their lives. But in the end, none on Crifoth can escape the grasp of Burpoross..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Crifoth, it is courage just to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
