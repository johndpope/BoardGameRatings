			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem (真・女神転生 Ｘ ファイアーエムブレム Shin Megami Tensei Kurosu Faiā Emuburemu) is an upcoming crossover role-playing video game in development by Atlus and Intelligent Systems for the Wii U. The game will feature characters from both the Shin Megami Tensei series and Intelligent Systems's Fire Emblem franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was officially announced on January 23, 2013 as part of a Nintendo Direct presentation. The trailer showed artwork of several characters from both series, and revealed the game was going to be developed by both Atlus and Intelligent Systems, the first joint project between the two development teams. The trailer concludes with the message 'Development in Progress'. While initially speculated by journalists that the game could be any genre due to the trailer's vague nature, Atlus confirmed the next day that the game will be a role-playing game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first announced to the public via a teaser trailer during a Nintendo Direct video presentation on January 23, 2013. The teaser consisted of character art from past Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei titles and was presented with the working title of Shin Megami Tensei x Fire Emblem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This crossover project morphed into the conceptually wildly different Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE (2015) soon after the announcement of the start of development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
