							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Spider &amp; The Fly</name>
									
			<description>Summer is here and so are the bugs inside my cabin room. But so is the Old Spider. We help him deploy his webs around the room to catch those pesky pests. Each player sets the web, rolls the dice and sees which bugs are caught. It's not as easy as it sounds, because the pests keep buzzing around and can wriggle free from a web. We and the Old Spider will have to help each other make some clever choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 game board &lt;br/&gt;2 bug dice &lt;br/&gt;6 bug tokens &lt;br/&gt;2 spider webs &lt;br/&gt;rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
