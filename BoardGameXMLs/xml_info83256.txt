							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Devil&#039;s Crossroad Western RPG (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the West was a violent point by our standards, it was not the gun crazy shoot out that media has made it out to be. That image has come from dime novels and travelling side shows from the 19th century and from Hollywood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devil&amp;rsquo;s Crossroad is a game that attempts to sit in the middle of the road between history and genre. It was created to capture the drama and action of the western genre without forgetting the historical facts on which the genre is based. The game is violent and gritty, but it is not a historic simulation. If this sounds like a game for you, then saddle up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
