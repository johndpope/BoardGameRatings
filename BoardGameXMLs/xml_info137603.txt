							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Waterloo Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Why did Wellington win?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an abstract challenge for one or two players. The board is a &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; shaped pattern of 33 squares in alternating colors. Each square is marked with the name of a Napoleonic battle. There are 32 playing pieces (like checkers) in two colors. The playing pieces are placed on the board, leaving the center &amp;quot;Waterloo&amp;quot; square empty. The object of the game is to &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot; every piece, leaving just one token left and positioned in the center space. In the two player version the contestants take turns making their jumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the 16&amp;quot; x 16&amp;quot; board and 32 tokens. The rules are printed inside the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
