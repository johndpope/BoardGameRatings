							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jinmenken Haunted School Escape</name>
									
			<description>This unique game takes the classic motif of the haunted school to new levels. In Jinmenken Haunted School Escape Game, your character must move around the scary school board, all while being chased by a so-called Jinmenken, a dog with a human face that is a staple of Japanese urban legends. Collect three matching items that spring from the clock tower to various rooms in the school, and then escape back to the starting point. Whoever gets there first is the winner! Spin the clock tower face to see how many moves you can make each time. But the clock may tell you to move the Jinmenken, who has three different speeds! If he catches your character, it's game over for you! There are also numerous other tricks and secret gimmicks depending on where you land on the board. This is a great game for Japanese language-learners and fans of Japanese ghost stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
