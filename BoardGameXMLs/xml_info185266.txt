			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slasher Flick -- Slash in a Flash offers a version of the Slasher Flick rules designed to be learned quickly, making it perfect for a one-off game with those who don't normally play hobby games or those who want to jump right in and get their hands bloody. Within this document, you'll find everything you need in order to run and play Slasher Flick, including character creation rules, the kill scene system and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed to be printed out on a single sheet of paper or cardstock (front and back). As such, we have included a version without a background to make it easier on your printer's ink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Experienced players will find that some of the rules have been modified to make for a faster game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
