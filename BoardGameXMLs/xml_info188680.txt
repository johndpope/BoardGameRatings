			<description>The game of the 70's movie. The 'private eye' detective is trying to locate a kidnapped daughter of a gang boss. Players secretly indicate the location they are moving to by marking it on a 'location indicator' disc. The game involves deduction (working out which location a player has chosen to move to). The game uses a vinyl game 'board' and was sold in a round plastic box made to look like a film canister. The game is marked 'X certificate', but that appears to relate to the adult-only classification of the source movie rather than game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
