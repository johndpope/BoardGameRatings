			<description>A horse racing themed card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Bookie and will offer odds on each race. Those odds are determined by how many cards of each colour are randomly drawn before the race starts. If only one red card is drawn, the odds will be better than a colour that has no cards drawn. If 2 are drawn for one colour, the odds increase. And so on. The odds reflect the fact that there are less cards in the deck for that colour to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having established the odds and all bets are placed, the race begins. The Bookie turns over a card and that colour advances one card length. A horse needs to be moved 7 card lengths first to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some wild cards that have certain effects. They tend to affect the race of the next card to be revealed. For example, if you drew a Blue Horse Stumbles card, the Blue horse is moved forward as usual. But the next colour card drawn has to suffer the effects of having stumbled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner at the end of the evening is the player with the most cash. I would suggest you might end it after every player has had one turn of being the Bookie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
