							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Himmelsziege und die schwarzen Löcher</name>
									
			<description>The space ship Himmelsziege travels through space, trying to evade the dangerous black holes. &lt;br/&gt;One player is the route planner, another is the captain. The planner reveals three route cards, and secretly blocks one of them with a magnet on the underside of the board. The captain then chooses one of the route, and the planner tells the captain about one other route that is not blocked. The captain then has the option to change the route. &lt;br/&gt;Afterwards, a small metal ball is rolled from a ramp at the starting point toward the destination. If it passes the magnet, it is stopped and caught by the black hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the outcome and on whether the route had been changed, chips in different colors are awarded to the players. The goal of the game is to collect chips, but mainly to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
