			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crazy 8s is a rules-lite, universal game engine that is intended to provide a quick, easy to learn and fun RPG experience that anyone from the first time newbie to the seasoned veteran can use to create a simple, kick-ass role-playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crazy 8s engine is built around the use of two eight-sided die (2d8) rolled against a difficulty set by the Talespinner, who acts as the principal storyteller and rules adjudicator. The Crazy 8s System is based on character skills, gear and Awesome points, which players may spend in order to edit the story and have numerous in-game effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crazy 8s 2nd edition has been greatly revised and includes more character options and guidelines for new and existing storytellers while keeping in line with the freeflowing systems that make the game a freeflowing rules lite system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
