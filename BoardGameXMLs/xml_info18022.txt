							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Jock Baseball</name>
									
			<description>This is in the Super Jock series of sports games.  You hit Super Jock on the head to make it do its action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Super Jock Baseball, one player has a spring loaded pitcher (Unfortunately, not activated by slamming its head!) who delivers to a Super Jock batter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is by far the hardest of the Super Jock games.  Most often the batter strikes out  ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
