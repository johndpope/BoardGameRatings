The game plays like the other games in the R&amp;aring;da Tr&amp;aring;den series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 80 cards with two subjects on each card. Every subject have 10 clues. One of the players reads a card and knows the answer, tells the other players the subject, and then, one by one, going thru the clues. The players can try to answer on high levels and get a higher score, or wait to answer and get lower score. Every player starts each subject with 10 points, and loses one for each new clue.
