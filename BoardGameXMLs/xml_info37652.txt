			<description>1938 Pontiac &amp;quot;Premium&amp;quot; promotional board game entitled &amp;quot;The Pontiac Safety Drive Game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game reproduces all of the problems encountered in driving an automobile through the congested streets of a typical city. The board portrays a street map, with traffic signals, sixteen objective points (golf course, fair grounds, etc.) and obstacles (Jail, Hospital, etc.) Rules and penalties are based on actual traffic regulations. [The] OBJECT OF THE GAME is to acquire the most money by being [the] first player to reach the various objectives with least loss though fines or damages.&amp;quot; This is a truly entertaining and well thought-out game, which manages to combine education, advertising, and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was printed in the USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
