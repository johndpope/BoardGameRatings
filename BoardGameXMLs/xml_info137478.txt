			<description>Alien Labyrinth Twists and Turns in Outer Space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cool Factors:&lt;br/&gt; - A randomized board of rotating rooms&lt;br/&gt; - Simple rules with complex strategy&lt;br/&gt; - Space Cats, Displacer Beams, and the Neutron Burrito!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;Stranded aboard an alien space station millions of miles from Earth, your only hope of getting home is to outrace your companions and buy the only seat on the last space taxi leaving. It won't be an easy task. The station itself is constantly changing as you move through it, making every step a challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you explore the station, you'll find all kinds of strange souvenirs the aliens have collected on their travels. Gadgets, weapons, clothing, food and even a few mysterious specimens that can only be loosely defined as creatures. Collect what you can and trade it away to afford your ride back home. But beware the others and what they might do with the things they find, and never go near anyone who has just eaten a Neutron Burrito...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;Be the first player to buy your way onto the space taxi to get home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;The board is modular and made up of 24 square tiles which are randomly placed in a pre-configured shape at the start of the game. One tile will be labeled sleeping pods, which is where all players start the game. On your turn, you have 4 moves. Each move allows you to rotate your room or an orthogonally adjacent room clockwise one turn, or move one space. Exploring a new room spends all remaining movement, but also allows you to draw an item card. Item cards represent clothing, specimen, food, or occasionally an event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you end your movement on a tile, you may perform the action depicted on that tile once. Most tiles allow you to trade in an item of a specific type for 1 credit, 2 credits, or 2 more cards. Some tiles allow you an additional movement, some allow you to draw a card if your hand is empty, and others have no effect at all. Once you have 10 credits, you need to race to be the first player to the escape pod to escape and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
