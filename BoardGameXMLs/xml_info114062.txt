			<description>The original Starfire, obscurely published in 1975, was the prototype for the later Task Force Games series. The presentation is minimalist: a blank hex sheet and one page of rules. Players must improvise their own counters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its successor, the game depicts combat between spaceships. Each ship is represented by a series of letters,with each letter representing a system (shields, engines, several types of beam weapon, torpedoes, guns, etc.). In each turn, ships fire their weapons, then move. The probability of a hit depends upon range. A hit destroys one of the target's systems, gradually reducing its firepower, defenses and speed. Movement is simply a number of hexes equal to the number of engine systems - no momentum or other complications of physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three scenarios: &amp;quot;Main Battle Fleet&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Convoy Action&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Planet Assault&amp;quot;. Terrain, in the form of radiation belts or asteroids, may be added in the players' discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Starfire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
