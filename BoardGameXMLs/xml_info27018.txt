			<description>The players must deduce which of the six given historical figures is the correct one. The players choose and ask the questions on the cards given to them while the quizmaster responds according to the answer key. The player who gives the correct answer scores points depending on how many questions were asked by the players. The first to score one hundred points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is loosely based on a television series designed by Monty Hall of Let&amp;rsquo;s Make a Deal fame. Mr. Hall&amp;rsquo;s name is misspelled on the box lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
