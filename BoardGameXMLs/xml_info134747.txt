			<description>You the player will take over a person living in a corrupt society, that is going to try and take advantage of government policies, corporate bureaucracies and a few bribes to climb up the ladder to a position of power. You'll need money to get influence with the right people and the right spots, soon after you'll have a small group of contacts that will expand into a web. A Web of Influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in a hexagonal board, divided in its axis by public or private sectors.&lt;br/&gt;In every round each player has to decide if they want to build their connections on the board between the private and public sectors or move through the connections he has made to perform actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round a maintenance phase occurs, giving players money for their hard work, deals appear for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deals can be made between 2 or 3 players where their connections cross each others, the active player collects everything that is involved in the deal and creates two stashes or three (depending on the number of players in the deal) and then the other players choose one stash leaving the remaining one for the active player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
