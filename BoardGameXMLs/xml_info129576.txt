							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dead End: An Adventure Strategy Game. With Zombies.</name>
									
			<description>Dead End is survival-horror strategy game which pits survivors against zombies in a city-scape scenario. The world has succumbed to a laboratory-engineered super virus, bringing humanity to the brink of extinction and reanimated those who were once dead. The few who remain alive spend their days seeking out fellow survivors to help improve their chances for survival. It is a constant struggle to find sufficient food, tools, and--relatively safe--shelter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your story begins with your vehicle having just broken down in the middle of Sanctuary City. You must now wander the streets looking for replacement parts to repair your vehicle. During your trek, you will encounter roadblocks, lootable buildings, and countless zombie hordes. As you progress, your team will be faced with game-changing choices: does your team stop to rest and recuperate, risking the chance of a zombie attack, or move on? Do you split off from your group to check out that side-street, or stick together to better your survival odds? Meanwhile, the zombie player's hordes lurk around every corner, to ensure no one gets out alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a simplified dice-rolling system, Dead End allows for in-depth strategy and variety without bogging down the game in rules and exceptions. This allows the game to be fun and exciting for players of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
