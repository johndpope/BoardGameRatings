			<description>Players roll and move over a board. They can take up cards with certain pictures on the corresponding squares of the board. When a player meets another player, he or she can take a card from him/her (the loser goes back to the start). A cloud square means a card can be stolen from anyone. There are eight pairs of two cards each - when a player has both cards of a pair, these are protected from theft. The first player to collect 16 different cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
