			<description>From the Directions:&lt;br/&gt;RANKO is a game for 2,3, or 4 players using a deck of 48 cards, each having a numeral.  Each RANKO player is dealt 8 cards which he must place in a rack in the order dealt.  Then, by replacing various cards in his rack he tries to get his cards ranked so that the numbers represented on the cards are in increasing order from front to rear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four different games are possible since there are four different decks of cards:&lt;br/&gt;(a) Pink cards have numerals 1 to 48 in standard form: 1, 2, 3, 4,..., 46, 47, 48.&lt;br/&gt;(b) Blue cards have numerals 1 to 48 in non-standard form: (36/36), (2^3/2^2), (9/3),..., (7^2-2), (2^4x3).&lt;br/&gt;(c) Yellow cards have numerals from 1 to 48 in base five:&lt;br/&gt;1five, 2five, 3five,..., 142five, 143five.&lt;br/&gt;(d) White cards have numerals for the multiples of 4 from 4 to 192: 4, 8, 12, 16,..., 184, 188, 192.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
