							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pokémon Trading Card Game: Ancient Mew Alternate Art Promo Card</name>
									
			<description>This card was released in the year 2000 and was given out with the purchase of a ticket for the theatrical run of The Power of One (Pokemon 2000) in the United States and other countries worldwide, limited to only the first week. After the first week of the theatrical run, attendees would only be able to receive a Moltres, Articuno, or Zapdos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first Japanese prints of the card featured a speckle holo and misspelled Nintendo in the copyright text on the card border as &amp;quot;Nintedo&amp;quot;. A corrected print was released for a very brief time with the same holofoil as the first print. Then, after the corrected version, a third version was released which featured the same holofoil treatment as the international release. The only difference between the third Japanese release and the international release are the listed copyrights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
