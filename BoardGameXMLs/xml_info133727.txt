			<description>This exciting, pleasure packed game of skill develops coordination and steady nerves. Toss-Up fascinates old and young. Entertains family and friends. Play Carrom Toss-Up and you will never give up! Now! Get in the swing and make a &amp;quot;ring&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns either single, as partners, or in teams trying to make &amp;quot;rings&amp;quot; by trying to toss the ring onto the hook. If you make one ring you get a bonus toss. Two rings in a row give you two bonus tosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ring is worth 1 point and games are played to any point value set ahead of time. Typically you play three rounds with the winner being the one with the most points in 2 out of the three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
