			<description>From the back of the game box: &lt;br/&gt;Contents: Original plastic playing board plus 64 two sided (yellow and green) playing pieces, plus game instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aristo - The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AIM - to try to end the game with a majority of your color pieces on the board. Aristo is a game of wits. You have to outwit your opponent, overturn as many of his pieces as possible in each turn and aim to cover the playing board with your color.&lt;br/&gt;Sounds simple? The problem is that your opponent is trying to do exactly the same to you!!! Are your pieces blocked? Are most of the pieces on the board your opponent's color? Don't give up... one well placed piece can turn your opponent's pieces over to your color in up to eight different directions at once!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
