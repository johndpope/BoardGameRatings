			<description>Go Eco is a card game for 2-6 players that celebrates diversity in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to reach a predetermined number of points over multiple rounds by scoring a set of food chain cards from one ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a hand of 8 cards. On your turn you can either draw a card or declare victory of the round. If you draw a card then you can play or discard a card from your hand. There are two basic types of cards in the game: Ecosystem cards and Go cards. Ecosystem cards will be collected in order to declare victory. Go cards allow you to gain an advantage over other players or protect yourself. If you declare victory and meet the victory conditions, you tally your points and then begin a new round. Play continues until one player has reached the predetermined number of victory points, 50 for a shorter game or 100 for a longer one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
