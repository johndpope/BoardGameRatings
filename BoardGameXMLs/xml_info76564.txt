			<description>Yes, you are an Archaeologist. You track down antiquities all over the globe. You don&amp;rsquo;t want trouble, yet trouble always seems to find you. But you are ready for anything with your whip, gun, and lucky hat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sen So is a 2 or more player strategy board game for ages 10 and up. Most games take about 15-30 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sen So uses a unique set of octagon cards and card holders. Players have to think ahead of opponents by placing and revealing cards together. This provides fast play for even large numbers of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sen So Print Your Own decks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TwinBlade Games is proud to offer this affordable way to enjoy Sen So. Print Your Own (PYO) is designed to be printer friendly. PYO uses less ink and very little color ink to provide you with a cost effective way to print and play Sen So. Some details that were ink heavy have been removed, but the cards and materials still provide clean, clear and exciting graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
