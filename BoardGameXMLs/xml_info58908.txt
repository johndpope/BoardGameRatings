							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Japanese Games of Cash and Akambo</name>
									
			<description>Cash is a Pachisi type race game and Akambo (Red Baby) is a simple children&amp;rsquo;s game in which players match parts of the face with overturned counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1881, when this game was published, Japan had recently opened itself to the outside world after centuries of isolation.  This resulted in a surge of interest in Japanese culture which is reflected in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with most McLoughlin Bros. board games, the playing boards are colorful lithographic prints of high quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
