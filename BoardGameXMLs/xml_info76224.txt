			<description>Subtitle: Rules for 18th and early 19th Century Naval Wargaming On the Great Lakes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Away, Boarders! is an historical wargame designed to recreate the battles between the small warships of various nations that fought on the Great Lakes during the 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes the role of the commander of a ship, and makes decisions about how his ship will maneuver and what tasks his crew will perform, with the object of defeating his opponents (or, perhaps, just surviving the ordeal of combat to fight again another day).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a repeating sequence of actions, performed in a specific order each turn by the players. The sequence, which represents the events that would take place in about the amount of time it would take a typical gun crew in the 18th century to load and fire a large cannon, is repeated until the victory conditions of one side have been achieved, or all the ships of one side have been lost or have fled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
