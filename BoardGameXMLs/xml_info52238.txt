			<description>A free introductory adventure for Exalted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Age of Savage Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exalted is an elegantly simple game, but you can explore the Age of Sorrows and delve into its vastly detailed setting for endless hours of entertainment. It is the Second Age of Man. Once, the Scarlet Empress of the Dragon-Blooded held the Realm in an iron grip, but with her disappearance, all hell has broken loose. Civil war is at hand, and Demon Princes, Deathlords and the inscrutable Fair Folk hammer at the gates of Creation. Into this time of darkness are reborn the Solar Exalted, heroes once slain by the Dragon-Blooded. Will these living legends herald the return of the Golden Age - or the end of Creation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tomb of Five Corners&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A band of mighty heroes are brought together by hazy visions of their past lives and of the tomb wherein their forsaken bodies lie, defended by deadly traps and surrounded by untold riches. Four of the stalwart souls find their way to a valley north and east of the city of Nexus, rediscover the bonds of their ancient brotherhood and determine to join together to recover their forgotten artifacts of power. Soon, they find that even the most Exalted of fellowships can be broken &amp;mdash; one of their Circle was to meet them, and now, it seems she has been kidnapped by one of the foul Deathlords. Amid the hallowed stones of their own graves, the heroes overcome the blasphemies of necromancy and face fierce foes in a battle that leaves little doubt that the lords of the Abyss must be turned back before they destroy Creation and descend upon its corpse like vultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
