							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mortimer Beckett and the Secrets of Spooky Manor</name>
									
			<description>Mortimer Beckett and the Secrets of Spooky Manor is an adventure game (point 'n click). The main plot is to find items to advance to the next chapters. Also, you can use items called &amp;quot;puzzle pieces&amp;quot; which will let you interact with other characters, items, or animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this first episode of the Mortimer Beckett series, Mortimer helps his uncle to get rid of ghosts, by retrieving pieces of the Ghost Machine which have been hidden all over the manor. The cut scenes are 2D and read like a comic book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Windows edition runs on Windows 98 and  newer Windows editions. This game has also been made into a game for Nintendo Wii and into an Application for the iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mortimer Beckett,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
