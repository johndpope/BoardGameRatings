			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win or Go Home! is a racing game where you can take a driver and improve him (or her) over the course of a career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other racing games, it's the pack of cars that moves around the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win or Go Home can be played with the counters we've provided or with any die cast models you may already have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A game that can be played solo, cooperatively, or as a head-to-head competition.&lt;br/&gt;    A system that lets non-player drivers race against players, and allows the non-player drivers to follow their own strategies while remaining competitive.&lt;br/&gt;    A campaign system that, with little bookkeeping, allows you to race a full season.&lt;br/&gt;    Playable with die cast vehicles in any scale, or even cardboard counters if you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
