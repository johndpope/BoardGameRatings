			<description>Apostles is a non-denominational Christian-themed card game in which players represent ministers working to edify the Christian church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the management of spiritual gifts and fruit, his people become equipped for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up. In the game gifts, fruit, mission and people are represented by cards which, once established yield spiritual blessings (cards dealt at the beginning of each round), and/or souls reached, which accumulate as points for scoring at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 135 cards, out of which a hand of 9 is dealt to each player. Players use the cards to establish gifts, fruit, mission or workers (by discarding cards from his hand),  or save for later rounds. Gifts nurture and encourage good fruit in the church, which in turn manifest themselves in the form of mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As events affect the development of the church, players struggle to establish the most thriving ministry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can follow the game design thread here: &lt;br/&gt;WIP, Apostles, Christian card game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
