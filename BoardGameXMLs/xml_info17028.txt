			<description>The aim of the game is to build a spacelab from several components. The players compete to bring up the most modules. Therefore they need to buy launch pads, rockets  or the shuttle and the components itself. &lt;br/&gt;There are different types of rockets that vary in their ability to carry one or more modules and how much weight they can accept. Rockets can be used only once, whereas the shuttle is reusable.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the players picks the last module, rocket or extra card. The player with the most money (earned by successful installed modules) wins.&lt;br/&gt;The components are very well done for a self-published game, the first edition held 211 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
