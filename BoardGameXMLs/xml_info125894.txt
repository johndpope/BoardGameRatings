							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bad Moon</name>
									
			<description>The year: 1815 AD; the location: Maine, New England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Cape Grimson has turned into a battleground for ancient vampire houses and savage clans of werewolves. The stench of blood fills the night when the children of the darkness prepare their teeth for the taste of the enemy. Now, it's your time to become the lord of the damned and conquer the night once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Moon is a fast-paced card-drafting strategy game about the war between vampires, werewolves and other sinister creatures of the night. Players collect victory points by guiding the factions in the war and balancing the battles by secretly playing different factions during the game. The strong factions don't always prevail, mind you; it's all about intrigue and planning the future of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round represents one month consisting of four moon phases. Moon phases determine possible movements in the map for different locations. Players play one of their hand cards in order to conduct actions on the map. At the start of each new month new cards are drafted giving the players a chance to change the way of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
