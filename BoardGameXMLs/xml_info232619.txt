							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D100 Alliterative Consumables</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[D100 Alliterative Consumables] contains 100 different consumables with system-agnostic effects. Each consumable has an alliterative name (e.g., Potion of Perception) and each name is used only once (i.e., there is only one &amp;ldquo;potion&amp;rdquo;, one &amp;ldquo;vial&amp;rdquo;, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is intended that these effects last one hour unless they are specified as permanent, but this time can be adjusted depending on the particular rule set as well as the GM&amp;rsquo;s discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are most often useful as a random consumable that a PC finds and identifies, but this table can also be used to generate a random effect of drinking from a magical spring, for example. A similar risky feel can be achieved by having the PCs find an unlabeled consumable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some effects are negative and some are positive, with the idea that known negative effects will be used on enemies and known positive effects will be used on oneself or on an ally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
