			<description>The government has become corrupt, repressing, and enslaving the people, ruling with iron fist. The world has been tossed into turmoil. But amidst the upheaval, leaders are being made; heroes with their own agendas. As they gather more followers, they are creating armies to take down the Global Government and anyone else who may stand in their way. Competing ideological federations are battling for control to unify the world under their principles one nation at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As General of a federation, you are to leverage your innate capabilities to master the market, leverage trades, and then develop and command your military to conquer provinces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to four players can play and each player is provided with armies comprised of Caltrops (Soldiers), ArmTors (Armored Units), Threshers (Sea Units), and Fight Kites (Air Units) each with specific capabilities and costs. Each individual playing piece can be further developed with enhanced capabilities depending on the level of training a player is willing to invest.  The playing board is comprised of hex tiles that carry with them specific assets that enable players to accumulate assets and money. Players can use money and assets to create manufacturing plants (Barracks, Armories, Harbors, and Hangars) which in turn can be used to create armies.  Unit ranks determine the level of dice players roll in battle which determine victory or defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The victor is the General who captures all of their opponents Headquarters or forces the other Generals to concede the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the development at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://revolution-thegame.blogspot.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://revolution-thegame.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Biggs &amp;amp; Jay Guerrero &amp;ndash; Game Design&lt;br/&gt;Todd Biggs &amp;ndash; Game Piece Design&lt;br/&gt;Mark Mahaffey &amp;ndash; Artwork&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
