			<description>In Color Spiel, each turn players roll three special color dice using each one to either claim a color stock card or manipulate a color's score value from a central supply/score track wheel. Each stock card has a color which is always known and a numeric value ranging from 1 to 7 which is often public, but could be claimed secretly. Claiming low value cards grants the player a one-time ability that increases their odds of collecting points. The actual victory point value of each color is determined collectively by all players via trackers on the supply wheel. The values on the wheel rise slowly, crash quickly then cycle back around. The value for each color is tracked independently and is only awarded to the highest shareholders when a supply of stocks runs out. Players attempt to determine which stocks are best to collect, get the highest total of them, and maximize their value at just the right time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory points are only awarded at the end of each each round. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Color Spiel was chosen as the winner of the 2017 HABA USA Game Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
