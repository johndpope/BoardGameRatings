							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crusader: No Remorse</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Crusader games are divided into missions, each with their own locations and objectives. Settings vary from military bases to factories to offices to space stations, and contain a variety of enemy soldiers and servomechs, traps, puzzles and innocent bystanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the environments can be destroyed by weapons fire, providing a previously unprecedented level of setting interaction, and some traps or defenses can be manipulated for use against the enemy. The geography of the setting encourages the use of tactics and combinations of moves in order to hit the targets effectively with the minimum possible loss of resources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot revolves around economic downfalls at the end of the 20th century, the nations of the planet Earth began gradually to organize themselves into huge economic super-conglomerates. Eventually these continental organizations merged into the World Economic Consortium. The WEC is a tyrannical entity; while the world is made to look peaceful and prosperous, the reality is that most freedoms are suspended, taxes are well over 90%, military force is used mercilessly against those who dare oppose the WEC, and freedom of the press is barely even remembered, and then with contempt. Only an elite upper class of WEC executives have true power and wealth. Among these are WEC President Gauthier and Chairman Nathaniel Draygan.&lt;br/&gt;The WEC is being fought by an organization calling itself the Resistance, led by former WEC colonel, now general, Quentin Maxis. The Resistance is a severely outnumbered and outgunned ragtag mix of disparate people: ex-WEC soldiers and employees rub elbows with political dissidents, life-long refuseniks, and criminals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As No Remorse opens, a trio of Silencers&amp;mdash;enigmatic super-soldiers&amp;mdash;are returning from a botched mission in which they disobeyed an order to fire upon civilians who were (mistakenly) believed to be rebels. They are ambushed by a WEC mech, and two of the Silencers are killed. The remaining one, a nameless captain, (the player character), was able to disable the mech with a grenade.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crusader_(game_series),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
