			<description>Wummy! is a word game that is family friendly as well as possibly educational. The ultimate goal of the game is to use all the letters (cards) in your hand to make words. Even short words count and you get extra points if you can link two short words into a larger one. For example, linking &amp;quot;PAN&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;CAKE&amp;quot; would get you &amp;quot;PANCAKE&amp;quot; for extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything needed comes in the tin other than your own ability to create words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to reach 30 points on their score card is the winner of this word game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
