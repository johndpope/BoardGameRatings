			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROTOCULTURE ADDICTS PRESENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT A-KO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're going to die, A-ko! This is it! This time I'm gainsto come out on top and beat you! Akagiyama Missiles!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;A-ko glanced at the incoming missile swarm with trepidation, then turned and ran as quickly as she could. She stayed just ahead of the explosions, which ripped through the nearby buildings. When the last explosion narrowly missed toasting A-ko into a crispy schoolgirl, she turned back and faced B-ko. The latter was hastily reloading another pack of missile ammo.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no you don't!&amp;quot; cried A-ko. She picked up a mail box and whipped it at B-ko. &amp;quot;Catch this!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The mailman, who had stayed well back from the conflict up to now, called out in alarm, &amp;quot;Hey, You put that down! That's government property!&amp;quot; He watched helplessly as it became a missile weapon heading straight for B-ko. She barely had enough time to blast the mailbox out of the air, scattering bits of mail all over the street like confetti. He groaned at the loss.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Look at what you did! And people wonder why the mail takes forever! Behave yourselves!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of all the serious, grim worlds of love triangles and mecha-bashing intrigue? Ready to poke fun at all those popular mecha shows and at anime in general? Ready for hours of gut-busting laughter and spontaneous buffoonery, drawing upon your knowledge of Japanese anime or the world at large as a ready source of puns and jokes? If you are, then immerse yourself in the world of Project A-ko!&lt;br/&gt;Project A-ko: the Roleplaying Game is a comedy science-fiction game, complete with rules, equipment and characters derived from the Project A-ko animated features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is the PROJECT A-KO FIGHTER card game that can be used on its own or with the roleplaying game, with 36 cards printed in full color on quality stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
