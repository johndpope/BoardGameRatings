			<description>Fire Power (sometimes Firepower) is a strategic military tank action game developed by Silent Software, Inc. originally for the Amiga. It was released in 1987 and published by MicroIllusions and Activision. Ports were made for the DOS, Apple IIGS, Atari ST and Commodore 64 systems in 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay consists of controlling a tank through an expansive, outdoor landscape. Each map has at least two bases - one for green team, and one for the yellow team. Initially, the base locations were hidden from the players, so an extensive search of the landscape had to be conducted first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each base had several different types of buildings, such as armories, barracks, and bio-domes. The objective is to capture the flag from inside the enemy base by blasting through walls and destroying any defenses. You could also rescue prisoners of war by destroying the POW camps that were scattered throughout the enemy base. Destroying the camps would allow the captives to hop in your tank for a ride back to your base. An extra tank life was rewarded for each fifteen POWs rescued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Fire Power (video game), available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
