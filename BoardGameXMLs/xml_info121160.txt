			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the dungeon, the PCs have finally bested the foul ogre after an epic struggle and with glee loot their fallen enemy&amp;rsquo;s chambers. With excitement in their eyes, they ask &amp;ldquo;So what treasure did the ogre have, anyway?&amp;rdquo; An answer such as &amp;ldquo;300 gp in gems, three pieces of jewellery worth 200 gp each and a large rug&amp;rdquo; is somewhat of an anticlimax, but who has the time to prepared detailed treasure descriptions these days?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s That Shiny Thing, Anyway? banishes these problems by providing 28 pre-generated, ready-to-use lists containing hundreds of detailed items for the busy GM to immediately use in his campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
