							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Savant</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The savant is a specialist in knowledge, divination, and detection. At higher levels, their knowledge of all things arcane gives them significant prowess when dealing with creatures from other planes of existence, and their erudition and education give them access to spells that are normally only the province of clerics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you need a stand-alone savant class for your Old School game? Are you playing a savant and want a quick reference book for the table without having to flip through the entire Players Manual? Curious about Adventures Dark and Deep and want to take a look without diving in all the way? Here's your chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Savant is a complete player class suitable for use with any old-school game. It's an extract from the Adventures Dark and Deep Players Manual, and contains the full class description plus all the spells available to the savant class (including a ton of new spells unique to the class).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you already own the Adventures Dark and Deep Players Manual, you don't technically need this pdf. But it can be pretty handy to have a quick reference guide that gives all the essentials in one place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
