							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grifter: A Game of Cons</name>
									
			<description>Grifter is a fast-paced set building game of bluffing and hand management. Using subtlety, theft and countering, players take on the roles of Grifters operating during the late 1800's hoping to complete the perfect Con before their opponents do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player adopts one of four unique Grifters with special in-game benefits as they try to complete a set of Businesses, Opportunities and Marks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through unrevealed Plot cards attached to these Businesses and Opportunities, players attempt to Bluff their Marks and opponents into completing a set that may or may not be a legitimate enterprise. Through a hand composed of Tricks cards along with these set cards as well as potential allies, or Shills, players have to assemble a Full Monte of cards to walk-away with the winning hand, or be revealed to be nothing more than the Con artist they truly are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
