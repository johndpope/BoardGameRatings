			<description>The City of Angels. Between pervasive evil and countless temptations lurking beneath the city's glittery facade, Los Angeles proves to be the ideal address for a fallen vampire looking to save a few lost souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are souls to be saved during daylight hours and in the dead of night. You have to choose which to save, you cannot win this battle by tryng to save both!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the night approaches you will turn into your alter ego... a vampire. You will have special powers to see what others are not able to see in the day. Make the most of this time, for come the dawn, you will lose these powers, and have more mortal weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By day or night there are souls to be saved and dangers to overcome. But in this game, if you can call it that, you not only have to look out for yourself. But also try to discover what other players are doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only by doing this will you be able to manipulate the game towards its conclusion. For you to be the winner and the saviour of souls!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses a license from the Angel TV series which ran from 1999 to 2004. The series was a spin-off of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mixes Roll and Move, hand management and memory mechanics. Each player has two hands of cards from distinct day and night decks but has limited opportunities to look at them. During the game, players manipulate their decks and decks of their opponents using different actions which are triggered either by landing on action squares or by action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach his starting point with three souls in one hand and none in the other wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
