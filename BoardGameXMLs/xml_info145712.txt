							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Takeover</name>
									
			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, the Rivadis Empire ruled a united continent offering peace and prosperity to its subjects. But then, the necromancers took over and everything changed. The land is now corrupted and dying. It is up to you to unite the Kingdom to its glory once again! Lead one of the three nations, the Duchy of Westaria, the Crimson Horde or the Icedales cult and secure victory. Whichever nation you may choose, Takeover is sure to keep you company for long hours. Build mines for gold, farms for suooly points and obelisks for mana, build a strong army and, region by region, defeat the opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
