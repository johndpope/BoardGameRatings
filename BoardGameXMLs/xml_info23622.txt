			<description>Fielder's Option is now a game!  Like the excellent original, which was developed to instruct young people in the important fundamentals of baseball, this version may also be played alone or with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one has to tell a serious player that a MENTAL MISTAKE can often make the difference between winning and losing a ballgame.  It is for this reason that college and high school students - as well as the recognized professionals - are required to read and memorize play books and study sheets.  They are aware that such activity is just as important to becoming a good ballplayer as knowing how to hit the ball and run the bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fielder's Option is different because it puts the &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; into it.  It generates a sense of competition, which is what baseball is all about.  And when you play Fielder's Option you have the opportunity to learn not only what is requested of you when playing your &amp;quot;favorite&amp;quot; position, but all the other positions as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pete Rose has recommended it.  The creators of Fielder's Option are grateful, for we know there is no better example of a player always being mentally prepared than Pete Rose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
