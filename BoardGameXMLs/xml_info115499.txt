			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You use Power Points or PP to buy powers. Power Points are determined by multiplying your END MSB times ten (END MSB x10). So if a player has a PP of 50, they may spend 50 points to buy powers. It is up to the GM to regulate how powerful your players are. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want them buying a Cosmic power, make sure you make it clear at the beginning of the character creation process. Below is a list of powers Important: Powers are used like skills for the most part. So I someone has a Fire attack they would follow this formula: AGI MSB +Power Level +1d20 You are going to find powers that don&amp;rsquo;t have details for anything above level 10. You may still buy additional levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
