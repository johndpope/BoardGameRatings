							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Background &amp; Details Kit</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every character in the world has some kind of background. Even the lowliest of NPC&amp;rsquo;s have some kind of history to them, although for the most part you will never find out they are descended from the last king of the 5th T&amp;rsquo;ping dynasty (on their grandmothers side) or that they survived the infamous Guld Dare Massacre of &amp;rsquo;87.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part this background &amp;amp; details are decoration, but, they can provide insight as to why a character is acting the way they are&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These can apply to PC&amp;rsquo;s as well as those they encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Background &amp;amp; Details Kit is aimed as players and NPC&amp;rsquo;s from a fantasy setting. Volume 2 will deal with Sci-Fi/Futuristic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
