							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Suomipeli: The game of Finland</name>
									
			<description>In this game you buy shares of Finnish companies, similiar to Monopoly. The companies are divided into colors. Three companies in one colour. Unlike Monopoly, there are no hotels to build. But there are two shares for each company. And when someone stops on a company wich both shares have already been bought they have to pay rent. And the amount of rent is calculated trough how many same colored shares the owner has. For example:&lt;br/&gt; Teollisuuden Voima Oy: &lt;br/&gt;Rent: &lt;br/&gt;1 share 3000,-&lt;br/&gt;2 shares of the same company 8000,-&lt;br/&gt;3 shares of the same colour 8000,-&lt;br/&gt;4 shares of the same colour 10000,-&lt;br/&gt;5 shares of the same colour 13000,-&lt;br/&gt;6 shares of the same colour 15000,-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If two people own a share of a company, both must be paid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game starts players will agree on when to stop. For example after 2 hours or when 2 players have gone bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
