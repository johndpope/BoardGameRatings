			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t remember what came before. Where were you before you woke up here? The store? Buying groceries? The gas station on the way home? Your desk? Your kid&amp;rsquo;s recital? Wait. What is this place? How did you get here? And who are these other people with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There seems to be plenty of air, but no way out. The room is large, almost too large. You&amp;rsquo;ve walked from one end to the other so many times, your legs are tired. But where is this place? Who brought you here? Is there a way out? Is food coming? What&amp;rsquo;s the meaning of this?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve done nothing wrong!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol One-Sheet Series do not include rules, only charts. Each game requires players to own at least one game in the Protocol series, or Protocol Prime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
