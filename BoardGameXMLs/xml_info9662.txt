			<description>Players move their elephant mounted hunting parties about a jungle-hunt themed board by using a spinner that dictates their movement as well as special spaces on the board.  Players are hunting a tiger that moves about randomly on the board through cards drawn by players on their turn.  The player that captures the tiger wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An attractively painted hunting scene on the board makes the game a nice display piece, but gameplay leaves a great deal to be desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
