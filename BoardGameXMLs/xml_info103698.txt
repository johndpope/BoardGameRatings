			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mamoru-kun wa Norowarete Shimatta! is a vertical Shoot 'Em Up (shmup) that is based on the Japanese anime series: Mamoru-kun ni Megami no Shukufuku o! or Venus to Mamoru.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls Mamoru (there are also other characters that can be used). The scrolling in this game is controlled by the player. Thus, the pace of the action will be dictated by the player, which is different from most games in the genre. The player can traverse the screen however they please, but as this is a vertical shooter, there are boundaries set in place by the game. Still, the freedom of movement available in the game is a unique feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other main gameplay feature involves the curse bomb. The player may shoot these bombs to destroy enemy bullets or to curse them and make them stronger, allowing the player the possibility to achieve a higher score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
