Through these innovative and easy-to-play games players master important information about the political and physical geography of the world.  A valuable experience for young and old, novice or expert.  Learningames are unique, informative, and always enjoyable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview of play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to six players sit around the Map Playing Board.  The map may include political centers and/or geographical areas.  In place of the names of the political centers (including cities, states, and nations) and geographical areas (including physical features, regions, and cultural and economic centers) normally found on the map are numbers 1-50.&lt;br/&gt;To begin the game a player draws a Card form the deck.  Each card has the name of a political center or geographical area on one side (Side &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; with the blue background) and a number with important information about the named center or area on the other side (Side &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; with the white background).&lt;br/&gt;In the Basic Game players win cards by locating and naming different political centers or a geographical area on the numbered playing board or by correctly challenging incorrect answers.  When playing the Advanced Games, players master important information about the political centers and geographical areas identified in the basic games.  Players always find Learningames fun, and best of all, they learn about the world around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
