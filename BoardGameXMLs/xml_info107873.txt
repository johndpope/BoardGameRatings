							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corner Chess</name>
									
			<description>Corner Chess is a variant of chess for 2 or 4 players, on an 8x8 board with pieces of increased power (increased mobility for pawns and knight move for minor pieces), with piece starting in the corner.  In the base game a player wins game by capturing any enemy king.  In an advanced variant, players can win by getting their king across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
