			<description>Abbott and Costello, front and center, salt and pepper, Castor and Pollux - QUICK! Get your partner to name these four commonly coupled-up people, places and things. Sound easy? But you'd better be &amp;quot;fast and furious&amp;quot; because it's an &amp;quot;out-and-out&amp;quot; race against time! Guess the pairs before time runs out and score points. Be the player with the highest score at the end of the game and you're the winner, &amp;quot;fair and square!&amp;quot; So gather every &amp;quot;guy and gal&amp;quot; you know and serve up the &amp;quot;chips and dip.&amp;quot; This is one game that won't leave you &amp;quot;high and dry&amp;quot; for excitement! (For 3 to 6 players or teams. Contains 800 &amp;quot;tried and true&amp;quot; pairs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Paired Up: Fame &amp; Fortune&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
