							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tootsietoy Speedway</name>
									
			<description>The only board game I have ever found that was published by Tootsietoy, they were much better known as a toy company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a simple 'spin' a number and move around the track. All squares with instructions must be obeyed. Although the game comes with eight cars, only a maximum of four people can play (the track is only four lanes and each car uses its own lane). First to the finish line, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cars in the set are;&lt;br/&gt;No.1 Stutz Bearcat, white&lt;br/&gt;No.2 Duesenberg Special, gold&lt;br/&gt;o.3 Marmon, yellow&lt;br/&gt;No.4 Packard, red&lt;br/&gt;No.5 Blitzen Benz, green&lt;br/&gt;No.6 Studebaker Champion, silver&lt;br/&gt;No.7 Peugeot Special, orange&lt;br/&gt;No.8 National, lilac&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
