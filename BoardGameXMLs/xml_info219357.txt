							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wearing the Cape: The Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cape (plural capes): literally, a sleeveless garment hanging from the neck over the back and shoulders; figuratively, a superhuman who has chosen to act as a superhero. Synonyms: hero, mask, super, superhero. Connotations: &amp;lsquo;cape&amp;rsquo; is used as both a familiar and derogatory term for superheroes, who often casually refer to themselves as capes but generally consider it a demeaning term when applied to them by the press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barlow&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Superhumans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if the world changed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years ago, everything did. The world we knew ended with The Event and the appearance of hundreds, thousands of superhuman individuals&amp;mdash;ordinary men and women empowered in the blink of an eye, between one breath and the next, transformed or given extraordinary gifts. With this gamebook, you can take on the roll of a superhuman&amp;mdash;a breakthrough&amp;mdash;who has chosen to &amp;ldquo;wear the cape&amp;rdquo; and become a superhero. Or at least come as close to one as you can in a world with legal institutions that are adverse to the idea of super-powered vigilantes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wearing the Cape&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, Marion G. Harmon indie-published Wearing the Cape, a superhero novel. WtC was enthusiastically received by fans looking for good superhero fiction, and it and its six sequels have consistently been ranked in the top of their genre category. The books have introduced Astra, Artemis, and other &amp;quot;capes&amp;quot; to a growing legion of fans. Many of these fans are also avid superhero RPG gamers, who expressed a keen interest in seeing the world of the books given its own sourcebook or gamebook. And so...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wearing the Cape: The Roleplaying Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built on the FATE CORE system by Evil Hat Productions, Wearing the Cape: The Roleplaying Game uses an open system of Aspects, Ratings, and Stunts to describe any conceivable character and superhuman power, as well as organizations, cities, regions, and any kind of environment the heroes may encounter. 220 pages of gamebook, with 30 dense pages of Post-Event World background to provide endless ideas for locations and threats, Wearing the Cape: The Roleplaying Game is a gateway for anyone who wishes to adventure in the world of the novels, or who wishes to make a world of their own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
