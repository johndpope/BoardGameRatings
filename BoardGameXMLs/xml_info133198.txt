			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your character belongs to a group of people who were involved in a certain conflict, a conflict they felt committed to not so long ago. Suddenly they decide to abandon it, fully aware that severe consequences for such an act are imminent. What changed? What was the conflict? Why did the characters leave, and most importantly, did they make the right decision?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing &amp;quot;Bridge Across Eternity&amp;quot; will provide answers to these questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
