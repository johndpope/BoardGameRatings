The book includes a foreword by Lieutenant General Tommy Franks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pair of six-sided dice are required to play this solitaire game which is a variation on the Choose Your Own Adventure game book genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Combat Team, you take on the role of a U.S. Army captain commanding a company-size tank-infantry team in combat. &amp;quot;Combat Team hurls you into the turret of a main battle tank as you command a balanced company team (two M1A2 Abrams tank platoons and two Bradley mechanized infantry platoons) in battle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes several maps and appendices with weapons data and data on the M1A2 Abrams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Antal wrote three books which used this system: Armor Attacks, Infantry Combat, and Combat Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
