			<description>Umakartov&amp;eacute; is experimental take of Ale&amp;scaron; Pilgr on mixing indie music CD and family co-op board game for 2 to 6 players. The game plays exactly 41 minutes; so as long as music CD which comes with game (or it&amp;acute;s other way around?). The players are Umakartov&amp;eacute; (something like home elf) and after the human family goes on holiday, they take over the house and tries solving problems in 12 rooms; like hot iron left on table, milk on stove etc. If they save the house, all players win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you need to do to save the house? Prepare twelve playing fields that correspond to individual rooms. Then shuffle the word cards and give them out among the players. Everyone holds their cards hidden. When you insert a CD into the player and turn on the shuffle mode. The game begins. Youngest player chooses a card and pantomime the word shown. Other players have one attempt to guess words, anyone can guess. Correct guess is the first successful step to avert danger in the room (you put the card in the appropriate room). If guessing is not successful, then take a card in your hand and performs a new word. Words are selected from the songs, so playing song can serve as a hint. You have to guess 5 words for each room. Compositions have a length of about three minutes, that means to guess each word have approximately 20 to 50 seconds. Guessing must be quick, otherwise fail. The entire game fits into a box with music CD.&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;Po zběsil&amp;eacute;m balen&amp;iacute; odj&amp;iacute;žd&amp;iacute; rodina na dovolenou a nevědomky za sebou zanech&amp;aacute;v&amp;aacute; v domě celou řadu mal&amp;eacute;rů, v každ&amp;eacute;m z dvan&amp;aacute;cti pokojů jeden: tu zapnutou žehličku, tu ml&amp;eacute;ko p&amp;aacute;l&amp;iacute;c&amp;iacute; se na plotně&amp;hellip; Je na v&amp;aacute;s &amp;ndash; tajemn&amp;yacute;ch UMAKARTECH, skryt&amp;yacute;ch obyvatel&amp;iacute;ch lidsk&amp;eacute;ho staven&amp;iacute; &amp;ndash; abyste zažehnali v&amp;scaron;echny probl&amp;eacute;my a zabr&amp;aacute;nili nejhor&amp;scaron;&amp;iacute;mu. V&amp;aacute;&amp;scaron; čas je ale omezen &amp;ndash; než dohraje CD! Origin&amp;aacute;ln&amp;iacute; hra spojen&amp;aacute; s poslechem CD skupiny Biorchestr. Zcela nov&amp;eacute; prožit&amp;iacute; poslechu hran&amp;iacute; hry a poslechu CD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
