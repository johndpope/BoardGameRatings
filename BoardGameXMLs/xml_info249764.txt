							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Quest of Thane Tostig</name>
									
			<description>An early set of fantasy miniature tabletop wargame rules which were released in 1977 with an associated set of miniatures. The booklet itself is a 12-page A5 book, typeset with illustrations in black and white with colored card covers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As play progresses certain events are triggered. Combat is resolved through d10 rolls, and uses hit point locations to determine damage, while magic uses a point system and carries a chance of misfiring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scenario was defined within the rules. The hero player was required to raid through woodland and into a small pre-mapped dungeon area with a team of seven miniatures. Meanwhile the evil player had to use his army of eighty orc-like &amp;quot;Sprites&amp;quot; to defend against the heroes incursion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Rulebook: We have devised these rules for use with the Thane Tostig range of fantasy figures designed and produced by Barry Minot, who also drew the illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are intended to give an easy to play, fast moving, fantasy action game, which though ideal for the younger wargamer, will provide a basis on which older wargamers and fantasy fanatics can build, adding as many further complications as their fertile minds may devise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
