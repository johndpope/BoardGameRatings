							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribes: Vengeance</name>
									
			<description>[From the Game Box]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A family in conflict. A galaxy at war. The endless war has begun. The Empire and the Tribes now fight as much over resources as they do for revenge. But when a war spans generations, it becomes a mother's quest to discover the truth about the conflict, and an heir's duty to break free from the cycle of vengeance. Play as multiple characters across two generations of a family at war in the first ever TRIBES single player experience. Physics system seamlessly integrates jet-packing, running, skiing and piloting into one dynamic experience. New weapons and vehicles add to the classic TRIBES arsenal and guarantee a fight like no other. Powered by an enhanced Unreal (tm) engine, stunning visuals take you into a never before seen chapter of TRIBES history. Battle in vast locations from underground caverns and forgotten cities to acid wastelands and mighty coliseums. Join the war online with extensive multiplayer action for up to 32 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
