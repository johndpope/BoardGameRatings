			<description>The game board depicts a cherry pie. On the pie there are flies which are attached to strings held by the players. Each flie is different; wearing different items of clothing. The active player holds a fly swatter and rolls a die (d12). The players whose flies show an item of clothing that was rolled have to pull that fly's string instantly while the active player is trying to swat the fly. A player who was too slow or pulled the wrong string has to give the active player a pie chip. The player with most chips at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
