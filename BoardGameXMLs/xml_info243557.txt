							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beaky and the Egg Snatchers</name>
									
			<description>Cassette Inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beaky belongs to the family of Andromedan Armed Condors, the rare goggled variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numbers of his species are dwindling fast because of their rather foolish choice of breeding ground on the planet Crackit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unfortunately happens to be the home of a particularly evil band of creatures known collectively as the Eggsnatchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their sole malicious intent in life is to extinctify Beaky's species by stealing or destroying eggs by any foul means available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective is to try and brood, hatch out and rear as many little Beakys as possible through 12 different screens of formidable but delightful arcade action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andromeda Condors possess great magical powers but care must be taken for Beaky has only limited reserves of magic and these must be strategically conserved to protect you through the games three main phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beaky is armed with potent magic seeds which he is able to spit out in short rapid bursts. This is his only means of attack against the evil Eggsnatchers and their many adversaries in this epic battle for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
