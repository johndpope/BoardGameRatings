			<description>Chepy is a mini version of Pawn's Shephy solitaire card game. It was released at Tokyo Game Market 2014 as a set of 4 postcards, 3 of which are the Chepy playing cards (6 per postcard) which must be cut out prior to playing. The last card is a double sided rules card. All cards are Japanese language only, unlike the dual language (ENG and JPN) Shephy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are basically the same as Shephy, but scaled down slightly. The player starts with one sheep in their field, and must manage the event cards presented to you in order to accumulate ONE HUNDRED sheep in the field before you go through the deck of event cards three times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sheep deck consists of values 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100; at the start of the game, you place a 1 sheep card in your field, then shuffle the event cards and lay out three cards to form your hand. On a turn, you choose one card, carry out its effect, then refill your hand to three cards. Event cards might duplicate existing sheep cards, add new ones, swap one value of sheep for another, remove sheep, etc. Play through the deck until you have no cards in hand, then shuffle the event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you go through the deck three times without having at least one 100 sheep card in the field or if at any point in the game you have no sheep in the field, then you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
