							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GLARPS: Generic Live-Action Role-Playing System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLARPS attempts to be a generic, universal system that can handle Live-Action Role-Playing in any genre.  The game is run by a Director with one or more Assistants and, depending upon size, a Crew.  GLARPS is run in one or more Sessions (3-8 hours is suggested), with connected Sessions making up a Campaign.  Resolution of opposed actions is done by observed &amp;quot;Rock-Paper-Scissors&amp;quot;, as the game is strictly &amp;quot;no contact&amp;quot; in nature.  Uncontested actions use a check against a Difficulty Level.  Combat uses a fairly complex method which allows for gradual accumulation of wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have up to 21 Stats (depending on genre) with Points in each Stat ranging from 1 to 4.  The Stats are:  Art, Athletics, Combat, Computing, Connections, Crafts, Driving, Enigmas, Linguistics, Magic, Medicine, Perception, Physique, Security, Science, Stealth, Subterfuge, Survival, Technology, Wealth, and Willpower.  A Point of 1 indicates no training while 4 indicates exceptional ability.  Within a Stat, Specialization may be allowed.  Characters also may have Advantages (Common Sense, Fast Learner, etc.) and Disadvantages (Arrogance, Migraines, etc.).  Characters may gain Experience which can be used to improve Points in Stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
