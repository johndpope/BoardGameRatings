			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic idea is that each player takes on the role of a scholar, from before scholarly pursuits became professionalized (or possibly after they ceased to be). You are cranky, opinionated, prejudiced and eccentric. You are also collaborating with a number of your peers &amp;mdash; the other players &amp;mdash; on the construction of an encyclopedia describing some historical period (possibly of a fantastic world).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 26 turns, one for each letter of the alphabet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
