			<description>Gravitas is the game that gets people thinking and talking again.  The game is simple; there is no board, no tokens, and no dice.  It is a game of questions and discoveries with no right or wrong answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are life questions and deeper philosophical questions,&amp;rdquo; says the creator Alan Gratias. &amp;ldquo;The game gives us permission to reveal ourselves by answering questions we have never been asked before.&amp;rdquo;  For example, one card picked at random asks the following: How much is enough? What do you wish your mother understood about you?  Who is riding in your sidecar?  These questions and 426 others make up the inquisitive game of Gravitas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are straightforward. The player with the birthday closest to the date of play asks the first question. The opening questioner selects any card and picks one of three questions. Each player answers that question.  Then the questioner decides which player has the best answer and awards that person the card.  The first person to win three cards in a short game, or five in a long game, is the winner or the &amp;lsquo;Gravitarg&amp;rsquo; of the occasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravitas is available online at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gravitasthegame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.gravitasthegame.com&lt;/a&gt; and retails for $39.95.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
