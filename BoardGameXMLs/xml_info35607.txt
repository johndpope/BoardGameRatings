							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Desert Fox</name>
									
			<description>Desert Fox is a Division/Regiment/Battalion level simulation of the war for Egypt and Libya from Sept 1940 to January 1943. There are three mini-games and one long campaign game which the rules state &amp;quot;It is very lengthy and is recommended for fanatics only, or those with time to spare&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a bright desert yellow 44&amp;quot; x 15&amp;quot; five colour map. There are about 300 playing pieces, 123 of which are actual combat units and the rest are markers. The markers are used to show a units combat changing strength as the the units only have a movement rate printed on them. The rules are only 8 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a very interesting sequence of play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impulse 1 - The Allied player moves all units as desired then conducts attacks against any adjacent Axis unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impulse 2 - The Axis player may move all of his units as desired but may NOT attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impulse 3 - The Allied player moves all units as desired. Once moved he may then conduct attacks with any unit that did not attack in impulse 1 against any adjacent Axis unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impulse 4 -  The Axis player moves all units as desired then conducts attacks against any adjacent Allied unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impulse 5 - The Allied player may move all of his units as desired but may NOT attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impulse 6 - The Axis player moves all units as desired. Once moved he may then conduct attacks with any unit that did not attack in impulse 1 against any adjacent Allied unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You repeat process this three times to complete each month of time. In the campaign game taking 28 months that's 504 impulses over 84 turns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supply as ever is important in the desert with the Axis having to keep track of &amp;quot;Stores&amp;quot; to supply attacks and &amp;quot;Issues&amp;quot; to supply movement of motorized units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
