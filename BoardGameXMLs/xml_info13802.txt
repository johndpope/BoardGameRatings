Along the boundaries of each sector are printed Time Factor Numbers.  These numbers indicate the movement cost to a military unit crossing the boundary from one  sector on the opposite side of the Time Factor Number.  The higher the number, the greater the movement cost.  The movement costs also relate to the terrain features on the map, representing their effect on movement.  Finally, note that diagonal movement costs more than horizontal or vertical movement, because greater distances are involved.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other words, the map consists of squares with the cost to cross a side or corner of the map printed on the boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each sector (square) measures 500 yards.  Each turn represents 20 minutes.  Game length is 16 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units represent company sized units.  Infantry has a an attack range of 1 sector.  Armor has an attack range of 3 sectors.  Artillery has a direct fire range of 2 sectors or indirect fire range of 5 sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequence of play is IGO-UGO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game length is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules also contain a &amp;quot;Solitaire Rules&amp;quot; section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
