							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le Malefice des Atlantes</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third installment in the adventure of the Ka. This time our hero is sent underwater. Gameplay hasn't changed: collect objects, evade or destroy enemies, find ways around traps. The back of the box says (translated from French):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ever since the dawn of time two mythical realms are at war on the bottom of the oceans: the kingdom of Neptune and the Atlantean continent. Rumor has it the Atlanteans are winning, and the equilibrium maintained by the Sea God is in danger of being broken... Storms, tornadoes, tsunamis and global destruction would be the result! Only a series of challenges would save Neptune from his inaction, but none of the Neptunian champions has succeeded yet. Amphytrite, the bride of the king, decide to call upon Karl Adrix, whose fame has reached the bottom of the seas. Will he succeed where the fish-men have failed?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
