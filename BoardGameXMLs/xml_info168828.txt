							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Aliens: The Kassars</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close Encounters of the Mythic Kind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re encountering them on a distant planet in a far-off nebula, or they&amp;rsquo;ve come to you, and are abducting innocent villagers for nefarious purposes, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like a strange, alien race to help breathe some life into your galaxy&amp;mdash;and your game. Some Pathfinder products have even explored the idea of alien life in the past, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly true that many aberrations could serve as alien creatures in a pinch. But there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that Pathfinder aliens have never been until now, and that is&amp;hellip;mythic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the Kassars, a race of lizard-like humanoids who hail from the planet Kassar V. Tough and cunning, through strength of arms and subtle manipulation the Kassar people have managed to become a dominant force throughout much of the galaxy. Indeed, their reach extends far further than most realize, as the mythically gifted kassar secret society known as the Sla&amp;rsquo;hert have been using their impressive shapeshifting powers in order to infiltrate and control governments big and small in total secrecy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
