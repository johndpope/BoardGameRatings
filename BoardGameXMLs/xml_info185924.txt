			<description>Each player owns six pieces of heights 1, 2 or 3. The objective of the game is to move the pieces thus the pieces of same height are in orthogonal adjacency. A single piece may move exactly as many steps in any direction as it is high. As soon as a piece is adjacent to an other piece it loses its own movement but may only move as far as one of the neighbours induces by its height.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
