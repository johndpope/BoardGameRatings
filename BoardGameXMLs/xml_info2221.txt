			<description>Each player starts with three pawns on his home space.  To move a pawn out to the home space's exit space, a 1 or 6 must be rolled.  On each die throw, a single pawn is moved.  Upon landing on a starred space, you roll again; on a 1 or 6, you move to the central circle from whence you may exit to any starred space on a later turn.  You clobber enemy pawns by landing on them --they're sent back to their home space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to place his pawns on their arrival spaces (by exact count).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The board consists of a three-lobed track; it touches the central star circle at its three innermost points.  The player home/start spaces are arrayed around the outside of the track, whilst the ending circles are inside the track (but each uses an outer circle's exit space as its entry space).  The inner circles are all made up of three different-coloured arrival spaces; the distribution is such that each player must reach the last three circles of a full circuit to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A member of the Parcheesi family of board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
