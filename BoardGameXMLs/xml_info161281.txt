			<description>If you liked the original Crosscountry USA, you and your students will love this new, updated version of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your geography classroom becomes a real American adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students 'drive' an 18-wheel truck around the country picking up and delivering a variety of commodities. As they travel between any of 203 cities, they'll learn valuable skills including problem solving, map reading and decision making. On-screen maps, GPS navigation and a compass allow students to learn directions and plan the most efficient route. Students learn time management, decide when to eat and sleep, and watch road conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photographs of cities, famous places, and landmarks add a visual dimension to the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher's Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
