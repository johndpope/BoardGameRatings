							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jail of Gundavold</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jail of Gundavold is a scenario designed for a solo player but adjustable enough for a party size if needed. After a foray into the wilderness Ruins of Borgdell, you found yourself ambushed with a bag tossed over your head. After a grueling trek across uncertain terrain you find yourself in jail. Are you smart enough to get yourself out of this mess?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not your typical dungeon crawl and should be careful read a few times before attempting to run it. While no DM (or author) can cover every idea a player comes up with, multiple avenues have been addressed in this offering. Remember creativity should be rewarded appropriately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a lower level solo adventurer and DM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
