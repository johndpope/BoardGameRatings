			<description>Players move around the board and are able to buy ranches. Each ranch differs in cost and maximum capacity of cattle. When player buys ranch, he is also able to buy some cattle. Each time player will pass the ranch again the cattle number will double, until it will reach the maximum number. When player stops on ranch, he/she may take some cattle and bring to town to sell (if he will take all cattle, he will have to sell ranch since ranch cannot be left without cattle). However, since each time cattle doubles, it is better to wait until it grows. But, yet again, you may not step on a ranch for a long time later; so, you may loose cattle if number will reach maximum. Also, you may steal other players&amp;rsquo; cattle by stepping on their ranches. If you do so, you will have to reach town without being captured by the player you stole cattle from. Players, if their cattle is stolen, can chase thieves not only through ordinary routes, but also through cutaways, however if he will use them, he could lose ability to step on his ranches and take cattle to town for sell. If thief is captured, he must give cattle to owner and pay fine. Each robbed ranch is automatically sold to bank and could be bought again. If player steps on casino, he/she could play for money. Player could then bid money and roll die. If it rolls 1, 3 or 5, player looses money. If it rolls 2, 4 or 6 he takes his money back and also the same amount of money from bank. The game automatically ends after 60 minutes; so, it has to be played with clock or chronometer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was released by Azar in Lithuania and could be unknown elsewhere. However, it is in Wild West style so uses English board and ranch names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
