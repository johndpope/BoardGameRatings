							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nor&#039;ever</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come one, come all, see the sights of the afterlife!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden in the fog is the way to Nor&amp;rsquo;ever, a bog where all the broken and discarded fountains of the world gather and lay of all eternity; forever sinking into the ground.  With it come the unfulfilled wishes and rejected sacrifices made to the water spirits of old.  The bog is home to the lost, the trapped and the imprisoned.    Inhabited by the bog wraiths, illusions and sinkholes, the bog seeks to muddle and confuse the weary into submitting to the murk below.  A tyrannical god fountain, known only as the Nor&amp;rsquo;ever, draws spooks from the Great Beyond to engage in its cruel games and impossible puzzles.  Unlike most hosts, Nor&amp;rsquo;ever plays for keeps and the only escape is to beat it at its own game.  There is an underlining motive for the god fountain.  Whatever its true intent, it is likely to rock the Great Beyond when it comes to its fruition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
