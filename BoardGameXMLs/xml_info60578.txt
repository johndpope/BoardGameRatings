							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragons: An Adventure Into Middle Earth</name>
									
			<description>Dragons is a two player game in which each player leads an expedition composed of men, hobbit, dwarves, elves, and wizards, in search of treasure in an ancient and unexplored dungeon: full of goblins, trolls, and other generally nasty things similar to those found in the Mines of Moria. The dungeon changes from game to game, indeed from turn to turn, with each player building the dungeon as he goes along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three different levels that can be played each with different sets of victory conditions: &lt;br/&gt;- The first is called &amp;lsquo;In Search of Gold&amp;rsquo;. In this system, the first player to get out of the dungeon with 2000 or more gold pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;- The second set of victory conditions is called &amp;lsquo;The One Great Ring&amp;rsquo;. The first player to have a character leave the board through his opponents starting edge with the Ring wins.&lt;br/&gt;- The third version of Dragon is called &amp;lsquo;The Lonely Mountain&amp;rsquo;.  In this game, the first player to kill Smaug the Dragon wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
