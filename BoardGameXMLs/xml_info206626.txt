			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daydream Dungeon is a single-player dungeon crawl played entirely with a single piece of paper, a 6-sided die, and a pencil. A key feature is that the game requires no erasing, so once an adventure is completed, the player can see every action they took on the page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by designing a character using the games five skills, Dexterity, Ranged, Endurance, Accumen and Melee. Purchase equipment, and then set off to fight or outwit a dungeon full of monsters, finally clashing with the boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players track their movement through the dungeon on a 5x6 grid. Upon entering a room, roll a die, add your depth, and look up the resulting number in the Bestiary. This can reveal anything from a chest full of loot, to a deadly trap, to a terrifying monster. Once they know what they're dealing with, players can choose how they want to deal with the situation. A roguish character may want to sneak past, or even risk pickpocketing a monster. A stronger character might simply choose a direct attack. A magically attuned character might try casting a charm spell. Each of these actions are performed using a single die roll, and players get a bonus based on thier character's statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes a player might not be able to play to their strengths, such as an archer running out of arrows, or a swordsman fighting a flying enemy. Fortunately they can use a variety of magical potions to help even the odds, though it's probably best to try them before you need them, since the first time you try a potion of a given colour, you don't know what it will do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
