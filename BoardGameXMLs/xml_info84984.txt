			<description>The game consists of cards numbered 1-12 in two colors. Each of the players receives a stack of cards and places it in front of him/her without looking at the cards, plus five hand cards. The top card of the personal stack is flipped open.&lt;br/&gt;The active player can play a card with number one to the middle of the table or a card that is one point higher on any card already open in the middle, as long as it has the same color. At the end of the move, a card from the hand has to be put onto a personal discard stack (of which each player has up to four), but only one number can be into any given stack. Cards from all stacks can also be played to the central stacks.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to get rid of one's original card stack first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
