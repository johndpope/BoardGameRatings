			<description>Operation Blast is a game of economic and military strategy, playing with cards. You are president of a small republic at war with its neighbors. Thanks to the financial resources you have, you can afford the services of foreign powers to fight the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your territory, such as your enemies is divided into 10 provinces, materialized by tokens. In different ways, you can destroy your enemies provinces, they can destroy yours, you can rebuild, and they also. When a player's 10 provinces are destroyed, it is eliminated. The last player to have at least one province has won the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the money, there are four types of cards: the production units, combat units, units of action and events. These units belong to foreign powers grouped into five categories: United States, Europe, Eastern Countries, Asia and Arab countries. Depending on the money you have, you can afford the services of these units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat units, such as production units, are placed on the territory of the player. For that, each time he places a card, he must pay the recruitment fee or purchase price, either by using profits from its production, either with cash it may have on hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit can only move once per turn. They can either join a production unit to support his defense, or to regroup them (maximum 3 units can be grouped ) or go to war: for this, the player must pay the travel expenses, and the unit then join the combat zone, a &amp;quot;no man's land&amp;quot; in the center of the table. When your opponent has no more unity in the combat zone or to protect his territory , each time you attack him, your attack will destroy a province...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
