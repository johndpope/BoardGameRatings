			<description>Adapt is a highly strategic survival card game where you take on not only the environment, but your closest friends. Players take turns facing challenges on the island, exploring, hunting, and deciding when to betray the other players all while they are hunting down the precious relics to win the game. You can avoid dangerous misadventures by collecting and holding onto the right supplies, like the fanny pack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each player's turn, they must draw an action card that they must play..the island gives them no choice! Players then take turns rolling a 4-sided die for the actions they can perform. During their turn they can choose from 5 different actions: Gathering, Exploring, Stealing, Attacking, or playing a card's action from their hand! To perform these actions, the player must roll the 20-sided die and get a 10 or higher (for attacking, gathering, or exploring) to be successful, or a 15 or higher for stealing! As the game progresses, the players must collect all three relics and keep hold of all 3 to win! It's either holding the relics, or be the last survivor standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
