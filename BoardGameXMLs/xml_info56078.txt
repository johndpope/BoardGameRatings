							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maze of the Riddling Minotaur</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a long time you have heard legends about the Island of Vacros; when you were only a child, the stories about evil minotaurs were used to scare you into behaving. Now you are grown, and you no longer believe children's stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But King Trueon of Cathos is worried: his daughter Princess Lydora has been kidnapped, and he has found clues that she has been taken to the ancient and evil island of Vacros. You have heard rumors tht a large and dangerous mazework lies beneath the surface of this island&amp;mdash;a mazework that is guarded by false minotaurs. Of course many rumors are false, but then again ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maze of the Riddling Minotaur is the second in a series of invisible ink modules: using the invisible ink pen included in this module, you may play the adventure by yourself. After you have played the solo version, you have not used up the module: instructions are provided as to how you may change the solo version into an exciting group adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module was retroactively re-coded as MSOLO2 to distinguish it from the later M2 Vengeance of Alphaks. No printings ever featured this new code, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
