			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time there was a quest to find the legendary but lost time machine. We want to return to our home dimension. It is too hard on Earth trying to use our knowledge &amp;amp; resources positively. Earthlings just don't get it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All living things are connected in very deep ways. No one is an island by themselves. When something good is done, everyone gains &amp;amp; when something harmful is done, we all lose out, with more troubles &amp;amp; a loss of precious life force. This game thus nurtures imagination, listening, self-expression, collaboration &amp;amp; clear thinking, using a story-telling format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is science fictional, the issues everyday &amp;amp; real, tackled with role-playing, values discussions, dialogging, problem solving as well as creative writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adaptable to any group situation. Lots of replay value!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
