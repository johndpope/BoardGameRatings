			<description>&amp;ldquo;Only remain slaves those who are afraid to die&amp;rdquo; - Zumbi dos Palmares&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Palmares, 2 to 4 players impersonate local chiefs of the Quilombo dos Palmares, a community of villages formed by runaway black slaves, spread out in the interior of Brazil. It grew so large as to become the biggest symbol of resistance to slavery in the Americas during the XVI and XVII centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frequent parties were sent to destroy Palmares, but always succumbed to their guerilla tactics. Palmares was only defeated after the largest army to date in the colonies was assembled to vanquish it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your job is to try to set another ending to this story. As a village chief, on each of the 8 turns you will secretly allocate your villagers among the 5 possible actions: hunt for food, harvest wood, raid farms, build structures and pray for the Orishas. Then you reveal what you did and compare with the other players, action by action. If you allocated more villagers than the other players, you'll get more benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware of the attacking parties that each turn come closer to Palmares. When they attack, all players should be ready to defend collectively, or you may have your village sacked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
