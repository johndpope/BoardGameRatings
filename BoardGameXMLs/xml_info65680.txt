			<description>Art history students will classify paintings by period or artist. Using a card showing a piece of art, students will match it to another card with a picture of the same period or artist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the format of the card game &amp;quot;UNO.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;Each card will contain a picture of a piece of art from one of four periods. Students will use cards from periods that are close together in time and style. The following periods could be used: Realism, Cubism, Impressionism, and Surrealism. Each card has an ID number that students may use at certain times to find information about the picture. &lt;br/&gt;To win, the player must get rid of all cards in his or her hand. Point values for the cards will be higher for the most recent works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
