			<description>The Official Game of the Saskatchewan River Basin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of Moopher begins in a gopher burrow beside a river. One day the curious gopher met a moose.  They spent the day together nibbling on plants and sharing stories.  The gopher was curious about the mountains the moose talked about and he wanted to go there.  The moose said it was too dangerous.  The gopher asked why the moose was not afraid.  The moose replied that he had antlers to protect him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That night the gopher dreamed about seeing the mountains. He even dreamed he grew a set of antlers. When he woke up he had an idea.  He took the antlers from a plastic deer and taped them to his head.  His friend the moose saw him and said &amp;quot;You are the size of a gopher but have antlers like a moose.  You must be a Moopher!&amp;quot;  Together they traveled to the mountains.  One day Moopher met a trout.  The trout told Moopher that all rivers run to the sea.  When Moopher heard about the sea, he said good-bye to his friends and set off on his amazing journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts on a leaf that marks the headwaters of a river.  There are three ways to help Moopher move.  Each space on the board is numbered.  To move ahead one space, the player must roll the exact number needed on three dice.  If one die is the exact number needed, or any of the dice can be added to get the right number, the player moves.  The player can also choose to play a memory game with cards or answer a river question.  The first player to move their token into Hudson Bay is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
