			<description>How well do you really know your friends? Have fun finding out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Thing Bad Thing is a turn-based voting game with a bit of an edge. Each player has five Opinion Cards in their hand (Fantastic Thing, Good Thing, Who Cares, Bad Thing, and Terrible Thing). These cards are exactly the same for each player, and will be used to express how the players feel about certain topics in the Illustration Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, as the active player, you will draw the top card from the Illustration Deck, and place it, face up, next to the Illustration Deck. Once the top Illustration Card has been revealed, you must decide which one of your five Opinion Cards best represents how you feel about the Illustration Card revealed. Whichever card you choose, place it secretly, face down, on the table in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, the inactive players attempt to decide which Opinion Card you chose to play, by selecting one of their five Opinion Cards, and placing it face down in front of them. Once all of the players have selected their &amp;ldquo;vote&amp;rdquo; and have placed their chosen Opinion Cards face down on the table, all of the chosen cards are revealed for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no other players chose your opinion correctly, no one earns points. If at least one other player chose your opinion correctly, as the active player, you gain one point. If at least half of the other players chose correctly, you get two points. And if all of the other players chose correctly, you earn three points, as the active player. Inactive players who chose correctly gain one point.Using the Score Track, and the Player Tokens you and the inactive players adjust your scores accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once scoring is complete, your turn is over, and play continues to the player on your left. This clockwise turn progression continues until one or more players reach 16 points. The first player(s) to reach 16 points wins the game. If the active player is involved in a tie for victory, they always win. Otherwise victory is shared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
