			<description>Translation from the back of the box - from Norwegian:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dare to double? Who will be the leader?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the success from NRK (Norwegian Public TV) in your livingroom! Just as when Dan B&amp;oslash;rge Aker&amp;oslash; askes questions on NRK, there is more than just knowledge that counts - you also have to control the game. Exploit the team's combined expertise and pick the right leader. Choose whether you want to change question or double the bet. Are you on the best quiz team in the room?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the friends or the whole family: Two or three teams are asked fascinating questions in general knowledge. They get cryptic hints on what each question is about, and have to choose how hard they want to bet on how well the team knows the theme. Occasionally the questions will - to laughter and surprise - be about something completly different than what the players expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quiz for everybody: The board game is ingeniously created, which makes the expert quizzer and the more normally knowledgeable may compete at the same level; as team mates or as opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
