			<description>THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game a moderator hands out a role card to each player, assigning them to either a small team of informed werewolves, who know each others identities, or uninformed villagers, who do not know any player identities. The game then alternates in phases of &amp;ldquo;night&amp;rdquo;, in which werewolves agree to covertly kill a villager, and &amp;ldquo;day&amp;quot;, in which villagers debate the identities of the werewolves and vote to kill a suspect. Play continues until all of the werewolves have been killed, or until the werewolves outnumber the villagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CARDS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are NO DUPLICATES in the Werewolf House deck of 37 different character cards. Each card features a unique, full color character illustration, so even after dozens of game rounds players will still be discovering new art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CORE CARDS - The base version of the game can be played by 7-12 people, using 6-10 basic villager cards and 1-2 werewolf cards - all included in the Werewolf House deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVANCED CARDS - It&amp;rsquo;s fun to mix it up. Dozens of characters with unique abilities have been carefully curated to add complexity to the gameplay, without burdening the moderator with messy role management tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
