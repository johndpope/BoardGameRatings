			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many ways, Home Sweet Home is a traditional role-playing game. It employs a [Game Master] and players. It uses an interesting and relatively unusual resolution system&amp;mdash;but not a unique one. In actual play, it will occasionally look and feel quite similar to a session of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. With one key exception. The game focuses on the importance of faith. In most role-playing games, character &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; is literal, where the character is retired because he is, say, slain in a battle with a great beast. In Home Sweet Home, a character is retired when&amp;mdash;and only when&amp;mdash;he loses his faith. Characters don&amp;rsquo;t have hit points or some analog; they have a measure of faith that can rise or deplete as circumstances dictate. This subtle distinction can have a profound impact on play. Things that cause great concern in most role-playing games might become trivial. Conversely, a simple off-hand comment might have grave implications. By shifting the focus of character survival from the physical to the spiritual, a unique game experience results. Interestingly, this phenomenon is highlighted by the otherwise similar structure of play. The dissonance highlights the distinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exceptional game presents a well-developed and internally consistent setting that supports the game focus on the characters' internal belief system.  Character Attributes - Scripture, Creed, etc. - focus on character belief.  Opposed action resolution uses opposed (small) dice pools with the highest non-tie result determining the winner.  Each player should have one distinctive die (which plays a special role).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
