							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Monastery of the Dragon Sons</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the Player Characters is ordered by his family to visit a family member who has not contacted his house for several years. He became a member of the Sons of the Dragon, a monastic order specialising in a martial art emphasising dragon-like moves and dragon-inspired weapons. However, once the party arrives at the monastery (situated in the Province of the Red-Gloved Daimyo) they find out, that Wing Lang (the relative) has disappeared 4 years ago on a quest into the great crater nearby. The monks seem to be extremely reluctant to talk about this matter and more than willing to see the PCs off. Many of them seem ill or have physical handicaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
