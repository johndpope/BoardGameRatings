							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Summerland (Revised and Expanded Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time is now. The world has changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised and expanded edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Event brought the Sea of Leaves into our world, an immense forest that choked cities and drowned civilisation overnight. From the trees came the Call, a lure to the weak that decimated the population. In the aftermath only pockets of humanity remain, resisting the woods' siren song. In the endless forests lurk the Lost &amp;ndash; whose wills were drowned by the Call &amp;ndash; and the Wild, who have forgotten they were ever human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of a select few who can resist the Call. A Drifter, hardened to the lure of the woods by the scars of the past, you cannot let go. Your torment shields you, but drives your isolation. More than anything you crave welcome in a community, but can never be truly accepted without leaving behind your past. To do that, you must confront and defeat the demons that haunt you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What will you risk for redemption?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
