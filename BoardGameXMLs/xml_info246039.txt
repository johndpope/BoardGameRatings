			<description>Scrollhammer 2nd Edition is a miniatures wargame with a setting derived from the Elder Scrolls media franchise.  It is notably distinct from Scrollhammer because Scrollhammer 2nd Edition uses a completely original move and combat system.  The game has gone through repetitive playtest/revision cycles, leading to numerous (iterative) versions, each published as a static PDF from 2013 through 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scrollhammer 2nd Edition focuses primarily on squad-based skirmishing where opposing players control a force composed of individual units, each unit represented on the play surface by a model.  Each model has a corresponding data card.  Scenarios may use either pre-determined setup or a deployment zone method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models should conform to a 25mm standard; the play surface is assumed to be flat (terrain is indicated but not created).  Distance and movement are performed in &amp;quot;inches&amp;quot;, determined by tape measure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is divided into two half-turns, one for each player.  Initiative determines which player acts first.  During each turn, every model may take two Actions (during the controlling player phase) and take one Reaction (during the opposing player phase).  Attacks may be made on any other model that is in range and which is in &amp;quot;line of sight&amp;quot; of the attacker.  Attacks and other opposed situations are resolved by a modified six-sided die roll.  Attacks may destroy, disable, or partially disable the target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rules cover command influence, cover, missile and thrown weapons, dual-wielding combat weapons, blast attacks, and so forth.  The game utilizes a magic system as an organic component; magical effects are circumscribed and are &amp;quot;low powered&amp;quot; in scope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios use a pre-determined victory condition and play proceeds until the condition is achieved.  Many pre-built units are presented in the rules (custom unit creation is supported but complex).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
