							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lords of Waterdeep: Skullport expansion</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Skullport Module&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skullport&amp;mdash;also known as the Port of Shadow&amp;mdash;is nestled in the heart of Undermountain, deep below the streets of Waterdeep. It is a haven for nefarious crimes, underhanded deals, and back-alley murders. Those who visit Skullport do so at their own peril, for around every corner are new ways to make people disappear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Skullport module includes a new resource: Corruption. Unlike Adventurers and Gold, having Corruption in your tavern penalizes you at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Corruption token in your Tavern at the end of the game is worth negative Victory Points. The exact negative value depends on how much Corruption has been collected throughout the game; the more corrupt you and your fellow Lords are, the more Corruption hurts your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
