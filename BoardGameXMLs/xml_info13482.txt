							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baretta: The Street Detective Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on 70s TV show. The game board has an outer ring of spaces (like Monopoly) and paths leading to a center space (the Hideout) where the Baretta pawn starts. Each player selects a criminal that he wants Baretta to catch and takes its matching Baretta Captures card. The deck of cards is then shuffled and a card is placed on all the outer ring spaces (except the corner Location spaces). The remaining cards are then dealt to the players who then shuffle in their Baretta Captures card to the cards they received to form their own draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player rolls the dice and moves Baretta in any one direction the amount rolled. If he lands on a space with a card, he turns the card over and follows the directions (usually moving him an extra amount of spaces or to a specific location). If he lands on an outer ring space without a card, the player draws the top card from his pile, looks at it, places it on the empty space, and marks it with a token of his color. Eventually players will start placing their Baretta Captures cards on the board and the first player to move Baretta onto his Capture card wins. So players are constantly trying to move the Baretta pawn away from cards marked by opponents and towards their own capture cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
