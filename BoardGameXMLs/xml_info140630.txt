							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Command Line</name>
									
			<description>Command Line is a table top game where players take command of vast robot armies and battle across a system of planets. The board is made up of many different planets currently inhabited by biological lifeforms. Each players starts with their own planet, some units, and some generators. As generators produce more units and currency, you will expand to different plants and destroy the inhabitants. Currency can be used to buy upgrades, more generators, and tech cards. Tech cards allow you to modify the moves you take, some will even give you the power to destroy entire planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game of pure strategy; there are no dice rolls, random card draws, or any form of luck. Combat is resolved with a calculation of attack and defensive power, and these powers can be improved throughout the game. By the end of this war, armies will spread across the system, devastate their opponents forces, and even destroy planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
