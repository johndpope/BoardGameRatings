			<description>The challenge was to create a game that uses all the worst bits of many of the bad games that Flip the Table regularly disparage, including roll-and-play (&amp;quot;Surprise!&amp;quot;) and press-your-luck games, but especially Monopoly because @tableflipsyou actually likes Monopoly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game essentially consists of players bidding for turn order, with payments paid to subsequent players, with the added complication of the need for money to be exchanged due to restricted access to various denominations. This is followed by choice of a variety of dice movement strategies, in order to arrive back at GO! with exactly $200 (no more, no less).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During movement, if two players arrive at the same square a variant of SNAP (The BANCE! action) allows for players to steal one another's money. NOTE: The game is deliberately complex and there is a strong possibility that it will last for a long time, depending on whether players have realised that it is intended to be torturous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
