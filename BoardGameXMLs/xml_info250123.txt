							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">20 Hallucinations 2</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From time to time you will find a player character having a hallucination or two. Sometimes it's from bad liquor or a drug slipped into their food, other times its the result of a magical spell, the spores of a toxic cave fungus, or the side affect of a foul monster's venom. Regardless of the cause, the player is likely to want to know exactly what the hallucination is like.&lt;br/&gt;This product contains twenty brief but adequately detailed hallucinations for the GM to quickly roll up and use. Some hallucinations may cause audible and/or visual delusions, others may affect taste, smell, and touch. Many of the delirious delusions in this product affect multiple senses at once.&lt;br/&gt;Twenty Hallucinations is carefully designed to work with any role playing game setting, from fantasy to sci-fi to modern to historical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
