			<description>From Publisher's Web Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The long hours on the road have left you yearning for a good night&amp;rsquo;s rest at your favorite way station. Decent food, a clean bed and live entertainment have never sounded so good &amp;ndash; especially so with those storm clouds looming on the horizon, mounting winds and periodic raindrops heralding some fouler weather to come. The warm glow of a fire and a hot meal will be welcome, but where is the wait staff?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dusk of the Dead is a new HackMaster adventure featuring a variety of challenges designed for four to six 5th to 7th level player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailing a haunted location off the beaten path, Dusk of the Dead may be used by itself as a stand-alone one-shot adventure or easily placed anywhere in the wilderness of an ongoing campaign. Located in the wilderness near Frandor&amp;rsquo;s Keep, just off the Borderland Road, Dusk of the Dead may also be employed as a follow-on for characters completing the Frandor&amp;rsquo;s Keep mini-campaign and/or as an add-on or segue into the Mines of Chaos series of adventures. The adventure contains a myriad of hooks and ideas for introducing players to the scenario as well as follow-on integration for on-going play with Frandor&amp;rsquo;s Keep, the local towns of Vew and Sabden, as well as direct connections to the City-State of P&amp;rsquo;Bapar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
