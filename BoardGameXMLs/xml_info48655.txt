			<description>Connectomy is the hilarious game of connecting anatomy.  Players earn points by correctly performing the connections described on the Connectomy cards, with the help of different partners.  As the connections build, so does the FUN!  Nothing is more fun than watching your friends going through hilarious contortions except... attempting them yourself.  Nothing is more fun than Connectomy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
