			<description>OBJECT OF GAME: The player to make the last legal move wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;START: Make two piles of l1 stones. Each player rolls the die. Whoever rolls the highest value makes the first&lt;br/&gt;move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY: Each player starts his/her turn by flipping a coin. If the coin lands heads up then the turn must be TAKO&lt;br/&gt;HI. And if the coin lands tails up the turn must be TAKO LO. TAKO HI and TAKO LO affect how many stones&lt;br/&gt;the player can remove from each pile in this turn. Then the player rolls the die and makes note of the value. Next&lt;br/&gt;the player must make a legal move. Legal moves consist of:&lt;br/&gt;1. Taking any number of stones from one pile.&lt;br/&gt;2. Taking an equal number of stones from both piles.&lt;br/&gt;3. Using an option move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE DESIGNER SAYS: As far as I can recall this is the first game I created that I actually committed to paper. I believe I created this game in 1992 or 1993. Based loosely on a mathematical game called Tsianshidsi, TAKO is a silly time wasting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the rules sheet, TAKO is pronounced take-o.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full Rules Here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://gnomegaming.com/ourgames&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://gnomegaming.com/ourgames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
