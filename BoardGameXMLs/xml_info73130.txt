			<description>CAPITAN is a new concept of Napoleonic simulation game, which can be played by both the neophyte and the Napoleonic &amp;ldquo;grognards&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you do not have figures we can endeavour you to build your own small units, if you already have them congratulations (28mm, 25mm or 15mm. no problem with the scale or the basing system), you have infinite game possibilities with CAPITAN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not think CAPITAN is a &amp;ldquo;skirmish&amp;rdquo; game, it is a game system based on the infinity of battles during the Napoleonic wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAPITAN is a selection of rules designed to play battles between small groups of troops, such as advance recognition, convoy escort, guerrilla actions, raids on small towns, border posts, incursions into enemy territory, actions against advanced camps, and all those situations where specific tasks were assigned to a few troops of their units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The troops&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most cases these clashes included small combination of infantry and cavalry, where the training and preparation of the troops was important, unlike the big battles where the big formation groups and the way they were formed was very important (column, line, square, etc.). The gameplay is frenetic and highly addictive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
