			<description>the sequel to Another Code: Two Memories (known as Trace Memory in North America). Unlike its predecessor, the game has not been released in North America and Australia.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of her summer holiday 16 year old Ashley, now an aspiring musician, receives an invitation from her father Richard, who has always been curiously distant towards his daughter. He has been absent as he took over from Ashley&amp;rsquo;s mother to work tirelessly on a memory control system known only as Another, the cause of her mother&amp;rsquo;s death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to cement their bond following his protracted disappearance Richard left Ashley to be brought up by her aunt father and daughter are to spend a weekend together at Lake Juliet, a camping resort. But, as the game begins to unfold, Ashley discovers that there are a series of mysteries surrounding Lake Juliet. The intrigue deepens as she realizes she has been to this resort before she has a dim memory of being here just before her mother died 13 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story is played as if in the pages of a mystery novel. Ashley must engage with the other characters to follow up the myriad different trails and clues in order to solve the mystery. Journeying through the story&amp;rsquo;s digital pages, she will encounter people who clearly know more than they are letting on about the events leading up to her mother&amp;rsquo;s death, who she will have to interrogate to glean the information she needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use the Wii Remote to point and click items and characters in the game&amp;rsquo;s watercolour backgrounds, interacting with them as she travels. Ashley is guided through the game&amp;rsquo;s world by clicking the arrows that tell players where she is able to go. Ashley is assisted in her puzzle solving by her DAS, a portable device with which she can take pictures during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Another Code: R - A Journey into Lost Memories&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
