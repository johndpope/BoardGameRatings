			<description>Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as a soldier in the bloody missions of World War II. You and the members of your squad were sent to Paris, France with only one mission: Kill Nazis. On the way to destination spot, the plane was shot down. Every one, except for the sergeant, managed to escape the burning plane and hide in the woods. You are a loyal and courageous soldier so you must help the sergeant. That is the start of your first mission and a long bloody way to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon completion of all missions, your last call is the fight with &amp;quot;The Boss&amp;quot; General and the division of angry soldiers. He was the one standing behind those terrible war crimes and he must be punished.&lt;br/&gt;It's your chance to write your own history - if you can survive this brutal adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
