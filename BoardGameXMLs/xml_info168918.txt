							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Belongers</name>
									
			<description>Once upon a time there were two villages--alike in every way-- nestled in a land surrounded by fog. It was obvious to each that the other did not belong...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Belongers is a 2-player semi-abstract strategy game, played without a board, wherein each player tries to raze the opposing village to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set up by arranging the hexagonal terrain tiles in one of the map configurations available in the rulebook (or a custom map created by the players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, each player takes two of the three possible actions: draft a terrain tile to the map, draft a unit, or move and/or attack with a unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, each unit may use its special ability AND terrain bonus once per turn. Each of the units has a unique special ability, and each of the terrains offers a unique bonus...creating huge number of possible combinations for players to explore as they maneuver around the map, attack enemies (either directly, or by pushing them into hostile terrains), and finally, destroying the opposing castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deep strategy war game that plays any small flat surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
