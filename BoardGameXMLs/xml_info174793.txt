							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minor Races: The Neuralon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minor Races line details some of the many life form inhabiting your Science Fiction Traveller game. Unlike the Major Races who discovered Jump Drive technology and began exploring, the Minor Races have rarely ventured farther than a single system or planet. Of the numberless stars, planets and moons; many have hosted unique species and civilizations yet to be discovered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The volume details The Neuralon; often called &amp;quot;Neuralon Seductors&amp;quot; by outsiders.  The Neuralon are willowy, curiously seductive, non-human, bipedal pleasure-lovers. The Neuralon reputation within the Imperium is based around their medical knowledge, particularly in the area of analgesia, anaesthetics and in the treatment and management of both acute and chronic pain, and in luxury technological items of all sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This peaceful race has evolved to be highly sensitive to those around them, using that sensitivity to create and broadcast pacifying pheromones and adjusting their own body language and vocal range to tones and flexions that quickly calm and pacify the aggressors. This automatic, uncontrollable pursuit of appeasing and pacifying aggressors through virtually undetectable means leads to a lifestyle that is monopolised by sensory seduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their home planet, Neuralos, is a holiday destination for the extremely rich and powerful or for the decadent pleasure-seekers. The pleasures they can provide, from food, clothing, drinks, beds, entertainment or mere pampering cannot be matched. Oddly, (to an offworlder, that is) the seedier forms of entertainment do not exist outside startown. The Neuralon find it emotionally upsetting to see the degradation of enforced slavery or prostitution. What is more useful to offworlders  is that the Neuralon medical capabilities, growing from their natural urge to appease and aid those they meet, exceed all expectations, and are on the cutting edge of technological advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a species and society, their strength is also a drawback. They do not build armed warships and are completely reliant on the Imperium and hired mercenaries for their defence: the very thought of inflicting pain on another sapient creature causes them severe distress, triggering their own, reactive-defence measures. As a result, when making their way in the galaxy, they either take jobs as medics or as entertainers, or sometimes as advocates, as many other jobs involve too much pain. There can never be a Neuralon empire or conquered world; but for the same reasons they cannot force their will on another, others find it difficult to force their will on the Neuralon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn more about this race, their homeworld and some of their advanced technology in this eleven page PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
