							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Manbow</name>
									
			<description>Space Manbow is a shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Konami for the MSX2 in 1989. It was later re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console service on the 24th of November, 2009. It has never been released outside of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game the player pilots one of three starships shaped like a mambo fish. There are only two weapon types, however your ship is helped by two stationary &amp;quot;options&amp;quot; similar to those found in the Gradius series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ship from Space Manbow inspired the &amp;quot;Mambo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Samba&amp;quot; characters in Konami's Parodius series, which parodies other Konami shoot 'em ups. The characters first appeared in Gokujō Parodius!, in later Sexy Parodius and Gokuraku Parodius in Pachislot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nintendo DS game Ganbare Goemon: Tōkai Dōchū Ōedo Tengu ri Kaeshi no Maki contains an unlockable Space Manbow minigame with identical graphics but enhanced music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2007, Bart van Velzen released an unofficial sequel, Manbow 2, for MSX2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Manbow has some similarities to Thunder Cross (and Thunder Cross II - both from Konami as well), which makes Space Manbow considered as a Thunder Cross sequel, released only to MSX2 computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space Manbow&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
