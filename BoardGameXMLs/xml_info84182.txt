			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special Response Team (SRT) is a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) unit within a law enforcement organization. This team includes a four person assault team and a two person containment team. In a large city, both teams would form the core of a much larger group, likely close to 60 with everyone in the field. In a small town or rural area, this might be the whole team, and in such a case, they might not even be full time SWAT. Rather, they would be regular police officers trained in SWAT tactics with their armor and weapons in the trunk of their vehicle, ready to switch from officer to operator at the flip of a switch. The team might even belong to a state or federal law enforcement organization, like the FBI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether used separately or as a team, the characters from SRT offer a quick resource for modern campaigns needing that touch of special weapons skills. You'll also find descriptions and game stats for new weapons used by the SWAT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
