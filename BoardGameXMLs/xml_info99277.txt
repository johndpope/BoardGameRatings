							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Trip To Mars</name>
									
			<description>A simple roll-and-move game but with an added feature, you may be instructed to move in or out of the orbit you are currently in. The first to reach Mars (after starting at Earth) wins. Should you be unlucky enough to fall into the Sun, you are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is featured in Victorian Board Games by Olivia Bristol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another version produced by Glevum has similar game plan but updated graphics from around the 1920s&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
