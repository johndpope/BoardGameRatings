			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Beer Drinkers Guide to Role Playing. &amp;quot;FREE WORLD&amp;quot; This is a pen and paper Role Playing Game (RPG) designed to be easy and fun to play. Yes it&amp;rsquo;s a little dated however, in this age of technology maybe you want to take a break and unplug. If you are familiar with Role Playing games you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything within these pages that is too hard to digest. If you are a virgin (never played Role Playing Games before). I believe you will find the rules are written in a very simple manner or layman's terms &amp;quot;easy to understand and straight forward.&amp;quot; Please remember this is a fictional future of our world and broad assumptions are taken on the world's direction, nothing is meant to be offensive, everything is nothing more than speculative fictional satire. I do sincerely hope you enjoy this game, thanks in advance I Don't Know Jack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
