			<description>In the year 2071, satellite mapping revealed vast deposits of oil far below the surface of the Pacific Ocean in the general vicinity of American Samoa. It would be a dangerous and unprecedented project &amp;ndash; never before had oil drilling taken place so far from land. But the size of the deposits, and the vast demand from an oil-dependent and increasingly weak U.S. economy, made the hidden riches irresistible. The United States government, brushing aside international objections that the drilling would take place in neutral waters, staked its claim and sent out a task force of tankers loaded with the equipment to build an oil rig the size of a city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They found a city already there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divers and probes reported a sprawling, domed metropolis on the ocean floor, directly above the oil deposits. Glittering palaces of gold and streets of seashells filled with men and women who breathed variously air and water, and wore rich, colourful robes. Carefully tended farms of kelp and other sea life stretching for miles. Either these people &amp;ndash; quickly dubbed &amp;ldquo;Atlanteans&amp;rdquo; by a not-very-imaginative world press, despite the location of their city &amp;ndash; were oblivious to the oil deposits just below them, or they were already tapping into them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attempts to communicate with the Atlanteans failed &amp;ndash; they spoke a language unknown on any continent. Linguists and anthropologists chafed to study them, but the United States government had other priorities. Learning their language would take years and would only be a prelude to negotiations that might take even longer and still go nowhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drilling was to begin immediately in the kelp farms outside the city dome. Negotiations and studies could take place once the oil was secured. Naval forces arrived on the scene to herd the surprised farmers behind the walls of their city while underwater engineers began construction of the foundation for the rig. The communications of the Atlanteans, increasingly insistent, could not be translated, and so were ignored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, the Atlanteans attacked. Riding giant seahorses and wielding strange weapons, supported by schools of sharks, dolphins, and other sea life, the Atlanteans drove the divers off their lands in brief, bloody raids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The President wasted no time. An act of aggression had been committed against American citizens in American-held waters. It was war. A nuclear submarine would breach the walls of the city and frogmen would secure drilling positions. Forces marshaled &amp;ndash; and struck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game simulates the battle between the United States navy and the forces of the so-called city of Atlantis. The navy has the advantages of overwhelming firepower and ranged weapons, Atlantis of speed and the ability to use the environment. The navy player&amp;rsquo;s objective is to break through the walls of Atlantis and occupy the city, a military victory that would allow drilling to commence. The Atlantis player&amp;rsquo;s objective is to destroy the nuclear submarine, repelling the navy&amp;rsquo;s first attack and granting them time to summon an army of sea creatures too vast even for the modern military power of the United States to overcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
