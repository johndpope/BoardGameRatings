			<description>'From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Clement Sector!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2210, scientists discovered a wormhole allowing travel to the opposite side of the Milky Way galaxy.  Once across, exploration teams discovered worlds far more suited to human habitation than those in star systems nearer to Earth.  Were they terraformed by some unknown race?  Are they just a coincidence in the vast diversity of the universe?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the ensuing years humans left Earth and began to colonize these worlds.  Nation-backed colonies.  Corporate colonies.  People who simply no longer felt compelled to remain on Earth.  The best and brightest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2331, the unthinkable happened.  The wormhole collapsed leaving those in Clement Sector cut off from Earth.  Now these new worlds and new civilizations must stand on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2342.  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clement Sector is the core setting book for Gypsy Knights Games' alternate Traveller universe.  This book ties together all of Gypsy Knights Games' previous subsector sourcebooks and colony books into a vibrant and growing space opera setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clement Sector contains a history of the sector and humanity's expansion in the sector.  It has detailed maps showing all 16 subsectors from those which are fully settled to those where mankind has not yet set foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clement Sector also details the Zimm Drive, the method of stellar travel in this setting, and showcases five commonly seen starships.  Deckplans, art, and statistics are provided for the Rucker-class merchant ship, Luxury-class yacht, Trailblazer-class scout, Atlas-class freighter, and Farragut-class destroyer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clement Sector is also filled with campaign and adventure seeds to allow you and your players to jump straight into the action.  Armed with this book and the Traveller Main Rulebook, you are ready to hit the ground running!  If you crave more detail about these worlds, you can couple this book with our subesector sourcebooks and colony books for a rich tapestry on which to base your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Clement Sector!  Adventure awaits you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
