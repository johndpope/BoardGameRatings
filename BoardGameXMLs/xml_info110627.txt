							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced Class: Druid â€“ Favored Forms</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a druid, you have the power to adopt the shape of any natural or fey beast found across the planes or your imagination. However, in all your time dwelling in the wilds, you have grown attached to one particular shape; you have developed a kinship with one species of beast that your fellow druids, in their ever-shifting wild forms, cannot understand or respect. They speak of the advantages of versatility&amp;mdash;but you have delved into the nature of your favored form and claimed its strength as part of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Favored Forms, the first installment of the Advanced Class line from Silent7Seven Games, includes seven heroic feats and four paragon feats that allow your druid character to truly manifest the form of your favorite animal or magical beast. The heroic feats grant you animal abilites available only in that shape, and the paragon tier feats take it a step further, granting you access to special powers that tap into the inherent powers of your favored form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
