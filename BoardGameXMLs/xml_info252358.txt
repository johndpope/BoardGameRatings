			<description>Clockwork is a trick taking game with a twist. Set in a steampunk world in turmoil. If you like classic trick taking games like Spades, Euchre or Hearts, you will love the extra strategy in Clockwork which includes special card powers, varying objectives and set collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of cards, they take turns playing a card into the &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; like traditional trick taking games highest card played wins the trick and a gear worth -1 point at the end of the game but in Clockwork the lowest card played in the trick gets to trigger its card power. Winning tricks is powerful but sometimes you want to come in last to trigger that special power just at the right moment to swing the game. You have to watch out for the powerful character cards though, when played they not only win the trick but also get to use their power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a trick is completed the winner gets to distribute the cards played to the &amp;quot;workshop&amp;quot; in front of each player, the workshop serves two purposes, first the cards in each players workshop at the end of the hand is the players score for the round. Second after scoring each player picks up the cards in their workshop and that is their hand for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also random special objectives in play rewarding players with negative points for getting specific card combinations in their workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over 3 rounds. At the end of three rounds the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
