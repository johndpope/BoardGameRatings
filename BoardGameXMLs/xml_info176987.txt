							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Patent Deal</name>
									
			<description>Invent, Patent and Negotiate Deals to WIN.  Invent and create technology in eight different fields.  Patent your invention or negotiate patent deals to dominate the market place. (from the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws a type of company and random inventions.  Depending on whether the inventions you've drawn match your genre of company or not, you follow flow charts (printed on mats) as to whether to patent or not, whether to license out to another player or develop the product for market.  As you go around the board, you land on spaces that cause you to draw revenue from your invention, pay license fees to the other player, or go to patent court.  Play continues until the first patent expires (or second patent if a longer game is desired).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
