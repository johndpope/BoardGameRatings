			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bushido Blade 2 (ブシドーブレード弐 Bushidō Burēdo Tsu) is a fighting game published by Squaresoft, released in both Japan and North America in 1998. It is the sequel to Bushido Blade, which had been released the previous year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bushido Blade 2 expands on some of the aspects of Bushido Blade, while limiting or removing others. The story mode is changed from one large connected level to a series of skirmishes, each set on a different map. Playable characters are chosen from groups which represent two opposing schools of assassins, and they are armed with swords or polearms of varying types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fights in Bushido Blade 2 mark the progress of the chosen character who&amp;mdash;depending on the character&amp;mdash;either fights to regain a legendary sword, or to destroy the opposing school. Levels involve a pattern of fighting several generic ninja followed by a boss, who is one of the playable characters from the opposing school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two characters in Bushido Blade 2 are exceptions to the typical opponent roster: the gun-wielding Tsubame and Katze. They have sworn loyalty to opposing schools, and battles involving them provide a different, arguably greater kind of challenge. With proper tactics, such as monitoring the opponent's remaining ammunition, however, the player can defend against the firearms with his melee weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
