							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flatland (Inflated) the RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the game you've been waiting for! If you haven't been waiting for it...well....it came anyway. This game takes the classic beloved Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (by Edwin Abbot Abbot) and...well....inflates it. It includes a small system for making characters (the KaSE system), including supernatural powers, mechanics for dealing with third dimensional creatures, and numerous things to kill for characters created by anyone insane enough to actually play this. It also includes a small setting. 31 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
