			<description>The Fairly OddParents: Breakin' Da Rules is a video game released for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the PC in 2003. It is based on the famous Nickelodeon cartoon, Fairly OddParents. It was developed by Helixe and published by THQ. Its sequel, The Fairly OddParents: Shadow Showdown is on GameCube, Game Boy Advance and PS2. The console versions of this game features a different plot than the PC version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, Timmy Turner's mother and father have gone on a vacation, and left Timmy with the evil babysitter Vicky. When Timmy tries to make a wish, his fairy godparents Cosmo and Wanda tell him that it's against &amp;quot;Da Rules&amp;quot;. Outraged, Timmy wishes he didn't have to follow the rules. So, Cosmo destroys the book. Vicky arrives, and gains possession of Da Rules. She wishes Timmy was still sleeping, and since she has possession of a fairy item, her wish is granted. Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda and Julia go to Fairy Court, and are accused of destroying Da Rules. Jorgen Von Strangle gives the three of them 49 &amp;frac12; hours to find the missing pages of Da Rules. Timmy must navigate through ten levels and find the pages before Vicky's wishes become too extreme!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC version features a different plot. In this version, Juandissimo Magnifico tricks Timmy into wishing the book destroyed so that Cosmo and Wanda will get in trouble for it. It also notably features an appearance by Vicky and Tootie's mother (at Timmy's age, as the level featuring her is set in the past), named Nicky. Here, she is shown behaving a lot like Tootie, and Timmy initially mistakes her for Tootie when he first sees her, although the in-game graphics depict her as resembling a younger Vicky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Game Boy version, Anti-Cosmo arrives to steal the book, and you defeat Vicky at the very end to restore peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Fairly OddParents: Breakin' Da Rules&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
