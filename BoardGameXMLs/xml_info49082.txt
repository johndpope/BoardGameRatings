							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Glacier</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A village is only as livable as its surroundings. We are caretakers not only of our homes, but of our world.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-Inum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange sentiments, perhaps, from one who lives in what many perceive as a frozen wasteland, but the philosopher Inum speak for the Ulutiun people of the Great Glacier. Their tribes share that icy landscape with arctic dwarves who enjoy sun-bathing, sled-animals that are hardier than dogs, and fierce monsters that live nowhere else - and thrive in the freezing air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Glacier is the first supplement for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting to detail an Inuit-based culture. In this booklet is fact-based information on building a snow-house, suviving in sub-zero temperatures for extended periods of time, and more ideas for fantasy campaigning in an arctic setting. For those who are tired of the normal, temperate, &amp;quot;you-meet-in-the-tavern-and-proceed-to-go-adventuring&amp;quot; games, here's something completely different.&lt;br/&gt;Make sure your characters dress warmly - it gets nippy at night on the Great Glacier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
