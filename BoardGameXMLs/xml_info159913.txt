			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pyramad is the game of pyramid power. The cosmic forces of intuition and chance meet head on with the powers of observation and logic in this multilevel game for two players. Like the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, each players seeks to build and possess a pyramid by stacking cards drawn from the special 92-card deck. Until the last card is played, you will be hanging on the edge of your throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pyramad is played on a 6x6 square grid using 92 square cards. Each card shows a pattern of four squares colored red, blue, or white; red and blue are the players' colors and white is neutral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player either draws a card or plays a card (playing is required if a player has five cards in hand). A card can be played on an empty space or on the intersection of four cards, but the latter play can only be made if the intersection has fewer than three squares of the opponent's color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to either place the single card on the sixth level of the pyramid or make it impossible for your opponent to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
