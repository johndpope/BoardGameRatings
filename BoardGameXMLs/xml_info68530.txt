			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snafu is a one- or two- player game in which players maneuver snakes around the screen.  Several options are available for play.  In the basic game, which is similar to the lightcycles from Tron, players try to win by eliminating opponents by running them into walls or snake paths or &amp;quot;tails&amp;quot;.  A second mode existed for players to go head-to-head in a battle to reduce the opponent to zero length by biting off the tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Intellivision version, players chose what game to play using the number pad. Each code designated the use of NPC snakes, obstacles, diagonal travel (instead of only orthogonal), and whether tails would disappear after a snake was eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
