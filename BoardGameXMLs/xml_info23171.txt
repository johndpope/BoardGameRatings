							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder in Metropolis!</name>
									
			<description>It was a gray day for all the world's comic book readers to learn that the robot that was once the famous, &amp;quot;Robo Gal&amp;quot; was found deprogrammed behind the old Metropolis Theater. Wire harnesses, electronic components, and floppy disks had been strewn about the deserted parking lot. Detectives on the scene immediately noticed that Robo Gal's electro-cerebrum had been tampered with.... as well as her power pack units. Her legendary umbrella with its unique candy cane handle was found on the pavement along with a leaking can of acid. A set of stainless steel wrenches, a flying bat and batteries were also found on the scene as well as&amp;hellip;a clove of garlic, a chocolate candy bar, and some French fries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell us more&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual celebration of the world's most famous &amp;quot;superheroes&amp;quot; was just about to commence. These worshiped figures always assembled for their yearly &amp;quot;SUPER-BLAST&amp;quot; party in the secret ballroom located in the basement of the old abandoned theater. Each year they honor one of their peers with the &amp;quot;Trophy of Power &amp;quot;and this year Robo Gal was to be the recipient of this tribute. Robo Guy was preparing to make the announcement when it was discovered that our beloved Robo Gal was nowhere to be seen. While everyone searched the ballroom and the theater, X-ray Faye, with her incredible super duper infer-ray vision, turned on her powers and was able to look right through the old thick theater walls. There, to her dismay, she saw the remains of her beloved friend and compatriot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who could have committed this horrible crime? Why would anyone want to do away with the wonderful Robo Gal? And what was with the garlic, chocolate and fries??????  Hmmmmmmm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So now it's time to grab those capes, turn on your powers and join this gang of superheroes for an evening of masquerade, mystery, and MURDER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
