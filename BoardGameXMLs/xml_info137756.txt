			<description>Search It...a game designed to test your knowledge against your web searching skills and speed. Players that know the answers are rewarded with moving faster through the game. Otherwise you must use your web enabled device to try and find the answer before time runs out. Players young and older will be challenged with using technology and brain power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing board is made up of multi colored spaces corresponding to question cards. There are four categories to chose from. People Places Things and General. Players can either answer the question or use their web enabled device to find the answer. Knowing the answer will advance the playing piece four spaces. If the internet is used you may move 3 spaces. If you cannot answer in the 15 second time limit any other player my try and answer. A correct answer will advance their piece 1 space. Within the board layout there are special spaces. Landing on a Back Space moves your piece back 2 spaces. Players landing on and ESC space will take a ride on the High Speed Fiber Optic line bypassing several spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
