			<description>Content:&lt;br/&gt;77 word cards, 33 picture cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 7 word- and picture-cards. Alternating the cards are played separately. The destination is to build a senseful sentence. Are the co-players not content with the word of my choice they had to be convinced. Mostly an incredible sentence construction with fantastic content is getting develloped. The winner is who gets played all cards and ends a sentence with that last card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
