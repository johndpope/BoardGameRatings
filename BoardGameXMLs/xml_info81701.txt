			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;You are Licia, secretly trained as a fighter, and your skills are about to be severely tested as you follow the footsteps of your missing brother in his quest to destroy the evil illusionist, Treg, who holds your family's future in his hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is Tym, a young adventurer with a frank, open face and the skills of a thief. And then there is Max, a scholarly magic-user, with the eyes of a mystic and the ability to make you feel emotions you've never felt before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your fantasy adventure lead you to your first romance, or will the decisions you make carry you into realms from which there is no return? In a HEARTQUEST book, you, the reader, are challenged to PICK A PATH TO ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
