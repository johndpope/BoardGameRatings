			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five levels of play in this PET machine language program.  Level four is for experts only and is designed for tournament level play.  So far no one has been able to beat level four.  Level five takes several minutes to move and is used for exhaustive analysis of specific moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several features to help in the analysis of a game.  Any position on the board can be recalled and replayed.  Both the level of difficulty and the position of the pieces can be changed at any time.  You can play against the machine, against another person, or watch the machine play itself.  You and the machine can switch sides during the game.  Moves are selected with the cursor rather than by coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmed by Mike Riley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
