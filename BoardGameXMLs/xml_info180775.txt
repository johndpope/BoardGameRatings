							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zlatan Board Game!</name>
									
			<description>The Zlatan Board Game! appears inside the back cover of the book Zlatan by Illugi J&amp;ouml;kulsson. It follows the life and career of Swedish soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It is a simple roll-and-move game where players roll a die to progress along a track. Spaces along the way refer to setbacks and successes in Zlatan's life and career, corresponding to moving forward or back on the track or gaining or losing turns.  Some spaces also require player to complete actions such as counting to 60 or speaking in a French accent. The first player to reach the end of the track wins, although the rules specify that players decide whether an exact roll is necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
