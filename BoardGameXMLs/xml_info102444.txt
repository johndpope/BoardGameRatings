			<description>Are you an athletic &amp;amp; passionate girl, who is ready to work as hard as it takes to become a world champion of modern dance? Laura is just like you, so take the chance with her to make your dreams come true!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the help of your eccentric coach and his charming son, you will learn new skills and soon see your full potential as a dancer. But bear in mind that the road to victory will be full of surprises&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become the best dancer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You can choose between 2 game modes to decide whether you want to go directly for training or discover the many twists of Laura&amp;rsquo;s adventures&lt;br/&gt;     Remember that following the rhythm of the music will be key to delivering a great performance&lt;br/&gt;     As you progress in the adventure, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to learn up to 38 new moves or steps and therefore perform a large range of combinations&lt;br/&gt;     In order to improve, the competition with other dancers is also good motivation. You will meet &amp;amp; challenge 12 other dancers on a huge variety of music &amp;amp; styles. Bear in mind that each dancer has his own specific strong points &amp;amp; personality that can teach you many things!&lt;br/&gt;     Another way to improve your style is to carefully watch the replays of amazing dance routines and try to reproduce them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find your personal way to dance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Show your creativity by creating your own choreographies combining the moves you want to do. You can also choose to dance with or without accessories like balls and ribbons that can add something very personal to your dance&lt;br/&gt;     Have a look at your outfit and accessories you will use during your performances. The better you look, the best for you express yourself!&lt;br/&gt;     The choice of the music and the dance floor you want to dance on can also have a great influence on your overall show. What musical genre will you choose today? Funk, Pop-Rock, Soul / R&amp;amp;B, Electro ? That&amp;rsquo;s up to your mood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Share your fun with your friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     During your progression, you will unlock exclusive pictures or videos that you can share with your friends thanks to the wireless connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
