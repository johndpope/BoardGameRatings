							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Haunted Musicians</name>
									
			<description>You are composers, haunted by music that you didn't write, and also doesn't exist. As such, all of you are in an asylum. To regain your sanity, you have to complete three of the compositions haunting you. Unfortunately, there are only so much paper and ink available  at a time. Also, the asylum tries to keep as many of its patients in group therapy at a time as it can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players invest their tempo(represented by metronomes) to obtain the materials, time, and inspiration needed to complete the pieces haunting them. There are currently two card decks, one for 3-4 players and one for 5-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
