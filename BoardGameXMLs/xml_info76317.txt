			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Tomorrow, a retro sci‚Äêfi roleplaying game. I designed this game for Ro Watts because she asked me for a steam punk game. I told her, &amp;quot;You don&amp;rsquo;t want a steam punk game; you want a game about how the past thought the future might be.&amp;quot; I said this because she loves movies like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and games like Bioshock. Both that movie and that game aren&amp;rsquo;t steam punk, but \ they are about a speculative future. A future from the past&amp;rsquo;s point of view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so, this game is about just that: how the past thought the future would look like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s also about a little more. I talked with Ro and found out exactly what she liked about those kinds of stories. After our talk, I discovered she really liked four key themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first was Action! She loved the high danger and suspense she found in those stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second was Science! She loved the technology people from the past thought we would come up with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third was Mystery! Ro loves Victorian mysticism and so we had to throw in some of that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And lastly, Ro loves Romance! Characters like the roaring &amp;lsquo;20&amp;rsquo;s dilettante and the Victorian Adventuress were high on her list, so we had to include something for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From there, I just made stats for each of the things Ro loved and provided a way for the players to create a character based on those four themes. Then, I threw the game at a few game design folks I respect and admire and found out what they thought of it. They gave a few suggestions and the game really started taking shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so here is Ro&amp;rsquo;s game. We hope you enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
