			<description>THE EPISHELL WARS  Squads of humanoid mecha face off in varying terrains over ever changing goals,commonly resulting in the destruction of the other team.  The game uses a system of 3d12 rolls, with modifiers to the minimum and maximum that may be rolled.  Each roll will have a modifier of +X/-Y (EG. +1/-1, +4/-2, +0/-3).  The +X portion determines the minimum result of each of the d12, and the -Y determines the maximum.  A modifier of +2/-2 would mean that each die can result in the range of 3-10 (1+2, 12-2), the total roll being anywhere between 9 and 30.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game setup involves a map with 1&amp;quot; hexes of a size predetermined by either a provided scenario or popular decision.  Terrain involves transparent overlays called terrain Plates that have visual cues as to which form(s) of terrain are included (Obscure, Hostile , Hostile , Resistant).  Terrain Plates can overlap, and each terrain type present in a given hex applies in a &amp;quot;yes/no&amp;quot; fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players agree on the number of units and of which types that each will bring into play.  Given a default game of 1v1 death match, each player will have four Epishell (humanoid mech) units.  For each unit they will decide the variety from Scout, Assault, Marksman, and Escort and apply modular designed equipment based on the carrying capacity of that unit.  Pilots are also assigned to the units with a zero sum trait set.  Typically, each player will have a side of the map to treat as their starting area.  Time and objectives will be determined by popular decision before the terrain is placed and the units outfitted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During game play, each player has a set number of &amp;quot;MOVE&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;FIRE&amp;quot; actions equal to half of their total unit count, rounded up and may only allot one to each unit at the start of the &amp;quot;Circuit&amp;quot;.  A countdown procedure occurs using the traits of the units, giving priority to &amp;quot;FIRE&amp;quot; actions.  Every action is given a small amount of Movement points, with an extra bonus from a &amp;quot;MOVE&amp;quot; action.  Movements points can be used to change facing or location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
