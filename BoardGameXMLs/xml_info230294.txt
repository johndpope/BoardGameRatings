							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lakota Terror (Black Hack)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Storm began the sacred chant. Beginning quietly, he sang the words of power, ancient when his people were still wide-eyed with wonder at this new land. The land that had now been taken from them by the pale interlopers with their strange tools and stranger ideas. The old medicine man had seen too many of his kinsmen die at the hands of the intruders. Victims of the thunder sticks, or strange plagues, or the peculiar-tasting beverage that caused more braves to fall under its spell every year, leaving them uselessly lying in camp, wetting themselves in their endless cravings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Storm sang his anguish into the words, giving them extra potency. After what seemed like hours, he finished his rite with a final shout. The area fell deathly silent. Red Storm looked up at his companions, weary but satisfied. &amp;quot;It is done,&amp;quot; he said with a slight smile. &amp;quot;The strangers will soon feel the wrath of the People.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the distant horizon, a storm cloud tinged the hue of blood took form&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lakota Terror is an Old West/Horror adventure, set in the American west in the late 19th Century, and for use with David Black&amp;rsquo;s The Black Hack. The heroes find themselves opposing a Lakota medicine man's plot to exact vengeance for his people by awakening an ancient evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although intended for use with The Black Hack, the GM should have no trouble adapting The Lakota Terror to other game systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
