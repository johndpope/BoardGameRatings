			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;行けたら行くよ! (Iketara Ikuyo!) in English would mean &amp;quot;I'll go if I can!&amp;quot;. This game is the official board game of Japanese Manga &amp;quot;Majime Kei Kuzu no Nichijou (Everyday of serious type scum)&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I'll skip school events more smartly than everyone else does!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players try to live lazily, eluding tiresome school activities while not destroying your reputation with your classmates. Your reputation is gauged by school hierarchy. You go up ranks in the hierarchy if you accomplish something with your classmates, and go down if you blow off something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have the same deck of cards, each of which is numbered 0 to 2 indicating how much energy they will commit to an activity. Each round, an event card is drawn. Players secretly determine how much energy they commit on that event, placing cards face-down. Then all cards are revealed simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the event is co-operative, players need to commit a certain number of total energy to accomplish. If successful, all involved players go up ranks. If the event is competitive, only players who have committed the highest energy are successful and go up ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you should not over-commit an event because the victory goes to the player with the most energy saved in their hand. Because of that, you may play a &amp;quot;Blow off&amp;quot; card secretly instead of committing energy. It saves you from wasting your cards, and you may draw two cards instead of regular one card at end of the round. But if two or more players play &amp;quot;Blow off&amp;quot;, their ranks go down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the round, cards played are discarded, except for &amp;quot;Blow off&amp;quot; cards which return to players' hand. When you go up to a certain rank, you may have a friend who can use a special ability for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after several rounds, and you win the game if you save the most energy in your hand, but you can't claim the victory if you are at the lowest rank in the school hierarchy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;「オレは学校をサボる！誰よりも上手く！！」&lt;br/&gt;学校で起こる様々なめんどくさい青春イベントをやり過ごし、&lt;br/&gt;周りに嫌われぬまま、楽して生き抜くことを目指すゲーム。&lt;br/&gt;人間関係わずらわしい！めんどくさい事やりたくない！&lt;br/&gt;周りを欺き、裏では手を抜き、本能のまま生きる事を目指す！&lt;br/&gt;学校行事に参加してスクールカーストを上げ、&lt;br/&gt;ここぞという時にサボって体力を貯めこむ！&lt;br/&gt;漫画『まじめ系クズの日常』公式ゲーム&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
