In striking full-color, and more than doubling the size of the original, The Lost Lands: Bard&amp;rsquo;s Gate details hundreds of individual locations and NPCs, gives an overview of the Lyre Valley and a complete history of the city, and quadruples the number of adventures that were found in the original, raising the total to 8. The adventures contained within are suitable for player characters of 1st level to 10th and even beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City of Bards&lt;br/&gt;In the far north lies the ancient city of Bard's Gate. Located on a strategic trade route, this city is famed far and wide as a bastion of art and learning that welcomes bards, performers, writers, artists and creators of all sorts. Yet this citadel of enlightenment, deep in the wilds, is also threatened by dark forces - the gnolls and orcs from the wilderness and cults of evil gods from within, for the very freedom that draws artists and musicians from across the continent also allows evil to flourish in secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City of Adventure&lt;br/&gt;Bard's Gate is a fully-developed fantasy city that can be used in any campaign. A wide range of businesses, churches, homes, shops, taverns, inns and other locations are described in detail, ready made for your campaign. Bard's Gate is also filled with unique NPCs, from the most influential leader and wealthiest merchant to the lowliest pauper. Also included in this product are the adventures Slip Gallows Abbey and The Gnoll Fortress, where Bard's Gate-based PCs can find peril and - if they're lucky - fortune. Whoever you may be, whether prince or beggar, if you are a seeker of adventure, Bard's Gate welcomes you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
