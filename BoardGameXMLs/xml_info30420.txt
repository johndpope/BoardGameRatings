							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tru-Action Electric Track Meet</name>
									
			<description>From the same company who made the famous Tru-Action Football game (The one with all of the men with plastic legs that when you turned on the power &amp;quot;ran&amp;quot; all over the place. This electric action game features 4 Sprinter racing figures. There are two different kinds of tracks on the field (board). One features the regular running events like the 100 yard dash, the 220, the 440 and the mile run. A separate track was used to run the low hurdles. The low hurdle track had bumps on it so that at least in theory the runners actually jumped over those low hurdles as they came down to the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
