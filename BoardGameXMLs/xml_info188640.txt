			<description>Legend of the Wayfarer&lt;br/&gt;A Gamebook System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This solitaire role-playing system allows single players to adventure through pre-generated adventure books using fairly standard table-top methods and mechanics.  Characters select three Abilities to begin (and may acquire others later) from a list of twelve:  Combat, Roguery, Stealth, Athletics, Charm, Perception, Lore, Magick, Mysticism, Survival, Pathfinding, and Trading.  Characters also have Vitality and Will, which vary during play.  Play also grants experience which can be spent to gain re-rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core mechanic has the player roll 1D6 against a target number.  A fairly commonly occurring mechanic allows for re-rolls on failures.  Combat proceeds in this simple manner as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains a character sheet as a printable page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
