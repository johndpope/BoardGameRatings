			<description>Birthday party game is a delicious birthday cake. Your job is to chip yourself a juicy piece of cake by dice throwing. The question, however, is not just a normal piece of cake, because you'll need to assemble the layer-layer plate candles always bottom up. Cuts to be taken whenever the dice seems to shift to a picture of the piece. The task is challenging more than you think - dice is a tyrant! Winner is the one who gets more pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
