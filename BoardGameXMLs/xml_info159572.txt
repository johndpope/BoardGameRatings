							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deep Dig</name>
									
			<description>A press-your luck card game with an underground theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play as treasure hunters exploring deep underground, facing monsters such as giant earthworms and lava swimmers, and dangers such as narrow bridges and tunnel collapses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the active player purchases tool cards with various special abilities. Then they encounter monster and danger cards from the dig deck until either they choose to stop digging or a card knocks them out. They score treasure based on the number of cards they encountered that turn, but only if they weren't knocked out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the dig deck is depleted, whoever has the most treasure wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
