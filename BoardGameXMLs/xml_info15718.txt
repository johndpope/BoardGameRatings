							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kukla and Ollie Game</name>
									
			<description>This game, based on the Kukla Fran &amp;amp; Ollie TV show, is to be the first player to move all of your playing pieces (representing puppets) into the center area marked ON STAGE. Each player starts with 4 pieces (numbered 1-4) on starting circles. On your turn you may move any 1 of your pieces. A piece may move any direction except backwards, and moves a number of spaces equal to its number (the #3 piece moves 3 spaces). If 2 or more pieces are on the same row, the moving piece gets bonus moves equal to the numbers on all the pieces in that row. If you land on an opponent's piece, you send it back to its start space. Be the first to get all your pieces ON STAGE and you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
