			<description>Legend has it that once every hundred years a dragon descends from the sky and bestows a large fortune upon the magician who has the best control of the elements. It has been a hundred years since the last contest and mages from all over the land have gathered in anticipation. In spite of being a young mage you have proven your mettle by outlasting all but six other mages. Suddenly the skies are lit by a blinding light and out of the sky emerges the most magnificent of all creatures. The Dragon has arrived and perched on Mount Fuji, the legend is true! Your resolve has redoubled; the time to make your mark on the world and gain a fantastic fortune is close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you keep your focus and control the elements to win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon's Fortune is a print and play set collection game. The player who can cast the right spells and score the most points wins. Dragon's Fortune can currently be printed via artscow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are links to the artscow decks. You will need to print both decks to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;Deck 1: Link coming soon!&lt;br/&gt;Deck 2: Link coming soon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
