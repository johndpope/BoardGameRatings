							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cornflower Corbin</name>
									
			<description>Cornflower Corbin is a family friendly, campy, side scrolling shooter about a whale, with a laser, that is trying to get the love of his life back after the evil Mecha Shark takes her from him. He is painfully assisted by his best friend Paul, an oversize clown fish that jokes a little too much, and has to battle his way through a barrage of enemies to get her back. Corbin's secret power is in his growth. You see the bigger he gets, the harder his lasers hit. But beware, he also gets slower and becomes a bigger target, so finding a balance in size to damage is key. The game is set up to be stat heavy with leaderboards. So get ready to compete with other players by taking out more turtles and sharks than they do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Procedural generated enemies making the game change a little bit each time you play&lt;br/&gt;    Five levels of action including 5 boss fights and 3 mini boss fights&lt;br/&gt;    Endurance mode where the waves just keep on coming&lt;br/&gt;    Leaderboards and stat collection for things like shots fired and sharks taken out&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
