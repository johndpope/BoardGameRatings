			<description>Pocket Sports Hockey is a fast, dice rolling game of Ice Hockey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses 8 custom made dice with a positional player system that 'calls' the play as it happens on the ice. It's a very rapid, light game that captures the theme of Ice Hockey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 positions on the ice. Defense, Wings, Center and a Star Player. The game sees the 'puck' being moved from position to position and shooting on goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your opponent controls a Goalie die to roll and make saves, and a 'check' die for making big hits against the player with the puck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 International Team cards are included with a goal scoring track and Power Play track, that uses cubes to easily keep score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple light filler, the player to first score 6 goals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packed with check hits, shots on goal and even fights, this perfect pocket sized hockey game will be suitable for any hockey fan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
