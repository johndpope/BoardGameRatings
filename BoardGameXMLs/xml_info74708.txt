			<description>From the back of the PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Areniel leaped off the parapets of Heaven. The stone battlements of the city fell away beneath him even as rolling lands stretched out on all sides. On his flanks the rest of the Host rose in unison - the hand of God, propelled by His will. As Areniel flew into the air, the lush fields of Heaven fell into the distance, a yellow-flecked expanse of grass stirring in the wind of a thousand angelic wings. The FallenHost flew above them, vicious weapons glittering in the in the light, their armor blackened in the absence of God's glory. Soon they'd glisten with blood...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Echoes of Heaven is a game world of darkness and danger, where a monolithic church has split into dozens of quarreling factions and holy war looms like a shadow. Here, strength and brutality win the day and only those with the most faith, honor and courage can stand against the terrible tyranny of those who would enslave everyone of a different belief, a different philosophy, a different race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worse, it is a world infected by the very fabric of Hell itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Echoes of Heaven is designed for use in four different game systems. They are the D20 system game (owned by Wizards of the Coast), Rolemaster (owned by Iron Crown Enterprises), HARP (owned by Iron Crown Enterprises), and HERO system (owned by Hero Games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
