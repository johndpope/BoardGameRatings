							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noteability for Juniors</name>
									
			<description>Now there's a special Noteability game for young players.  It comes with a great looking electronic piano and 300 songs that kids can recognize.  Players play songs for their partner who tries to guess the title.  Notes are numbered on the piano keys, and the song melody is numerically coded on the song cards.  Points are awarded for correct guesses and good piano playing, but no musical talent is required to have a great time playing Noteability Jr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
