			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 articles (including 3 adventures) from the ever-popular EN5ider publication. Rules, adventures, and more from the best in the industry.  Whether you seek dark paladins, weapon properties, plug-in settlements, or a brand new commander-style class, EN5ider has you covered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Business of Emotion. This is an adventure for 3-5 characters of levels 2-3. The village of Lanidor is suffering from an enchanted &amp;quot;summer of love&amp;quot;. Can the PCs figure out what's going on? By Paul Okesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Paladin's Dark Vows. Not all paladins are good; some may stray from the true path, while others are pure evil. Josh Gentry presents new flaws and class features for dark paladins. When a paladin turns from the light, flaws of aggression, blind loyalty, and na&amp;iuml;vet&amp;eacute; provide corruptions of the virtues of bravery, loyalty, and wisdom. Additionally, paladins may take oaths of the Purge or Supremacy, or use the new Bloody Hands class feature. Illustrated by Scott Harshbringer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Alive! Does your victim wish to inflict a plague via an obscure ritual at the start of a solar eclipse on the grounds of an accursed cemetary using the blood of an innocent demon? Build rituals to achieve your villain's dark goals. Animate a golem, summon a god, open the Gates of Hell, or banish the sun. Seven tables describe the ritual's purpose, time, location, components, side-effects, price of failure, and - of course - how to foil the dastardly deed! By Mark A. Hart; illustrated by Jacob Blackmon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Right Way to Fudge. When and how should the GM fudge an encounter? Jeremy Lewit discusses the reasons and the methods, and provides advice on the right way to fudge. Should you alter the enemies, change the goalposts, or add new challenges? Illustrated by Savage Mojo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mystery of Mordecai's Monster. From Dan Head comes this adventure of mystery and horror! Who is Mordecai, and what has become of his latest creation? Can the PCs solve the mystery of Mordecai's monster before it's too late? An adventure for 3rd level characters. Illustrated by Nick Cramp and Rick Hershey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Good As His Blade. Expand the list of weapon properties to include barbed, double, awkward, tripping, and more! Along with nearly 20 new weapons designed to use these new properties, and changes to the entangling and reach properties, this article will unlock the potential of weapon design and introduce more variety into your fighting style! By Connors; illustrated by Jacob Blackmon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the Next Hill: The Village of Drood. The Village of Drood is a small village bordering a dark wood, founded by a travelling wizard and ready to be plugged in to your campaign. The first in a series of three settlements, this article contains NPCs and plot hooks. By Mark Craddock; illustrated by Jacob Blackman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volumes of Forgotten Lore: Divine. Veteran author Ari Marmell brings you new divine player options. The Protection, Shadow, and Travel domains, the Urban druidic circle, and the Theologian, a new tradition for the wizard. Illustrated by Jeshields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friend of the Children. Why do the children of Medvedka Vas not age? Can the answer be found on Bear Plateau? Who is the mysterious &amp;quot;Friend of the Children? And what is the role of Eglantina, the last pixie of Bear Plateau? A dark fantasy adventure for 4th level characters. By Peter Zacchaeus; illustrated by Ellis Goodson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the Next Hill: The Town of Rivereave. The second in our &amp;quot;Over the Next Hill&amp;quot; series of small plug-in settlements is a lakeside fishing town on the fringes of civilization - an ideal base camp from which to launch expeditions into the wilderness! With NPCs, locations, and plot hooks, these settlements can be used in any campaign. By Scott Marcley; illustrated by Indi Martin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chessmasters &amp;amp; Commanders: The Noble Class. The full 20-level noble class is able to command and inspire through three paths - the Path of the Heart, the Path of the Brave, and the Path of the Tactician. By A. Nova; illustrated by Ellis Goodson and Shannon White.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
