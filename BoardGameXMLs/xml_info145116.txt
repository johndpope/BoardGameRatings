			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Type: Overland, Town, Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;Level: 3-5 Level&lt;br/&gt;Party: 2-5 Characters&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Celtic, Overland, Castle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Brian Young, the author who brought you the Codex Celtarum, an epic adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen Adyna is unhappy. Her King is not her lover and her lover is not the King. Such accidents of fate often need a guiding hand. The goodly King Gwgon ap Gwron has ruled the realm for many years but he does not rule his wife and it is her design to bring him low and the character&amp;rsquo;s task to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this complex adventure of court espionage and skullduggery, the adventurers must slay a king. To do so is no mean feat, for they must track him, watch him, weave their way through the forest of court intrigue to unseat him and even then it is best to be wary. For hired assassins are often loose ends that themselves need cutting. To Kill a King is an adventure of betrayal and backstabbing; a story steeped in intrigue and regicide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those noble born and good of heart may shy from the task at hand. For certain, there will be blood tonight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a semi-historical mythical Post-Roman Britain, in the North of Wales in the little kingdom of Penllyn (&amp;lsquo;Pen-thlin&amp;rsquo;) this adventure has the strong element of the faery-folk and druidic magic about it. This module can be easily placed in the Airhde world setting or any other with a change of names and places and taken out of its historical and geographical settings and refitted for one of pure fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
