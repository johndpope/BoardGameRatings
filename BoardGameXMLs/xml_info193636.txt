			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bursting with high-speed arcade action, Emlyn Hughes International Soccer offers the most realistic gameplay yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can almost feel the crowd pressing you forward as the goalkeeper tips a dipping shot over the bar! Stand back and you'll believe you are watching a real match on TV!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's amazing that so many features have been packed into one program. Diving headers and sliding tackles, even barging and side-stepping, plus free-kicks, throw-ons, goalkicks, corners and penalties!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that's not all - Emlyn Hughes International Soccer allows you to enter your own teams of star players, set their skill levels individually, and manage them through the season. The fitness of each player is constantly changing, so you may have difficult selection problems - would you take a risk and put your star player in the team if he wasn't fully fit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One or Two can play, or you can watch two computer teams battle it out. And to create those really classy moves, why not try two players against the computer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emlyn Hughes was a successful British soccer player who captained England and Liverpool, and later found fame as a pundit. This game is a soccer simulation with management elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players can select from eight national teams. The game can either be played as a one-off friendly, a Cup (which is a knock-out competition between the eight teams), a League, or a Season, which consists of both a cup and a league.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to eight players can select to manage a team each. Managing each team must be done in a hotseat fashion with each player making team selections, etc. separately before moving on to the fixtures for the week. In a match itself, two players can play simultaneously competitively. In addition, when facing a computer opponent two players can play cooperatively against the computer. If all teams are set to computer opponents, then the computer will play itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
