							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">4th &amp; Inches</name>
									
			<description>4th &amp;amp; Inches is an American football computer game by Accolade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other sports games by Bob Whitehead, 4th &amp;amp; Inches was hailed upon release, combining the action of previous titles with the new feature of strategic play calling. For the first time in a computer football game, players could choose from a number of plays. The player initially designated a formation, and then selected one of five plays based on the formation. These plays included a great number of offensive strategies, including draws, curls, sweeps and long bombs, among others. Defensive tactics equally were varied, with the player being able to choose a defensive formation based on what they thought the opponent would attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;4th &amp;amp; Inches,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
