			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many people dream of traveling to the worlds they read about, or stepping into the movies they love. We wish we had in our world what our favorite characters have in their worlds. Sometimes, getting what we want is worse than not getting it. Fictional worlds are as real as our own, separated by nothing more than quantum probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metafiction is a two-page RPG about people who can travel to fictional worlds and bring parts of them into our world. Characters are described in terms of how closely they resonate with these alternate worlds, in both useful and dangerous ways. They use points of Coincidence between themselves and certain works of fiction to draw those imagined worlds into our own reality, or to travel from one saga to another. Points of Entanglement tie them far too closely to these worlds, turning them into pawns of fiction. Ideal for an evening of escapism, the game is designed with a three-panel layout, so it can be folded into a pamphlet. Everyone at the table can have both their character sheet and a complete copy of the rules!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metafiction was designed as part of the Compact RPG Challenge at The Forge. It was inspired by Dan Simmons' Olympos and the excellent JAGS: Wonderland supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
