							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aeries of the Aevekar</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The wars of the Ground Walkers have taken their toll, too many of our people lie dead and broken on the cold hard earth. We must, for our own sake, retreat and take stock -- our place is the high aeries of our forefathers, the give of Zavonis&amp;quot; ~ Kelos Nom Zerinian: 1741 A.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of the Aevekar is fraught with these winged fae dying on behalf of those who walk the earth. They were once found everywhere on Shaintar, yet there are now only a few thousand left hidden in secret communities in the most difficult locations. The Kal-A-Nar Empire has declared genocide upon them after the death of the Emperor's favorite sone so this may not be a bad thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though scattered, some few leave the aeries each year to take their place among the Rangers, or fight alongside their fae brothers and sisters against any evil focused upon the land. In this book, you'll leanr the story of what happened to these folk and how they've survived. There's some new gear, edges, professions and you'll get a good look at what their lives are like within their homes. Scattered they may be, but these are among some of the best bowmen ever seen and they created aerial combat.  Take a tour of the aeries and learn a few secrets about the most hidden of them all - one no aevekar would ever admit exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn of their food, drink, society and what they find entertaining or artistic.  It shouldn't be surprising that wind instruments feature prominently in their music. While they aren't militarily inclined, everyone learns to fight and serves as protection for the aeire they live in. Their death rituals are particularly beautiful given their close relationship with Zavonis, Ascended of air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
