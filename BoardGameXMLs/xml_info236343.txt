			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shed some light on a land perpetually shrouded in shadow. Draw back the veil on this ancient nation and learn more about the people and places that make up the umbral lands of Nidal. Ruled by a brutal and oppressive theocracy, the nation of Nidal is among the oldest in the Inner Sea region and one of the most isolated. Its people hide in fear from the monsters who openly hunt the countryside, and those in cities, like the gothic capital Pangolais, keep their heads down when walking the streets among the masochistic priests of the Midnight Lord, Zon-Kuthon. Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Nidal, Land of Shadows presents a comprehensive look at this shadowy servitor state, a place of nightmarish creatures, tyrannical subjugation, and ancient mysteries. Whether you are looking for horror and conspiracy or wanting to uncover the history of this secretive nation, this book has everything you need to run a spine-chilling campaign in the land of shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
