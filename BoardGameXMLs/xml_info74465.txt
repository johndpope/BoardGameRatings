			<description>A 32 page booklet for adding fantasy elements such as magic users and their spells and various monsters and their special abilities to your existing set of miniatures rules. The inspiration comes from the popular literature of the time with an emphasis on the classic thematic elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three different types of magic users to add to your army:  Druids, Shamans, and Sorcerers.  Each gets 10 spell points to chose from the 25 available spells (cost 1-4 points each) but is limited thematically to what they may chose.  Adding a magic user to your army is expensive however, costing roughly the same point value as a Dragon, Giant, or a Commanding General.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty different classic monsters are created for your army by following a simple template system.  Here is an example of how to get stats for a goblin character by making conversions to your normal miniatures rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblins:&lt;br/&gt;Fight as:  Light, medium or light-medium infantry only.&lt;br/&gt;Movement:  As designated troop type.&lt;br/&gt;Frontage:  As designated troop type.&lt;br/&gt;Special:  Like Orcs, Goblins loose one morale grade for reaction test purposes in bright sunlight.&lt;br/&gt;Limits:  No more than one Goblin unit in an army may be designated as elite.  Goblins may never be classed as regular troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User Summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
