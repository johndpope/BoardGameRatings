							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Quintessential Rogue II: Advanced Tactics</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironically, for a character class that includes so much versatility, rogues are all too often pigeonholed into very narrow set roles. For some, the path of the rogue is not just a way to make easy money by taking what is not yours, or a path to the respect of your peers, who learn not to turn their back on you for fear of what you might do. The true master rogue takes pride in his work, determined to make more of himself than just another corpse in cheap leather armour, and achieving heights of prestige to which no other class can reach. The ideal rogue chooses his fields of study carefully and practices meticulously, making sure that his abilities complement one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the help of this sourcebook, any character choosing the rogue class will find many alternatives and options for expanding his range of abilities. With career paths, rogues can customize their advancement with their chosen branch of training; legendary classes offer an expansion of their character features that elevate them to epic levels and beyond. Multiclassing gives advice on to how best integrate two classes, while superior tools ensure that his performance is unparalleled. Insights are given into the use of easily overlooked spells and additional magical items are described, while the Gizmo is introduced as the last word in rogue equipment, along with rules and expansions on criminal rackets, confidence tricks and bank robbery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
