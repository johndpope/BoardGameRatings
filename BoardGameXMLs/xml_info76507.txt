			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pilotwings is a flight simulator video game developed by Nintendo EAD for the SNES and released in 1990. In both North America and Europe it was a launch title, and in Japan it was released shortly after the console's debut. Shigeru Myamoto was producer of the game and Koji Kondo co-composed the music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main game consists of a series of training areas that take place on a platform in the saea. In each area the player has to partake in four different flying events:&lt;br/&gt; - Light plane: Fly a plane through a series of rings and land the plane on the runway.&lt;br/&gt; - Skydiving: Jump from a helicopter and fly through a series of rings and land on a target area.&lt;br/&gt; - Rocket belt: Lift off, fly through a series of rings and land on a target area.&lt;br/&gt; - Hang glider: Fly using a hang-glider fly through rings and land on a target area. Use thermal currents to ascend.&lt;br/&gt; In every training area the player has to complete the four events and receive points based on the results. Points are rewarded based on landing accuracy, amount of rings flown through and time used. When a certain minimum score in a area is obtained, the player receives the certification for that area. The player can then advance to the next course. A number of areas have a bonus stage which allows for scoring more points. Bonus stages include controlling a man over a series of trampolines and controlling a penguin diving into a pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After receiving all certificates the player can do a helicopter mission. After completing that mission, more difficult training missions can be played. The target scores in these levels are higher and they feature more difficult weather conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses Mode 7 to create the 3D-like 'flat'-surface effect as in Mario Kart. &lt;br/&gt;The game was well received. Both for it's graphical style, as it's difficult level. &lt;br/&gt;A sequel was released on Nintendo 64. The game has also been released as a Virtual Console title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
