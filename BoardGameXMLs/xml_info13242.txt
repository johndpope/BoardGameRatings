							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lenny Henry&#039;s Stand-Up Comic Game</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to be the first player to end up in the center of the spiral board track and be named &amp;quot;Star of the Show&amp;quot; with comic Lenny Henry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to travel along the track, the player rolls a die and moves forward that number of spaces. If he ends up on a joke track, he rolls the die again and tells a joke of one of the following 6 types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Knock-Knock&lt;br/&gt;    News Flash&lt;br/&gt;    Limerick&lt;br/&gt;    Riddles&lt;br/&gt;    Impersonations&lt;br/&gt;    Tongue Twisters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player cannot think of a joke of the type rolled, he can look at one of the many Joke Cards that comes with the game. (These all seem to be &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; rated and many are very UK-oriented.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After telling a joke, the player rolls the die again to get a base score. This score will be modified by certain attributes pertaining to his joke telling, which include whether he used his own joke and how a vote of the other players goes. The player then moves forward a number of spaces equal to his revised score (or backwards if his score ends up negative). His turn continues until he lands on a non-joke space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These other spaces involve drawing event cards that give directions to be followed and some &amp;quot;Chutes and Ladders&amp;quot; type spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to end up in the center space by exact movement wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
