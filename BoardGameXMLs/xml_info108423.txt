			<description>The Game of Little n Big!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move the Slider Tiles to try to discover a Little Baby Tile that matches one of your Big Mommy Tiles.  Reunite the most Big N Little pairs to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box is a crucial part of the game setup.  There is a tray which fits in the box, and the 25 Little Baby Tiles are placed randomly on the tray.  A plastic punchout overlay sits on these tiles, and 24 slider tiles are placed on this with one space open.  This will give you something similar to a Sliding Puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each have 3 face-up Big Mommy Tiles.  On your turn, choose one of your face-up tiles and announce that you're looking for its associated Little Baby Tile.  You get up to 5 slide-moves to try to find it.  A slide-move consists of moving an adjacent Slider Tile into the open space.  This will uncover a different Little Baby Tile where the tile used to be.  You may continue sliding tiles until you either find the match for the Big Mommy Tile you named, or you have moved five Slider Tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiles match if they have a Mommy and Baby of the same animal (the game rules includes pictures of all the matching sets).  They also will have the upper and lower case versions of the same letter.  If you uncover a match on your turn, take a &amp;quot;MATCH&amp;quot; Scoring Token and cover the Big Mommy Tile.  Draw a new tile so you always have three face-up tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the last Big Mommy Tile is drawn, continue playing until the next MATCH is scored.  The game ends immediately, and the player with the most matches wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Concept of Big &amp;amp; Small, Upper &amp;amp; Lower Case Recognition, Memory &amp;amp; Matching&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
