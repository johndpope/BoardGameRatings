							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UTAH in a box</name>
									
			<description>Yet another Monopoly variant, but this is not the same as &amp;quot;Monopoly-Utah&amp;quot; by Hasbro, nor &amp;quot;Utah on Board&amp;quot; by Help on Board. Description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; Utah  is a land of incomparable natural beauty. It's varied terrain, from the snow capped mountains of northern Utah to the stunning red-rock country in the south, surrounds it's residents with breathtaking views on a daily basis. A place of great contrasts, the majestic Wasatch range rises dramatically behind the sparkling skyscrapers of progressive Salt Lake City. With a history forged by pioneers, Utah now embraces the future while delighting the eye and rejuvenating the soul. Yes...this is the place!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;UTAH IN-A-BOX was created with the help of Utah natives. We asked Utahns what makes this place so great. While it's impossible to include everything, UTAH-IN-A-BOX includes many of the highlights. Advertising space was not for sale on this game. The board includes authentic landmarks only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is full of mountains, parades, dinosaur footprints, salt, basketball, symphonies, ballet, a little more salt and lots of things Utahn! This is a game about a unique place, so roll the dice and take a hike! Who knows? You may win big in the Winter Games or become the proud owner of Skull Valley! Are you looking for a fun way to experience Utah? VOILA! -- behold; here it is!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Here's a quick idea of how to play: Buy property, build a skyline, trade the skyline for a key to the city. It sounds easy enough -- but add a traffic jam, property taxes, car fines and the IRS and it becomes a little more difficult and a lot more fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
