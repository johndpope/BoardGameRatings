							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rasslin&#039; Strategy</name>
									
			<description>Rasslin' Strategy is a 1990 pro wrestling card game by Mike Besky that normally requires (if not using an alternate rule) that the game be played WHILE wrestling is on, specifically wrestling that neither player has seen yet (original airdates, PPVs, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards, which are moves like Choke, Bodyslam and Dropkick, are realistically and competently illustrated black and white images with a few rules and values that are used to resolve success and score points. Gameplay involves playing cards from your hand that match those being performed in the currently playing matches on your television (if the match you're watching has Shawn Michaels using a dropkick, you can play Dropkick).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to pin your opponent of course, by playing the correct cards/sequences to end the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
