			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most shoot-em-up target games are 2-D shoot across the screen type, and quite frankly there is a glut of inferior ones.  A need for a new approach exists, such as fast 3-D HIRES simulations with clever and complex challenges.  How about shooting into the screen, into 3-D space, where the target is mathematically many feet behind the screen surface?  How about computer intelligent targets that shoot back and use strategy and learn?  How about all this and the best attributes of the more popular games?  Let's include high score, 10 levels of play, snappy sound effects, colorful explosions and real time graphics.  Why not go all the way and have a three dimensional gunsight?  A real space battle simulation.  Nah... no one would believe it or could even write it.  Right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrong! We have it.  And it is Super Starbase Gunner.  We are very excited about this product because it is all the things we wish we had and didn't.  And you can have it now with this introductory offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
