			<description>Magician is a side-scrolling role-playing game released in February 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was designed by Eurocom Entertainment Software and published by Taxan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Paul sets out with some food, water, and money. The player must navigate him through puzzles and mazes in order to acquire more items, which allow Paul to learn more spells, and weapons, which allow him to cast certain spells or shield himself. Also, Paul can interact with people, which can help him along his quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from Paul's health, the player also keep in mind his food and water levels, which decrease over time and are refilled by using food and water. The game uses a unique system for learning and using magic spells; the player transcribes spells by piecing together sets of phonemes to form magic words, and each spell has a corresponding word that must be written to learn it. Players can simply write the spell words for every single spell at the start of the game (although writing a spell costs 50 mana each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By helping NPCs and completing various tasks, Paul grows more experienced, increasing his maximum mana and his rank as a magician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a battery-backed save system, which allows the player to save their progress at any time. However, it only allows the player to save a maximum of 15 times, with four different save slots to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Magician (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
