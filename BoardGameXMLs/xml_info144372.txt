			<description>Subtitle: A storytelling game of cause and effect in a world of super beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Here I am with this body, and the government's blessing to use it for my benefit. It's massively strong, resistant to heat, cold, pressure and impact. I can hold my breath an hour and see at night like an owl with a telescope. Given all that, what should I do? ... What might I do? What would you do?&amp;quot; - Concrete&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if there really were superpowers? Unique individuals with abilities far beyond the normal people around them. What would those abilities be? What would people choose to do with those abilities? How would the world react to them? How would the world change?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;fingerprints is a unique role-playing game for 3 or more players. The game provides a structure for group storytelling, in the style of post-superhero comic books like The Authority, Concrete, or The Watchmen, using paper, dice, and free association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
