			<description>From eBay listing (Michelle Murray, used with permission):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cardboard board game cut off of a cereal box. It's called &amp;quot;Sgt. Preston Gets His Man&amp;quot; and comes with the playing field, a spinner, 4 little pawns and instructions. To make the spinner work, you would put a straight pin through the center and twirl it--there should be a tiny cardboard pointer but that part is missing [in the photos]. The cardboard playing board is about 6&amp;quot; x 6&amp;quot;, the spinner is 1 3/4&amp;quot; across, and each little pawn is 1/2&amp;quot; x 1/2&amp;quot;. There is no date but it's probably 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
