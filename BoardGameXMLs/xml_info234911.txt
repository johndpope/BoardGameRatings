							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quattele</name>
									
			<description>The name Quattele is the short form of &amp;quot;Quattro Elementa&amp;quot; - 4 elements, because in this strategy game for 2 - 4 players fire, earth, water and air fight against each other alone or in 2 teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special feature of Quattele is, that each element can only beat one of the other elements and is beaten itself by one. So, for example, water beats fire, but is beaten by earth. Water and air meet as allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are straightforward and the moves are basically simple, which is why players can quickly find themselves in the game. However, due to its special set of rules, Quattele offers a high degree of tactical challenge. The players have to attack as well as try to defend the opposing, allied element from the attacks of the opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you manage to reduce the 10 pieces of the opponent's elements by hitting them to 3 or to occupy the middle of the opponent's starting field, you win the battle of the elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
