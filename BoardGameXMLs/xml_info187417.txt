			<description>From the document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Okhrana, no one person controls the game; everybody round the table gets the chance to input. Sometimes an individual will play the role of their protagonist, an &amp;eacute;migr&amp;eacute; revolutionary who acts against the Czarist regime. Sometimes they will be asked to play the character of an antagonist, a member of the Okhrana, one of their informers, a spy or an ally in the French police, the Surete Generale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must create a protagonist for themselves. The protagonist is an individual upon whom a story will focus. That story is told in the form of six scenes, with the story of each protagonist being told, scene by scene, in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game originally was created in 24 hours as a 24-hour RPG contest entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
