			<description>WildGuns - The wild west. Where the buffalo roam on the vast prairie, Indians, cowboys and Mexicans fight for valuable land. Decide which side you want to be on. Establish a village and transform it into a powerful town. Make peace treaties, fight against enemy settlements or discover valuable goldmines. Light up the pipes of peace or dig up the hatchet. Conquer the prairie now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your nation from  Cowboys,  Mexicans and  Indians.&lt;br/&gt;Every nation has its own special qualities, so choose wisely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Found your village in the middle of a desolate prairie.&lt;br/&gt;Expand your villages and transform them into established and invulnerable bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect  wood from the forests, get  iron from the mine, dig for  clay and cultivate  grain on the fields so that you can extend your village and recruit warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore surrounding territories, discover hidden artefacts and develop new settlements to expand your area of influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build troops to defend your territories from enemy tribes or try to occupy enemy territories with the help of a little bit of violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
