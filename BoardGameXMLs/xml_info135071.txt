							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harvest Moon 3 GBC</name>
									
			<description>Harvest Moon 3 GBC, is a farm simulation video game for the Game Boy Color developed by Victor Interactive Software, part of the long-running Harvest Moon series of video games. Harvest Moon 3 is the last game for the Game Boy Color in the series, and also one of the most distinctive. Its original Japanese release was on two separate cartridges (one for the Boy side and one for the Girl side), but was combined into one single cartridge for overseas release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character may be chosen as a boy or a girl. The beginning and ending are different depending on which character the player chooses. The boy is a successful Rancher, living on the farm from Harvest Moon 2, who is asked by the mayor to help a girl on a nearby island run the farm of her father. The girl's beginning shows her trying to save Harry's farm by taking control of it. She then meets the boy character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvest Moon 3 takes place on an island, which has some mountainous regions, a grassland, a small village, and the farm where a lot of the game takes place. There are no shops to buy things like tools, crops, and animals; every Monday and Thursday a ferry is available to take the character to the mainland, where all of the shops reside. This is an element unique to Harvest Moon games, as most allow players to buy things whenever they desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Growing crops and raising livestock are among the prime tasks in Harvest Moon 3. But, as with many other HM games, the player has the opportunity to marry his/her partner, and even have a baby. There are some differences between playing as the male or female character; the girl starts out with a free cow and a brush, but cannot upgrade tools, when the boy character can. The male also has more stamina than the female. Also when the player marries as the girl, the game ends, but as a boy, the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Harvest Moon 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
