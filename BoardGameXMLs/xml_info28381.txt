Rolling a 6 results in reading and obeying some tasks on a randomly drawn event-card. The player, who provides the last playing piece for the individual patient's card, has cured the patient and gets his card.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most patient's cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
