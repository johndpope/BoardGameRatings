							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kobura</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smallest of the First Ones, Kobura are a subrace of Sobeka bred for scouting and foraging. These small snakemen range ahead of every First One army, preparing the ground for more powerful creatures and assisting them via ambushes and surprise attacks. Outside of First One service, Kobura are nomadic predators, less organized but hardly less dangerous than their soldierly brethren. Kobura have been bred for subservience for countless centuries - indeed, their race may have been magically created to serve the Khaynites. While this manifests itself as stolid obedience in the Kroca, in the Kobura it leads to obsequiousness. Unlike humanoid servants whose fawning is often directly proportionate to their disloyalty, most Kobura genuinely mean the compliments they heap upon their masters. Among those they consider equals, however, the Kobura are ruthless and conniving. Though they do not fear death, they seek prestige, and have been known to abandon comrades to a gruesome fate to advance their own cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Kobura (CR 1/2)&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Kobura Paragon (CR 3)&lt;br/&gt;     Kobura Miniature Counters&lt;br/&gt;     Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
