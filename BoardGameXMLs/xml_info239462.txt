			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Found Footage Savage Edition is an adventure seed for use with Contagion Savage Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface, it looks much like the world you and I live in. Just beneath that surface, in the shadows, rages an ancient conflict between supernatural factions who all seek dominion over the Earth and control over the souls of humanity. As a byproduct of this conflict, various factions have created inhuman monstrosities and released them into the world. While most average people are fortunate enough to never encounter such terrible creatures, those who do find themselves facing things that reason cannot explain. Often, this ends tragically for the poor souls who have stumbled upon the foot soldiers of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Found Footage Savage Edition centers on the aftermath of such an encounter. Two normal people set out on what should have been a normal weekend getaway that ends in tragedy. The only clues to the mystery of what happened to Monica Garrett and Jim McLeod are in videos and photos taken from Monica&amp;rsquo;s cellphone. It is up to the characters to solve the mystery of their disappearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
