							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pick-A-Plack</name>
									
			<description>This undated game combines die rolling with memory. Each player takes a bingo-like card with four numbered columns and seven rows of circles and covers each circle with a plastic disk (plack). On each card, 12 circles are blank, and the remainder have instructions such as &amp;quot;Pick-A-Plack&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Others cover one blank&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Have another turn&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Cover two blanks&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a die. On a 1-4, they may remove one plack from that column; on a 5, they must replace a plack on an open location of their choice; and on a 6, they may remove a plack from any one location. When removing a plack, they obey whatever instructions are underneath. The player who first removes all the placks on his card wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the random element of die rolling, the key to victory is using required replacement of placks to re-cover useful spots, and remembering which of these will be most useful in each future situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
