			<description>The game consists of a special die and a set of tiles. These depict things that dogs do (sniff, pee, run, etc.). In the basic game, the children take turns picking up a card and acting out the action. Then they can keep the tile. At the end of the game, the player with most different card colors is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a competitive variant, the players take turns rolling the die. A player rolling a dog symbol can pick up cards and act out the pictures and keep the tiles until another player rolls the dog symbol. The player with most tiles at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(user summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
