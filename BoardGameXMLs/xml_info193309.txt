			<description>The Devious Darkos Blackovian has gathered the most bizarre, dangerous and funny teams of creatures in his Arena in order to entertain and also surprise his audience which came from almost anywhere to bear witness to this weird spectacle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a team of creatures and the main goal is to get the creatures into the Arena and manage to get them out safe before any other player does.&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate turns rolling dice,playing creatures into the Arena and, if able, remove their creatures and/or pile them on other player's creatures in order to slow them down. Creatures have unique abilities that might come in handy during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn has 4 simple steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)Roll the dice.&lt;br/&gt;2)Play one or more creatures and/or remove or grab, if able.&lt;br/&gt;3)Use creature abilities, if able.&lt;br/&gt;4)Draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remove: means removing creatures from the Arena, if able.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab: grab another player's creature if it is not guarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guarded: a creature with at least one creature from the same team, on the same Arena space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who plays all of its team's creatures and removes them safely from the Arena wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
