			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRAIN GAME is an exciting memory game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards show well-known landmarks - but each card only shows half the picture.  The object of the game is to find the matching pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, place all the cards face down on the table.  Each player in turn turns 2 cards face up.  If they make a pair (they are the two halves of the same picture) that player takes the two cards and scores one point.  If they do not form a pair, the two cards are turned face down once again and the next player takes a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until all the matching pairs are found and the player with the most pairs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
