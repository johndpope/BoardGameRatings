			<description>Kabinettskrieg is a Grand Campaign module combining the games Cockpit of Europe, Sport of Kings, and Queens' Gambit in one very large scenario. IMPORTANT. All three base games are required for this module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kabinettskrieg is a multi-player operational study, for 2-6, or even more would-be generals; each player controls the forces of one of the major participating nations and its minor allies. Extra players can lead the troops of the same nation in individual theatres of the war. Although the players are divided into two Camps, victory is an individual goal as you try to win more glory than both your allies and your enemies. Do YOU have what it takes to become the greatest captain general of the Eighteenth Century?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the module is a set of the latest basic rules, charts, and tables (version 3.75) for the Lace Wars system. A few key concepts in this system include Operations Points, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. Operations Points are accumulated during periods of inactivity, in order to be spent during the course of active campaigning. If a player is unable or unwilling to spend OPs, his forces suffer attrition instead. The further forces are from their base of operations, the more severe the penalties will be. Whoever has the most OPs also has the initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map scale is 8.5 miles per hex. The counters are battalions and regiments. Units are rated for Strength (in battalions), Effectiveness (a combination of morale and training), and Movement. Turns are equivalent to months. Each turn is broken down into several phases - supply, operations, admin, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players alternate moving their formations, laying siege to fortresses and engaging in battle with the enemy field forces. The players have a degree of flexibility in what they do with their forces, but they are constrained by the Campaign Plan or plans that they choose. These dictate what objectives (usually fortresses) must be taken. A successfully completed plan will garner Prestige for a player. At the end of the game, the player with the highest prestige wins. In addition, bonuses can be won for victory in battle, and these may be used to buy rewards that improve a player's chances, or be used as influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaders have an important role to play, as befitting an era where personal command was critical. They are rated for skill or effectiveness, personality, and influence (i.e. the chance they have of retaining command despite their incompetence).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the concepts above, the supply system has been streamlined while keeping to the basic elements of foraging in tandem with the use of pre-positioned depots. River and canal movement has been taken into account and will prove as critical to success as the use of rail lines in more modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
