							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Verkade&#039;s Melbourne-race spel</name>
									
			<description>Simple roll-and-move race game themed for the 1934 MacRobertson International Air Race from from Mildenhall, England, to Essendon airport in Melbourne, Australia. The race was sponsored by confectionary magnate Sir MacPherson Robertson as part of the Melbourne Centenary celebrations. This game published as a promotion for Dutch biscuit company Verkade, is based on the heroic efforts of the Dutch team, flying a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines DC-2, who came second in the race overall but won the handicap prize.&lt;br/&gt;The board is a map of the eastern hemisphere from England to Australia, with 63 numbered circles (unusually, they are not contiguous nor connected by lines) marking cities both on and off (Peking, Algiers) the official race route. 12 of the circles are blue, and have penalties or bonuses described in the lower left of the board. &lt;br/&gt;The game is described as for &amp;quot;een onbeperkt aantal personnen worden deelgenomen&amp;quot; (an unlimited number of participants), and players much pay an ante of five collector cards from packets of Verkade biscuits. Some of the penalty spaces require payment of more cards into the pool. Although not specified, presumably the winner takes the pool of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
