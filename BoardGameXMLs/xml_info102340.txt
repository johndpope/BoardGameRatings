			<description>From the publishers web site:&lt;br/&gt;Toys themed memory game where the players are looking for a toys that go together. Gather the toys line up in front of you - the winner is the one who has the longest line when all the toys have been found. Easy and fun memory game youngest family!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More about the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with a cloth bag, a dog figure and 2 small houses that can put together.&lt;br/&gt;Each player on his turn takes out 3 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;On each tile there are different pictures. For example cat, marbled and a smile. Now, children need to find pictures that go together. Like smile and teeth, or cat and mouse, marbles and balls. There can be many variations in which parents are the judges about the pairs.&lt;br/&gt;Each time players get a pair, parent take on tile from the bag and place it back side up between the houses. On the back side of the tiles are the roads (a la Carcassonne). Game ends when the road are connected from one house to another. Dog moves on the road, so road must make sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
