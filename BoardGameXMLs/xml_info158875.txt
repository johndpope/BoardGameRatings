			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built by the trillium Industrial Group, the tpt-133 logistics transport is a common sight in the Versis Principalities. Their stylish, functional lines, combined with the outstanding quality and craftsmanship displayed in their construction, makes them popular throughout Foreven and the surrounding sectors, even after decades of service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn more about this versatile starship: whether you are looking for a well-used workhorse for your merchant crew, or a brand new hull with customized equipment and interiors to be a corporate executive's plaything; the Fat Cat is the ship you've been waiting for. Equipped with eight double staterooms and capable of carry a hundred tons of cargo in its yard configuration, the fat cat also boasts three hardpoints, a 4-ton orbital raft, and a bridge that is (almost controversially) luxurious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly a full year in development, this book aims to &amp;quot;raise the bar&amp;quot; among Traveller's third-party publishers. Inside, you'll find full technical and gameplay specs, along with detailed deckplans, background information, and amazing illustrations. It was the support of players like you that sent this book to the printers, and helped us earn the distinction of being the first starship supplement licensed for use with Marc Miller's Traveller5. We are giving gaming in the far future a new look; a level of detail never thought possible. I hope you enjoy the ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
