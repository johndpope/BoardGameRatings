							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Punk Rock Book Tour: The Boardgame</name>
									
			<description>Live the adventurous life of a publisher on the road! Meet fans, discover rare books, get peed on by cats! Just make sure you can scrape up enough gas money to get to the next city or it's game over, man, game over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Punk Rock Book Tour: The Boardgame, you go on a book tour with limited supplies. The player with the best haircut goes first. Drive the biofuel truck to PICK UP WASTE GREASE. Drive the waste grease to the PROCESSING CENTER to make fuel. Then drive to YOUR EVENT and on to the next city. If you run out of fuel, you move only one space. When the first player has completed three cities, the player with the most fuel wins. However, the player who has the most fun is the &amp;quot;real winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
