			<description>One of the first roleplaying games to be released for free online.  From the opening:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kimagure Orange Road is popular comic and animated TV series from Japan written by a very talented Japanese artist named Izumi Matsumoto.  The story focuses on the Kasuga clan, an ancient family line with rare esper powers (referred to here as &amp;quot;Cho-no Ryoku&amp;quot; powers, which translates simply as &amp;quot;super natural powers&amp;quot;), living in Japan, and on a love triangle between the main character, Kyosuke Kasuga, a cute but irritating girl named Hikaru Hiyama and the beautiful and enigmatic Madoka Ayukawa.  I liked the universe, liked the way the powers were set up, and decided to make an RPG system and try it out on my friends. And now you can too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a role-playing game.  It requires one person to be the Game Master (GM) and some 10 sided dice.  Also, you'll need some paper, pencils, junk food, xeroxes of the character sheets at the end of this file, and, oh yes, maybe people who care to play -- at least 2 players, but not more than 56.  Players generally assume the roles of &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; relatives, distant cousins of Kyosuke's branch of the family, etc., who were never in the series.  Players will have random esper powers and various stats to help define their character's abilities and goals.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Characters are family members of the esper clan, with a recommended age of 15-17. Characters can be male or female, but in order to play a male character, you have to roll for it (50/50 chance on a d10); you can choose to be female (presumably to have a higher concentration of female characters, as in the manga/anime).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three abilities in the game: Fighting (for combat), Smarts, and Dai-suki (looks/charisma/appeal). You roll 1d10 for each skill, but are allowed to re-roll 1s and 2s. From this base level, you can add up to 10 additional points among all 3 abilities. No ability can go past 15, which is god-like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After setting your abilities, you roll percentage dice 3 times on a table to be assigned personality traits, special abilities, backgrounds, and so on. Some traits can only be kept by certain sexes. These traits can affect ability scores. Some traits give more rolls on the traits table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also have other skills: English, Sports, Driving, Kakko (style), Virginity, and Swimming. These range from 1-10, or have yes/no/sort-of values. There is a formula involving a d10 die roll and particular abilities or traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game have their own personal goals, in addition to the goals of the adventure, creating interesting conflicts. Sometimes these goals come from traits, sometimes they are assigned by the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are hit points in the game, from 5-17 depending upon bonuses. If a player reaches 0, they are &amp;quot;beaten up&amp;quot;. Combat is not the main focus of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Power Points, for esper powers, ranging from 7-11 points. Powers cost a fixed amount per use. Characters have 1 primary power and three or more secondary powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
