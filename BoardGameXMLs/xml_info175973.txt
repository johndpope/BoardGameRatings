							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hunters A.D. 2114</name>
									
			<description>The Hunters is a cooperative miniatures board game for 1-4 players. Become a machine hunter and face the enemies in a brutal post-apocalyptic world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players become the Hunters of machines who wander between human settlements and together hunt dangerous enemies. Each mission, taking from 30 to 90 minutes, requires an adequate choice of gear and tactics. The players can also lay deadly traps and prepare ambushes. A day and night system is used in the game which has a significant impact on the choice of equipment and enemies' action abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each mission players gain experience points allowing them to reach new levels of training and be better prepared for survival in the hostile world. The most precious prize though is the remains of the defeated machines used to construct the hunters' gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the missions combine into an outstanding campaign during which the players will have to make tough choices influencing their future fate. Each time the will be able to make different decisions allowing every mission to be an exceptional experience full of new emotions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
