							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Island PIZZA</name>
									
			<description>The aim of the game is to collect the first one pizza of any color of the 6 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards represent pieces of pizza from 3 pairs of different types and 3 different colors (red, green, yellow), on some cards there are Hero-cards (Pepper, Mushroom, Knife and Fork), which has useful effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think it's easy? It was not there, because in the game you'll not only find repeated pieces, discarding the wrong color, but also strongly interfere with favorite neighbors, using the effects of the Hero-cards. You can choose from and sharing bits and reset of the selected card and diabolical plans rigging the deck! Yes! We legalized cheating a little ))) Here is an adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who are and it will seem easy, we have prepared Advanced Rules. The game adds a Ship-Captain special card and achievements!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now 3 cards will always be open to players that provides an opportunity not only rely on luck and memory, but also to plan their actions! Special cards and achievements offer a real challenge - not just to win the game, but also to fulfill some conditions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We thought about the smallest! For them there are Easy Rules, and card-tip and full-sized Pattern-hint (on the back of the Rules)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play with children from 5 years for Easy Rules and from 7 and 10 years for Basic and Advance Rules. The party lasts 10-20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
