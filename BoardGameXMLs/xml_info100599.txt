			<description>Videomation is a North America-exclusive video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System that allows players to create artwork using a mostly freestyle method and have them come to life with full video animation. The game does not support the use of a mouse or any other external component; forcing players to rely on the NES game controller to draw objects. There is a basic grey screen with plenty of logos around it. This game used the CHR RAM chip that was also used in a variety of NES video games during its era. Thirteen different variations of palettes and seven different kinds of tools (including various geometric shapes and the eraser) promise to enhance the creativity of any project. Once the player chooses one of the palettes, there are different colors to choose. Some of the fancier colors include: turquoise, pink, purple, light blue, and colored that have been dithered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's instruction manual has included some ideas for drawing including: Crazy geometric designs with intense patches of color, graceful birds flying over untamed jungles, souped-up cars on a race track, and dinosaurs in the player's imaginary backyard. Pictures and video can be saved by recording the work through a VCR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Videomation&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
