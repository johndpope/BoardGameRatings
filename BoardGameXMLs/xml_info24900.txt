							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dhaemon</name>
									
			<description>Played in Mauritania and Western Sahara, Dhaemon is a game similar to checkers and/or Seega. It is played on a 9x9 grid, usually made out of piled sand, and the opposing game pieces are frequently represented by short sticks on one side and dessicated camel droppings on the other. It has been featured in the travel book &amp;quot;Sahara&amp;quot; by Michael Palin, and the BBC TV series of the same name [2002].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible that this is the game referred to as Srand or Dhamet by Lh&amp;ocirc;te.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
