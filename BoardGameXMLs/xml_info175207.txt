			<description>Big Bucks is one of the games published in Math on a Roll, a book of number games using polyhedral dice. It is designed to help teach adding decimals to children. It is played with a 20-sided and a 12-sided die. In turn, players roll the two dice. The smaller number represents the dollars they gain, and the larger number the cents.  Players take turns, adding up their totals and they go. After ten turns, the player with the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
