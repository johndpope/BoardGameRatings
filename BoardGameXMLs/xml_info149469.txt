							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Secret of Eastvale</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party has traveled for several days and come across the small village of Eastvale where the villagers give them a less than warm welcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jorg the local shopkeeper sneaks into the party's room and pleads for their help. He explains to that a Witch of the Wilds has placed the village under a spell and even kidnapped Ardnis, his only daughter. He begs the party to help him and is willing to pay them with them a few items he has managed to acquire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any investigations around the village offer little light on the situation and only make the party more suspicious or at least confirm that something odd is going on. After this, they should decide to head into the woods and face off with the witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
