			<description>Libra symbolizes balance and harmony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIBRA was invented by N&amp;eacute;stor Romeral Andr&amp;eacute;s on January 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIBRA is a 2-player board game of asymmetrical goals played on a hexagonal grid of any shape and size. Two players (MORE and LESS) share a common pool of stones in two colours. MORE will try to create as many groups of connected stones of the same colour as possible, while LESS will try to avoid that many groups from being created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIBRA combines these well known mechanics into a new interesting game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- MORE vs LESS (asymmetrical goal)&lt;br/&gt;- Group counting&lt;br/&gt;- Placement of any colour&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A hexagonal grid of any size and shape. For beginners, a hexagon of 5 cells per side is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;- A supply of stones in 2 colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nestorgames edition will include around 200 stones in two colours and a hexagonal board (with 5, 6 or 7 hexes per side depending on skill level).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 types of gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duel: The game takes place over two rounds. In the first round, one player plays as &amp;lsquo;MORE&amp;rsquo;, the other as &amp;lsquo;LESS&amp;rsquo;. In the second round, the roles reverse. Whoever creates more groups playing the &amp;lsquo;MORE&amp;rsquo; role wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bid: Before the game starts players take turns announcing how many groups they think they can create, raising the number each time. The player that passes first plays as &amp;lsquo;LESS&amp;rsquo;, and the other player plays as &amp;lsquo;MORE&amp;rsquo; and must create at least as many groups as she bid to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with &amp;lsquo;LESS&amp;rsquo;, players alternate turns placing a stone of any colour on an empty cell of the board. The game ends when all the cells have been occupied (or by mutual consent).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count the number of groups of connected stones for both colours. This is the &amp;lsquo;MORE&amp;rsquo; score. Isolated stones are also considered groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
