							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mall Game</name>
									
			<description>The Mall Game, Richmar Incorporated, 1977. I assume that this one was sold at shopping malls in the seventies. Somewhat Monopoly-like. You buy a lot and then lease stores. Although it looks pretty dull, this is a *fantastic* game as far as looking back at so many stores that no longer exist and the great seventies USA mega-mall boom in general. And who couldn't like a game where young players shop at the now-defunct Fredericks of Hollywood for a fancy nightie?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
