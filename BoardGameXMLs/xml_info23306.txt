							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Church On The Way</name>
									
			<description>Church On The Way sets out to loosely simulate the influx of new church plants into a city. Up to six players each decide on a church name and draw their first two leaders to add to their church of twenty members and a very small budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses each church looks to increase their 'Holiness', 'Theology' and 'Holy Spirit' points through preaching different topics from the 'Preaching Track' (each of which give different variations of point provision - for example preaching on Biblical Truth gives +3TH while preaching on Serving allows an extra leader to be drawn next turn). Points can also be gained from buying equipment and events (buying Original Greek New Testaments gives a Theology bonus each turn for example).&lt;br/&gt;These equipment and events can also be used to increase the size of the church (Church barbecues, Harvest Festivals, Bible Weeks etc)or to make your current members happier (doughnuts, china cups, quality tea, comfy chairs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make sure the church can afford to pay the rent of the pub meeting room it is meeting in and look for bigger and better buildings to rent and buy that are on the market!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However church life isn't always fun and roses, watch out for the potentially damaging &amp;quot;Event Cards&amp;quot;. Some good, some bad, some indifferent, but all a talking point, as the churches look to grow, compete or work together in a game trying to balance between dry wit, in-jokes and a business simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But which church is the most rounded and most developed by the time all the world's people groups have been reached?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
