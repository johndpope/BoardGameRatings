							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Numinoes</name>
									
			<description>Numinoes is a strategic board game inspired by Othello (Reversi), Dominoes and modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting position is two tiles from each player laid on the board (d4, e5 and d5, e4). The players take turn where they try turn a line by lining up with one of their tiles separated by the opponent's tiles. The players play until there is no more moves possible and the winner is the one who has the highest score calculated from the values of the tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra tiles are special moves designed to change the tide in one or another's player favour. They are :stop, :swirl, :gold, :bomb and :star (described below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stop tile prevents an opponent to turn all tiles in a line up until the stop tile (included) rather than until the opponent&amp;rsquo;s bounding tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A swirl tile turns all the opponent&amp;rsquo;s tiles aside in all 8 directions plus all playable line up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A gold tile behaves like stop tile but cannot be turn ever. It can be laid down at the beginning to add a handicap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bomb tile explodes the tiles aside in all 8 directions regardless of the colour. The tile itself can stay on the board for an added handicap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A star tile gives extra points (e.g. 5 points) and cannot be turned ever but will not prevent a line up to turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
