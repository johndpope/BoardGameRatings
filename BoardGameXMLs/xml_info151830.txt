							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cave System</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 1&amp;rdquo;=5' battle map of a cave system.  It could be used with any game system, though fantasy gaming systems and settings were the target.  I have intentionally left the spaces within the cave system predominately generic (meaning no Goblin Lord's throne, no rooms with chests of treasure, no skeletons of dead adventures, etc.) so that any GM's that use this can fill each room with whatever their heart desires, and to ensure that this map will be compatible with as many systems as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     80&amp;quot; x 80&amp;quot; in size.  That's almost 7' of gaming space squared!&lt;br/&gt;     HEX and SQUARE grids for each type of map listed below.  Each one is sized to be 1&amp;quot; = 5' of gaming space.&lt;br/&gt;     Full Color Version &amp;ndash; This is a printer intensive, full color version of this map.&lt;br/&gt;     Printer Friendly Full Color Version &amp;ndash; This version reduces the load on your ink cartridges by replacing inaccessible earth areas with blank white space.&lt;br/&gt;     Black and White version &amp;ndash; A black and white version that replaces the inaccessible earth areas with blank white space. Meant to be the least printer intensive of all of the maps.&lt;br/&gt;     Natural looking cavern, with mossy floors, bioluminescent mushrooms (which provide the light that feeds the moss), stalagmites, and even an underground river.  There is also a bridge that crosses the river, allowing access to the other side of the map.&lt;br/&gt;     Intentionally generic so that this map is useful with multiple gaming systems and/or settings, and so that GM's can create their own stories within these caves and fill it with whatever monsters, treasure, traps, or challenges they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
