			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player manages the public transport system running between various towns. His job is to establish and maintain routes of transportation. Two gaming styles offer completely different gameplay: The first is to play the successful entrepreneur, whose main objective is to achieve maximum profits. The other is to play the role of the government official in charge of public transport, whose main concern is the well-being of his citizens and, obviously, the citizens' votes in the next election.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of special events add to the atmosphere of the game and keep it interesting: Try coping with the traffic generated by the World Cup Final!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
