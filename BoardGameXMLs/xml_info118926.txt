							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kamen Rider Hibiki</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on Kamen Rider Hibiki (仮面ライダー響鬼（ヒビキ） Kamen Raidā Hibiki, Masked Rider Hibiki), a Japanese tokusatsu superhero television series. The television show is the fifteenth installment in the popular Kamen Rider Series of tokusatsu programs. It is a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei. Kamen Rider Hibiki first aired on January 30, 2005 and aired its final episode on January 22, 2006. This series is noted for introducing new themes and styles yet unseen in other shows. The catchphrase for the series is &amp;quot;To us, there are heroes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The video game Kamen Rider Hibiki (仮面ライダー響鬼 Kamen Raidā Hibiki) featured a unique cross compatibility with the Taiko no Tatsujin Tatacon controller, where the taiko-like controller could be used in the rhythm game-like sections of Hibiki. It was also released alongside a special edition of the Taiko no Tatsujin series which included the theme songs of the Kamen Rider Hibiki TV show (&amp;quot;Kagayaki&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Shōnen yo&amp;quot;). A release for the Nintendo GameCube was planned, but ultimately scrapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kamen Rider Hibiki&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
