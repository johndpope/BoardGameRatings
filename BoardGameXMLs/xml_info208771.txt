							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Period Game</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the designers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Period Game strives to turn a typically uneasy situation into a fun, positive, learning experience. It is designed to teach participants about what is happening within the female body and how to &amp;quot;go with the flow.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn begins with a player turning one of the two ovaries, releasing a marble into the tray below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A red marble came out? Congrats! You got your period. A clear marble? Better luck next time.  Depending on where your marble takes you, play a protection card, preparation card or go to the nurse&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make it around the board before anyone else to win. Either way, you&amp;rsquo;re a pro at handling your period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
