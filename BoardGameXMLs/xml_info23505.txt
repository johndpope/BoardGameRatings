			<description>Anybody studying the history of the American Indians? &lt;br/&gt;For an innovative addition to your curriculum, you might try Beaver Tooth, a game played for centuries by the &amp;quot;First People of the Pacific Northwest.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a woven basket, four carved beaver teeth (dice), and a bundle of &amp;quot;counting bones.&amp;quot; (In the original game, the beaver teeth were real teeth and the counting bones, bird bones; in the modern version, both are reproductions, made from bone-colored polymer.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple, fast-paced, and fun: depending on the fall of the carved teeth, players win counting bones; the player with the most bones at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An accompanying color-illustrated booklet (Beaver Tooth: An Authentic Game from the First People of the Pacific Northwest by David G. Gordon &amp;amp; Mike Kowalski) contains a native legend about the origin of the beaver, historical background information about the Indian tribes of the Pacific Northwest, a list of related reading suggestions, and a history of the Beaver Tooth game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For two or more players, aged 6 and up. $19.95; from the Skookum Jump Rope Co., Box 1159, Port Townsend, WA 98368; (800) 255-9526; fax (360) 379-9049.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Authentic good fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial proceeds help support the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
