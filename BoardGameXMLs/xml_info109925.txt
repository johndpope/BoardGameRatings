							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Splash Page Special</name>
									
			<description>The title appears to be an old journalism phrase, relating to special editions with lots of photographs about a special event.&lt;br/&gt;Players must collect sets of two or three, by enquiring of other players &amp;quot;Do you have card so-and-so?&amp;quot;. If a player gets a pair, he may play it in front of him but should someone get the third, they can claim the other two. At the end, a set in front of you scores points (each set varies in this regard). First to 50 points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;The Splash Page Special card is a kind of Joker and is the only card not relating to a unique set.&lt;br/&gt;Variant rules are provided for playing a type of Snap with the same cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
