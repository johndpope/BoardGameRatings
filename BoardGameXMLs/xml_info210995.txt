			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is designed as an imaginative conversation/narrative style game to be played around a table, campfire or gathering place. You are encouraged to use words, gestures, actions and sounds to describe your behavior, but always be respectful of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be sure to establish safe rules if you do choose to LARP this game in any way and respect the boundaries and personal space of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, one person will read this instruction sheet aloud to the group. When the text says so, pass this sheet of directions to your left and the next player will read to continue playing. You can play the game with 2 people, but 3 or more are recommended. Even large groups should still find this game enjoyable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
