							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Geronimo</name>
									
			<description>One player rolls five dice (each side of the die bearing a different color). The result is called &amp;quot;Geronimo&amp;quot;. All players will ante chips into the pot. Each player will then ante another chip and then attempt to match the Geronimo. If three of the five dice match, he may reroll the remaining two. If one of the two match, he may then take a third roll of the remaining die. If the dice match the Geronimo, the player wins the pot. During play, other combinations of dice may win the player lesser rewards from the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when the pot is exhausted and the winner has the most chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
