							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">2 Player Soccer Squad</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Typical football (soccer) manager game with one twist: it hasa hot seat mode. Player who's turn it is not should, however, look away, as the on screen stats of the other player's team show to much info. Games are fully AI, so then it's up to the players to enjoy the match and cheer at the screen, after which a new round of buying and selling soccer players starts, and determining set-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
