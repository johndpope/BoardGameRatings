			<description>After the heist, there&amp;rsquo;s always room for an argument &amp;ndash; an argument about who gets the least, who gets the most, who gets enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Can&amp;rsquo;t Win is a player-versus-player trick-taking rule-making game. Each round, you&amp;rsquo;ll try and lay out a rule for the rest of the game, you&amp;rsquo;ll see if that rule sticks, then see if your final card is one of the few cards that has a chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll find you just can&amp;rsquo;t win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But maybe you can make sure someone else can&amp;rsquo;t win, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Can&amp;rsquo;t Win comes with twenty cards and two facing cards for the deck to keep things looking nice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Can&amp;rsquo;t Win requires very little table area, and players will need to be able to read or handle one another&amp;rsquo;s cards, so being able to reach a common area is important. It does require some reading, but not much math. The game&amp;rsquo;s in a single shared deck that only needs to be shuffled once per game, and nobody needs anything to track the game&amp;rsquo;s points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
