			<description>This is a preschool game suitable for small children BUT there are enough interesting tactics to make this a viable game for older children or adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll two dice each turn. The first one determines which color worm to move (half of the dice sides permit you to choose a color) the second shows how many spaces to move. If you manage to completely surround an apple on the board you keep it. Play continues until all 19 apples are gone and the player with the most apples wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a simple roll and move game. Children will enjoy moving the worms to get apples but there are always a few decisions regarding what path to take each turn. At a somewhat more advanced level there are decisions to make to limit your opponents choices and scoring opportunities each turn and potentially maximize your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
