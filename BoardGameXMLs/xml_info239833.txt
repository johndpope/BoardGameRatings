							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Under Western Skies: Twilight Trails</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opening of the American frontier in the latter half of the 19th Century offered hope, opportunity, wealth, discovery, and the chance to make a mark in a country finding its way onto the world stage. But the panoramic landscapes and the endless skies hid many dangerous secrets. And behind them, the shadows boiled with the turbulence of a secret war raged for no less than human destiny itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under Western Skies: Twilight Trails is Gunsmoke meets The X-Files &amp;mdash; dark secrets, shadowy conspiracies, and subtle supernatural occurrences in the Old West. Behind the cattle drives, shootouts, posses, and Indian attacks, vampires stalked the night for fresh victims; were-creatures awoke the next day in human form wondering what happened the night before; things that defied comprehension plotted ways to invade our reality; and extraterrestrial beings walked our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twilight Trails is designed to allow the Referee to introduce the paranormal and the horrific into the backdrop of the Old West. Heroes take the roles of investigators of the strange and occult, and occasionally get a glimpse of the secret war going on in the background. It includes a new Characteristic, several new Skills, advice for the Referee in running the campaign, an overview of the campaign&amp;rsquo;s Big Secret, and stats for the major combatants of the Secret War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under Western Skies: Twilight Trails. The Wild West is wilder than you thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
