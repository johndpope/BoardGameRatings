							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dyrisa Castle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dyrisa is the second largest settlement in the Kingdom of Kanday and the principal seat of King Andasin IV and the royal House of Kand. The town prospers from its position on the road between Aleath and Coranan, two of H&amp;acirc;rn's largest towns. The area around Dyrisa was sacred to the Ariathe tribe and is the site of many barrow graves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dyrisa article describes the town's history, government, religion, and economics, and provides details for some of the settlement's craftsmen and other locations, including the mysterious barrow grave of Asagran the Ghoul, a depraved former ruler of Dyrisa. Includes full-color GM and player maps as well as complete floor plans for Caer Dyrisa, the king's castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics article and was originally published in 1986 as part of the Kanday Kingdom Module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
