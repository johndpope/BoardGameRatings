			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloody rebellion in neighbouring kingdoms recently prompted the ruler of this realm to at least give his rule the face of a constitutional monarchy. As he was a rather benevolent and successful ruler and his propaganda network works rather well most of his subjects don't mind that the vast majority of their representatives are the very landed nobles to which they owe fealty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those are seated at the fragile glass tables, on simple wooden chairs without backrest, ringing the centre of this hall and the podium of the speaker situated there. Simple barons sit in the back, counts and earls slightly closer to the centre while the tables at the very front are reserved for the dukes of the provinces. It is their duty to represent the interests of the fiefdoms they control and their votes are weighted according to size and population of the very same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the very back, behind even the lowliest baron the actual elected representatives of the peasantry stand. They usually are influential heads of guilds and councilmen of the realm's cities. The king or his representative is seated  on  a platform raised above all others. Numerous gates lead in and out of the room around its circumference and above them tapestries in the realms colours are hung.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
