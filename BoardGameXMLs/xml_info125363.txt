							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Plaza</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The well kept, two stories tall houses of successful citizens, built from whitewashed brick and stone to reduce the risk of spreading fire, surround this small square in a residential neighbourhood at the same time separating it from the narrow and much darker streets. Like the streets connecting to it the plaza is plastered with cobblestones and unlike said streets it is well lit by lanterns flanking each door leading out onto the square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other squares that double as market places this one is rather quiet. Usually only frequented by the locals and rarely used to celebrate festivals by the very same people. One distinguishing feature of the plaza is its marble fountain, paid for by the rich merchants living here, always flowing with fresh, clean water pumped up from a deep well below the fountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
