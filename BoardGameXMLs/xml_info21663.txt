			<description>Looney Laundry is a game designed for children ages 4 and up.  The object of the game is to be the first player to successfully discard all their laundry pieces into the talking, electronic laundry hamper. After each roll and subsequent movement, the players push the hamper's eyes where he will either tell you what a good job you're doing, lose a turn or burp and eject the pieces that were discarded out of the tray. The ejected pieces are now part of that players hand in which they now have more pieces to get rid of. First player to get rid of all the pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
