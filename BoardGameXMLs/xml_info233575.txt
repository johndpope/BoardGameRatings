							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloody Jack (S&amp;W)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the children of the Blight know the nursery rhymes about Bloody Jack Carver, cautionary tales for naughty or overly inquisitive children to mind their manners and obey their parents. However, their parents know the true horror of those times 30 years ago when the lunatic serial killer known as Bloody Jack Carver stalked the fog-shrouded streets of the Blight and abducted children. The killing spree finally ended, but the perpetrator was never caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the PCs are deputized to assist in a homicide investigation, they find terrifying clues that point to the three-decade-old Bloody Jack killings and signs to indicate that they were just the beginning. Now the PCs are in a race against time across the breadth of the decrepit and deteriorating city that is the Blight as they attempt to stop a new killing spree before it can start. The PCs&amp;rsquo; investigation takes them from the halls of the Capitol and the seedy streets and alleys of Toiltown to the garish carnival piers of Festival and the pollutant-crusted banks of the Great Lyme River. Only they stand between the children of this decayed city and new nursery rhymes being written in their blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloody Jack is a stand-alone adventure set in the Blight for 4&amp;ndash;6 5th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
