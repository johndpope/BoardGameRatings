							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The genreDiversion 3E Manual</name>
									
			<description>Go beyond just a diversion with this revised and expanded genreDiversion universal roleplaying rules manual that is more versatile, more dynamic, more heroic, and more exciting. This book provides a game system that is not only easy to learn and quick-playing, but also extremely customizable and flexible. The rules are simple, allowing you to get down to business -- playing the game -- quickly. Optional rules can either be ignored or easily implemented -- and provide a framework for building your own game elements. Consistent mechanics for characters, vehicles, and creatures avoid confusion. Built-in rules for magic, and guides for directing the game and adapting older titles expand the game's horizons even further. If you've been looking for a roleplaying game system that you can sink your teeth into quickly and has the versatility needed for just about any setting, look no further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Ability-Centric Characters&lt;br/&gt;      Focus on a character's raw potential rather than his training to get things done. While skill refines a character's accomplishments, raw talent makes them happen.&lt;br/&gt;    * Create Characters Your Way&lt;br/&gt;      Characters can be built using a variety of methods, from random choices to arbitrary or controlled assignments. Custom species and vocations can be created as a framework for characters in a particular setting. New gimmicks can be devised to add special powers, such as for the supernatural and scientific enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;    * Quick Resolution&lt;br/&gt;      Roll dice (two six-sided) only for tough and contested challenges, maintaining a smooth progression of story. Resolve focused situations like combat using a simple scale of difficulty that can be influenced by various factors. Utilize optional elements like experience to gain the advantage or exploits to make the most out of success.&lt;br/&gt;    * Vehicles and Monsters&lt;br/&gt;      Apply the same basic mechanics to vehicles and monsters, from cars and starships to dragons and sea monsters. Engage in chases, dog-fights, and even desperate battles with larger-than-life creatures.&lt;br/&gt;    * Miniatures and Maps&lt;br/&gt;      Miniatures and maps can be used to better visualize combat and vehicle interactions. While this adds a more tactical feel for those who prefer such elements, it is not required.&lt;br/&gt;    * Unbidden and Forsaken&lt;br/&gt;      Dive into the action with a ready-to-use modern setting based on our older Unbidden game.&lt;br/&gt;    * Compatibility&lt;br/&gt;      Convert or interact with characters/elements from genreDiversion i, Iron Gauntlets, Story Engine Classic, and Active Exploits Diceless Roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
