			<description>A soccer simulation for 2 players. Each player is dealt 5 cards which are used to move the ball around the field. The field is divided into squares and on each card there are numbers that indicate the direction the ball can move and how long. When the cards can be used to move the ball into the goal the player scores. When the deck of cards runs out it's half time, the deck is shuffled and the second half is played in the same way as the first one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
