							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Haven</name>
									
			<description>A fixed set Deckbuilding Game based on the upcoming iOS Card Game of the same name. War Command blends traditional elements of collectible card games with the gameplay of a tabletop strategy game. The game plays out similar to chess, with each player maneuvering their six character cards to attempt to attack and kill the enemy commander character. &lt;br/&gt;Players can use three actions each turn to move characters, attack with characters, or play support cards from their hand, like a spell or upgrade card. When attacking or being attacked, players can also play attack or defense cards which only affect that instance.&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay and Deckbuilding are both quick and easy to learn, but deep and open for exploration. The game storyline revolves around three races (the reptilian G'harrana, the technologically advanced Delylians, and the war-hardened Humans) who have fled to the same remote planet to avoid a wave of radiation that is wiping out all life in the galaxy. Their fragile civilizations, crumbling from the expense of the migration effort, are unable to maintain communications due to the planetwide frequency of magnetic storms. The units on the ground are soon isolated, and must make new allies to stay alive. This is reflected in game in that you can mix races in your decks ;)&lt;br/&gt;The storyline is brought to life on each and every card through the spectacular artwork of established artists like Keith Thompson and Shaun Mitchell, as well as younger talents like Austen Mengler, Ven Locklear, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
