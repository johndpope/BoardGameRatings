							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Command Ops: Highway to the Reich</name>
									
			<description>As the first official expansion pack for the award winning Command Ops series, Command Ops: Highway to the Reich from acclaimed developer Panther Games brings us to the setting of one of the most epic and controversial battles of World War II: Operation Market-Garden. The Highway to the Reich expansion pack is a set of 13 scenarios covering all of the major actions that took place during the Market Garden Campaign in Holland during September 1944.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenarios cover every major engagement along Hell&amp;rsquo;s Highway, from the surprise capture of Joe&amp;rsquo;s Bridge by the Irish Guards a week before the offensive to the final battles on &amp;ldquo;The Island&amp;rdquo; south of Arnhem. The dramatic parachute and glider landings of the US 82nd and 101st Airborne, The British 1st Airborne and the Polish Brigade are all represented on some of the largest maps ever created for the series and the largest &amp;ldquo;campaign&amp;rdquo; scenario in this system to date. More than just a conversion of the old scenarios to play on the new system, the Expansion Pack represents a major update of Panther Games ground breaking classic game Highway to the Reich, incorporating numerous corrections to Maps, Orders of Battle, Unit Compositions, Reinforcement Schedules, and overall game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command Ops: Highway to the Reich is an expansion for Command Ops: Battles from the Bulge and requires the base game to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
