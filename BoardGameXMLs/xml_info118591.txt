			<description>A &amp;quot;persistent world&amp;quot; multiplayer boardgame designed to be run continuously for at least 48 hours, preferably more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marketeer is a card-based sci-fi exploration, trading and combat game in a persistent board game universe. It requires one game master and one book keeper on deck at all times. A minimum of three of each is recommended for anyone attempting to set up a session. I've listed 8 players as a minimum, but that would probably be pretty sparse. 30-50 is probably recommended. any more than that, and you will probably have people waiting in line to play for most of the peak hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players set up corporations made up of up to three players. Each corporation collects and trades resources, makes bets on the stock market and can battle other players. The goal is to be the corporation with the highest score at the end of the game session. There are also individual goals (called Legend Trials) and many other accolades for achievements throughout the game, such as being the first to build a star base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into four phases with slightly different rules and prerequisites. Each card in the game has four different functions: as ship part, as cybernetic upgrade, natural resource and combat maneuver. How to collect and transform cards is one of the main mechanics of the game, the second is the card-vs-card combat system and the last the financial betting system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
