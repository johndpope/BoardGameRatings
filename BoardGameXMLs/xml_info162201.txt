			<description>This book has 4 board games and a crossword with some easy games used to explain Ancient Egypt to kids. The book also has punchable hard stock counters and even a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four board games are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the river floods. 2 players. Two farmers compete to bring all of their harvest to the granary before the river Nile floods. They must follow a circuit and can have encounters with gods disguised as animals that can help them or harm them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chariot race in Thebes. 2 players. Two teams of two chariots race for victory in a circuit full of bifurcations, barriers and even a herd of goats that moves really slow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding Ra's crown. 1 player. Choose your adventure game in which you read the description for each chamber inside a pyramid and must choose your next action. Many lead to death, only one leads to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senet. 2 players. The original ancient Egypt Senet game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's also a crossword made with Egyptian hieroglyphic instead of latin letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
