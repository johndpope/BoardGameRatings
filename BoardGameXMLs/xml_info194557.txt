			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This high quality deck of cards is an excellent supplement for a game of Night Witches. Each deck includes a set of quick advancement cards with fictional prompts that make running a one-shot even easier. In addition there are portrait cards and medal cards, both of which can be used as visual props in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a full-color deck of 109 standard-sized cards printed on premium card stock, double-sided, with rounded-corners and a low-gloss UV Coating, making it an attractive addition to your tabletop game. Here's what's included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;37 Portrait Cards: Each of these cards includes a custom black and white illustration of an airwoman created by Claudia Cangini. Use them to represent your character or one of the non-player characters in the Regiment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;27 Medals Cards: Each of these cards displays an actual Soviet medal, complete with citation script on the back. Hand them out to players as they earn the awards, reading the citation aloud!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 Advancement Cards: These cards are designed to make running a one-shot game easier to set up by quickly advancing play past the starting duty stations. Hand out the cards randomly and see which characters earn medals, promotions, new abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 Airplane Cards: These illustrations of planes and targets are useful for demonstrating formations and maneuvers as well as letting you easily assign&lt;br/&gt;navigators and pilots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Articles Card: A handy reference for the text of Articles 58 and 133, so that you'll know when you're about to earn the attention of the Regimental Politruk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
