			<description>Adventure Summary from the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for character Levels 1-3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have arrived in the small mining town of Silverton two days after a group of wererat goblin bandits attacked a caravan carrying silver to the city of Archbridge, to the north. The goblin tribe has taken up residence in an abandoned silver mine to the northwest of town and has been conducting these daring raids against the caravans for several months, crippling Silverton&amp;rsquo;s silver trade. These wererat goblins are under the leadership of a powerful human wererat bard named Lawrence Gannu, who is exacting his family&amp;rsquo;s revenge on the town of Silverton for killing his grandfather and cursing his then-infant father and grandmother before exiling them to the southern city of Soulgrave many years ago. With help from the desperate townsfolk, the characters have found their way to the&lt;br/&gt;entrance of the abandoned Gannu family silver mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
