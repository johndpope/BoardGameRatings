			<description>&amp;quot;A remake of Conker's Bad Fur Day titled Conker: Live &amp;amp; Reloaded was released in 2005 for the Xbox console. It includes improvements to graphics and sound and several other changes. The game retains the single player mode of the original but features a much improved multiplayer mode in favor of Xbox Live featuring an entirely new weapons set and gameplay mechanics. Unlike Bad Fur Day, Live &amp;amp; Reloaded was also released in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer&lt;br/&gt;The multiplayer in Live &amp;amp; Reloaded uses the same third-person perspective as the single player game. Multiplayer consists of different game modes such as Capture the Flag or the standard Deathmatch modes. The player may participate as a member of the SHC or the Tediz. As well as a choice of soldier, the game has a choice of &amp;quot;classes&amp;quot; which significantly affect play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each class has its own special equipment, special abilities, and physical capabilities; each class being designed for a distinct purpose. They are also designed to have advantages against certain classes while being vulnerable to others. For example, the Thermophile's flamethrower inflicts extreme damage on Sneakers and Long Rangers, who have less health, but is virtually useless against the high-vitality Demolisher. Each class comes equipped with a primary weapon with unlimited ammunition, (although reloading of the weapon is still required), a limited stock of grenades, and at least one special ability. Scattered throughout the arenas are yellow Upgrade Orbs, which grant a player more equipment and abilities when obtained. A player loses his upgrade orb upon death, allowing another player to obtain it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Conker:_Live_&amp;amp;_Reloaded,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
