							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Abandoned Manor House</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutations and twisted offspring plagued the Westmores and they collared and chained them in the cellar. But the monsters discovered their lineage and rebelled. Now the Child in Chains controls the abandoned manor. A beautiful five-year-old to the human eye, the Child kills to make playmates for itself. It freed the mutations. It staged the slaughter of the Westmores. Now the Child wants you too. Its small child hands could reach inside your skull and remove that part of your brain that tells your heart to beat. So, don&amp;rsquo;t make it an enemy. Don&amp;rsquo;t make it want you for a friend either. But do try to wake the Apothecary whose brain the Child messed with. He knows how to cure disease. If he won&amp;rsquo;t waken? Rap sharply on his specimen jar. If you ask the right question, maybe he can chain the Child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
