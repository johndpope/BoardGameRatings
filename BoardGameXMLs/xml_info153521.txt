			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is your super-heroes game missing the zombie hordes you've always dreamed of?&lt;br/&gt;This release of The Manual of Mutants &amp;amp; Monsters provides game stats on the Infected Zombie, a creature returned from the dead to eat brains and spread its infection to the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the infected zombie template so you can transform any creature into an infected member of the undead, along with example infected zombie Uh Huh and attack dog stat blocks. There is also a special infected lasher zombie template (zombies that whip and entangle their prey using their own intestines) with a lasher scientist example. Rounding out this product are three caper ideas for using infected zombies in your game, suggestions on how the zombie infection may function in your game, and 2 new extras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
