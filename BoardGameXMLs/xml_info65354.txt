			<description>In the late 18th century, the Duc de Praline sets a challenge to six of the worlds most famous chocolatiers - design a chocolate just for him. The winner will receive riches galore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each chocolatier researches the life of the Duc and each designs a chocolate that they believe will appeal specifically to the Duc. However, after eating one of each of the chocolates, the Duc falls to the floor - dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renowned detective, Sherlock Truffle, is called in to investigate. It appears that one of the chocolatiers may have inadvertantly designed a chocolate that would remind the Duc of less than happy times, and fearing ridicule, poisoned the Duc to save his own reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have one of each of the chocolates before you (happily poison-free). Your task is to taste each one and refer to the background research of the Duc's life to determine who is the guilty party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes chocolates (six of each - and all absolutely gorgeous); notes of each chocolatier; a brief history of the Duc; and a CD which includes interviews with each of the chocolatiers. In addition, a sealed envelope contains the findings of Shelock Truffle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
