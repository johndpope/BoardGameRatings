							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atari Classics Evolved</name>
									
			<description>As we live in a world where video games look as real as live television, who would have thought that it all originated from Pong? Classic games like Pong, Centipede, and Battlezone began a video gaming revolution. Atari, the video game pioneer, is bringing back these and 8 other 2-dimensional classic games, giving it an updated look for the 21st Century and introducing a new way to play them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No need to dust off your Atari 2600. These classic games are now available for you to take everywhere you go on the PSP&amp;copy; (Playstation&amp;copy;Portable) system. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking for that classic, retro experience, or you&amp;rsquo;re looking for new-age graphics, each game will be playable in both classic and evolved forms to satisfy your itch. As an added bonus, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to unlock over 50 Atari 2600 titles giving you non-stop gaming action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids - Shoot down flying saucers before they shoot you. Asteroids was originally released in 1979 and was quickly a hit in the United States, becoming Atari&amp;rsquo;s best-selling game of all time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids Deluxe - Asteroids Deluxe was produced in 1980 as the sequel to Asteroids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlezone - Drive your tank around the battlefield, fire your gun and destroy the enemy tanks. Battlezone was released in 1980 and is widely considered to be the first &amp;quot;virtual reality&amp;quot; game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centipede - The Centipede is attacking and you must destroy all the segments before it reaches the bottom of the garden and takes you out! Centipede was released in 1980.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lunar Lander - The first carbon-conscious game! Land you craft on the craggy moonscape, but try to use as little fuel as you can. Lunar Lander was released in 1979. Though it never equaled the success of Asteroids, it has always retained a strong and loyal fan-base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millipede - Released in 1982 as a sequel to Centipede. Shoot the garden nasties and watch out for the Millipede!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missile Command - Defend the cities and don&amp;rsquo;t let the nukes take out your missile stations. Released in 1980, Missile Command was a huge hit, often providing more revenue than contemporary machines until the mid-1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pong - Well, what can we say about this classic that you don&amp;rsquo;t already know? Pong was released in 1972 and is the oldest game of the collection. It&amp;rsquo;s a classic that never grows old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Breakout - Move the bat and deflect the ball. Released in 1978, Super Breakout was microprocessor-based arcade game, as opposed to the discreet logic used in the original Breakout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tempest - Destroy the baddies as they make their way toward you. Tempest, released in 1981, was the first game to allow you to choose your starting level (a system Atari dubbed &amp;quot;SkillStep&amp;quot;). This feature increased the maximum starting level, depending on your performance in the previous game, essentially allowing you to continue &amp;mdash; a feature that became a standard in later video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warlords - It&amp;rsquo;s like Breakout, but with four players. Defend your base and destroy the others. Warlords was released in 1980.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atari 2600 (Unlockable) - To unlock Atari 2600 games, you must earn all four awards for each of the main games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
