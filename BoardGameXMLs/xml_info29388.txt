			<description>Sadie! is a Word game, that use a special deck of 69 cards, with the 26 Latin letters on them, as well as values ranging from 0 to 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sadie! each player is dealt 6 cards and the rest of the cards form 7 piles, in the center of the table. The top card of each pile is flipped face-up and play begins. On his turn, a player creates a word or passes. A created word must be entirely from the face-up cards or include at most one card from his hand. A word must be at least four letters long. After making a word the cards used are collected and discarded and the Word's value is added to that player's score.  Then new cards are turned up and the next player's turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;Also included are rules for Sadie's Solitaire, Letterummy, Word-Poker, Five-Card AlphaDeck Stud, Seven-Card AlphaDeck Stud and Alphacasino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadie! comes with a board capable of scoring up to 259 points for 4 players, using a unit peg and ten peg system. The four peg colors are white, yellow, red and blue (2 of each). The board also has capacity to hold the seven piles used in Sadie!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
