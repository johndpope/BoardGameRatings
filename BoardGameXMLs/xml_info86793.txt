			<description>Statistical replay game on basketball, featuring many different expansion sets. Basic game is very simple: each team is rated for points made, points allowed, rebounds and assists, plus it has a special value based on historical performance in the tournament (used to give a possible random variation to a few of his ratings). Opposing teams compare their value and a die is rolled for each team to determine the score. It is a fast replaying simulation, with a good bit of accuracy in the final result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the moment the following sets are available (directly from the designer, Roberto Chiavini or from Wargamer Vault): WNBA (all seasons) NBDL (all seasons), original ABA (all seasons), all the NBA from 1951 in single decades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
