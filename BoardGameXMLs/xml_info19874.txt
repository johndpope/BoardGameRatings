			<description>&amp;quot;For the amusement of youth of both sexes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Designed with a view to promoting progressive improvement of the juvenile mind, and to deter them from pursuing the dangerous paths of vice.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A roll-and-move race game where the players seek to travel from the house of corruption to reach virtue, the 33rd space on the board. Every space offers a punishment or reward, such as taking or losing tokens, going to a certain space, rolling again, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board was a hand-colored engraving mounted in 12 sections on linen and stored in a slipcase.
