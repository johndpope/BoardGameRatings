							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turbo the Tortoise</name>
									
			<description>Doctor Mulliner, the world renowned scientist and part-time pub&lt;br/&gt;singer, is developing the latest Cybernetic technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst creating his first prototype, a freak uncontrollable&lt;br/&gt;and unexpected chain of events occur. His pet tortoise Wal decides to start hibernation in the Matter Doesn't Matter chamber. The Doctor's psychopathic assistant Beckett, unaware of this fact, activates the generators; simultaneously, a 4.75 giga-watt bolt of lightning blitz's the control circuits, causing a massive overload in the artificial intelligence system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the smoke clears the chamber is opened, but no-one is prepared for what is about to be discovered. Through the thick mist an outline of what appears to be a huge tortoise can be seen, but it can't be, can it ... yes, now possessing Super Tortoise Powers is our new super hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCENARIO&lt;br/&gt;After the initial shock the Doctor's lightning quick brain begins to scheme. To complete his prototype there are six major components still required. There is a slight problem however; all known supplies have been exhausted. The only solution is to travel through time to where the items were first discovered. As time travel is relatively easy these days, Turbo now possessing Super Tortoise Powers, is sent on his first mission to collect them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From the inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
