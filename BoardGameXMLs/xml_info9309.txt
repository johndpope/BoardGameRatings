			<description>Players each run a Dutch passenger railroad company. Each company has claims which are moved around the board; these determine where the railroads can run routes, and also earn money for routes than run through them (no matter who runs them). Each passenger transported also pays a variable amount. Players can invest in bigger trains, bus companies to transport passengers from cities without train service, and headquarters buildings (which earn more money when included in routes). The object is to have the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
