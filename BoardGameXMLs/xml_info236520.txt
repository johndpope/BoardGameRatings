			<description>From the abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gamebook is an interactive book that became a huge commercial success in the eighties, with the Fighting Fantasy and the Lone Wolf series, which sold millions of copies worldwide. The interactive book has come a long way from the experimental novels by Jorge Luis Borges in the forties, to the gamebook in the eighties, when the whole idea of printed interactive books reached a creative and commercial peak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subsequent decline of the interest in the gamebook in the nineties coincidences with the growth of the computer games industry. Since the computer games evolved rapidly, and became more and more sophisticated, while the gamebook as a printed medium no longer could compete with the rival, all gamebook series were discontinued in the nineties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of this inquiry is to make a comparison between the two biggest and most commercially successful series: Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf. Included in the paper is also a brief history of the interactive book, as well as an analysis of the renaissance the gamebook is currently enjoying, and a look into the future of the format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
