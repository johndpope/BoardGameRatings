			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Shootist&amp;rsquo;s Guide - an accessory for use with your Aces &amp;amp; Eights game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several parts to this product, with the first and most obvious being the collection of new Target Silhouettes. These complement the game by providing a huge new array of targets, including outlaws with hostages, mounted riders, and gunslingers in many different poses. You also get a huge number of animal silhouettes, including bears, wolves, cougars, deer, and many more, along with detailed animal statistics and additional rules on hunting and tracking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, because of the size differential introduced by the larger silhouettes (such as mounted riders), a new &amp;quot;Big Game&amp;quot; Shot Clock is also included! (Silhouettes requiring the new Shot Clock are annotated as such.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
