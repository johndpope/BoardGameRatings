			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Final Fantasy d6 game is a tabletop roleplaying game inspired by and that openly attempts to emulate the Final Fantasy video game series.  The system is based on a core mechanic using six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;lsquo;FFRPG&amp;rsquo; project originally began as a bold undertaking by Scott Tengelin in February of 1995.  Development began with a small initial group of designers and administrators consisting of Tengelin, Martin Drury, Chris Pomeroy, and Matthew Martin. After many years and changing of hands, it became a fully-realized dream &amp;mdash; the current third edition was spearheaded by Samuel Banner as the lead developer.  However, at the time of this writing, the project seems to have been all but abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although I was inspired by the Returners, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but shake the feeling that it was flawed for laid back, around-the-table gaming, and I na&amp;iuml;vely began a slow conversion of the rules systems into something that I felt was more conducive for casual play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, as things often do, the more work I put into the system the more complex the rules became, until finally they took on a life of their own and became a total system modification. In too deep to stop now, I could only forge on ahead. I attempted to reproduce combat that accurately reflected the feel and style of the Final Fantasy series, where battles were dramatic, larger-than-life and grand affairs; cinematic opposed to mechanically monotonous, if you will. I endeavored to churn out a system filled with grand possibilities and heroic action. I struggled with a world where titanic struggles between good and evil for the fate of the world would be an accurate summary of the typical adventurer&amp;rsquo;s day, and that&amp;rsquo;s just before breakfast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether or not I succeeded is up for debate, but I find myself mostly content with this pdf in its current incarnation. At least for now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is free distribution and not for sale under any circumstances, and I hope you enjoy playing the Final Fantasy d6 as much as I enjoyed creating it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
