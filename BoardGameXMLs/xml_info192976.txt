			<description>The burgeoning coastal city of Rime's Reach is in need of adventuring Guilds to undertake the tasks that the locals can't (or won't) deal with themselves. Recruit guild members to aid you in undertaking quests and conduct shady dealings to undermine the competition. Who will still have a reputation by the end of the week?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventide is a game for 2 to 4 players where you play the role of guild masters vying for the best Reputation after 7 days and 7 nights. You have three main objectives:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Recruit guild members, some of whom can only be recruited at night or during the day, from a shared applicant pool by drafting them with gold.&lt;br/&gt;2. Quest by sending away recruited guild members to conduct the task, or do the job yourself by sending away the guild master.&lt;br/&gt;3. Mess with other guild masters by playing dealing cards to assert yourself in an evolving landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
