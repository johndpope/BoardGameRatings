			<description>Paper-and-pencil game where from 2 to 4 players must score the most possible points by enclosing spaces of an 8x8 board. Three extra dice are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player throws the three dice in their turn and chooses any combination of these dice of which the sum equals 6; these values are then written on vertically or horizontally consecutive spaces of the board. When an area of the board has been enclosed, the player with the biggest amount of border spaces in their colour fills the enclosed spaces with dots in their colour; if there is a tie the spaces remain blank until a space in the area is filled and the tie is broken. Areas including spaces on the border can include two spaces at most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When every space on the board has either a number or a dot the game ends; the player with most dots wins. An alternative scoring method is offered: dots score two points and border spaces score one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
