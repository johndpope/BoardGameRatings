			<description>From the bottom of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kan Zen: the perfect word game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A GAME AND A WORLD:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KAN ZEN (tm) is more than a game. It is a world. In that world there is a place for everyone, and fun for everyone. There is also a place for all of the words on earth - those in your own language, those in foreign languages, ordinary words, and words that are the names of persons or places - if the letters of an alphabet can be used to spell them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be as easy, or as difficult, as the players choose to make it - among yourselves you agree on the kind of words that are to be used. The playing time can be readily adjusted to suit your convenience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above all, KAN ZEN is a world for those who let their imagination soar, discovering how much enjoyment they can have with a game that permits almost infinite variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KAN ZEN AT A GLANCE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a circular track, on which a step is taken for each letter of a word played. Letters drawn at random at the beginning of each move must be included in the words that you use. UP-TURNS, where the TALLY (letter count) is added to your score, alternate with DOWN-TURNS, where the TALLY is subtracted, unless evasive action is taken. The &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; words are those whose TALLIES enable you to move to sectors of the circle where the best advantage can be taken on multiple scoring opportunities on UP-TURNS or where losses can be avoided or minimized on DOWN-TURNS. The winner is the player with the highest net accumulative TALLY at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW MANY CAN PLAY?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two, three or four sides can play the highly competitive versions of the The Perfect Word Game - as individuals, partners or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can also be played &amp;quot;solo&amp;quot;. Those who love words, or who find pleasure in drawing on a well-stocked memory of names of persons and places, may well consider KAN ZEN the best solitaire game in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
