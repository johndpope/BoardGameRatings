			<description>The card game One of Us becomes an Evil God! (邪神がこの中にいる！) is based on the Cthulhu myths, and during play the player with the most insanity points becomes an evil god who fights against the other players as they fight for humanity. Will the evil god win, or will the human side win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an interesting mix of a hidden identity game and a cooperation game. Insanity cards are dealt face down and randomly, so you can't know who has the highest card, which means that you have to play until the end without confirmation whether you are an evil god or a human being. You have to choose your best action while inferring the camps of you and other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinations of insanity cards and character cards are so various that you can play many times without getting bored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
