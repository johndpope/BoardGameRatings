							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">When Good Villagers Go Bad</name>
									
			<description>This game is a miniatures game for two or more players that also comes with pieces that you can use if you have no appropriate miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;This is a game depicting conflict between a group of individual and somewhat less than good willed adventurers, and the denizens of a local village who have had about all they can take from the would be heroes that constantly abuse their hospitality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game for the villagers is to gently persuade the adventurers that their attitude and presence in your town is not appreciated through the use of tar, feathers and a wooden rail which you use to run them out of town.&lt;br/&gt;While the object for the adventurers is to teach recalcitrant villagers a much needed lesson about the virtues of hospitality by murdering them, looting them and burning their peaceful village to its very foundations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
