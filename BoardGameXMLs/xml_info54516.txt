			<description>Publisher's Summary: If there is only one adage that can be applied to science fiction roleplaying, it is this: The future is a place of limitless possibilities. While the d20 System core rulebooks give the GM and players everything they need to get started, there is always room for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its spiritual predecessor (Modern Player's Companion), the Future Player's Companion focuses on the material used in character creation and game play designed for use by players but also valuable for Gamemasters. After all, the same material that applies to a player character can just as easily apply to an NPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the Future Player's Companion you will find new character options and all manner of new feats, skill uses, and races for your perusal. More than that, though, you will find inspiration and imagination. A character's stat block doesn't make it interesting or exciting, but the way you play him or her does. It is with this concept in mind that this book is being designed, allowing you to match mechanics to your abstract concepts in a way that makes logical sense. Each page is filled with ideas, just waiting to jumpstart your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
