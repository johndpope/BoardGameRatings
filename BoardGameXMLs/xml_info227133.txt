			<description>A card game for 2-7 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a city of the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Culture.  The IVC flourished (in present day Pakistan) 3300 - 1300 BCE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is conducted over 10 turns.  Each turn represents 200 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck.  Each card has the trait of one or more scoring categories of seven different types: &lt;br/&gt;1. Farming&lt;br/&gt;2. Animals&lt;br/&gt;3. Materials&lt;br/&gt;4. Products&lt;br/&gt;5. Trade&lt;br/&gt;6. Building&lt;br/&gt;7. Culture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has 4 Phases: &lt;br/&gt;1. Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Each player draws 3 cards OR fills their hand to 7 cards.&lt;br/&gt;2. Trade Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Players may trade Cards and Points with each other.  Trades do not have to be equal. &lt;br/&gt;3. Meld Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Each player may make 1 or more melds in this phase.  A meld must consist of 3 or more cards in the same category.  A meld scores points in that category equal to the square of the number of cards in the meld. &lt;br/&gt;4. End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  Max hand size is 5.  Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game each player looks at his 7 point categories.  A player's final score is equal to his score in his lowest scoring category.  The player with the highest final score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
