			<description>Red Aurora is a single-player game offering the player to relive the dramatic historical events of October 1917 in Petrograd as a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee attempting to overthrow the Russian Provisional Government. The game is played on two maps of Petrograd showing historically precise locations of stationed regiments, officer schools, bridges, important buildings and the Winter Palace itself. The player will take control of soldiers, Baltic Fleet sailors and Red Guards attempting to overcome the government forces consisting of Junkers, cossacks and Shock infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the game, the player prepares the coup organizing Red Guards, agitates garrisoned regiments, gathers revolutionary forces to prevent the government from bringing more troops into Petrograd and arresting the player. The revolutionary patrols seize crucial points in Petrograd, like train stations, communication centres and power plants, facing opposition from the government that tries to uphold the control of the city. The conflict escalates with the revolutionary forces encircling the Winter Palace and finally assaulting and seizing it during the dark October night. &lt;br/&gt;The game includes 58 historical events, played in variable chronology, and with 60 minutes of playtime offers excellent replayability. Will the Provisional Government be able to retain the control of Petrograd or will the shot from Aurora usher in a new era in the history of Russia?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
