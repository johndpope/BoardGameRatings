							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">20 Bookplate Spirits</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have been following the Sword &amp;amp; Stitchery Blog of Eric F. for more than a year now. Every now and then Eric will post a list with random finds, encounters or other stuff for use with OSR roleplaying games (Fantasy, SciFi, Post-Apocalyptic and others). A while ago, his blog featured an article about spirits bound into bookplates, including 20 inspirational examples. Immediately, my own creativity was ignited and I started to put down my own 20 bookplate spirits and now want to share them with all of you. And I take my hat off to Eric, this was a wonderful idea of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
