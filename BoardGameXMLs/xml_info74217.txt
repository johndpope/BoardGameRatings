			<description>&amp;quot;Battletoads in Battlemaniacs is a game released by Tradewest in 1993 for the Super NES. It is a sequel to Battletoads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;The story opens with the 'Toads visiting the Gyachung-La fortress in northern Tibet, where the Psicone Corporation is demoing their new virtual reality game system, TRIPS. Suddenly, a pig lackey working for the evil Dark Queen and her partner Silas Volkmire, leaps out of the system and kidnaps Michiko Tashoku (daughter of Psicone Corporation's CEO, Yuriko Tashoku) and Zitz. Now the remaining Battletoads must make chase into the Gamescape, rescue the two captives, and stop Volkmire and the Dark Queen from fulfilling their plans to control the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;In this game of up to two players, you control Pimple or Rash. Both Battletoads have combos and moves to help them defeat their enemies. The artistic style is decidedly cartoony, with exaggerated weapons protruding from the 'Toads' limbs to deliver the coup de gr&amp;acirc;ce. Like the original version of Battletoads, this game is also known for its extreme difficulty, and is very tough to finish, even for experienced gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ports &lt;br/&gt;The game was ported in 1994 to the Sega Master System by Syrox Developments and was going to be published in Europe by Virgin Interactive with a stated July 1994 launch date. However, the European release was pulled out in the last moment for unknown reasons and with the game already having been reviewed by video game press in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some time later, Tec Toy made an agreement with Virgin Interactive and released the Master System port in Brazil, despite not being completely finished due to its sudden European cancellation. This release is playable and can be completed, but there are minor problems with it like some graphical glitches, invisible and fatal collisions in the turbo tunnel level, an unfinished introduction scene, some reversed briefing scenes, and some stages repeating previous music tracks (not fitting with the original SNES title) or even lacking background music at all.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battletoads_in_Battlemaniacs,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
