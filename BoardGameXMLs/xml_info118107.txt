							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aasimar: Heirs of Glory</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born as scions of celestial spirits, aasimar stand as proof that the mortal world is infused with touches of the divine. From relentless adversaries of evil to eccentric benefactors of justice, aasimars have developed many traits and techniques unique to the heirs of the upper planes. Using these abilities, aasimars strike out to make a place for themselves in the world, and now you can join their ranks! Filled with variant racial abilities, including aasimar bloodlines, new class features, feats and character traits, Aasimar: Heirs of Glory is an advanced guide to playing an aasimar. Using these tools, players and GMs can create an endless number of unique, memorable aasimar characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course, since anything that players have access to is fair game for a GM, quick and easy guides for creating random aasimar NPCs are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ZIP file also contains a separate PDF containing the product's compiled stat blocks enabling the busy GM to build up a handy library of ready-to-go stat blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
