			<description>Travel through time and visit the most interesting peoples and places throughout history in Peoples of the Planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This board game will keep you on the edge of your seat, as you travel on a wild, worldly adventure, taking in all there is to know about the world&amp;rsquo;s numerous cultures. From the dawn of humanity to our present day, from Australia to Alaska, your adventure will lead to discoveries of rich diversity and extraordinary traditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, be the first to collect the Exploration Cards from each of the nine time periods to make up the Great Book of Ages. Punctuated by fun riddles and surprising turnarounds, Peoples of the Planet is an unforgettable journey into the heart of civilization and its mysteries, and it leaves no speculation as to why it recently gained recognition at the Anti Racism Awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
