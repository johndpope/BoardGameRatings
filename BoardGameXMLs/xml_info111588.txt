Her brother Lord Maliss, who can take the form of a dragon, changes Snow White's Prince &lt;br/&gt;Snow White: Happily Ever After is a North America-exclusive video game that was released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This video game was targeted for female video game players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players follow the further story of Snow White after the death of her stepmother, the Evil Queen. Her brother Lord Maliss, who can take the form of a dragon, changes Snow White's PrinceCharming into an shadow monster. An entire kingdom must also be freed from Maliss' sorcery. Players can play as either Snow White or her shadow monster husband. This video game is based on the animated Filmation movie Happily Ever After; as opposed to the classic Disney film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fruit and stars can be collected while apples can be thrown at enemies and blocks. Players are given four continues to stop the evil Maliss. At the final stage, Maliss confronts Snow White/Shadow Man in his ultimate dragon form. Players can change the difficulty level (ranging from easy to medium to hard) if the game gets too frustrating for them. A vast array of continues allow players to restart failed games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Snow White: Happily Ever After (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
