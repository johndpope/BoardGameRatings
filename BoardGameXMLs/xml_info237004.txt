			<description>6ラホマミキサー (Oklahoma Sixer) is a card game in which players are shamans who, at a festival held on one day each year, summon elemental spirits for a dance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses one of two actions each turn: play (from a hand of cards) a dance partner to his or her lead spirit, or play a card to one of two rows at the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the two rightmost cards in either card row in the center add up to six and are capped with a zero, players swap dance partners. This sometimes eliminates players' lead spirits as combinations of some elements (such as fire and water) are volatile. If either row has a total of six cards, a scoring occurs. The player with the highest combination of lead spirit and dance partner chooses all cards of one color from the row that caused the scoring. The player with the second highest combination follows, and so on. Cards taken from the row are set aside to score at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at some point after the stock deck runs out of cards for a second time. Players then score the cards that they have collected over the course of the game. Each card is worth one point, but bonuses are awarded according to the number of score cards of the same rank that each player has. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
