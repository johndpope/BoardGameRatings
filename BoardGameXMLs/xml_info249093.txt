							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pan Twardowski</name>
									
			<description>In the &amp;quot;Rome&amp;quot; tavern, Mr. Twardowski appeared. What kind of figure this time took the well-known wizard: a nobleman with a lush beard or maybe a proud gentleman with a pipe? Try to catch Twardowski, but watch out: the most famous mag will try to mislead you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Twardowski is a deductive game where players have to look carefully at the image of the tavern and indicate which element has changed, to collect clues about Mr. Twardowski's identity. &lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Rome&amp;quot; tavern is represented by 16 double-sided tiles. In each round one player flips single tile, while other players don't look. Then, the others have to guess the flipped tavern segment. The player who will do this first, can check one of the clue cards and learn more about the wizard&amp;rsquo;s appearance (eg. &amp;quot;He doesn't smoke pipe&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;He has moustache&amp;quot;). With enough clues the real Twardowski can be selected from the suspects list. The game ends when one of the players is sure he can catch the wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
