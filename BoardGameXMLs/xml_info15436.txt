							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sleep Over Club: Goof or Dare Night</name>
									
			<description>This is a truth or dare party game for girls. The player whose turn it is (called the Goof) is asked, &amp;quot;Truth or dare?&amp;quot; The Goof selects a category and is read a question from a card. She must answer the question truthfully or else perform the task described at the bottom of the card. Both questions and tasks are designed to be silly. If the group decides that the Goof did a good job, she receives a bead from that category for her bracelet. By the end of the game, each player should have three beads from each category on their bracelets. Winning and losing is not really important since the game is designed mainly for slumber party fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
