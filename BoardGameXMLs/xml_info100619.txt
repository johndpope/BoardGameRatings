			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This a property game like Monopoly, where players roll a pencil and can spend money to buy/ open stores in a mall. Other players landing on those stores must buy at least one item from that store, and if there are none left, they have the option to buy it out. Players can expand their store by purchasing adjacent properties, and bigger stores will extra and more expensive items. Players also can use event cards to produce wild effects, making sure that no player is totally out of the game. There are several different style malls and at least eleven characters to choose from. The art style is &amp;quot;cute anime&amp;quot; and contains lots of silly humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
