							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marooned</name>
									
			<description>Marooned is designed to be played by 2-4 players on various different boards each with different set ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to get as many of your peices from your 'IN' block to your 'OUT' block. This is done by moving the movement blocks around the board and fashioning a 'stepping stone' path across the various hazards whilst also attempting to scupper your opponants chances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squares on the board include the 'Sudden Death' square, the 'Quicksand' Square and the 'Conveyor Belt' Square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
