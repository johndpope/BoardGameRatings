							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mystic Theurge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystic theurges place no boundaries on their magical abilities and find no irreconcilable paradox in devotion to the arcane as well as the divine. They seek magic in all of its forms, finding no reason or logic in denying themselves instruction by limiting their knowledge to one stifling paradigm, though many are simply hungry for limitless power. No matter what their motivations, mystic theurges believe that perception is reality, and through the divine forces and astral energies of the multiverse, that perception can be used to manipulate and control not only the nature of this reality, but destiny itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Mystic theurge.&lt;br/&gt;Build Classes: Cleric, wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: The mystic theurge is a powerful component for any party, supplying magic for attack, defense, and healing. Mystic theurges travel the world in search of arcane&lt;br/&gt;and holy artifacts, magical lore, or divine revelations, and most have no qualms about teaming up with groups of adventurers so long as that group&amp;rsquo;s goals do not directly conflict with their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
