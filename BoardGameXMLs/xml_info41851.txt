							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Empires of Iron</name>
									
			<description>Empires of Iron is a game of diplomacy, war and intrigue set during the period of roughly 1871-1918. Two to eight players compete to create alliances, develop the latest weapons, and become master of Europe. There are multiple paths to victory - military, economic, diplomatic, or any combination thereof... which will you pursue? But beware, enemies can become friends in the blink of an eye, and allies can turn on you without warning. Nothing can be taken for granted, and anything can happen.&lt;br/&gt; Played on a map Europe at the turn of the 20th century, Empires of Iron includes several scenarios based on the number of players, each playable in an afternoon. The game includes both introductory and standard rules. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).&lt;br/&gt; Home page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.blueiguanagames.com/eoi.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.blueiguanagames.com/eoi.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
