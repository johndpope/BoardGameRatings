			<description>A game of Real Estate speculation... actually three games in one... each one slightly more advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Agent, players roll the die and move around the board listing properties.  This is a simple race game to see who can list the most properties before they run out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Real Estate PLUS, players not only list, buy, and sell properties, but they also manage stocks.  The winner in this version is the player who bankrupts the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Affluence more complexity is added.  Loans, Savings Accounts, stock dividends, and insurance are added to the 'Real Estate PLUS' game.  The winner is the person with the most net worth at the end of the game (one year of simulated time) or the player who bankrupts his competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
