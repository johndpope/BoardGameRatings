			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;A compact version of Videopac G7200 basically. A G7000 with a build-in monochrome monitor in a French teletex terminal case Minitel 1A. The games are pluged in from the side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the G7200, there is no option to plug-in the console to the TV, so the games can only be played on the black/white monitor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was only released in Europe, and possibly only in Holland and France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not certain about release date, as no data could be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
