			<description>&amp;quot;Bendy and the Ink Machine&amp;trade;&amp;quot; is the first person puzzle action horror game that will forever ruin your childhood love of cartoons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player plays as Henry, an animator, who gets an invitation to his old workplace, an animation workshop called Joey Drew Studios, by the owner of the studio, Joey Drew. Upon arriving, the place seems deserted, and ran through with large ink pipes. Upon exploring, Henry finds the titular Ink Machine, as well as evidence that Joey began dabbling with the occult, finding a mutilated corpse of Boris the Wolf, one of the cartoon characters appearing in Joey's cartoon posters. He searches around the workshop to find six items needed to power the machine: a manual, a Bendy plush, a cog, a record, a wrench, and an inkwell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
