							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pillars of Dead Light</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Pillars of Dead Light&amp;quot; is the second expansion book for the post-apocalyptic game world of Dystopia Rising. In the searing deserts of the Southwest, the survivors learned that there was something worse, far worse than the dead - the living. A rampant testament to capitalism gone wrong, the slave-state of Vegasia is an example of human greed and mistrust left to fester in the cruel desert sun. Backstabbers, slavers, and swindlers roam the streets, but worse by far are the ones in charge? For Vegas City has become a cesspool of evil, a breeding ground for the savage monsters known as the Final Knights. And on the the East Coast, the crucible of Sin known politely as Aysea is a microcosm of Vegasia's excess. But there is some hope, for the Knights do not control the badlands. Out in the ruined earth, the Dieseljock clans fight the Knights (and each other) from within their sacred rides, cobbled and kit bashed vehicles that are their souls and lifeblood. Among the slaves and the downtrodden, there is rebellion. Aysea and Vegasia are slow burning powder kegs of excess, and they're both set to explode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
