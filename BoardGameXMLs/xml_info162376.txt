							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Domains at War: Battles</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomorrow you will bring the battle to the foe. Tonight you walk among the troops you&amp;rsquo;ll lead. The mercenaries are veterans and sleep while they can, but the peasants levied from your lands seek courage in tales of your previous victories. In the cover of darkness, you can listen rather than lead. Remember when you were like them? Back when you first entered the dungeon, you wielded a sword to fight for gold, glory, and the favor of the gods. Winning these earned you a throne. Now you wield an army, and fight for the right to rule the domains at war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Domains at War: Battles (D@W) is a supplement for Autarch&amp;rsquo;s best-selling Adventure Conqueror King System (ACKS). Using the rules herein, you can run massive battles between opposing armies using playing pieces on the tabletop. Designed specifically for battles where RPG characters are in command, D@W: Battles makes the deeds and decisions of those characters the focus of its gameplay, and works hard to integrate their actions into the flow of battle. Built from the same mathematics that power ACKS, it generates outcomes like what you'd get if you fought it out on the one-on-one roleplaying scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Domains at War: Battles is compatible with any fantasy RPG system that uses twenty-sided dice and shares concepts like hit points and armor class.  With Domains at War: Battles, we invite RPG gamers to bring the epic scope of pitched battle to their tabletops!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
