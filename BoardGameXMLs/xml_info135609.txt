							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwarven Euchre</name>
									
			<description>Dwarven Euchre is a fantasy-themed evolution of a popular trick-taking card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is normally played with four people -- two teams of partners sitting across the table from each other. Each round involves one set of partners bidding on a trump suit, cards are played around the table as the bidding team tries to win the required number of tricks. Between rounds, a battle map is updated with results. The goal is for one team to capture the center hex on the map. Depending on board position and hand results, partners may earn 'reinforcement' draws in future rounds to make their hands stronger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners may discuss board position between rounds, but within a round they must anticipate other player actions. Some example decisions: &amp;quot;My partner has this trick so far - should I play trump or save it for later?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;My opponent called trump - should I draw some of it out?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differences between Dwarven and traditional Euchre include fantasy-themed cards, the battle map, sorcerer wildcards, and reinforcement draws. The rules contain example play and a two-player version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
