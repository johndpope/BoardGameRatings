			<description>In Fishing Resort, players have complete control over their tropical island vacation. Each part of the island is open for exploration, with locales ranging from serene lakes and meandering streams to jungle rivers, sandy beaches, mountaintop frozen lakes, and the deep blue sea. Players can fish wherever there is water, giving them a wide array of options as they explore the game&amp;rsquo;s open world setting with rod and reel in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fishing Resort offers players a wide variety of fish. More than 200 unique marine creatures are available for players to catch and feature in aquariums at their hotel. As players catch fish, they exchange them for in-game credits that can be used to buy new fishing equipment and customizable clothing items. Fishing Resort also offers more than 20 mini games, including kayak races and fishing competitions, a deep achievement system, online leaderboards, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique fishing rod attachment for the Wii controller is also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
