							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trouble with Demons</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city's magical underground had trouble some years back with an evil cult called the Cult of Gavrian. The whole thing ended in a magical battle where many good wizards sacrificed their lives, but the cult was beaten and destroyed forever. Now the wizards are led by Quanthalas the Mighty, who in his kindness has taken it upon him to mentor Hans, the orphaned son of two of the wizard heroes. Everyone looks up to Quanthalas, and trusts his judgement in all matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Too bad for young Hans, then, that he's just found out that Quanthalas the Mighty is a member of the Cult of Gavrian, and is planning to usurp world power with brutal force! To make things worse, Hans finds himself backtied in an unknown basement with only four imps to help him. And he can't quite control his imps, either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
