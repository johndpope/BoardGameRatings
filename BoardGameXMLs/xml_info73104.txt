			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Over II (also known as Phantis) is the second installment in the Game Over series. Arkos, hero of the rebellion against queen Gremla has been captured and is detained in a subterranean prison on the planet Phantis, known for its vicious fauna and flora. It is up to Commander Serena to penetrate Phantis' orbital defenses, fight her way through the prison guards and free her lover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Over II is split in two parts (the second one being unlockable with a code given at the end of the first part). The first part is a horizontal side-scrolling shooter split in four zones: planetary approach in space, flying over the planet surface, flying in a tunnel, and exploring a swamp filled with deadly creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part is a platform shooter where the player, equipped with a jet-pack must find his way through the caves of Phantis, find a weapon and the necessary object to finally free Arkos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
