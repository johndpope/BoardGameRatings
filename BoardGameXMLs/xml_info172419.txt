							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughterball: Team Fury</name>
									
			<description>Thirteen official plexes grace the continental jewel that is India. The largest is the Bengali Mahaplex with over 274 million citizens living within its walls. And every last one of them is a fan of Fury! Developed decades ago as the very first exotic Slaughterball team, Fury is a perennial favorite not just in India, but in all 72 metroplexes. Their distinctive feline beauty and grace, coupled with the savagery of their gameplay, has earned them a place in seven of the last ten Slaughterbrawls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fury&amp;rsquo;s greatest strength, their savage claws that can rip other neohumans to shreds, are also their greatest weakness. These felinoids are very inept at handling the ball, and their razors are the worst shooters in the league. Fortunately, Fury razors are also the fastest, so they can usually get pretty close to the goals to take easy shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to win on goals. You better pounce on your opponents and do some damage. Thanks to the Savagery skill, you&amp;rsquo;ll be racking up the slaughter points. Don&amp;rsquo;t save those reactive cards (Penalty, Lost Momentum, etc.). You need to be sacrificing your cards to send opponents to the Slaughter Box early. Soon enough your opponents will team up against you to eliminate your butchers and slashers. So, attack with them early and often.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
