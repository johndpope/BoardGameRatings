							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Folly</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Folly is a full-color, 32 x 30 inch, floor plan of a folly, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The farmers have taken from the land for far too long! It is time that they are harvested instead!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The folly is a building constructed solely for ornamentation. This particular folly consists of a fountain in the middle of a walled-off stone courtyard. This product includes image files for your virtual tabletop (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The folly can be used in most settings. It makes an excellent lead-in to a castle in everything from a fantasy game to a modern game. It is also a good location for high-class outdoors socialization, for discovering a victim in a murder mystery, for settling scores with a duel, or to hold a last stand from behind which walls our heroes struggle desperately to fight off hordes of barbarians or monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local villagers have been disappearing. The superstitious townsfolk beg the group to investigate a nearby haunted castle for them. One of the villagers insists that the castle itself is kidnapping people from the village. If the group accepts the heroic assignment, they soon find themselves on the scene at the folly. As they near the fountain, the vines come alive and attack. To make matters worse, the very grass beneath the heroes' feet become animated and joins the attack. After killing the vines (and/or grass), the group finds the corpses of several villagers decomposing in the grass. These corpses have plants growing out of them, as if used as fertilizers. Should they continue deeper into the castle, the group findseven more dangerous plants (DramaScape's Courtyard Ruins, Castle Ruins, and Western Keep all make for good locations to use for further inside the castle). After defeating vines, trees, flowers, mosses, and other plant creatures, the group finds a mad druid at the heart of it all. The mad druid explains his experiments as him trying to teach nature how to protect itself from farmers. The adventure's climax is against the druid, his animal companions, and any remaining plant creatures the druid still has, including his latest experiments. (Unless the heroes agree with the druid&amp;rsquo;s perspective and join him, that is. In this case, the climax instead comes with druid and the &amp;quot;heroes&amp;quot; attack and slaughter the villagers). If the group succeeds in defeating the druid, they are able to save a few of the hostage villagers who are still alive bound by vines. They return to the village as heroes and are given a sumptuous feast in gratitude by the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
