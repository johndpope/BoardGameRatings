							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uncle Wiggily&#039;s New Airplane Game</name>
									
			<description>From inside box cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story: That old rabbit gentleman, Uncle Wiggily, after many games and adventures, bought a farm and grew some carrots.  He used to take his carrots to market in a wheelbarrow, but one day, over the radio, he heard that airships where much faster than wheelbarrows, so he bought himself something with which he could fly in the clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here we have a playing board to represent the country over which Uncle Wiggily flew from his carrot farm to the market where he sold his yellow vegetables.  But the rabbit had so many adventures in his new airship as he did when hopping through the woods to cure his rheumatism at Dr. Possom's office.  There were storms, waterspouts and he fell into tail spins and once had to jump in a parachute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The moves are made by drawing cards.  There are 105 white cards, each one telling you how many miles to hop Uncle Wiggily through the air.  There are 35 red cards, which may move Uncle Wiggily ahead or perhaps delay hime for a turn or two, all according to luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The air path, from Uncle Wiggily's farm to the market is marked by sign boards each containing a letter instead of a number.  And when these letters are separated into words, beginning at the farm, they spell out a funny little verse.  See if you can write it down after the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
