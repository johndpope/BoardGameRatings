							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anchor</name>
									
			<description>Anchor is a game of claiming territory by surrounding it with your stones. In that, it is similar to the classic game of Go. However, it is played on a hex grid and the life/death of a group is decided differently - in Go, a group is alive by having eyes; here, a group is alive by connecting to three edges (or in certain cases, two).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the six corners are marked alternately with black and white anchors. Corners with anchors of a player's own color are his home corners, and corners with anchors of his opponent's color are away corners. A group is an anchor if it touches three or more sides of the board. If a group touches just two sides, it is an anchor only if these two sides do not meet at an away corner. When both players pass consecutively, any group that is not an anchor is ruled dead and is removed from the board. Each player then figures his score, which is the sum of his territory (vacant surrounded points) plus dead stones of his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
