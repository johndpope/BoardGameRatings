							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forsaken Magic</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forsaken Magic contains four playbooks of player classes for Dungeon World that has gorgeous cover art done by Nick Ladd. This pack features casters that utilize forces strange and uncommon as they are distrusted and feared so you can bring the outlandish and the wonderful to your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Geister: A daring individual who has permitted a disembodied specter into themselves, sharing their body with the entity in exchange for being granted the utilization of the baleful powers of the departed. However, such a union of souls in a mortal body isn&amp;rsquo;t without consequences, as if the ghost is ever displeased, it will take its anger out on the unfortunate host. &lt;br/&gt;     The Charred: A poor individual who has been victim of an unnatural flame that has burned them strait to their soul. Your skin is covered in untreatable burns and respite from travels offers no comfort. The only solace you gain is through feeding material to your inner smouldering wound. This horrific injury of both body and soul does have a boon in the form of a strange magic that it grants to its victims.  Most are unwillingly exposed to this strange curse, but some ambitious or desperate seek it out regardless of the costs.&lt;br/&gt;     The Fading Soul: It could be recently, or perhaps all your life you have had it, you have had seemingly holy powers of creating angelic lights and other unsettling feats. These powers have come to you without warning and until now, without explanation. Through sought wisdom or self-discovery, you have learned that these magic powers are not a gift from some higher source, but the accidental and lost art of utilizing one&amp;rsquo;s soul as fuel for magic prowess. You must carefully balance the use of these powers, for an overuse could extinguish your soul.&lt;br/&gt;     The Changeling: A strange and tricky offspring between an enraptured mortal and a fay captor, or a perhaps a human child who has been abducted by fay and raised as their own. By either means, you have been raised in the fairy world of glamorous magics and alien scenery. You have now traveled to the duller world of mortals that leaves you a little homesick with its mundane texture. The stories you tell of the fay world are so invigorating and enchanting that they mold the mortal realm to fit their description. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
