			<description>This has a lot of similarities to Balderdash, but has some differences as well.  First is spelling can win you points.  Second is it ships with two actual Scribner dictionaries for checking on answers.  Finally is how it constrains someone just about to win...  There is also a handicap system.  So this Canadian publisher seems to have worked out a slightly more sophisticated system to the same fun we know as Balderdash, but added enough additional stuff to make it a bit more strategic in play and more educational to boot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
