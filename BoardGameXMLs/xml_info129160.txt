			<description>Each player is dealt 6 cards. &amp;mdash; The card following next will be placed on the table face up, being the &amp;ldquo;starting-card&amp;rdquo; for the journey. The remaining cards will be left in the pile, face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player takes the top card of the pile and must consider how to lay out as many cards as possible on to the starting card, according to the following rules:&lt;br/&gt;The player may continue laying out only cards showing countries with common borders (a map of Europe is provided). He is also allowed to lay out two cards of the same country at the same time;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any country may be reached by aeroplane, i.e. including any country not adjoining the country shown on the card laid out last. However, the rule is that a plane may be used only once in each turn. Flying will be indicated by leaving the previously laid out card uncovered in such a way that the aeroplane will remain visible. (With neighbouring countries the cards will be placed partly on top of each other in the form of scales, the aeroplane remaining covered.) It is left to the discretion of the player himself whether or not and when he wishes to make use of a card as air ticket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player having finished laying out as many cards as possible next to the starting card and in conformity with the above rules, each additional player will follow his turn in corresponding manner, by laying out his cards next to the card laid out by the previous player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of a round will be the player who first succeeds in laying out all his cards. The game should be played to a pre-agreed number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring the points: the figure in the left hand corner of each card shows the number of neighbouring countries. The figures shown on the cards remaining with the players will be counted minus points for those players.&lt;br/&gt;Special instructions: in addition to countries with common borders those countries connected with each other by ferry boat (railway ferries) will be considered neighbouring countries too. (See the map of Europe with the game).&lt;br/&gt;In this game Turkey is considered a neighbouring country also of the Soviet Union, although that frontier is in Asia. There is no neighbouring country to Iceland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
