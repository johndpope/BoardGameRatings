			<description>Back Cover: &lt;br/&gt;The Justice Department is the huge, sprawling organisation that governs and regulates the lives of every citizen within Mega-City One. The judges on the street are merely the most visible portion of this gigantic administrative body and though the maintaining of Law and order is paramount, the Justice Department also controls or monitors all governmental bodies within Mega-City One, ensuring every citizen is provided for and protected from enemies both within and without.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every judge on the street is far more than a well-trained individual committed to upholding the Law. He also has the entire weight of the Justice Department behind him, and can call upon its resources throughout his career. With this authority comes a terrible responsibility, for a judge is sworn to protect every citizen from harm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside You Will Find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organisation:&lt;br/&gt;Learn how the massive structure of the Justice Department is able to combine its resources to fight any threat to Mega-City One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specialist Judges:&lt;br/&gt;Train hard and specialise your character to join the Acc-Div, Heavy Weapons Squad, Holocaust Squad, Pursuit Squad or attain the rank of Sector Chief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clones and Bloodlines:&lt;br/&gt;To fight escalating crime levels, many judges are cloned from those individuals who have distinguished themselves in the line of duty.
