							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rugby World Cup Game</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;                DUE TO THE RWC GOVERNING BODY WRITING TO ME REQUESTING THAT I CANNOT PUBLISH THIS GAME WITHOUT A LICENCE, I HAVE TEMPORARILY HALTED ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. WHILST I APPRECIATE THAT RWC HAVE THE RIGHTS TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE TOURNAMENT I AM SURE THAT I CAN PUBLISH A GAME THAT DOES NOT INFRINGE ON THOSE RIGHTS - AS I DID WITH THE WORLD CUP GAME TO WHICH FIFA HAD NO OBJECTION SO LONG AS I DID NOT USE THEIR LOGO'S OR ANY OTHER LICENSABLE ATTRIBUTES. HOWEVER, WITH OTHER PROJECTS TO WORK ON I WILL RECONSIDER THIS FOR SOME OTHER TIME.&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A kind of sequel to The World Cup Game, covering the great game of Rugby Union. Each player will control a number of teams in either the 1987 or 2007 World Cup Finals. All the group matches are played simultaneously decided by card play from the players. The winner is the player controlling the team that wins the World Cup Final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
