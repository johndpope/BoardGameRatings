			<description>TRY Time is a game that simulates a rugby league season or a rugby cup competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the game involves building up your team and backroom staff whilst staying within budget, fast paced, dynamic! A season or cup competition is complete in just 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players choose to progress to a cup final or the play offs after the regular season or cup opening rounds are complete then the teams built during part 1 of TRY Time or alternatively fantasy / real teams of the players choice are used to compete in a head to head matches using the patented TRY Time game slider and ball. Head to Head matches take an additional 20 minutes per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
