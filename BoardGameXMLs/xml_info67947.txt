							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Double Knot</name>
									
			<description>A trick-taking Decktet game for 3 to 5 players with a lot of trumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Knot is the favourite trick-taking game among pandas. It's a common habit to end a dispute with a game of Double Knot in order to decide who gets to sleep in the best bed. Unfortunately, in case of a tie, play is continued. This explains the amount of pandas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is named after the two highest cards in the game, the Ace of Knots and the Crown of Knots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Double Knot every player bids a number of tricks. The object of the game is to win exactly the number of tricks bid and at the same time let other people fail to do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a hand of Double Knot, each of the Decktet cards is treated as belonging only to the top suit. The bottom suits of the first card played to a trick determines which cards can be used as trumps in that trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of the game can be found at the Decktet wiki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
