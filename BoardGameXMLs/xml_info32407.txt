			<description>A snakes and ladders type game for two to four players with some extra strategic manouvres possible including piggy-backing, multiple-piece options and blocking other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must move his 4 pieces (thims) up the board by rolling the dice or piggy-backing on the thim of another player.  The goal of the game is to have each of your thims on the last four squares of the board.  The player can use the blue arrows to advance up the board if he lands on one and if he lands on a square with a red arrow must slide to the bottom of the arrow.  There are some special squares that force the player to roll a six to move past that square and some that allow the player to roll the dice again.  The most interesting square on the board is the STYMIE square.  If a person gets his thim to land on the STYMIE square no other player may move their thims past him until he moves his thim.  This makes for a burst for the finish ending in many games.  Players may move any of their thims on their turn including ones that may be buried in a stack of other thims as long as they take all thims resting on top of theirs.  This rule does not apply on the top row where only the top thim may move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fairly simple game and probably appeals mostly to children.  However there are usually four options for the player on every turn and the race for the finish is usually close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
