							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legion</name>
									
			<description>Legion is a new skill and strategy game. It has 81 unique playing tiles and is played on a 9x9 board with 81 squares. each playing tile is square, and has either two, one or no stripes marked on each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have seven tiles and take turns to form lines of tiles on the board. After a turn, a player replenishes his seven tiles from the tile bag. Each side of every tile played must match the sides of every tile already on the board that it touches. Pieces score 1 if played onto a white square. The board has a grid of bonus squares. Pieces played onto bonus squares score the number of stripes on the piece played times 2 (blue), 3 (silver), or 5 (gold). Each tile has a red dot on one face, and must be played with this side facing the red dot on the board. The game ends when no player can place any more of their tiles on the board. the number of stripes on pieces still held by each player is deducted from their score at the end of the game. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
