							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sails of Glory: Additional Ship Mats</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play large Sails of Glory battles with the Additional Ship Mats expansion! This set includes 4 ship mats and sets of action counters to handle multiple ships in a battle. In Sails of Glory, each ship is handled through a ship mat - a specially designed game board in high-quality cardboard, with linen-finish and die-cut. Together with the ship log included with each ship model, the ship mat enables a player to handle the actions of that ship, and to keep track about everything that happens to the vessel, from special damage, to the settings of the sails. Additional ship mats are optional when playing larger battles with Basic or Standard Rules, and required when playing with Advanced Rules. The ship mats included with this accessory are similar to those included in the Sails of Glory Starter Set. You must own a Sails of Glory Starter Set to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
