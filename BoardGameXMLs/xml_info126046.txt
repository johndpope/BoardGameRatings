			<description>This game from Cadaco Ellis capitalizes on the 1950's TV quiz show craze. There are 200 total questions in eight different series (25 questions each). In the standard game each player is given a quiz series sheet and quizzes (from their own sheet) the player on the right. The answering player silently  places a peg in the yes or no holes on the board. The quizzing player then uses the code given on his/her series sheet for that question to turn the dial on the board and show the hidden answer. Players receive one point per correct answer. The player with the highest number of correct answers/points at the end of the game wins. In the party version all players work off the same quiz series sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
