							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hamlet</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 40 x 40 inch Battlemap of a Small Hamlet, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play, and a 360 view of the Hamlet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is time to push the Allies back to the English Channel. This small farming village is but the first step to total victory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hamlet is a large-scale map of a farming village. Scale is each one inch/square/hex is approximately 10 to 15 feet. This map can be used as the layout of a village for use in a fantasy game or it could be used as the site of a large-scale or mass combat battle. The Hamlet includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Hamlet from a perspective as if standing in the northern part of the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hamlet is intended for use in fantasy, historical, and modern games (adding some farm machinery can make it feel more modern or it could be a farming community than shuns such technology like the Amish).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major terrain feature of the hamlet is a river that varies from 10-30 feet (depending on the scale decided upon) in width spanned by five wooden bridges (two in the north, one in the center, and two in the south parts of the river). These wooden bridges are likely able to support wagons, horses, etc., but might strain under the weight of heavy vehicles such as tanks. Most of the hamlet is on the western bank with some houses and fields on the eastern bank north and south of the main village. In any type of conflict, controlling these bridges will be crucial to preventing the enemy from crossing the river and entering the main hamlet in the center of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This terrain feature allows you to designate two zones for deployment, the defender&amp;rsquo;s zone in the western bank and an attacker&amp;rsquo;s zone in the eastern bank. The defenders need to stop the attackers from breaking through to the western edge of the map to win and the attackers need to overrun the hamlet and breakthrough to the other side to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example scenarios could be the Allies set up on the western side with German forces attacking them from across the Rur River during the Battle of the Bulge. Or the Germans are set up on the western side of the hamlet with the Russians crossing the Oder River as they approach Berlin. Heavily armored vehicles like tanks crossing will sink the bridges, but lighter vehicles like trucks, jeeps, and lightly armored scouts can make it across. Field engineers who can erect a metal bridge might also be of great importance to the attackers to establish a route to get heavy tanks and tank destroyers across the river. Will history remain the same or change as a result of the outcome of these battles?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
