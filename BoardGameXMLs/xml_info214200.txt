							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fight! Unlockables: Shonen</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shonen, the first of the new Fight Unlockables series, contains rules specifically aimed at converting the standard gameplay of the core rules to emulate the specific genre tropes of shonen anime and manga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create Fighters with special elemental powers and who are able to draw power from the strength of their friendships and rivalries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enable your characters to transform into more powerful forms, either frequently during battle or in response to the events of major plot arcs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes rules to change standard combat to better reflect the feel and pace of shonen fight scenes, with escalating power and special attacks that are only available at the climax of a battle.  The rules also allow more direct engagement between a character&amp;rsquo;s non-combat skills and his or her combat abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win battles through Gambits, where victory can be achieved without a single attack being thrown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes guidelines detailing standard genre conventions, to aid Directors in shaping their own shonen campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
