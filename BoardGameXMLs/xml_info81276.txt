			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WEM3 is a pen-and-paper role-playing (RPG) game system of rules that I invented in 1997. It was invented out of a desire to simplify gameplay while maintaining a sense of realism in the gaming environment. I have been slightly modifying the core rules ever since on a very sporadic basis (this game, by far, is a somewhat low priority of mine).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I invented this RPG system independent of whatever else there was previously available and with no prior knowledge that my RPG system might have similar elements to other RPG systems available, freeware, retail, or otherwise. I have since found other RPGs (both retail and freeware) that share some similarities to my system. I do not feel that they infringe upon my RPG, and I hope the same is likewise with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why the name WEM3?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: Seriously, this is a question with no &amp;quot;Wow! That is deep!&amp;quot; sort of answer. The R.P.G. had to be called something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
