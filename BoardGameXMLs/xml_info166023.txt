			<description>It's not simple being Herakles. Everybody seems entitled to tell you what great heroic thing to do next, this Hera goddess keeps harassing you most annoyingly and in case you are too heroic, the gods might just kill you off for being hubristic. And in that case, no historian will publish your great deeds. Not even your good friend Appolodor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Microgame of Herakles, the two cards you have available to choose from each round are handed to you by your neighbours. From those cards, you have to play one. You want to place heroic deeds in your play area, but only 2. The moment you place a third, the gods deem you too heroic and you are out of the game. Other cards allow you to manipulate the cards in front of you and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as only one player is left or the stack runs out, the game ends. The player with the highest score in his play area and hand still participating in the game wins and is declared the new Herakles. After  a set number of rounds, whoever was Herakles the most, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
