			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Eldruden Earth. God is dead and so are his Angels. Demons and Devils maraud the haunted landscape, where humans hang from the skies, Hell has fused with nearly ninety percent of the Earth, and the oceans, seas, rivers and lakes have turned to blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity is threatened with extinction. Hell Storms frequent the remaining cities. Butcher men prowl the streets in packs, preying on innocents. Serial Killers are initiated into demonic cults where their deadly art is refined and skills honed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, there are the Godchilds.  Conscious shards of the slain deity, Jehovah, they possess many powers and are masters of wielding Kavashem and are also known as &amp;ldquo;Eldrudens&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, should the player desire to play another race, there is this, Creature, the Prey 2 Tome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained within this publication, are all the rules neccessary to play a race other than the Godchild. Detailed here are 10 different races, from Xen Xadians to Brood Queens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
