			<description>In this new game you travel the world with your own fleet of cointainerships and manage large seaports. You want to be the biggest but there are many dangers in the way: storm, clashes, pirats,... You are in direct conflict with other shipowners, these are your competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A smart strategy, making decissions fast, choosing the best routes, buying new ships and seaports, buying-out another shipowner, reacting on a crisis ... A nose for business and a dose of luck will determine if your fleet will win this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Giants is a game for 2 to 4 players, you roll dice and move your ships forward on the course they are traveling, you get money if you end on a harbour spot and have the opportunity to buy the harbour, if no one else owns it yet. You can also spend your turn buying new ships for different courses. The game can end either by setting a time limit or by buying all harbours from other players so you are the monopolist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have a nice course !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
