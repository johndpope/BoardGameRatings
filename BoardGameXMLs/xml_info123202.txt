			<description>System for replaying individual football matches by minute-to-minute decisions. Statistics for all the 1990 World Cup teams are included, as it is a system for translating statistics from any match, so you can replay that great day for your team (unless your team is England, so there is no great day you can recreate!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team is rated for ability in certain skills like 'shooting at goal' or 'passing the ball', 'movement' and so on. Once you decide the option you would like to take, you roll the dice and check on the ability. Sometimes you will retain possession and thus make the next decision, and so on, until you lose the ball and your opponent has the same choices for his team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one who scores the most goals, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
