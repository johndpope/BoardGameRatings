			<description>Many, many sunsets ago, it started as a card game. It is a game about an armadillo in a handheld video game. Two twins, who had been playing the game since the womb, decided to create such a game by designing a system they deemed the Intento RiiPlay. It may have had monotone graphics but it had a cool level editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the prototype was hijacked by their rival creators and codenamed the Mega Raystation. Soon after, the project was apprehended by the government which saw the name as a threat to national security. Nonetheless, Intendo went on, and its founders continued playing RIC O&amp;rsquo; Chet, the armored &amp;lsquo;dillo card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You too can play this card game! Players create a level from their level cards for their opponent to beat. Each players level starts as 3 cards with controller button icons that must match the icons on their editor cards to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As cards are scored from the left, cards shift just as they would in a side scrolling platformer. The creator of the level uses their editor cards to determine which level cards are placed next. The first player to score all 12 of their opponents level cards wins the round and the opponent loses a health. If  a player loses all health, they have lost the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
