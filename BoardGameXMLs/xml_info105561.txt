							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy</name>
									
			<description>The player controls Earthworm Jim, who has the ability to jump and shoot, but lacks his trademark head-whip ability from other games. Player could collect items such as additional weapons (including a gun shooting green plasma, rocket launcher, and a machine gun). Also, player could find Jim's friend, Snot, and ride him to jump higher, or obtain Jim' rocket, which allows fly and shoot across the level for a small amount of time. Before each level, Jim has to explore a small city level to gather nuts and bolts before using a transporter to choose his level. In every level, except the boss battles, Jim has to collect the nuts to activate the transporter back to a city level. After every two levels, Jim would have to face a boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
