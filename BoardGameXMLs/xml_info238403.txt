			<description>This game depicts a battle between the Hanseatic League Fleet and the Pirates of &amp;quot;Victual Brothers&amp;quot; around the island of Heligoland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 24 units comprising two fleets with the same mix of units in both fleets. The fleets are differentiated by the color of their hulls and different Flagships.  The ships are of different sizes represented by the number of their masts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ship can take (destroy) an enemy ship of the same or smaller size and can move a number of points on the map based on its size (big ships move less than the smaller ones).  If a ship has other ships on points surrounding it, it is considered protected and cannot be taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The units are flats and appear to be hand painted.  The Flagship of the Hanseatic league is the &amp;quot;Colorful Cow&amp;quot; and the pirate's Flagship is called the &amp;quot;Sea Wolf&amp;quot;. Both Flagships move and attack with a range of 1 but can take out all ships including each other. Victory is determined in multiple ways related to which ships have been lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A truly amazing game from the late 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
