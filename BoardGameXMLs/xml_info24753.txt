			<description>Mid-sixties Marvin Glass offering from Schaper for two players only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modular 'board' consists of a high quality hollow green plastic beanstalk about 18&amp;quot; high with a fluffy white cloud surrounding the top, concealing the 'sleeping' giant.  A sequence of ten small holes spirals from bottom to top of the beanstalk on each side.  Each of the holes is one of three shapes and these accommodate the stems of the plastic leaves players must insert in the correct sequence from bottom to top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, all beanstalk leaves are placed inside the hollow beanstalk through a slot situated on each side.  There is a sliding apparatus at the base of the beanstalk which allows each player access to a single leaf on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plastic beanstalk leaves come in 3 colors - green, gold &amp;amp; black.  The green leaves have stems that will only fit into specific beanstalk holes and must be replaced inside the beanstalk if they do not match the next in the sequence.  Gold leaves are universal and fit into any beanstalk hole.  Black leaves are useless and are immediately replaced through a slot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete the sequence of leaves in order wins the game.  When a leaf is placed in the final hole at the top of the beanstalk, a spring mechanism is triggered which causes the 'sleeping' giant to pop up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
