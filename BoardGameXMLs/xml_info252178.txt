			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Princess Maricara, a tiefling from the northern coast, is supposed to be getting married today. Her lifelong friends have gathered in addition to her extended family and the wealthiest members of her kingdom. As she readies for her wedding, she learns that her groom, the noble Prince Vali of the southern coast, is not in his bed chamber. His attendants and family do not know where he is, and the wedding is in a few hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bride and her bridesmaids have gathered in her bed chamber, and as a group of princesses who would rather knock bolts with their crossbows than cross their legs, are not consoling their friend, but they are plotting how to find the missing groom. Princess Maricara will not be a jilted bride!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
