			<description>Paw Patrol Pups in Training is a frantic, real-time game in which players mash spring-loaded &amp;quot;flippers&amp;quot; that cause their pups to leap into the air and -- hopefully! -- knock badges and treats off of a spinning, overhead carousel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four badges and eight treats in all, with 'Badges' worth 3 points and 'Treats' 1 point each.  When all badges and treats have been knocked off the carousel the players add up their points and the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Game play is similar in style to Hungry Hungry Hippos.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paw Patrol is on a roll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spring into action with the Paw Patrol Pups In Training Game! Your mission is to collect as many treats and badges as you can from the spinning target ring. Set up is easy, just place the treats and badges on the target ring and give it a spin. Then get behind your favorite Paw Patrol Character and press the Pup Flipper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you knock off a badge or treat hold on to it, each one is worth points. The player with the most points at the end wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(No batteries required.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
