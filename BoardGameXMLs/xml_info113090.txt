			<description>It was only supposed to be a onetime deal to make a little extra cash. That was several years, countless deals, and a few arrests ago. Now you can't even imagine a life doing anything else. The money is too good to give it up. At least it was until someone started moving in on your territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Druggies is a flip toss game where each player takes the role of a drug dealer trying to get and sell drugs in an effort to be the first seller to reach the sales goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT IS A FLIP TOSS GAME?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A flip toss game is a boardgame that uses a coin of some sort, instead of dice or cards, to determine different results during the course of the game. This is achieved by flipping a coin and trying to get it to land in a desired location on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
