			<description>UGGU is the acronym for &amp;quot;ungleich-gleich/gleich-ungleich&amp;quot; (different-equal/equal-different)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Material:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A square of wood with a 9x9 grid. Alternatively, for a shorter playing time or else to learn the game, the 7x7 bright-colored area can be used&lt;br/&gt;     14 light-colored wooden pieces in three different heights, for a total of 42 cube units&lt;br/&gt;     14 dark-colored wooden pieces in three different heights, for a total of 42 cube units&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Bright starts and sets any of its pieces on a square of the playing field except for those on all four board sides&lt;br/&gt;     Then dark sets any of its pieces on any square not adjacent to the bright piece and also not on the board edges&lt;br/&gt;     Both players now place their pieces alternatively so that every new piece is placed adjacent (orthogonally, not diagonally) to an already placed piece, no matter the color.&lt;br/&gt;     The following two rules must be observed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) If the adjacent pieces have different heights, they must have the same color&lt;br/&gt;  b) If the adjacent pieces have the same height, they must have different colors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The player unable to add a new piece during his turn loses the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
