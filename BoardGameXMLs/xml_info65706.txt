			<description>The objective of MixMania is to provide newly formed and intact groups with a fun and interactive way to get acquainted with the other members of a group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;profile&amp;quot; consists of one answered question from each of the four suits. This equals a total of four answered questions on each of the other players. The first person to accumulate &amp;quot;profiles&amp;quot; for each of the players in the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MixMania follows a rummy structure and categorizes information by the four suits. The wildcard can be used for any suit in a &amp;quot;profile.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Componets:&lt;br/&gt;82 cards&lt;br/&gt;There are four suits called Work Life, Personal Life, Childhood, and Dreams and two Wildcards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
