			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Circus Attractions the player is performing various attractions  in the Big Top. The game can be played single player, or cooperatively. The acts are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trampolining - The basic skills here are simply to time your jumps to go higher. However the crowd quickly tires of this (indicated by an on-screen gauge). To maintain interest, the player must perform somersaults. In the two player version, jumps are controlled individually, but if one player initiates a somersault, the other player follows. Timing is therefore key such that both players can successfully land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tightrope Walking - The player moves forward automatically but must balance. Bonus objects can be collected with artistic acts such as a scissorkick or handstand. In the two player mode, the second player stands on the shoulders of the first. Both must keep balance, but only the top player can perform artistic acts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juggling - This starts simple by controlling the throwing and catching of balls between two hands. However soon you have to deal with a ball being kept aloft using your foot, the collecting of additional objects and jumping to avoid a motorbike! The two player mode has the players throwing balls to each other, but timing the taking of additional items is crucial in order to keep the rhythm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knife Throwing - The player must take and throw knives at a lady strapped to a rotating disk. Taking too long between shots will cause your assistant to casually throw knives into the audience (!) and he will occasionally attempt to pass you a stick of dynamite rather than a knife. In the two player version, both players are throwing at the disk simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jumping Clowns - Three clowns and two see-saws. Jumping on one end of a see-saw catapults a clown across the screen to the other see-saw, hopefully in turn sending another clown back in the opposite direction. Bonuses can be collected when flying across the screen. In the two player mode, players take turns directing the trajectory of a flying clown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
