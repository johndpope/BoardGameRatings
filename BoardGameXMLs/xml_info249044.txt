			<description>Texas Showdown is a game of strategy and skill that provides the thrill-a-minute excitement of an Old West Showdown at the saloon card table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Texas Showdown, players must simultaneously consider the money bet against the Pot and the moves the cards will allow them to make around the board.  The object is to acquire certain combinations of board properties or to break your opponent(s) either with your skillful play at the Two Card Poker table or by charging outrageous rents when they visit your gambling establishments.  But watch your play--you may end up in Judge Roy Bean's Court where you will be fined for such things as &amp;quot;relieving yourself on his horse's leg&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;not sharing your chickie at the Texas Chicken Ranch.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Texas Showdown uses original statistical combinations that make each Wild West Showdown different from the last and provide a never-ending source of entertainment for two to five players, aged twelve to adult.  Average game time is thirty minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The properties of Texas Showdown represent infamously crooked gambling houses of the Nineteenth Century, where the only sure bet was the loss of your money.  Relive the stories that have come down to us from this romantic era of great gamblers and famous suckers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Description above is from side of box.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
