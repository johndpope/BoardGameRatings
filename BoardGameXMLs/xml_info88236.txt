							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mortality of Green (Generic/Universal)</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Tis said of that ancient forest that even before the world grew accustomed to the light of day, that her stems had grown high and her eaves already dark and contemplative. If ever those ancient trees pondered, however, then it was in silent expectancy, brooding on a bent that only they and perhaps a few others may not for it has never been theirs to speak with vocal tongue. Mayhap they ponder simple things, or  maybe they wonder on the many creatures which have come to crawl the earth since those days before days, for all manner of beasts and monsters have come from the Outlands to slip into obscurity underneath the shadowy vale of the Darkenfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mortality of Green is compatible with any fantasy roleplaying system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
