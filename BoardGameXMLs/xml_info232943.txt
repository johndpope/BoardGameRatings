			<description>Starweb is a placement game without movement or capture. Players take turns to place one stone. The starshaped board has 18 corners, 12 outward and 6 inward ones. Groups containing corners have a value of 1 point for one corner, 2 points for the second corner, 3 for the third and so on. A group containing 4 corners thus has a value of 1+2+3+4=10 points. This 'triangular' score makes connecting groups very advantageous.&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the pie rule and ends when both players pass on successive turns. The player with the highest score wins. In case of an equal score the player who placed the second stone on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
