			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are defined by Characteristic Scores (Abilities), including Strength, Agility, Endurance, Intelligence, Perception, and Charisma.  Characters also possess Combat Skills, but they are derived values based on Characteristic Scores, potentially modified by experience.  Characters select a Race which offers some modifiers to the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat uses a fairly standard process, based on a percentile system, and incorporates &amp;quot;Action Points&amp;quot; (temporary, optional bonuses).  Combat rounds are subdivided into Revolutions (5 seconds) and Revolution Cycles (12 Revolutions) to track duration and measure actions.  Several &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; types of combat are supported, including pulling, pushing, tripping, grappling, and so forth. A variety of special damage conditions are supported (Concussion, Fatigued, Paranoia, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document does not include setting or adventure notes, though the inclusion of firearms and &amp;quot;thrown explosives&amp;quot; suggests it is intended to support a modern genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
