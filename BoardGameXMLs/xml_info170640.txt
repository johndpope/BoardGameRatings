			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 40 x 20 inch Battlemap of a Boxing Gym, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play and a 360 view of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It ain&amp;rsquo;t much of a choice. I break your legs and cripple you for life or you let our best fighter smash your face when you throw the fight tonight. Don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather keep walking than worry about my good looks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dare enter the boxing ring where fighters have shed sweat, blood, and tears upon victory or defeat? As you enter the gym, the pungent aroma of sweat assails your nose. The floorboards are old and creak as you walk on them. You swear that some of the floorboards in the back have been taken out in odd two by four shapes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxing Gym is an interior map of a four-corner boxing ring, surrounding gym, and a small office. Boxing Gym includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the room right next to the boxing ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxing Gym is intended for use in modern games. Its gritty, grimy, and bloody atmosphere also fits pulp and horror games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxing Gym has a lot of scope. Besides a boxing ring, the four corner ring can be used for a martial artist fighting ring, or a four-corner wrestling ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Legs or Jaw, Your Choice: One of the Player Character&amp;rsquo;s enemies, debts, or favors comes into play. A criminal organization is running a fight club at night. The criminal organization captures the Player Character and tells them to either fight in the club tonight or they break his legs. If the Player Character agrees, the criminal organization tells them to make it look good and throw the fight. This might cause a complication for some characters that are arrogant, overconfident, have a code of honor, etc. where doing anything less than their best conflicts with their personality and ethics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the rest of the group is searching the streets for their friend. Eventually they find the boxing gym at night where their friend is in the ring and fighting a large, musclebound opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question becomes does the Player Character throw the fight? If so the criminal organization is happy and forgives debts or favors as well as improves its attitude towards the character (such as becoming unfriendly or neutral rather than a hostile enemy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Player Character doesn&amp;rsquo;t throw the fight, the criminal organization isn&amp;rsquo;t happy after losing money and tries to kill the Player Character as payment for its loss of cash. It&amp;rsquo;s up to his friends to help get him out of the fight club alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
