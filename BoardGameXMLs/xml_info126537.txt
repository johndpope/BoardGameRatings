			<description>&amp;quot;The new word game that makes staying home fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the 15 cubes and set the timer, then try to create as many words as possible on the scoring board (crossword-style) before the timer runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once time is up, words that were created are scored at a rate of 5 points per cube, with cubes that were not used subtracting 5 points per cube from the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, each cube is placed on top of a numbered square when creating a word, and as each cube is scored, the number that the cube was placed on top of is also added to the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if you have an &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; that is on top of a 7, that cube would score 5+7=12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player with the highest overall score after 3 turns is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appears to share a large number of design elements with Scrabble Crossword Cubes, but with a different scoring mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
