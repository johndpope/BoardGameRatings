							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FILD: Renegade Monster</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a mildly scary universe, with creepy monsters and subtly chilling music, FILD: Renegade Monsters is aimed at the whole family.  It is an easy-to-learn but hard-to-master territory conquest game.  Children as young as four will pick up quickly on the intuitive gameplay, while seasoned board gamers will develop complex strategies to master this option-rich game, which has a skill-to-chance balance similar to that of Backgammon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players embody the mighty spirits of Flora, Ice, Lava, and Desert.  They fight for territory with the help of Zombies, Phantoms, Vampire Ladies, and other disloyal monsters.  Each field has the colour of the monster placed on it.  Monsters change colour when a monster of their family, but of a different colour, is placed next to them.  Turn-by-turn territories expand, change sides, or are fenced off.  At the end of the game, the player with the most and largest territories wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
