							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neverwinter (Fortune Cards)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neverwinter is the second set of 80 themed &amp;quot;booster&amp;quot; cards released by Wizards of the Coast for their Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 4e game. This set of 80 cards is themed to match the Neverwinter Campaign Setting, the August-September 2011 D&amp;amp;D Encounters season (Lost Crown of Neverwinter) and the Game Day release Gates of Neverdeath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards come in packs of 8 with one rare card (a small star appears on the bottom to indicate rare card). The cards come in three varieties: Attack, Defense and Tactic. A user-made deck needs to be somewhat balanced between these three types of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Fortune Cards, sold in booster packs of 8 cards, give players fun new ways to survive the challenges of the D&amp;amp;D Encounters in-store play program, as well as their home campaigns. These cards give characters fun, temporary benefits that feel different from the benefits gained from powers and feats, without adding undue complexity to the D&amp;amp;D game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each encounter, shuffle your deck and draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play one card per round. It requires no action to play. The rules on each card state when you can play it and what effect it has. A card takes effect just once unless it states otherwise, and you discard the card when its effect ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can have only one Fortune Card in your hand at a time. At the start of each of your turns, you can do one of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Discard the card in your hand and draw a new one.&lt;br/&gt;     Draw a new card if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;     Keep the card that&amp;rsquo;s in your hand if you haven&amp;rsquo;t played it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
