			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snow Business is a murder mystery game for 10 to 12 guests and a host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each winter, the Harrisons and the Perrys ski in the French Alps and always rent the Chalet Flaubert. They hire the whole chalet and bring both families and friends. The holidays are usually an opportunity to relax and unwind away from the pressures of normal life, but this year has been different. Jacqui and Mariella have been arguing, Lucy has sprained her wrist, snow has cut the chalet off - and tonight, real tragedy has struck. A few minutes ago, John Morgan was found dead at the foot of the attic steps, his neck broken at an unfortunate angle. Nobody can leave the chalet; and there is no phone or radio in here... Did John fall or was he pushed? Is there a murderer in Chalet Flaubert? Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive Snow Business? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt; In Snow Business you will discover the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    What happened to the missing wallet? &lt;br/&gt;    Who still carries a torch for an old flame? &lt;br/&gt;    Is an ungrateful child really sharper than a serpent's tooth? &lt;br/&gt;    What are the Swiss good at, apart from chocolate and cuckoo clocks? &lt;br/&gt;    ...and, of course, who killed John Morgan? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in Snow Business!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Snow Business, the stage is set for an innocent family gathering, with a few friends and strangers added to make the party go with a swing. However, not everyone is as they seem - some have dark secrets they need to keep hidden... and someone is the killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snow Business lasts for three to four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (78 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?90&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?90&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
