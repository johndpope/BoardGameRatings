			<description>This game offers players a chance to show off their scrapbooking prowess in a fast paced card game that takes about 30 minutes to play. Players attempt to build a perfect scrapbook layout by mixing Title, Photos, Embellishments and other elements. But beware! The other players are working hard on their own designs and everyone is limited to the same box of supplies. As you try to gather the needed supplies for your masterpiece your &amp;quot;helpful&amp;quot; friends will be providing you with their cast-offs and useless items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end you will each have a complete scrapbook design. Will yours inspire envy or pity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
