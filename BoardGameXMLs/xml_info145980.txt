			<description>From Beasts of War;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;ArcWorlde, is a skirmish tabletop game, set in the fantasy realm of ArcWorlde. Although you can play it with any amount of players, and any amount of models, it&amp;rsquo;s usually with around fifteen models each, and features a model-by-model playing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each player takes turns to activate one of their models, in whatever order they choose. When a Captain (the leader of the force) or Hero (the minor characters) are activated the controlling player may activate a number of other models at the same time if they wish to do so. Up to six friendly models within 6&amp;rdquo; of the Captain or Hero&amp;rsquo;s base may be activated, performing their actions immediately as normal. In this way a player may co-ordinate their troops to attack their foes in waves but it comes at a price. Activating your models in larger groups can leave your opponent free reign at the end of the turn if all your models have acted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Other unique aspects of ArcWorlde are smaller &amp;ldquo;side-quests&amp;rdquo; within the main game itself. These are entirely optional, and by no means an essential component of the ArcWorlde game, but they add flavour and fun if the players so wish! There are Forgotten Tombs, where the player can delve inside to uncover lost treasure, or terrible evil. There are the Epic Duels, where ANY of the models on the board can engage in mighty combat, fighting to the death for glory and prestige. There are many more work-in-progress side quests, which will be added to the rulebook if the Kickstarter does as well as I hope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
