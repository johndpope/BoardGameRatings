			<description>Tully Alford, the Addams Family attorney, has evicted the clan from their home (based towards the end of the movie) and to make matters worse, Morticia Addams, Pugsley Addams, Wednesday Addams, Granny Addams and Lurch have gone missing. It is up to Gomez Addams to find and save his family, defeat the confused Uncle Fester and face his ultimate goal of kicking Alford out of the Addams' rightful home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Addams Family (handheld game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
