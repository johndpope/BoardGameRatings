			<description>Enchanters of Legamoria is a free print-and-play fantasy game that combines the strategic aspects of chess with the dynamics of magic the gathering.  Designed for 2, 4 or 6 players, the game is played on a grid where opponents take turns summoning pieces, modifiers, lands and spells to the battleground.  Pieces have various attacks, abilities and effects that, when used in concert with each other, produce infinite variations of duels.  Each player may summon up to 4 lands in his/her summoning ground.  The game ends when a player or team has no more remaining lands on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game files are located at legamoria.com.  Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
