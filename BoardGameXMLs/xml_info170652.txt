			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As gamers, our Saturday nights often revolve around dice. Sometimes, those dice are our tormentors - letting us down at the worst possible moment, or keeping us from succeeding in our endeavors time after time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thankfully, this is not one of those times!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Critical Success is one of the highlights of any gaming night, and no great story is complete without the well-timed and much needed Crit. Your character manages to do the impossible, or at least the unthinkable, and the well-crafted plans of your GM/DM are laid to ruin before your mighty d20!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following product gives you the tools to turn your drab old &amp;quot;your swing does double damage&amp;quot; routine into an exciting and often unpredictable triumph. From results that eviscerate your enemies, to Critical Successes that rally your allies and lend strength to their blows, these 47 tables are sure to deliver countless hours of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember, all products in the '47 Series' line are d20 fantasy-based, but system neutral so you can easily adapt them to any game system you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
