			<description>Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s Last Gamble contains five battles from the Waterloo Campaign, which Napoleon began by seizing the central position between the Prussian and British Armies. On June 15th the Grande Arm&amp;eacute;e was unleashed across the Sambre River. Allied screening forces sent out the warning to headquarters. The Allies executed a forward concentration behind the cover of their screens. As the 16th dawned, troops of both sides still converged on the battlefields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Napoleon's Last Gamble is one of the games from OSG's The Library of Napoleonic Battles series. Details on the series are below, as all the games share a common rules set and game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two 22x3&amp;quot; maps &lt;br/&gt;     One 17x22&amp;quot; map &lt;br/&gt;     560 die-cut counter units &lt;br/&gt;     100 playing cards &lt;br/&gt;     two rulebooks &lt;br/&gt;     15 Player aid cards &lt;br/&gt;     covered in a box &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BATTLES SIMULATED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quatre-Bras, Ney at the Crossroads, 16 June &lt;br/&gt;The French attacked on two fronts simultaneously.  The tenacious defense of Quatre Bras by the Anglo-Allied troops saved the Prussians from receiving the full weight of the Arm&amp;eacute;e du Nord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ligny, The Last Victory, 16 June &lt;br/&gt;Finally unleashed, the Guard pushed the Prussians back from the Ligny brook. Bl&amp;uuml;cher himself was wounded and separated from headquarters. But Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s hoped-for knock-out blow remained undelivered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wavre, Grouchy&amp;rsquo;s Blunder, 18 June &lt;br/&gt;Napoleon separated the two wings of his army, ordering Marshal Grouchy on the track of the Prussians while he pursued Wellington.  Grouchy&amp;rsquo;s prescribed route was wide of the mark, and took him to the outer flank, allowing the Prussians to interpose themselves between the two French wings&amp;mdash;Bl&amp;uuml;cher achieved a strategic reversal of the opening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waterloo, A Near Run Thing, 18 June &lt;br/&gt;While Grouchy frittered away time engaging the Prussian rear-guard at Wavre, Ney conducted the mid-phase of the battle like a rear-guard action in the Peninsular Campaign, failing to provide infantry support for his spectacular cavalry charges. Wellington fought a successful defensive battle, managing to cling to his ridge until the arrival of three Prussian corps. The broken French army retreated toward Charleroi; Grouchy&amp;rsquo;s intact wing moved south-east toward Namur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Souffel, Rapp&amp;rsquo;s Last Stand, 28 June&lt;br/&gt;Three days after Waterloo, Rapp woke up and began a slow withdrawal from the Rhine, pursued by the vanguard of Schwarzenberg's Army. On June 26 the heavily-outnumbered Rapp skirmished with the Austrian III Corps. Two days later he made a stand along the Souffel River, and the Austrians attacked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     480 meters per hex, &lt;br/&gt;     1 hour per turn, &lt;br/&gt;     400-800 men per strength point. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns. The Full campaign links the individual battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Text mostly from the OSG pages)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
