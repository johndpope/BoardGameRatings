			<description>Defenders of Dynatron City is a video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by JVC and LucasArts in August 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centers on a team of superheroes who protect a futuristic metropolis from Dr. Mayhem and his robotic henchmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game won praise in its preproduction by many video game magazines for the creation of an original superhero team. However, when the game was released it was widely panned by video game critics for, among other things, having a notoriously poor hit detection that required extremely precise aim for attacks to hit enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Defenders of Dynatron City&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
