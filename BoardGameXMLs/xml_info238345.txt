							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vale of the Iron God</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vale sits between two mountains that border the rolling hills and plains of the Desolation, and is the source of the Bitter Ice River that flows through that land of lost empires. The Vale itself is said to hold the living corpse of the Iron God, the very deity that wiped out the Lost Empires. Many bold (some say foolish) adventurers have come to this vale to seek their fortunes, but few have returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those that did spoke of caves where monsters dwelt, strange ruins, and of the dangers of the tomb of the Iron God; but these men and women also brought out gold and jewels and wondrous artefacts, and their successes continue to draw others to the Vale of the Iron God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vale ofthe Iron God is the third Book of Lairs, containing ten lairs/dungeons filled with monsters and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
