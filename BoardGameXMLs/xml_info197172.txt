			<description>Chip Shop Is a game about the computer boom of the 1980s. Players take on the role of the head of a fledgling computer company vying to capture a slice of the new market. You have a decade to make your mark, will it be for longevity, loyalty, units shifted or a balance between them all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of ten rounds, with worker placement from money made from products and events. Players may win by scoring on any one of three score tracks, or a combination of the above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chip Shop begins in the American 1980s, but expansions are planned to allow for game play in different eras, regions and markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from official expansions or 'updates', the tools and processes used to create the game have been open-sourced, allowing the community to create its own additions, or 'patches'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
