							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Judge Dredd: Block War</name>
									
			<description>BLOCK WAR is a 2-player card game based on one of the greatest story arcs in Judge Dredd&amp;trade; history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players act as &amp;lsquo;Perps&amp;rsquo; in their respective Blocks, when Block War breaks out. Blast the enemy, reinforce your gangs, or just drop a Boing&amp;trade; on the Justice Department who is trying to stop you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls 5 windows on their side of the street. Place your gangs and open your windows to attack and close them to defend yourself.  Down on &amp;ldquo;The Street&amp;rdquo; the Justice Department has responded to the disturbance and have joined the battle. Not only are you attacking  your opponent, you are attacking the Justice Department that is sworn to stop you. Strategically open/close your windows to defend yourself from the never ending onslaught that is facing you. But Watch Out! They&amp;rsquo;ve called in a Manta Tank! One shot destroys your window, and if you&amp;rsquo;re really unlucky, you&amp;rsquo;ll face Judge Dredd Himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Judge Dredd: Block War cardgame was specifically designed to be as brutal a game to play as it is to exist in Mega-City One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
