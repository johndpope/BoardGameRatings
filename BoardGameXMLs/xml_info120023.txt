							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Dozen War Trophies</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War, and conflict in general, plays a large part in most d20 fantasy campaigns. Whether it serves as a historical background for a world or is a part of an active campaign, war happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, a lot of things occur in war besides fighting, and one of those things is the collection of trophies of war. Everything from weapons to uniforms to personal possessions is taken by the victors from the defeated and brought back home, to be proudly displayed, hidden away in trunks, or even thrown away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 7-page PDF presents a dozen trophies of war to help GMs get their players started on the fun hobby of trophy collection. Although these items are designed with the idea of actual war in mind, they can be easily adapted to be gained as the result of a typical adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
