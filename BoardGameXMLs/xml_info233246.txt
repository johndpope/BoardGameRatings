							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of Andor: Varatan&#039;s Lighthouse</name>
									
			<description>A promo for Legends of Andor: Journey North.  This was available through the Dice Tower Season 13 Indegogo campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set the tower from the base game on the rocky crag space to the left of the red symbol printed on the board showing a 4th place one of the 4 eternal flames on the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No, Varatan's Lighthouse at Klippenwacht has long since collapsed and fall into the sea.&amp;quot; That's what the sea people said. But sometimes, far away on the northern horizon, you could see a shimmering violet light. At the eternal flame of the sort created by Hadrian wizards, perhaps? King Varatan had been a friend good wizards of the. Might have given him a gift of eternal flame for his lighthouse? What it a good omen to show the heroes the way?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll a white die to  determine the letters on the legend track on which the remaining 3 eternal flames should be placed.&lt;br/&gt;1 = p &lt;br/&gt;2 = Q &lt;br/&gt;3 = R &lt;br/&gt;4 = S&lt;br/&gt;5 = T&lt;br/&gt;6 = U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following rule modifications apply - but only when the Narrator is standing of the letters with on eternal flame on one:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. If you uncover a new wind card, you are allowed to ignore this card and set it aside (for example, if it is a storm). Then you get to uncover a second card instead.&lt;br/&gt;You must accept this second card, whether it is a wind or a storm card card.&lt;br/&gt;2. When you are fighting a creature (not a final adversary), you are allowed to first roll for the creature.&lt;br/&gt;Only then will the heroes roll. In this way, you can assess the strength of the opponent and decide what tools to use - or, if you are fighting together, how many of you should participate.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
