			<description>Players represent the batting and fielding sides in a game of limited overs cricket.&lt;br/&gt;The fielding player sets up his field using white counters to depict his fielders. Counters also represent the batsman and umpires, though these are static.&lt;br/&gt;For each ball in an over, a card is drawn from the deck to represent the outcome of that bowl (no ball, howzat etc.), and the result is recorded in an authentically detailed score book - meaning that at the end of the innings the scores will be represented as in a real match. The positioning of the field affects the likelihood of the batsmen being given out as well as the number of runs they will score.&lt;br/&gt;The box includes: Game board, with all the major fielding positions marked; counters to represent fielders, batsmen and umpires (including several spares); a deck of cards for drawing each ball of the over; An in/out die (green and red sides); A fully authentic cricket score book; four blank cards for replacement/original outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
