			<description>Premier Manager 3 (also known as PM3) is a football management simulator video game for the Commodore Amiga and DOS platforms. It was released in 1994 by Gremlin Interactive. The objective of the game is to manage a football club successfully within the top 5 divisions in the English league system, starting from the 1994-95 football season. The game was re-released a year later to included updated teams and player details for the 1995-96 football season. Gremlin also released Premier Multi-Edit System; software that allows the user to edit the statistics of football players and teams in Premier Manager 3 to their liking. Premier Manager 3 followed Premier Manager 2. There is an AGA version of Premier Manager 3 as well as a standard version for all Amigas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premier Manager 3 is a football management video game that puts the player in charge of a football club. The player has to manage not only the team and tactics to win football matches, but also the club's finances such as applying for bank loans, organising advertising boards and scheduling stadium improvements. The primary interface is made up of 12 main sections. These are team settings, telephone, fax machine, sponsorship, ground improvements, business case, club finances, transfer market, history, league tables, cup competitions and play the next match. From this interface the player can access all the settings necessary to manage the football club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game starts, the user takes control of a conference league team of their choice. If the user manages the team poorly and finishes in last position in the league, the team will not be relegated; in real life, a team finishing in the relegation zone would have gone down to what is now Level 7 in the English football league system at the time, although since 2004 two leagues were added between these leagues and the Conference National. To be successful, the user must not only win football matches, but also manage the finances of the club well. If the player is in too much debt then the player can be fired even if he had good results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The user can change the club he manages by taking job offers from other clubs at the end of the season or applying for a position at a club where a manager has been fired mid season. The managerial rating of the user affects whether or not this application is successful. Premier Manager 3 can be played by two players, though they have to take turns accessing their teams. In a new feature to the series, the users can attempt to outbid each other. Previously in Premier Manager 2, the second user had the advantage of bidding after the first user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1996, Premier Manager 3 Deluxe was released which included the updated league, team and player statistics for the 1995/96 football season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Premier Manager 3,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
