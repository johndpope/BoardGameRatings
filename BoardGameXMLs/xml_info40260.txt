			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;  COMBAT, the new war card game, is inspired by the popular TV show. Players mix both skill and strategy with risk and luck to &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; as many weapons as they are able.&lt;br/&gt;  In the pack of 40 cards are 32 weapon card...which show a NUMBER, INSIGNIA and a WEAPON. The NUMBER on the WEAPON card is the point VALUE of the card in scoring. The remaining 8 cards are &amp;quot;CAPTURE&amp;quot; cards. They show a NUMBER and WEAPON. There are 2 CAPTURE cards of each WEAPON. These cards are used at strategic times to &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; as many WEAPON cards as possible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
