			<description>&amp;quot;Pok&amp;eacute;mon Battle Revolution​ (ポケモンバトルレボリューション, Pok&amp;eacute;mon Batoru Reboryūshon) is the first Wii incarnation of the Pok&amp;eacute;mon video game franchise. It is also the first Wii game to use the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in North America and Japan and the first Wii game to wirelessly interact with the Nintendo DS handheld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pok&amp;eacute;mon Battle Revolution features eleven different colosseums in a new land, a Pok&amp;eacute;mon-themed park called Pok&amp;eacute;topia.Other features include stadiums that have their own special effects, such as randomizing the order of one's Pok&amp;eacute;mon. Some other effects are choosing the order of an opponent's Pok&amp;eacute;mon and setting level limitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was the first Pok&amp;eacute;mon game to be rated 7+ by PEGI: all other Pok&amp;eacute;mon games rated by them were rated 3+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 14 different colosseums, each with special changes to normal play or prerequisites and a Colosseum Leader. The Crystal Colosseum holds battles in a 16-person single-elimination tournament mode. The Gateway Colosseum is only open to a rental pass holder, and Neon Colosseum uses a wheel to choose the player's and opponent's battling Pok&amp;eacute;mon. As the player progresses, the Pok&amp;eacute;mon available to rent become more powerful. The player also earns Pok&amp;eacute;-Coupons, the currency of this game. Coupons can be spent to further customize the player character. A trainer's apparel, accessories, and hair color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pok&amp;eacute;mon attacks are also much more diverse, with each Pok&amp;eacute;mon acquiring its own animation for most moves in the game. Some animations feature both the attacking and defending Pok&amp;eacute;mon on screen at the same time. In previous console titles, the game only showed one Pok&amp;eacute;mon attacking and then cut away to the second getting hit by the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with connectivity to the Nintendo DS games, a player can win Pok&amp;eacute;mon from this game and transfer them back to their DS games through Mystery Gift. This feature allows players to obtain Pok&amp;eacute;mon that are either hard or impossible to get without using a cheat device. To unlock the Pok&amp;eacute;mon, players must achieve certain goals or enter a special code. So far, Electivire and Magmortar are the only Pok&amp;eacute;mon that can be obtained through the latter method. A Pikachu with the special moves Volt Tackle and Surf can be obtained by beating each Colosseum once. In addition to the Pok&amp;eacute;mon download, players can purchase items like certain Technical Machines and evolution items.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battle_Revolution,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
