			<description>From the Game instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game consists of a Democracy Board with a spinning dial in the center and a road around the edge of the board over which the Players travel; six individual Charts for players, each chart with a scoring device on top; one Priorities Board Chart; forty-eight Defense Units in eight groups, each group being characterized by a different color background; six individual players Tokens, each of a different color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of &amp;quot;Democracy&amp;quot; is the first person to win $8,000,000.  Thus he arrives at a financial position which enables him to purchase all the units of a complete National Defense.  As the game progresses, many unforeseen things may happen to each player.  Just as in real life. Strikes, sabotage, shortages, troubles of all kinds beset the way but the end is well worth while.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
