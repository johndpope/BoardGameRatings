							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diminutives Opposing Civilization</name>
									
			<description>Rude, rambunctious, and raunchy. Diminutives hate civilization and they are on a one-way trip to end it all! Equipping themselves with unique and powerful gear (such as Yo Dong Wang&amp;rsquo;s Doom Frisbee and the Dreaded Unitard of the Old One) they fight while assembling their ultimate weapon of destruction. Will your diminutive be victorious and be the one to destroy it all?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diminutives Opposing Civilization is a card game for 3-5 players. Each player uses quality and gear cards to outfit their diminutive, defeat other diminutives, gather pieces for their ultimate weapon, and destroy civilization! There are literally millions of hilarious combinations in DOC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think that Diminutives Opposing Civilization is just a straight-forward, predictable game, well&amp;hellip; think again! DOC also has both &amp;ldquo;Twist of Fate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Quirk&amp;rdquo; cards. Twist of Fate cards create situations and effects that no can predict. Quirk cards shift the fate of battle in unpredictable ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spontaneous and unpredictable, with just enough strategy, means that Diminutives Opposing Civilization will keep things hilariously interesting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
