							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kookie Cookie</name>
									
			<description>A blue plastic cookie jar is placed in the center of the table.  A deck of 40 round cards are dealt into one face-down stack per player.  There cards show a chocolate chip cookie on the back and one of several Sesame Street characters on the front.  Each player also gets two cardboard cookie chips with a unique border color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players count aloud and then simultaneously flip over the topmost card of their stack and then quickly scan all of the newly flipped cards for any that have matching characters on them.  If there are no pairs, then everyone counts and flips another card.  If a pair is spotted, the players must try to toss their cookie chips into the jar.  Whoever does so first, as determined by the bottommost chip, claims all of the flipped cards and adds them to the bottom of their stack.  The player that eventually claims all of the cookie cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
