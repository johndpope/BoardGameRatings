			<description>From the Kidult website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows which colour dinosaurs were? Nobody! So have fun and colour them as you wish! Dear children, dear parents, who is writing these words has designed the animals you see, he is the father of three wonderful daughters Alessia, Alice and Michela who, like all the other children, are always searching for something new to do and to learn from. These unpublished images and these games are inspired at Bookgames a series of books designed to help parents grow with their children in a more simple way, more profitable and fun: PLAYING WITH THEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These games aim at those children that, in most cases, can not read yet or they are learning. That is why every character on a coloured pedestal has a big initial and a name completely written with capital letters. Children love to play: that is why every picture to be cut can become a playing card, or it can be folded along the base so that it stands and be played with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kromosauri game includes 54 pictures to cut, one coloured series of (27), one black and white series of (27) (that you can colour yourself) and a series of (27) presentation cards with a brief story where the character presents himself. There are also the rules to 6 different games to able you to use the picture cards you have cut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to this material you could have fun with your children getting them involved (and getting yourself involved) by playing with one of the 6 games offered (or you could make up new ones)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
