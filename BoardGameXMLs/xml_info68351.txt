							<name  sortindex="3">A New Royal Geographical Pastime for England and Wales (whereby the distance of each town is laid down from London in measured miles being a very amusing game to play with a teetotum, ivory pillars and counters)</name>
									
			<description>At the gameboard there are 169 principal and county towns joined by lines. The descriptions and rules on either side of the map list each town and any rewards or forfeits to be made. There are no charges for moving from one place to another. One of the better rewards occurs at Stonehenge 'worthy of visiting without expense, from whence you are to be removed to Chester at 148'. One of the harshest is at Knaresborough, 163, 'which has four medicinal springs of different qualities; to drink from them you must pay 1 counter and are conveyed to Bath, 2'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is enlightening, for it not only refers to visiting stately homes, cathedrals, churches and other public buildings but also describes events, folklore, and geographical features such as smuggling, the flitch of bacon given at Dunmow and the Giant's Causeway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published June 1st, 1787.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment required: teetotum, ivory pillars (markers), counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
