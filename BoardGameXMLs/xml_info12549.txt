							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Car, the Game of the Energy Crisis</name>
									
			<description>In &amp;quot;Last Car&amp;quot;, the object of the game is to complete a eight-stop shopping trip around the board. Each player starts with a Gas Guzzler that can only move a limited distance before needing more gas. The gas stations on the board, however, only open for brief periods, and stay open only until one of the cars at the pump draws the Last Car card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a car runs out of gas, the player can push his car one space at a time to a gas station. Otherwise, movement and fuel consumption are determined by the number of dice thrown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles to more energy efficient ones during the course of the game. These cars are slower (fewer movement dice) and have movement restrictions, but minimize the need to get gas. A player can also opt to stop off at home and switch to a bicycle. This needs no gas but requires the player to roll only one movement die, forgo the expressway, and go home to drop off goods after visiting only two stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
