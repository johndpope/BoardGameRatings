			<description>The Partymaster game is a simple and fun board game. It can be played in teams or as single players. The game consists of six pieces, where every single piece symbolizes a personality of the Partymaster Family.&lt;br/&gt; If you are more than five people playing the game, we recommend that you team up. In this way, everyone has a chance of being a part of the experience.&lt;br/&gt; There is a challenge card inside the game box, and with that, everything will be explained for you. It only takes a couple of minutes to read this card through, and understand the game. So the game is very simple and easy to learn.&lt;br/&gt; The average time of a game varies from 30mins to several hours. It depends on how creative and willingly you are to be integrated in the game experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: You or your team pick a brick. You can choose any brick except the green one, which is the pukemaster. Now you pick a challenge with your opponents that the looser shall do. You roll the dice to figure out who starts. &lt;br/&gt;The game mecanic is dice rolling. The teams throw the dice in turns and move the brick until the number is stated on the cube. Every field you land on from now has a picture that refers to the challenge card. The challenge card states what must happen when a person lands on a field. This could be &amp;quot;Give a Pitch&amp;quot; which means that one team should sing 10 seconds of a song, then point at another team that has to continue the singing in 10 seconds. If they can, your team have to drink two sips, if they cannot then they have to drink three sips. &lt;br/&gt;The reason that you cannot pick the pukemaster is that when you land on his field, then you have to down your drinks and become the pukemaster that takes sips when everyone else does. So you don't want to be the pukemaster. &lt;br/&gt;The game continues over 37 fields and finishes when the goal is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
