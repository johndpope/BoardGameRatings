			<description>Advertisement copy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate computer conflict.  MegaWars, a real-time space battle between the forces of the Colonists and the Kryon Empire.  Join an intergalactic shootout with up to eight starship commanders transmitting orders from their keyboard cockpits of their craft anywhere in the U.S.A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacking, evading, scanning, communicating.  That's MegaWars.  Easy to learn but difficult to maters.  That's why CompuServe will give one free hour to every MegaWars player entering a game before December 31, 1982.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacking, evading, scanning, communicating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MegaWars was a series of real-time online multiplayer space empire building games which were hosted on CompuServe in the 1980s and lasted well into the 1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MegaWars III did not follow a version II or I; it was (possibly retroactively) referred to as III in marketing efforts, inferring its complicated and lengthy development history.  It has been described as &amp;quot;The first multi-player strategic empire building space game.&amp;quot;  The game was text based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
