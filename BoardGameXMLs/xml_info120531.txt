							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vampire Diaries</name>
									
			<description>The Vampire Diaries is a board game based on the Warner Brothers television show of the same name. Players take on the role of one of four characters from the show, Elena, Stefan, Damon or Bonnie, and begin the game in possession of a photo-frame portraying their character as a human. A switch in the back of the photo-frame can be used to transform the photo into that of a vampire, and the object of the game is to avoid receiving three bite marks, thereby being the last remaining human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play occurs in turns with players moving a dry erase vampire marker/mover around a simple game board. In turn, each player rolls three dice marked with crows and moves the marker/mover zero to three spaces clockwise, depending on the number of crows rolled. The space the marker lands on allows the player to use the top portion of the vampire mover to apply a dry erase vampire bite stamp to another player's photo-frame, erase one of his or her own vampire bites with the supplied dry erase pad, swap photos with another player, or gain control of the Family Crest Ring which protects that player from vampire bites. A roll of zero crows does not move the marker, instead automatically gaining control of the Family Crest Ring for the player who rolled the zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player receives the third vampire bite on his photo-frame, he can no longer win the game, erase bites, swap photos or possess the Family Crest Ring. However, he can remain in the game, taking turns as normal, but only dealing out vampire bites as allowed. The last player without three vampire bites wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
