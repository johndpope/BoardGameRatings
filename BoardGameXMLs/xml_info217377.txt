							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Von Deutschland nach Amerika mit unseren Handels-U-Booten</name>
									
			<description>This WWI German game has a really unusual theme. Clearly published after the start of the war but before the entry of the United States, it is based on the idea of trading with America by using underwater freighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In game terms, it is a simple roll-and-move affair for up to six players. There are assorted spaces that cause delays or setbacks as well as a few that allow players to take money from the pot. The first player to complete a round trip from Bremen to the U.S. and back is told to shout &amp;quot;Hurra!&amp;quot; three times and take half the pot. The remainder is split by the rest of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has art by Siegmund von Suchdolski, with a cover showing a winged Hermes head in a rising sun over a surfaced U-boat, and the board featuring images of a U-boat engine room and of U-boats in harbor, underway and being loaded with bales of goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
