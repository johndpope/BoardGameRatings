			<description>From the document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new background was specifically created to accommodate...&amp;quot;pop-in players&amp;quot;. These are players that might only have time to come to a single game session or perhaps are just irregular players due to schedule conflicts. I designed this [background] so that there is some reasonable rationale as to why a PC might pop in and out of a larger campaign overall. It can be used in any setting and allows for flexibility to be used with any class as well as gives the opportunity for the DM to weave their own creativity into the main story line they happen to be running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unusual character background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
