							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le projet du siècle: Jeu sur la construction des ouvrages du Complexe La Grande de la Baie James</name>
									
			<description>[Adapted and translated from the French-language rules]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of the energy potential around James Bay is without a doubt the greatest technological adventure in Quebec's history. To transform this vast network of lakes, rivers and forests into an enormous hydro-electricity complex is a great challenge. Le Projet du si&amp;egrave;cle invits you to think on this challenge and to experience all the steps of constructing a hydro-electricity complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le Projet du si&amp;egrave;cle spans a diverse territory: camps, dozens of construction sites, giant dams, levees and other building works. For this game, we used actual technical drawings from the LG2 dam, encompassing the power station, the 2.8 km dam and over 30 levees, for a total of 46 million square kilometers of building works. Other illustrations refer to other parts of the La Grande Complexe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to be the first to construct a hydro-electricity complex. Each their turn, players will develop their own construction techniques. It is important to read the rules book for each step of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two main phases, each with their own track on the board. First is the Organization phase, where players acquires Exploration, Project, Financing and Worker cards to begin a Construction site. In the Construction phase, players will build dams, levees and their power station. Opportunities to act will be determined by the places on the board a player rolls and moves to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
