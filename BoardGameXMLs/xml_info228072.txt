							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Labyrinth, Howls in the Dark</name>
									
			<description>The young boys and girls from Athens are thrown into the Labyrinth, where a horde of Minotaurs dwells, much like the legend of Theseus.&lt;br/&gt; The players are divided into two teams, the Athenians and the Minoans. The Athenians are trying to help the young boys and girls from Athens to escape, while the Minoans are helping the Minotaurs keep the young ones inside the labyrinth and wipe them out.&lt;br/&gt; Every round a player from each team is nominated as team-leader and he makes a plan with 5 actions using the cards in his hand, along with those his team-mates gave him. The players draw cards from a common deck. The cards can help or hurt both teams depending on the correct timing of the actions. Revealing and executing the actions alternately comes next. Good planning, clever use of both the actions and the Heroes&amp;rsquo; abilities will determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suspense is the main feeling of the game since every step towards victory depends on the players abilities to plan, predict and deceit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
