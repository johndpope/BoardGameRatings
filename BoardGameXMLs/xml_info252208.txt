							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legacy of the White Dragon</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Silverwell lies at the foot of a mountain range in the icy north. Through most of its history it has enjoyed relative peace, save for its battles with the harsh elements. Recently however, a group of villagers were attacked by bandits while hunting in nearby Rothir&amp;rsquo;s Pass. The bandits left behind a grim message warning for none to follow. Frightened by the possibility of a larger attack on the village, the headman will happily reward any brave adventurers that can help. Unknown to the inhabitants of the remote village of Silverwell, this new terror pales in comparison to the troubles that have already begun to flood down from the distant Mount Neboria &amp;ndash; troubles stemming from the dark wish of a dying dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an introductory adventure for a group of four or five 1st level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
