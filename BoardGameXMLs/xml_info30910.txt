			<description>Don't know much about this game as my Polish is quite awful.&lt;br/&gt;(Perhaps one of the polish BGG members can help out here).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway Top-Gun is a game about Jet Air-Combat between NATO/Warsaw Pact Fighters. Game contains a sheet of counters that have to be cut out, a map with squares (instead of hexes) and several data sheets about specific aircraft. Also included are about 10 small pages of rules and 3 dice. Overall the game doesn't look too complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
