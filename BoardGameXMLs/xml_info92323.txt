			<description>Titled Rayman: Revolution (Rayman 2: Revolution in North America), this PS2 version of Rayman 2 was released a year after The Great Escape. It features some enhancements including new levels, some level revisions, a few new music tracks, three new bosses, lum redistribution, and an enhanced cameo from the first Rayman game's mosquito mini-boss. The Hall of Doors is replaced by a central hub in which to walk freely and discover the game. Also, this is the only version in which the 1,000th yellow lum can be obtained normally, as opposed to being a super-secret hidden lum in the Tomb of the Ancients. Instead, the player obtains the 1,000th lum the minute they get the Lums Radar, a PS2 exclusive gadget that helps the player find any missed yellow lums.&lt;br/&gt;A major upgrade for this version was that most 2-dimensional objects featured in The Great Escape were replaced with 3D models. The real speech also returns, but it is optional in this version, so the player can choose between the gibberish present in most versions of the game (Raymanian) or the real languages. However, the frame rate is also far lower than the smooth 60 frames per second rate of the Sega Dreamcast version. Also, whenever the player revisits levels, the music in most of them is replaced with ambience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rayman 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
