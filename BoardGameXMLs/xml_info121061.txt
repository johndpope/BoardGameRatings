			<description>GM: The blade bites into your side and you can immediately feel something&amp;rsquo;s wrong. Give me a Fort save.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: (Rolls dice) OK, 23. That has to save.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Your moment of weakness passes and you pull the trap out of your side. As you continue down the hall you start to feel weak again. Roll another Fort save.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: What, that&amp;rsquo;s insane; I already saved from the poison. Let me see that book (grabs for the game master&amp;rsquo;s book pile).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poison - it is an essential ingredient to dungeon traps, not to mention the stock and trade of assassins and some of the more nefarious races. But more often than not its use in a game can lead to confusion and arguments as players fight over how poison works and the game master has to constantly stop and look up the effect of a specific seldom-used poison. Well, have no fear - your friends at Healing Fireball Publications are here to help with our latest product, Combat Cards: Poisons. In this set of cards you will find both the traditional Combat Cards-style cards that explain the various rules involved in the use of poison. But this set contains so much more: one card for each of the poisons listed in the SRD. As an added bonus to this set we also provide 4 blank poison cards to add your own poisons to the set and 4 quick inventory cards for poison users to keep track of their poison stocks. So, as always, never stop to search through a book again - with Combat Cards the rules are at your fingertips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Publisher Blurb]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
