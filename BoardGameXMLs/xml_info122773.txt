							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The X-Files: Resist or Serve</name>
									
			<description>The X-Files: Resist or Serve is based on the television series The X-Files using the Resident Evil video game engine. This is the second game based on the series, after The X-Files Game. It was also supposed to be released for the Xbox console, but that version was cancelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended as three new episodes set during the show's 7th season, the game follows FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (voiced by David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (voiced by Gillian Anderson) as they travel to a small town in the Rocky Mountains to dig into the source of some strange and unexplained murders. Sightings of ghostly apparitions, zombies and hints of alien presence lead them on a chase for an &amp;quot;inhuman&amp;quot; killer. During the course of the story, Mulder and Scully follow leads to a remote location in Russia and then discover, and search, a mysterious half-buried alien space ship. Players can play as Mulder or Scully as they attempt to prevent alien colonization of Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features Mark Snow's theme music from The X-Files series, as well as voice acting by the show's actors. Additionally, bonuses with the game include &amp;quot;behind the scenes&amp;quot; footage (featuring several of the male actors recording their lines while wearing bright red lipstick, a common practice used to get better enunciation and crisper sound) and commentaries from the series. The game follows The X-Files series' established canon, including the themes of alien colonization and the &amp;quot;black oil&amp;quot; (also known as the Black Cancer). Players also investigate various sets from the series, including the FBI office, Mulder's apartment building, and the Russian camp where Mulder and Alex Krycek were subjected to the black oil. Many of the major and minor characters from the show make appearances, including Skinner, Kersh, The Lone Gunmen, Krycek, Marita Covarrubias and the Cigarette Smoking Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The X-Files: Resist or Serve&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
