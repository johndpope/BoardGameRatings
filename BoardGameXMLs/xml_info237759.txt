			<description>I remember a story my father told me when I was a boy, before the annihilation of my clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was once a man who had dishonored his family, and he swore to the Gods that he would go into the forest and slay the most ferocious beast he could find to bring them honor again. So the man did as he said, braving claw and fang to fell the largest, most feral thing he had ever laid eyes on. But, after he had completed his task, the man got lost in the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fearing the Gods were still angry, he slew beast after breast, each larger and more ferocious than the last, but nothing seemed to please the Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the man forgot that he was a man at all and became a beast himself, lost in the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten Thunders Box Set, containing one 32mm 'heroic' scale miniature made of high quality plastic. Will require some preparation and assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lone Swordsman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stat Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lone Swordsman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
