							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">20 Questions: American Folklore</name>
									
			<description>This is an educational card game.  The stated goal from the publisher is that it is designed to &amp;quot;increase general knowledge and to aid students in becoming 'culturally literate'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is American Folklore.  The game consists of a question tablet and 50 over-sized clue cards, each card representing a different American Folklore character (e.g. Daniel Boone, Paul Bunyan, Wyatt Earp and Rip Van Winkle).  Note that some characters are also historical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each card is listed 20 questions about that character.  Players take turns picking a number, which is tracked via the question tablet, and guessing based on the corresponding clue, until the character is guessed.  One point is scored per character guessed correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include variant team scoring rules and ruels that confer bonuses based on how many unused clues remain.  The game is also ideal for family game nights, road trips (even for adults!), etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
