							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boy Scouts&#039; Progress Game</name>
									
			<description>This is an old track game that depicts the players rise through the Boy Scouts. Players start at different board locations on the outer circle track. Dice are rolled, and ALL players simultaneously move the amount indicated. If you land on a space containing an Honor Check (merit badge), you take it and place it in front of you. These all have different values depending on which Honor they are. For example, a Tenderfoot Badge is worth 3 points, while an Eagle Scout Badge is worth 20 points. When a player reaches the center space on the board, the game ends and the player who's honor badges add up to the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
