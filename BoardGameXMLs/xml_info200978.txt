							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World War Cthulhu: Cold War</name>
									
			<description>[Publisher Blurb]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War Cthulhu: Cold War is a Call of Cthulhu setting full of thrilling espionage, tense horror and sudden betrayal set at the height of the Cold War in the 1970s. The tangled webs of the spymasters tear and rejoin, double and triple agents make their moves and counter-moves, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to be sure which side you&amp;rsquo;re really working for. Nuclear destruction hangs over everyone, and a few people at the heart of western intelligence continue their personal battle against the insidious influence of a much older enemy&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Western intelligence is possessed. Very few have heard of Section 46, and even fewer actually believe it exists, a loose cabal of agents drawn from across the western powers&amp;rsquo; intelligence and military apparatus. Agents who have had a brush with something unworldly, alien and evil. Agents like you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You work for the shadowy spymaster N against the insidious influence of the Mythos, but the enigmatic H also haunts the dreams of many agents. Active players in the Cold War, you need to maintain the confidence of your &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo; agency amid an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion. At any one time you might be engaged in multiple missions for multiple agencies, but not really clear as to where any of them have come from. Which mission objectives are valid and which must be kept deniable? Which are right, which are wrong? And can you really tell the difference?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are forced to deal with forces the human mind cannot comprehend &amp;ndash; the balance of power, the threat of nuclear war, and the ever-present danger posed by the Mythos. You don&amp;rsquo;t know who to trust any more &amp;ndash; least of all yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
