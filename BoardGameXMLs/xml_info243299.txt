			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Taste of Something Strange!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, you just want to add a little bit of strange to your game. Perhaps you were inspired by a recent television sensation&amp;rsquo;s second season, or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of extradimensional horror and a live fast attitude. Either way, this book presents the tools to bring a little bit of strangeness to your game. Included are two monsters, the otherworldly hound (CR 5), and the otherworldly walker (CR 10), which each have a number of exciting and unique abilities that bring to life the abilities of the monsters from the Netflix series Stranger Things. The book also includes the zoomer, a new base class that specializes in high-speed combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
