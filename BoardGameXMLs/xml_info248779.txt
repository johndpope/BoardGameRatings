			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Starfinder Roleplaying Game is an expansive set of rules, which detail everything from prosthetics to interstellar warfare, to subtle intrigue to magic. However, with as much as this comprehensive rulebook covers, it&amp;rsquo;s easy for even simple things to get lost, complicated, or split between a half-dozen chapters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resting and recovering is one of those things - one of the most used rules in the game is touched on in nearly every chapter in the book... yet never covered in detail anywhere. This essay collects and clarifies all the rules related to resting, from the basics of recovering stamina points, hit points and resolve points, to the more complicated side of resting, like interruptions and sleep deprivation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article collects and explains all the rules for resting in the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, and yes, that's all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
