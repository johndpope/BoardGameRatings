			<description>User review: Football-themed rummy variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt six cards. In turn, each player repleshes one's hand to six and draws an extra card, then plays a card or discards a card. Some cards allow a player to force an opponent to miss turns or forfeit cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to assemble a complete set of cards of one color along with a touchdown card and a field goal card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
