			<description>Game based on Popeye the sailor. In this game Popeye is searching for a treasure, but Brutus will do anything in his power to stop him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use a spinner to move along paths of connected spaces, aiming to reach treasure islands in order to collect correspondingly coloured chests. A player who has collected a chest of every colour may head for their home space, but landing on a Brutus space means the loss of a chest, and rolling the exact number of spaces is required to return home as well as when collecting the chests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
