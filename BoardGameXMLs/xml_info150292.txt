			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solitaire card game based on the concept of rhythmic video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has a band of five dancers from a selection of 11, numbered 1&amp;ndash;5. The dancers are put in a line, where each dancer is either in the front row or back row. From a shuffled deck of notes also numbered 1&amp;ndash;5, five cards are lined up. Each turn, the cards of the lest represented colour will &amp;quot;fall down&amp;quot; (are slid down a bit) and must be &amp;quot;caught&amp;quot; by the team of dancers. However, in order to achieve a &amp;quot;perfect rhythm&amp;quot;, a note must be caught by a dancer with the same number, if caught by a dancer with a number at most 1 more or less than the note is &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; if the note and the dancer are of the same colour; anything else is a &amp;quot;fail&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Before each catch, the player can only move one dancer one step, either from back row to front row, or sideways, in which case they swap places with whoever was beside them. However, moving sideways to a spot where no dancer is is not counted as a move, and will also cause the dancer who now ends up in the same column as the moved one, to move in the opposite direction, a so-called &amp;quot;cross move&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being in the back row gives the dancer one extra turn to catch the note. Also, apart from the current row of falling notes, the player will have another row of notes above it, enabling the player to plan his moves one turn ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final score is decided by the number of perfects and good rhythm catches. Also, before each game, the player chooses which song to dance to; each song having a special effect on the game. Each dancer also has a special power to activate once per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
