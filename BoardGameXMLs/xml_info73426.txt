							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bomb!</name>
									
			<description>Bomb! is a board game designed by a primary 4 student, Tan Zhiyong, from Rosyth School in Singapore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appears to be similar to snakes and ladders, each player has a single pawn that moves up a boustrophedon track, and there are ladders that pawns can climb up and bombs which send pawns back to the start.  There are also a few squares with instructions like &amp;quot;miss a turn&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Move forward 3 spaces&amp;quot;. All other squares that do not have a bomb or instructions on them have a fraction. Whenever a player lands on a fraction, they add it to their own cumulative score. The aim of the game is not to be the first to reach the last square, but to have the highest total sum of fractions among all players once everyone has reached the last square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is copyright of Government of Singapore and the graphic design is copyright of Noble Education.com (indicated on the board)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not come in a box, but in a large transparent sleeve which holds the laminated cardboard board and bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
