			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to go out drinking and to come home &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot;. Each drink carries a certain number of points, and the winner of the game is the first player to get home to bed with a hundred point or more, i.e. happy. But there is more to the game than simply stopping at a pub (bar) and drinking. A player must have a drink in at least 8 different bars to win. He must also consider the activities of the other drinkers, who may hiner his progress by throwing up, bumping into him, or even drinking bars dry....&lt;br/&gt;A special rule in the game is that you get less and less movement point the more and more drinking points you get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
