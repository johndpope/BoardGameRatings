							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neon 2.5</name>
									
			<description>Neon 2.5 is a bit of a spin off from the regular neon platform, this time you are in charge of the neon base and must shoot off the hordes of enemies and protecting your base from enemy fire.&lt;br/&gt;This is a fast paced shooter game shooting your way through from wave to wave, there are no life power ups so you must preserve your base power to get as far through the waves as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;In this game you steer a triangle (spaceship?) by moving your mouse. Shooting is strictly limited to where you move. Object enter your screen and collision is deadly. Several are homing in on your position, meaning you both want to fly away from then and  want to point your nose to them to shoot. Split second choices. The game resembles the old arcade classics, but with smoother (though abstract) graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
