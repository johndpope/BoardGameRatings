			<description>Sue You! was invented by a law student in the fall of 1991. He was intrigued -- and troubled -- by society's apparent fascination with lawsuits, and set out to create a game that would capture the essence of that fascination . . . The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player by successfully suing other players. The game ends when one of the players runs out of money. The player with the most money at that time is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
