			<description>If you have the time, money, imagination and skill... who knows what sort of ships you'll build or commission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb: &amp;quot;Space travel and starships are a huge part of the Babylon 5 universe, and almost every chronicle will no doubt run into the use of one in some way. Roleplaying evolution states that eventually the players will get tired of seeing 'the same old thing' over and over, looking for those ships that never saw screen-time. When those grow old, then inevitably players and Games Masters alike will soon look into creating vessels of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;That is what this book is for - to help you create your very own Babylon 5 starships. From simply ripping the weapons off an old hulk to totally funding the design and creation of unique hulls, Babylon 5 players can use the information in this text to build it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There is a host of information contained in this book concerning the design, building, altering and retrofitting vessels of all shapes, sizes and varieties. Using the rules found here players can go about adding bigger engines and external cameras to their commercial freighters, or maybe finding room for that rare antimatter torpedo launcher!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
