							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Abandoned Temple and Catacombs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There in the middle of the forest it still laid, overgrown and broken, but you could feel the evil that once had happened inside those walls. It was like it had taken over the air, made it sticky and hard to breathe&amp;hellip;..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a map of an abandoned temple and its catacombs below. Catacombs that has a secrete hideout for whatever kind of demonic sect you prefer. The map is made to work with my free map of the village Farjvad. It will give you the perfect setting if your players decide to investigate what secretes the old temple in that village hides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or you can just use the map in whatever adventure or setting you prefer. It is all up to you now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map package consists of two maps, one of the temple over ground and one of the catacombs below. Both maps comes in various versions, both coloured and black and white. The over ground map comes in ten different versions and the black and white in six versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
