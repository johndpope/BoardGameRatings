							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of the Entourage</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't Leave Home Without Them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the holder of a manor, each vassal knight in King Arthur Pendragon heads a a small feudal society that revolves entirely around him. This is the knight&amp;rsquo;s household. He doesn't have equal time to do everything or see everyone, and so his household does many tasks for him. His personal social sphere forms layers around him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Always at the center is the knight. Nearest to him are his key supporters: his squire, probably a wife, and perhaps one other closest advisor. The knight's retinue is next. The retinue is divided between the famuli, which assists the knight at home and manages the manor when the knight is away, and the entourage, which leaves the manor when the lord travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book of the Entourage features information about the squire and wife at the center of the knight's entourage, including both a Random Squire Table and a Random Wife Table. Dozens of professionals and servants available for hire are also detailed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady characters are not overlooked. There is a Random Husband Table and information about maid-in-waiting and professionals more suited to the Lady's needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book of the Entourage is the perfect sourcebook for the player who wishes to fully detail and realize the accoutrements of nobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
