							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sisiutl</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remarkable Races is going beneath the waves in a new series called &amp;quot;Remarkable Races Submerged.&amp;quot; These new racial supplements will add an aquatic flair to our beloved Remarkable Races line, transforming many of your favorite races for use with the Cerulean Seas Campaign Setting, as well as introducing a few new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two heads are better than one for the Cerulean Seas Campaign Setting! The Sisiutl is bound to be the talk of the table as it offers the first-ever aquatic two-headed player option without adding an extra character sheet. Have a friend that you work well with? Want to play two PCs but the Gamemaster doesn't want to deal with an extra mini on the table or two-sets of statistics? Or maybe you are a Game Master and you want to add an NPC that a particular player can't get rid of! Sisiutl are strong, smart, and super freaky. Masterfully put together in Alluria style with all original art by our newest artist, the fantastic and talented Mary Dearden!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book expands on the material presented in the Cerulean Seas Campaign Setting, bringing you a new PC race for aquatic adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
