			<description>Made by LDS (Latter Day Saints) Game Factory in Placerville, CA. I don't have the instructions, but it looks as though players go around the board -- and off into little side trips like Talents, Leisure, Career, Church. Family and Education -- to gather Blessings but to avoid Trespasses. According to the score sheets, you tally each, plus add the number of side trips made to the Blessing column and it looks like the highest Blessing score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge cards get you Blessings or Trespasses. Free Agency cards quote verses from LDS scripture. Corner spaces are significant: Go on a Mission or to the Tree of Life; these are the good squares. The bad ones are Temptation and Sin City. It looks like Sin City is like Monopoly's Jail square. You must roll to get out and the longer it takes, the more Trespasses you get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
