							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Random Encounters: Rabid Monkey Troop</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rabid Monkey Troop is a fully detailed random encounter designed for a typical group of 5th-7th level adventurers. While traveling through the wilderness, the heroes are attacked by a mob of rabid monkeys who use group tactics to overwhelm the heroes. Faced with more monkeys than they can hope to kill, many which are foaming at the mouth, a great deal will depend on the players being able to stay calm when things start to look grim. This encounter includes d20 statistics for four types of advanced monkeys, many of which are infected with rabies. It also features detailed rules for the rabies virus and includes some suggestions for possible peaceful resolutions to the encounter. Like all supplements in this series, this PDF includes information on. the background and terrain modifiers of the encounter, the monster's tactics, and possible ways for the heroes to gain bonus experience points from this encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
