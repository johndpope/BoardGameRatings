							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Little Big Game of Word Maven</name>
									
			<description>The Little Big Game of Word Maven consists of 6 letter dice, a dice cup, paper money and a sand timer. One die is a vowel die, with a e i o u and an 8-ball on the faces. Five dice have a mix of consonants, vowels and wild sides.  Players roll the vowel die to determine who goes first. Each player receives starting money from the bank and a Jackpot Fund is started. &lt;br/&gt;On their turn each player rolls all 6 dice. The goal is to make the longest word possible with the letters on the face of the dice. The player may roll up to 3 times per turn, but must keep at least one die per roll. The first roll is free; money must be paid to the Jackpot Fund for each extra roll. If the 8-ball face is rolled the player's turn is immediately over. Each turn must be finished before the timer runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is based on the length of the word the player makes. Longer words pay more money. The Jackpot is won when a player makes a 6 letter word without using any wild sides. The winner is the player who has the most money at the end of a predetermined time, or the player who reaches a predetermined amount of money first. Additionally, each die has an orange letter on one face that spells the word &amp;ldquo;MAVENS&amp;rdquo;. Spelling MAVENS instantly wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
