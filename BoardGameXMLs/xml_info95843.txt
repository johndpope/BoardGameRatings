			<description>This great new &amp;quot;fill-in-the-blank&amp;quot; trivia game will keep everybody guessing. Anybody can win because no trivia knowledge is necessary to score points. Players write down answers to questions they think are true or what they think other players will think are true. The &amp;quot;card reader&amp;quot; then reads all the answers aloud, including the correct answer. Players must guess which answer is correct or which they think most players believe to be correct. You can score points with both right and wrong answers. So, if you can bluff your friends and accumulate the most points, you'll be the big winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     a box of Trivia Question Cards, &lt;br/&gt;     a Score Pad, &lt;br/&gt;     An Answer Pad, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
