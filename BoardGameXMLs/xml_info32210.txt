			<description>The Pepys card game with the legendary magic monocle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 39 cards; 4 master agents, 5 secret agents, 5 secret plans, 5 inns, 5 trains, 5 planes, 5 cars and 5 M.T.B cards (and the monocle, of course...).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is collect six cards:1 secret agent, 1 secret plan, an inn and 3 of the same kind of transport.&lt;br/&gt;This is done by pick-up-and-discard.&lt;br/&gt;In order to win none of these cards may have a secret message written on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has collected the complete set he can call for help of the Master Agent (MA), thus using the magic monocle to reveal if any of his cards has a secret message written on it: He spreads them out and checks the colour coded strips at the base of his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is none, he wins, if there is - play commences, now knowing which cards to discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with nearly all Pepys games outstanding graphic design, the Monocle a really nice gimmick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
