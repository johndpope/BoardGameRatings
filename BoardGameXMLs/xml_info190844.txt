			<description>Radar Command is a 90-120 minute strategy board game. Start by building your own fleet, choosing from ships, islands, a radar base, air fields and etc... Once your fleet has been picked place your pieces on your map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once your pieces are in play it's time to search and destroy your opponent. May the best admiral win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By using special interrupter cards you can add reinforcements, repair damage or retreat from a particularly intense battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Radar Command's unique playing boards you can write directly on the playing board and easily erase for the next game. Have fun each game by choosing different ships and bases and by varying your game board set-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
