							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Smack it!</name>
									
			<description>A combination of War and Slapjack. Players place cards on the table, then duke it our War-style when a challenge card comes up, or try to slap the pile when a Smack It card comes up. Whoever has the highest card for a challenge, or is the first to slap the pile on a Smack It, gets the pile. Players who run out of cards are out of the game. As a twist, eliminated players may slap card piles to remove cards from play completely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
