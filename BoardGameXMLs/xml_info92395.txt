			<description>The Granstream Saga (グランストリーム伝記 Guransutorīmu Denki) is an action role-playing game for the PlayStation. The game was developed by a team consisting of staff from the developer Quintet under the name Shade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Granstream Saga is lauded as one of the first fully-polygonal RPGs, as opposed to using pre-rendered backgrounds. The game features anime-style cutscenes by Production I.G. It is also somewhat unique in that the characters the player meets in the game are faceless. The game's plot is based on the manga series Kros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to release, it was highly anticipated, but sales were ultimately disappointing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Granstream Saga,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
