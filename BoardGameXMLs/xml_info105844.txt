			<description>In the Sci-Fi themed Wolfteam, players log in to become superhuman werewolves, joining a clan and transforming into formidable beasts for speed, agility, the ability to scale sheer walls, among other enhanced biological features based on species. In human form, players have an array of high-powered weapons and elaborate maps at their disposal, where they fight for survival to increase rank and unlock new content. Strategy becomes crucial as players use the advantages granted in both forms to gain advantage in their battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
