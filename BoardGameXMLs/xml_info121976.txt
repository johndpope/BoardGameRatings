			<description>Choose from two modes of play and climb stacked cubes to reach higher floors, but don&amp;rsquo;t get crushed along the way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sky is literally falling, in the form of cubes, in the action-oriented Art Style: precipice. Watch for the telltale shadow to avoid seeing your character be crushed by a falling cube while climbing the stacked cubes to ascend to the floors above. Push, pull, or shove cubes to make your climb easier and try to gain extra points by stepping on five cubes in a row on the same floor. In addition, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter special cubes that can either be helpful or harmful to your effort. Choose from either TEN FLOORS mode, which challenges you to reach the tenth floor while scoring as many points as possible, or TOWER mode, which gives you the chance to climb as high as you can. Do you have what it takes to make it to the top or will you be crushed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
