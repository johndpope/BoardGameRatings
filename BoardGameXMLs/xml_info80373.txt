			<description>From the Game's Introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People have always looked to the stars for guidance. Astrology is one of the oldest methods of fortune telling, and the stars were named to help sailors and travelers easily find their way at night. The signs are linked to birth, forever marking those born under them with certain aspects and emotions. The stars of the horoscope provide many ways of helping mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what of those times when mankind, or any creature, needs more than simple guidance? What of those times when the world is threatened? How will the stars help when the very world is in danger?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stars provide...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There always seems to be a leader when the world needs it most. Generals that lead wars to defeat a great enemy, men and women who fight injustice with the simple means of passive resistance, and everyday people who deal with extraordinary circumstance regardless of whether they may live or die. These people are great in their own ways, but sometimes the world needs a little help from the stars themselves. That's when a Horoscope appears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This person, be they man or woman, human or alien, appears at a time when the world is in crisis. They can tap into the very stars themselves, using the elements and aspects of the zodiac to help avert disaster. However, they have a limited lifespan. With each zodiac called upon, the Horoscope spirit leaves their body. In essence, they may use their powers twelve times before they pass into nothingness. A Horoscope is a powerful being, but they of limited life and they know this fact. Yet even with this knowledge, they continue on, trying to save the world from the evils that ravage it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
