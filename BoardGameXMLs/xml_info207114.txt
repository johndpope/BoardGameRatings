							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Story of Creation</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the days before Time was discovered by Locke, the god of mischief and luck, and evil was unleashed onto the logic of all living things by Draegor, the gods languished in the great Celestial court of the heavens. There were a great many gods then, hundreds of them, and each was different, with myriad lesser gods serving beneath them, those lesser gods in command of even lesser deities, all with their own personalities and tasks to perform. There were no years, months or days, no god aged or died, but many were born into the Celestial land, brought into being by new ideas and discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
