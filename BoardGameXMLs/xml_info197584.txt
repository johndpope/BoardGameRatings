			<description>From author description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facing Away is a freeform RPG/storytelling game for 2 to 6 players. Submitted for the 2016 200 Word RPG Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if you were to have the conversations you've always wanted to have with people that, for one reason or another, were no longer in your life? Facing Away brings to life situations where characters might find themselves on the back end of a friendship that has ended, or the death of a loved one, or even a split due to fortuitous circumstances. The concepts of distance and time are executed by removing the ability to see the other players through a Game Space mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facing Away utilizes no table, no GM, no pens and/or paper, and only one d12. Players will arrange chairs in a circle, then turn the chairs to face outward from the center, or inward towards the center, depending on the round. The action starts with a round of monologues, with each subsequent player taking on the character of someone referred to by a previous player in the round. Rounds 2 and 3 allows the players to develop scenes, and a word-count epilogue brings closure to the session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect for one-shots, or even lighter, shorter RPG sessions, Facing Away is a great game on its own, and can even be used as a tool for gamers to help develop characters and character relationships. Active listening and responding is the backbone of the game, since players cannot see each other for certain parts of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
