							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizards and Rogues of the Realms</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Waterdeep to Thay, from the great Galcier to Calimshan, wizards and rogues dress, think, and behave in ways that tell the learned observer just where they hail from. Sometimes the differences are obvious - anyone can distinguish a seafaring mage from a turban-crowned spellcaster, or a thief of Lantan from a burglar of Amn. But often, appearance gives no clue: even wizards and rogues of the Dalelands vary from Dale to Dale, though one may look the same as another.Faerunians are fiercely proud of their heritage, and they carry their native traits with them wherever they go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages are dozens of kits designed to help players in a Forgotten Realms campaign discover their characters' roots and reflect them in role-playing. Special benefits and disadvantages related to each particular home town or territory allow players to create unique kits that can be applied to mages, specialist wizards, and rogues, and they can even be layered over other kits. As a bonus, two new player character subclasses have been included: the intriguing spellsinger and the stealthy shadow walker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
