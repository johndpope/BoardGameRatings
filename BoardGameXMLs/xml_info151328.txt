			<description>From publisher description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Co-operative Deck-Building!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jedrzej lived to fight, and that meant death for those he fought. After years building a reputation as a combatant to be feared, there was little left that could stand against him. When at last he returned to his home, he found his tribe annihilated and its customs forgotten. In his zeal for the thrill of battle, he had lost sight of its cost. He resolved to keep his axes at his side unless he found a good enough reason to heft them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Options&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jedrzej the Hurler is a new Hero deck, fully compatible with the base game. He brings a little of everything to the table - multiple attacks, strong attacks, ranged attacks, Wound removal and Wound denial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
