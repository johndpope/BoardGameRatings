							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dark Times (Vol 1, Issue 1 - Jun 2000)</name>
									
			<description>From the intro to the first issue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first issue of The Dark Times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In March of 2000, Wizards of the Coast announced that it would no longer produce new gaming material for the Alternity Role Playing Game and its campaign worlds after the end of the year. Many game masters and players were upset by the news, while other knew that if Alternity was to live that it would be because of their hard work and dedication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subsequently, call for E-zines (online magazines) and Netbooks (compendiums of similar-topic information compiled online and made available for download) surfaced on the Dark Matter mailing list. I saw a chance to gather together a group of individuals capable of producing a magazine dedicated to providing Dark Matter enthusiants with everything from new equipment, campaign ideas and FX to fan fiction and ready-made selections of support cast members. The driving goal of the magazine: to produce material useable in a Dark Matter, or similar campaign setting, of quality equal to or superior than that of the &amp;quot;professionals&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the creation of The Dark Times' first issue, major changes occurred including the structure of the magazine and the core staff, but one thing remained the same: an end product designed to supplement your Dark Matter campaign. On behalf of The Dark Times staff, enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
