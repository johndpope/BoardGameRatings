							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Era Digest: Golden Century</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BIRTH OF A NEW SOCIETY&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clans, brainchild of Nicholas Kerensky, emerged from the ashes of the decimated Star League Defense Force to create a new order in distant lands. Ritualizing combat, they established a new society where only the strongest warriors rule and justice is won through battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironically, it would be the death of the Clans&amp;rsquo; founder that would catalyze this new society and spur a period of amazing technological and social growth known as the Golden Century. This was the age where Kerensky&amp;rsquo;s warriors and their descendants truly forged themselves into the powerful army that would one day return to the Inner Sphere in a righteous Crusade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Era Digest: Golden Century is a mini-sourcebook that describes the development of the Clans at their origin in a new series format, giving players a glimpse of early Clan life, the basics of Clan rituals, and a look at the rise and fall of Clan Mongoose. Complete with rules and stats for several Golden Century units&amp;mdash;including the first OmniMechs&amp;mdash;Era Digest: Golden Century also features role-playing support for this crucial period in BattleTech history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
