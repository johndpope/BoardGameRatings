							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tomb of Lady Gasping</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tomb of Lady Gasping is designed to be an extremely difficult and testing challenge for even the most experienced players. Unless the party work together as a team, it is unlikely that they will survive the ordeal. Challenges will be met that they may never have had to deal with, so lateral thinking and an imaginative approach is required. It is suggested that the party comprise at least six characters of 9th-12th level, with a good mix of character classes and at least three strong fighter-types (ideally a combined total of 60 levels of experience).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is a challenging one. It is advised that the Dungeon Master take time to read through the adventure before running it in order to become familiar with the setting and the encounters that the party will face. The Dungeon Master may want to adjust the numbers of monsters prior to starting the adventure to suit the size and strength of the adventuring party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tomb of Lady Gasping adventure is set within its own campaign world. The main settlement in the region is the city of Wrak, situated on the eastern coast at the mouth of the River Zab. The Tomb lies in the cold wastes of Harune to the north of Wrak, in an old tin mining region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is up to you whether you use the adventure setting, or whether you substitute the place names in the adventure with those of your own world. For example, Wrak city, from which the adventurers start, could be any large city in your own campaign world, while the northern wastes could be any cold and barren region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
