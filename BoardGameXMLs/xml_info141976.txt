							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walk the Plank! Ghost Meeple Mini-Expansion</name>
									
			<description>By very popular demand Mayday is making this really silly and totally unauthorized (by the designer) expansion available. The ghost meeple will be awarded to the first pirate who is fully eliminated from the game. (All 3 pirates are out.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This player will continue to push/shove and generally cause mayhem with his ghost pirate, haunting the rest of the crew. He can't do physical things like cut or extend the plank, but can push and shove, but can't be pushed or shoved himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
