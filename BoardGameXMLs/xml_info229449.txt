							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reboot Hacked</name>
									
			<description>A dice game based on the Computer Animated TV series Reboot. Can be played solo or multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a round, each player gets one turn. Each player&amp;rsquo;s turn represents a single episode. During his turn a player will roll dice against a number of tables and gain (or lose) assets. Each Asset has a power level and/or modifies the power levels of &lt;br/&gt;other assets. Pencil and paper are used to keep track of roll results, power calculations, and Victory Points (VP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has 6 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.   Location Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Roll 1D20 on the Location Table to determine the key location for the current episode. Take actions as described on the card &amp;ndash; this may involving rolling on another table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.   Threat Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Roll 1D6 on the Primary Threat Table to determine what is the major threat for the current episode.  Dependant on threat type (Game Cube, Virus or Web) roll on respective threat tables and resolve (which may involve rolling against other tables)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.   Hero Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Roll 4 times on the Guardian Hero Table. You may then reroll any or all of these rolls once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.    Ally Phase&lt;br/&gt;-      Roll once on the Ally Table. You may then reroll this roll once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.    Key Phase&lt;br/&gt; -     Roll once on the Key Tool Table. You may then reroll this roll once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.   Score Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Guardian Power = Combined Power of all Heroes, Allies, and Key Assets. &lt;br/&gt;-     Threat Power = Combined power of all Game, Viral, and Web Assets. &lt;br/&gt;-     If the Threat Power is greater than the Guardian Power, the Guardians fail and you score no points. If the Guardian Power is greater, score Victory Points equal to the Threat Power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of 6 rounds. &lt;br/&gt;If playing solo, players should attempt to beat their previous score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
