							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cabela&#039;s Big Game Hunter 2012</name>
									
			<description>The game takes place in nine different locations Montana, Mexico, Uruguay, Russia, South Africa, Australia, Texas, Namibia and Alaska. Each location features three different primary days with five different hunts available from the start of the region. In Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 animals can see, hear and smell you. The game features a big variety of environments available including lush forests, dry deserts, craggy mountains, flooded plains, scorching savannas and the freezing tundra. The game also features multiple scenarios where &amp;quot;decisions&amp;quot; will have to be made. Each region features a variety of animals each specific to the environments in which can be hunted throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game incorporates many new elements not found in previous main series games, such as having shooting blinds, shooting rests and tree stands, a caller, and other things to aid the player. But other new things are implemented in this game to work against the player. Animals now have an improved and more realistic AI, meaning they could see, smell, or hear you if you make a wrong move. Similar to Dangerous Hunts, predators can randomly surprise the player by jumping out of a bush or off a cliff, and time is slowed down so the player can shoot before it kills you. Getting to your target is now more challenging with the implementation of stealth hunts and timed hunts. Stealth hunts are when the males are not within reach and the player must use stealth and cover (usually thick bushes, logs, and rock formations)to avoid does, noisy terrain, and other animals like birds. The player is also given a device called a UTD that measures your presence to the animals. A low-pitched beep means that the animals can't detect you, while high-pitched beeps tells the player that animals have spotted the player and they will run away. A timed hunt is activated either when you reach your target, a predator or another force could disturb the animals and the player must kill it in a certain amount of time; or when the animals appear as a large herd and the player must kill a certain amount of males before time runs out. Many birds and small mammals roam around for the player to shoot at their leisure. Sometimes the player can reach a hidden area, where they have an opportunity to photograph rare animals and natural behaviors. There's also a gun store where players can buy, customize, and upgrade their weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features multiplayer where players can create either an area found in campaign mode, or customize their own. Players can create custom animals, which they can hunt with friends. Players can set challenges to compete in hunting the rarest animals and like Campaign mode, players can also buy and customize their weapons for each type of situation (a typical weapon is usually a variation of a scoped hunting rifle). There are multiple shooting galleries like arcade, where you can kill as many animals as want, or reflex which tests your hunting skills by instructing the player to kill certain animals in a chronological order. The game is planned to be released packaged with the Top Shot Elite, a plastic peripheral for the Wii controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
