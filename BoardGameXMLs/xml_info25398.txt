			<description>This game is one of the winners of the 2006 Boulogne-Billancourt International Designer Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Panama, players are mission leaders that strive to complete the first canal joining the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Three projects are under study: one in Panama itself, another one in Mexico and one in Nicaragua.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, the players must not only dig the canals, but they must also hire experts, emit lotteries to fund their mission, buy shares in the different projects, and invest wisely in the six resources required when building a canal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
