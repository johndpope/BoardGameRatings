			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witching Hours and The Secret of the Blue Tower are two exciting introductory adventures for players new to The Dark Eye and the world of Aventuria. Both adventures have been playtested at German conventions for years, and now they help bring The Dark Eye to the American gaming table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Secret of the Blue Tower, the heroes come into possession of a mysterious map, stolen recently from a temple of Hesinde. The map leads them to the town of Honeyngton, or rather to the strange tunnels and caverns beneath it, all stemming from the blue tower once owned by the magician Vasilos. Now abandoned, the heroes explore catacombs beneath the city in search of a repository of ancient knowledge accumulated by the wily magician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Witching Hours, the heroes are drawn to the village of Millington, where for some months various hauntings have descended upon the villagers, driving them away from their homes. Some locals have vanished mysteriously, and those who remain are in a panic. What has caused these strange events, and can they be stopped? The heroes must investigate in this adventure of greed and deception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
