			<description>This self published cycling game by Anki Toner from Barcelona contains 4 teams of 4 cyclists, each player controlling a team. Each player also has 4 dice to determine movement. The game board (A2 size) is a 40 field long, 4 line wide oval track. The fields are in 4 different colors. Each cyclist also has a base under it's pawn (in the shape of a cyclist). The shapes are also in 4 different colors, matching the colors on the fields. Two different sets of rules are available so far. The basic rules are made by Anki Toner who also designed this game, the more advanced rules were made by Ludo Nauws from Belgium, in this variant the game is turned into an elimination race on which the last rider on each lap is eliminated. The game can also be downloaded on the internet for free and is license-free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second version, Pistard 2.0, was made available in February 2009.
