			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Optasia are defined first by Attributes (Strength, Intelligence, Resistance, Agility, Aura, Communication, Art, Speed) which have scores determined by distributing Development Points during character creation and, later, advancement.  Characters have a variety of secondary characteristics - some are selected (Species), some are derived (Life Points).  Characters gain experience and levels to improve.  Most non-combat actions are controlled by Abilities (Skills) which use a percentile system of resolution.  The extant game is fairly genre agnostic but combat heavy (hit locations; armor body zone modifications, etc.), and the assumption is that combat will involve armor, shields, and primarily hand-held weapons such as polearms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
