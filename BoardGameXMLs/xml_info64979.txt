			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Intrigue, trade and war in the Dune universe.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dune's universe, between the advent of Muad'Dib. Political, economic and military struggle between the Noble Houses of the Imperium. Meddle in politics during the Landsraad Council, influencing the Padishah Emperor. Acquire wealth, speculating on Semuta Drug and Pundi Rice prices in the CHOAM. Plan hostile actions against rivals, under the limitations of the Great Convention.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is conducted on 3 boards: on the LANDSRAAD board you can plan political actions; on the CHOAM board you can trade resources for SOLARI (the Imperium currency); on the KANLY board you can plan assassinations, sabotage actions, or even full-scale wars.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tokens represent commodities (SPICE MELANGE, HAGAL QUARTZ, etc.), or SOLARI (the Imperium currency). Also, there are tokens to represent three NOBLES for each Noble House, and for their soldiers (TROOPERS, SABOTEURS and ASSASSINS). Also there are tokens to represent the special ADVISORS (Mentat or Bene Gesserit) which you could be provided if you met the Emperor's favour.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cards represent useful situations which could help you during your quest for power. The most powerful ones are you cannot obtain by chance: they are PETITIONS to the Padishah Emperor which he has graciously agreed to concede (or, sometimes, not to concede). Less powerful situations are just acts of FATE.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each player will represent a Noble House and will be given three NOBLE tokens: he will use those tokens to attempt actions in each turn. Actions could be political (LANDSRAAD board), trade (CHOAM board) or hostile (KANLY board): to represent that a player is attempting an action, he will put one of his NOBLE in the appropriate slot on the appropriate board. The number of action a player could do in a turn will be therefore generally limited by the NOBLE tokens he has, even if it will be possible to increase it by mean of ADVISORS.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each turn is divided in three phases: LANDSRAAD, CHOAM and KANLY; each to be played on the appropriate board.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When a player will draw the End Game Fate Card, he will immediately show it, and the game will end. The Noble house with the most SOLARI will win the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
