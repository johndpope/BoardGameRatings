			<description>A fun game which enhances memory and logic skills. Knowing that goats eat cabbages, that wolves eat goats and that all of them fear dogs, how will you cross a river with wolves, goats, dogs and cabbages without losing too many of them? Rules are simple, the goal is to earn as many points as possible by saving &amp;quot;passengers&amp;quot; (animals or vegetables).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins the game with a hand of 4 cards taken from his own Passenger deck. Each turn, the active player reveals the top card from a common Placement deck, perform the appropriate action by playing a card from her hand, then discards it. She may also optionally play an Action card from her hand if she has any left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passenger cards are cards picturing animals (Wolf, Goat or Shepperd dog) or vegetables (Cannage), while Action cards have an effect on all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must fill boats with 3 passengers before they leave for the Island where the passangers will disenbark. Players must keep in mind that when disembarking, Goats will eat Cabbages and Wolves will eat Goats, unless there's a Shepperd dog in the boat to check on everyone. Players get points for all Passengers getting safely to the Isaland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a players plays the last Passenger card from his hand, which triggers the last turn. Players add-up all their points and the one with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
