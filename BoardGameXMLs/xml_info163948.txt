			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Introductory Adventure of Steam, Intrigue, and Mechanically Improved Monsters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the workbench, the man picked up a handful of small gears, and while pondering, he juggled them about as though they were pocket change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do &amp;hellip; what to do &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He studied the wolf, with its pneumatic pistons and yellowed fangs.  The pistons made the beast far stronger and faster, but it still could not catch swift prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thought suddenly buzzed in his head.  He gazed at the beast and smiled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was always room for improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After proving themselves reliable muckers in part 1, the player characters become potential tools used in the power jockeying between two rival corporations.  In this adventure, the PCs will be hired by an anonymous corporate representative to carry out a job designed to potentially ruin the reputation of a rival company.  However, the PCs will discover a far darker secret than their employer had anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
