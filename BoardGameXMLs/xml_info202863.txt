			<description>This is a card game in which players become members of a nomadic family, performing tasks necessary for the family's livelihood. If they work together, the whole family prospers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is assigned either 1 (4-6 players) or 2 (2-3 players) family members to carry out daily tasks and generate happiness. Players are each also assigned one secret family member (which may belong to an opponent) whose happiness is added to their own total at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Task cards are drawn randomly and then played one at a time to a common area. Each task rewards an amount of happiness to specific family members when assigned a family member token as a worker, but the most rewarding tasks must have prerequisite cards finished before they can be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happiness is measured in chips designed as full moons, half moons, and crescent moons. The player with the most full moon happiness chips at the end is the winner, with the remaining chips acting as tiebreakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
