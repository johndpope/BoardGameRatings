			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Hunter&amp;rsquo;s Guild is dangerous. Each has lived a life of tracking, pursuing, and killing beasts far more feral and dangerous than you have ever seen. They bring a different set o&amp;rsquo; skills to the game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Greyscales, Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Guild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bestial captain with untamed power, Theron strikes with the frenzy of a cornered beast. Tempered by the hardships of war, his primal wrath pushes him to endure and survive. He lives for the thrill of the hunt. Every chase into dense forest leads his prey to face their brutal end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theron&amp;rsquo;s Hunters are a rabid pack. Only when their opponent is most vulnerable will they pounce. Using traps and thick forests, they control the flow of the game by herding opponents directly into danger for brutal take-outs. Patient coaches looking for a fast pack of players to ensnare their prey will enjoy the fury of these Hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swift predators prowling the pitch, this set includes a ball, trap, 6 player cards, bases, and 6 players: Theron, Egret, Zarola, Jaecar, Hearne, Fahad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
