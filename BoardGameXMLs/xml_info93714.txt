			<description>Frame-Up! is a card game dating from the 1950s for two to four players which uses the principle of 'three-in-a-row', but on a larger scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game, each player has a 3x3 'frame' board on which they lay yellow, blue or red cards depicting 'O' or 'X', and points are scored points for making rows of three.  Red cards are worth the most points.  Some of the cards have black corner markings which alter the points value.  When all cards are laid, the boards are scored, with points available for each horizontal, vertical and diagonal line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules supplied for an advanced version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
