							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hoyle Card Games</name>
									
			<description>The package includes eight competitive card games, such as cribbage and go fish, as well as six variations of solitaire. Competitive games are played against the game's artificial intelligence (AI), or against another player. Two players can use two separate Game Boy Color consoles and connect them with a link cable, or use a single machine and alternate their turns. The AI can prove a challenging opponent since the game lacks any difficulty settings. Each game's rules are explained within a menu. Each player must pick an avatar to represent them before they can begin, such as a crocodile or a teddy bear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hoyle Card Games&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
