							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Potions with a Unique Flavor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the chest you find a bag of 100 gold coins, a small onyx statue and three healing potions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potions - an essential supply to most adventurers and a common treasure for game masters to award. But all too often they are just handed out as if they are mundane treasure like coins or jewelry. But as some of the most common magical loot in fantasy games they should be viewed with more interest as other magic items are. But how does a game master instill this interest back into potions? Well, your friends here at Healing Fireball Publications have the answer with our latest product Two Bit Tables: Potions with a Unique Flavor. This collection of tables allows a game master to generate unique looks for his potions as well as unique bottles to store them in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
