							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Wondrous Items Volume I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve picked out your mythic path, chosen your path abilities, learned a few mythic spells, and given yourself a mythic feat or two, but there&amp;rsquo;s one key aspect of character customization that you&amp;rsquo;re missing: magic items. Adventurers are only as good as the tools that they use, and why should mythic characters have to settle for the same every-day magic items that lesser mortals use?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents mythic versions of twenty six iconic wondrous items. These superior versions of well-known favorites are bigger, flashier, and more powerful, with expanded abilities suitable for a mythic campaign. Even further, each of them has a special ability that interacts in some specific way with mythic power, allowing mythic characters to make the most of their abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
