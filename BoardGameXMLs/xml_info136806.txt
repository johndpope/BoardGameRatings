			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to her legendary aim and her unparalleled agility, Kira was one of the first people to become an Aria of Wissenschaft. Her love of money and volatile nature keep her volunteering for mission after mission. This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral Wissenschaft Prowler &amp;mdash; Lv. 40&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oo &amp;mdash; Impure Shot (Subterfuge, Ranged Attack)&lt;br/&gt; Distance (4 inches). After this attack is resolved, Kira may move up to 8 inches, even if she has already moved this turn.&lt;br/&gt; ooo &amp;mdash; Buster Shot (Subterfuge, Ranged Attack)&lt;br/&gt; Distance (8 inches). +2 Attack / +3 Damage. After this attack is resolved Kira moves 4 inches directly away from her target (this can't cause collisions), even if she has already moved this turn.&lt;br/&gt; oo+ &amp;mdash; Buckshot (Subterfuge, Ranged Attack)&lt;br/&gt; Distance (8 inches). Kira may spend any number of additional AP when paying for this attack. For each additional AP spent in this way she makes an additional attack against the same target.&lt;br/&gt; ooo &amp;mdash; Valkyrie (Subterfuge, Dodge, Ranged Attack)&lt;br/&gt; Distance (4 inches).
