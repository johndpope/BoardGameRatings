							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legend of Alon D&#039;ar</name>
									
			<description>The game plays somewhat like the Final Fantasy series' Active Time Battle, with the player having to wait certain time for their turn. What makes this system different from ATB is that the time that has to pass changes with the weapon the player is wielding, for example an axe will need more time than a dagger to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a vast world to explore; with several towns and monsters to combat with. The game also features multiplayer experience after advancing in the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several types of spells like Water, Earth, Sound etc. that are stored in Orbs. This Orbs can be leveled up to unlock more spells or make the unlocked ones more powerful. As with weapons, certain Orbs take much longer to cast the spell than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Legend of Alon D'ar&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
