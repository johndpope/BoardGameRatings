							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bartender</name>
									
			<description>Bartender is a card game in which players compete to make the most money by mixing fancy drinks. The fancier the drink, the more money it is worth. &lt;br/&gt;In Bartender, the table represents the bar, the deck of cards represents the store-room full of ingredients, and the cards in the players hands represent the ingredients the players are carrying from the store-room to the bar. &lt;br/&gt;Players must 'stock' the bar with the cards from their hand so that they can mix fancy drinks but unless they are careful, the other players can use those cards to mix their own drinks.&lt;br/&gt;Bartender was designed as a bartender training aid. &lt;br/&gt;After a few plays, players will start to memorize the formulas for the over 50 real drinks depicted in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
