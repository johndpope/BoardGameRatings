			<description>Let's Rodeo is a game for people to enjoy the sport of rodeo anyplace, anytime.  This game is designed to show how one rodeos, starting from the amateur right up to the pro circuit and through to the finals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and move around the game board, which consists of two circuits, amateur and pro. All players start by moving around the amateur circuit. Players enter rodeos by landing on a rodeo square and paying the entry fee. A card is then drawn which gives the player's result in the rodeo and money is awarded. Each rodeo can be entered multiple times.  There are places on the board where players must pay money and some where broke players can earn money. Filling a &amp;quot;permit&amp;quot; (earning a set amount of money) is necessary to move into the pro circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once in the pro circuit each player must enter and place in each of the 8 pro rodeos.  Each rodeo can only be entered once. Once any player has completed all 8 pro rodeos the finals begin.  Any players still on the amateur circuit are eliminated. All players on the pro circuit roll dice to find out their standings in the final events.  Winnings in the finals are added to money earned in the pro circuit and the winner is the player with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
