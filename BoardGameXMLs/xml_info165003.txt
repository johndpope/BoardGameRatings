			<description>In Recruiters, two players compete to recruit the best group of candidates for the armed forces of their nation Uber Superb. Players need to spend their recruiting power wisely, balancing their efforts for each of the four service branches: Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force. It&amp;rsquo;s an advantage to recruit the most people, and it&amp;rsquo;s an advantage to recruit the best people. But that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning, since allocating your recruits to hotspots around the globe is even more important, and... there are two ways to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the standard game, there are two decks: one with all the Recruiting Power cards plus two Special cards, and the other with all the Recruit cards. Each player gets a hand of Recruiting Power cards, which are used to sway (i.e., buy) recruits which are constantly coming and going throughout the peak recruiting season. After this first part of the game, 2 VPs are awarded to the player with the most recruits. Then, four further and crucial competitions between the players will take place, and the player who best allocates his/her recruits to the aforementioned hotspots will earn the most VPs and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;friendly&amp;quot; version of the game is a lighter, press your luck design, with unfortunate results for a too-greedy player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
