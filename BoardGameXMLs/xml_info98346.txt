			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In deep space lies the alien sector Larkin. You are there on a mission to obtain energy sources that have been seized by the evil Larkins. Radar and a superior guidance system help you avoid attacking fighters and Kamikaze ships. The energy stars are near the Larkin command ship: you must retrieve them before you can leave the enemy sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An evil force, LARKIN, is attacking your base planet. In every sector you travel through, four bombs are dropped with a slew of fighters to ensure the bombs will reach your planet. Energy stars are floating above the planet for your strategic use. By flying through one, you are energized with an invincible energy shield to help you wipe out the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are different types of enemy fighters. Some of them fire missiles at you, others are kamikaze ships and will try to crash into you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radar is used to track in front of and behind your view. Enemy fighters are shown in white and bombs are shown in red. Your ships and the energy stars are shown in black. &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; on the control panel tells you how many enemy fighters you must destroy to complete a sector. &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; on the control panel tells you how many energy stars you have available to you. The number farthest to the right on the control panel tells you how many ships you have left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to reach the highest score by shooting down as many enemy fighters as possible and destroying bombs for bonus energy stars. Every 2 bombs destroyed in a sector gives you a bonus energy star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
