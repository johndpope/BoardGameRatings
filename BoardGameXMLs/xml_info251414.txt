			<description>This Grand Life is a financial life simulation game where you create a character, manage their money and help them achieve their life goals. Cruise your way through life with a silver spoon, or struggle endlessly to find employment as a convicted felon. You cannot control your past, but you can change your future. What choices will you make?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Sierra's 1990 game Jones In The Fast Lane, your life is divided into weeks. You try to accomplish as much as you can each week while economic conditions and special events create interesting choices to think about. Do I go to work this week, or take part in the Hot Dog Eating competition at the park? Should I spend time looking for a better job, or stick with my current job until economic conditions improve?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: [ The Game Website].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
