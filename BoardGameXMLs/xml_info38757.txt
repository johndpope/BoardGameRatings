			<description>From the back of the box: &amp;quot;A fun numbers game that can be played by all the family.  The object of the game is to score the most points by placing/matching the bugs in the best way.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to place tiles so that edges match, and they score points according to how many dots are on the relevant bugs.  An egg-timer is included to speed up play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
