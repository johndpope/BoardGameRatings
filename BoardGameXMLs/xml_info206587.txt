							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hand of the Pit</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction and &amp;quot;Set Up&amp;quot; sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snow falls from darkening skies in the village of Stenby. Winter is early this year, and the village&amp;rsquo;s stockpiles of food are gone along with several of its people&amp;mdash;stolen by the Ogre of Whelcrag and his raiders. They descended upon Stenby three days ago during the Harvest Festival, slaying and burning until they had claimed all they could carry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survivors could only watch in mute horror as the raiders retreated into the hills to the ogre&amp;rsquo;s lair: the cursed mine of Whelcrag. The raiders took the villagers&amp;rsquo; food stores with them, along with several villagers and Fenn Stonehand, a paladin visiting for the festival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pleas to the earl&amp;rsquo;s steward for aid have gone unanswered. The villagers will need help if they are to survive the winter. Someone must enter the forbidden mine, rescue the kidnapped villagers and steal back the village&amp;rsquo;s food. And then there is the matter of the trove of looted treasures the stories say the Ogre of Whelcrag keeps in his demon-haunted lair&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hand of the Pit is an adventure for 2nd level and higher Torchbearer characters, though 1st level characters are viable if played skillfully. It should take two to three sessions of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
