			<description>Top That is a bluffing card game in which players try to outthink their opponents and gain the least number of cards possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning each player is dealt a hand of six cards. The cards features numbers from 1 to 6 and wild cards. Starting players choose any number of cards from her hand and passes them to the next player clockwise. She then declare the true number of cards and the numbers on them (which can be a lie). The numbers that are on the cards need to be the same in declaration, but in reality they can vary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The receiving player has to options:&lt;br/&gt;1. Receive the cards, take them to her hand and make a new suggestion to the next player. The new suggestion has to be better. Either the number of the cards has to be greater or it can be the same if the numbers on the cards will be higher (or both).&lt;br/&gt;2. Challange, in this case the cards are revealed and if the giver declared the true then the receiver takes the cards and puts them in his own pile of negative points (1 card = 1 point). If the giver lied, then she must take these cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anytime a player has less than 6 cards in a hand, she draws to 6 from the pile in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until first challange when the deck is depleted. The player who has the least amount of negative points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
