							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Truth Behind Rings of Power</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Desk of Bayando the Brainy&lt;br/&gt;On This Day, 6 Years Since the Breaking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WITH THE LACK of proper information available to my colleagues across (what is left of) Anhelm, I am often the first sought out for the trustworthy answers to their burning questions. Wizards know that I possess much knowledge of things arcane and mundane. I have a reputation in this regard. When other wizards spent their summer breaks riding on dragons made of lightning or wooing the island girls of Lacya with their fiery magickal displays of manhood, I was reading, absorbing, and digesting the fabulous collection of books at the Magickal Mysterium Center for Intelligent Spellcasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, even now, to think of it... how I miss it. What a treasure we have lost to the ravages of vile heathens and unbridled magickal power. Imagine if that vast repertoire of knowledge was available today! Such wisdom, such vision, such meticulously catalogued greatness - surely, we wizards would not be in the mess we are in now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
