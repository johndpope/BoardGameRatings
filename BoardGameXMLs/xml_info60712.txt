			<description>From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single scene holiday themed mission for agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grandfather Frost, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle, Santa Claus: legends all, or more accurately myth. Everyone knows Santa isn&amp;rsquo;t real everyone that is, but the children, in whose dreams he makes the rounds each year, bringing happiness and presents to all the nice boys and girls. They leave out cookies and milk, sherry and mince pies, and carrots for his reindeer, in hopes that he&amp;rsquo;ll  remember their good deeds, and sometimes forget the bad. They write letters and wish lists, and visit him in shopping malls everywhere. Their parents indulge them, letting them dream as long as they can, because that&amp;rsquo;s the magic of childhood: dreams without limit, faith without question. At some point, though, everyone grows up and leaves Santa behind. They abandon their fancy and Christmas&lt;br/&gt;becomes merely special, rather than magical. Little do they know that&amp;rsquo;s just as Santa prefers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Christmas, one lucky group of agents learns the truth  and has the chance to save Christmas for everyone. Maybe, just maybe, they&amp;rsquo;ll also remember what it&amp;rsquo;s like to dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
