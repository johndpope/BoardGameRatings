In three separate incidents, squads of the Ogburg Pale Patrol have disappeared with no trace.  Investigations have revealed almost nothing.  The squads all had one thing in common - they were comprised of young, new recruits who were patrolling the countryside to the northeast of the city.  The Church Militant wants you to pose as novice volunteers, hoping that you can get to the bottom of this where they have failed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter Three of Germinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for character levels 1 - 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 31-page PDF scenario was distributed with a 5-page PDF of player handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
