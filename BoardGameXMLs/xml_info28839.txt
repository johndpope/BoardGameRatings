			<description>Dolls is a hostage negotiation game using little pipe-cleaner people called dolls.  At the beginning of the game each player has the five dolls distributed to his opponents.  Each player also receives a number of strategy cards that let him launch rescue attempts, foils other's attempts at rescues, move dolls from one player to another, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must negotiate for the release of their dolls.  If talks break down, a player can execute dolls that he has possession of.  Coming up with innovative methods of execution is also part of the game (Chopping up a pipe cleaner man and sending him back one piece at a time, lighting a doll on fire, running over a doll with your care are only a few possibilities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
