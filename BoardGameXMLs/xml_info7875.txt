			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone is a driver working for YELLOW BIRD TAXI COMPANY. Each driver takes a shift driving the Taxi, doing your best for the company and leaving the Taxi in good shape for the next driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to deliver as many of the 15 customers as you can to their destinations and earn as much money as you can.  The game ends in one of two ways. All the customers get delivered or your taxi gets hauled off the road with too many Demerit Points against it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's lots to do before the night is over besides just delivering fares to their destinations. Events are happening all over the city while there are speeding tickets to deal with, grabbing that necessary cup of coffee when you get tired, getting through traffic jams, past construction sites, watching out for thieves, keeping an eye on the gas gauge, fixing failing brakes. It will be a night to remember, no matter what happens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
