			<description>Game components include many wooden dice shaped pieces called &amp;quot;tivots&amp;quot; with differing numbers on each face.  Tivots are moved on the plastic playing board to gain ground and complete equations.  The game is scalable from basic addition to algebra with different templates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From product description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TIVY is a math board game invented by an Oklahoman. The game is designed to teach strategy and sportsmanship in addition to fundamental mathematics. Each board comes with &amp;quot;tivots&amp;quot; (the game pieces), score sheets, a rule book, and a variety of gamesheets for use from grades three through nine. During game play, players move their tivots, which are numbered, across the board and land in score goals. Each score goal is paired with a math problem that is missing a number. When a player lands a tivot in a score goal, they create a completed math problem by replacing the missing numbers with the number on their tivot. Phases of the game include strategy time, game play time (when the tivots are moved), calculate score time (when players solve the math problems they created), check opponent time (during which players check opponents' work), challenge time (when any disputes are settled), and agree time (when players agree on their final scores).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
