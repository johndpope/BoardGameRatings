							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quasi</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its play time with Quasi!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try to avoid getting your character mangled by this hunch backed humanoid. It means no harm. It just has to squeeze its beloved pet so tight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quasi, written by James Butler, is so named after the literary character of Quasimodo. The difference here is that this powerful, childishly curious and moody freak has none of the nobility, empathy or wisdom of the hunchback of Notre-Dame. It instead spends its life making traps, harvesting foodstuffs, and obsessing over a pet or object. Woe to any excavator who becomes the focus of its all-consuming attention, as the Quasi is likely to manhandle, toy with and eventually shatter the person, abandoning the broken pet in some filthy hole or ancient room before turning its attention to whatever takes its fancy next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This, our 8th Free Creature of the Apocalypse, comes in a 5 page PDF with a list of Quasi mutations as well as sampling of random pets and items the humanoid currently obsesses over. Also included is a full page, text free image of cover art for use as a player handout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although crafted for The Mutant Epoch role-playing game, using the Outland System Game Mechanic, a GM can easily modify the stats for the Quasi and use the beast with another post-apocalyptic game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
