			<description>You are a prospector in the Old West just trying to get by doing the only thing you know and that&amp;rsquo;s digging for Gold.  Your goal of riches is only hindered by what you may find in the mountain itself.  Each prospector will take turns digging deeper into the mountain looking for gold nuggets.  When the mountain is emptied of all its available treasures, the prospector with the most Gold nuggets WINS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses a unique 2 tile set system.  The &amp;quot;Mountain&amp;quot; is built by randomly setting up 64 of the 72 possible tiles in an 8 by 8 grid.  The other set of 72 &amp;quot;Shaft&amp;quot; tiles are shuffled and set up in stacks for draw piles.  As the players dig, the &amp;quot;Mountain&amp;quot; tiles are collected and replaced with the &amp;quot;Shaft&amp;quot; tiles. This allows for more players to be added without extending the game time substantially.  And makes each game vary with the number of possible Rocks, Gold and Dirt tiles placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
