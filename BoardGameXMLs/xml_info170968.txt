			<description>This is somewhat similar to a Werewolf game, with the setting of Danganronpa series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are largely divided into two teams, Hope Side and Despair Side, by their assigned Role Cards. Each player also has a unique Character card and starts with two Item cards, both of which can be used to change the flow of the gamw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a total of 126 cards in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;35 of them are Character Cards featuring characters from both Dangan Ronpa and Dangan Ronpa 2, there are also 7 types of Role Cards (19 cards total), &lt;br/&gt;1. Alter Ego (Hope): Select 1 person each night, and you will be told if the person is Hope Side or Despair Side. Reveal your Role Card when you are killed. You win if the Blackened dies. (1 card)&lt;br/&gt;2. White (Hope): Similar to villager, no special characteristics. You win if the Blackened dies. (10 cards)&lt;br/&gt;3. Despair Disease Patient (Hope): Appears to others as being on Despair Side despite being on Hope Side. (1 card)&lt;br/&gt;4. Monomi (Hope): Select 1 player to guard each night. If the Blackened targets the same player, you die in an explosion and they live on (effect similar to &amp;quot;Knight&amp;quot; role). You appear to be on Despair Side despite being on Hope Side. You win if the Blackened dies. (1 card)&lt;br/&gt;5. Traitor (Despair): Can see who the Blackened (and other Traitors) are on the first night but the Blackened doesn't know who they are. They win if the Blackened wins. (1 card)&lt;br/&gt;6. Blackened (Despair): Select 1 player each night to attack (like a Werewolf). Reveal your role card when you are killed. You win if you commit a set number of murders and then survive until the next night. (1 card)&lt;br/&gt;7. Ultimate Despair (Despair?): Appears to be on Hope Side until somebody dies and appears to be on Despair Side thereafter. This role has a solo victory objective to be punished during the Class Trial. (1 card)&lt;br/&gt;19 types of item cards (49 total), 2 target cards (for use by black to indicate who to kill off) 16 Summary cards (explaining the game)&lt;br/&gt;3 blank character cards, 1 blank role card and 1 blank item card for your own creations.&lt;br/&gt;Inside would also contain a rule book explaining all the different modes and explanation of all the characters.&lt;br/&gt;There is also a template for you to record down your plays for the gamemasters usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
