							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Master Key</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master Key: He's Keeping an Eye on Evil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playboy and amateur astronomer Ray Cardell was watching the stars when a mysterious ray from outer space struck his telescope and burned into his eye. When he recovered, he had gained the ability to shoot rays from his eye that melted metal, burned flesh, let him see through solid objects, and let him bend others to his will. Now, as Master Key, he fights crime (even if it's putting a cramp on his dating life).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master Key collects for the first time in  single book, the five best stories featuring one of the many forgotten heroes from the Golden age of Comics. In addition to the comics, Master Key contains an all-new expansion to NUELOW Games's superpowers system for OGL d20 Modern--&amp;quot;Keeping an Eye on Evil.&amp;quot; Inspired in part by the comics, these rules are easily incorporated into existing d20 Modern games, and they are focused on vision-based powers, such as X-Ray Vision, Heat Vision, and more. The book also includes a simple modification to the character generation system that will result in more superhero-like characters from the moment they start play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
