			<description>An abstract game played on a 9x9 grid, in which players have to find their pieces and every player can move every piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a game board, 16 ear-shaped player's pieces, 12 joker cards and a standard six-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;On each side of the board there are four coloured spaces to which the ears have to be moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is assigned a colour and receives three joker cards. Players try to locate the ears in their colour (the colour markings are at the bottom, face-down side) and to move them onto the target spaces of the same colour. At the start of the game, the ears are randomly (and without knowing the colour) distributed on the starting spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the die. A die roll can be used to move one ear the corresponding number of spaces vertically or horizontally, or the roll can be split among several ears. If a player rolls a six, he/she has several options:&lt;br/&gt;- He/she can move ears as in a normal roll.&lt;br/&gt;- He/she can roll again and look at the colour markings of a number of ears corresponding to the die roll.&lt;br/&gt;- He/she can place an ear of which he/she knows it is his/her colour directly onto a target space.&lt;br/&gt;A player can decide not to move on his/her turn and use a joker card instead. The active player then rolls the die to determine how many ears he/she may inspect.&lt;br/&gt;When players have found out which ears are theirs, they try to move them to their target spaces as secretly as possible. When an ear has reached a target space, it is turned over and the colour is shown to all players. If it is the wrong colour, it goes to one of the target spaces of the player it belongs to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all of one player's ears have reached their target spaces. Each ear that has reached its target space is worth 5 points, each joker card that hasn't been used up is worth two points. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
