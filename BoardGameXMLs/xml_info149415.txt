			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A riddle wrapped in a mystery, locked in a box might be one way to describe this room. Except it barely scratches at the truth or even the plain visible facts. Said box with the mysterious riddle has been cast into a cube of lead after all, wrapped in rusty bands of iron and chained to four monolithic obelisks. These in turn are surrounded by magical warding circle. Another almost mundane circle of obelisks connected by a rusty but massive fence separate the circle of wards from the rest of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reach this curious assemble, lit by a score of dimly glowing coal braziers one even has to cross a fiery moat. And to get this far, past the massive wooden door barring entry to the room, one already has had to fight their way past scores of guardian beasts. One simply can't help but wonder what might warrant all these measures. Is the content of the lead cube really worth it all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
