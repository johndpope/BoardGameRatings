							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Indigo Magic (D20)</name>
									
			<description>In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indigo is the colour of the mind. It is a deeper shade of Blue; where blue looks externally in the universe for ways to make order and gain control, Indigo looks within, seeking first and foremost order and control of the mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those with mastery over Indigo magic can control others with a thought, bring oblivion upon their enemies and read into the deepest memories of their friends and enemies alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most powerful and feared of mind mages is the Skeptomancer, a mage with such mental power that they cease to require the normal accoutrements of magic, becoming able to manipulate the thoughts and minds of others by the sheer force of their will alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;- 3 new Clerical or Mystical domains &lt;br/&gt;- a linked reclassification of one twelfth of the spells of the players handbook, with some new spell effects to fit the spells into Chromatic Magic Theory &lt;br/&gt;- a whole new character class, the Skeptomancer. This spellcaster is a mind mage and user of Indigo magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
