							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Bug Hunt</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bug out with the highest score by counting as may insect cards as possible without turning over a bird card.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Bug Hunt: The Unbuglieveable Insect Counting Card Game! is a push-your-luck type card game.  Players take turns turning over cards one at a time from the draw pile of 46 bugs and 6 birds.  They score one point for each bug card turned over.  Tbey may choose to end their turn whenever they like.  However, they must avoid turning over one of the bird cards.  If they turn over a bird, it eats all their bugs and their turn ends with no points scored. If a player ends their turn before turning over a bird, they keep their points.  When all bird cards have been turned over, the entire deck is reshuffled.  First player to a predetermined number of points (40 for 2 to 4 players and 25 for 5+ players is suggested) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
