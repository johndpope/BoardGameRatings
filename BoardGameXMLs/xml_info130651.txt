			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elevator Pitch:&lt;br/&gt;It's a futuristic version of The Warriors with a dash of Smash T.V., Unreal Tournament and Necromunda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting &amp;amp; Flavor:&lt;br/&gt;This campaign takes place in humanity&amp;rsquo;s distant future on a prison world called Todesfeld. The year is approximately 2500 A.D. Everyone in this setting plays a member of a gang. The powers that be, in this case a fascist dictatorship calling itself the Hegemony, film and broadcast the battles between these gangs from orbit for the pleasure of the senescent masses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hegemony was formed during an event called &amp;quot;The Unification&amp;quot; when all the governments of Old Earth aligned under a single political banner and undertook the joint exploration and exploitation of space. The globe of Earth expanded until it became the Sphere, an invisible bubble encompassing every star system within 100 light years of Humanity&amp;rsquo;s cradle. With the accomplishment of this tremendous feat there were many who speculated that human civilization would move into an age of unending peace. After all, what couldn't the human race accomplish if it could yoke the stars? For the first couple of centuries, this lofty ambition even seemed plausible but, by degrees, as the seeds of the human race spread farther and farther from home, the hue and cry for independent government began to peal ever more loudly. The ruling council of the Hegemony, a cabal of well-moneyed and old blooded ministers called &amp;quot;The Eight&amp;quot;, could not tolerate dissent of this sort and hope to keep their unified government together. They curtailed political speech and began to institute stricter &amp;quot;civil conduct&amp;quot; laws enforced by the threat of capital punishment. Through it all, The Eight maintained a veneer of piety, dressing their policies in florid language that extolled the virtues of their &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All along the periphery of the Sphere, where the influence of Earth was weakest, citizens grew tired of the central government's policies. Independent brushfire rebellions sprouted up on a number of border worlds at once. Though they all had different leaders and different methods the common theme was being shouted loud and clear: people weren't going to stand for the sanctimonious lies of the Hegemony any more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first, Todesfeld was just another of these disenfranchised worlds, more or less a glorified asteroid with little to distinguish it from the other rocks that were being gleefully core-stripped by the Hegemony's Mining Conglomerates. True to type, Todesfeld was filthy with pollution and mostly lawless. Hegemony Stormtroopers kept an eye on things from orbit but pretty much let the Conglomerates run the world however they wanted (so long as their brutal ore quotas were met). Cities metastasized around the mining camps, fueled by corporation money and the vices of the overworked miners. When the mines started to dry up the corporation executives suddenly pulled out, abandoning their holdings and employees on the surface. All of the miners were fired on the spot. Those who lacked the credits to leave started in with the usual rioting and disobedience that follows this sort of thing. Normally, Stormtroopers would have been deployed to crack a few skulls and restore order at the point of a gun, but the Hegemony had other ideas in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some time the Directors of the Eight had realized that the military was being stretched too thin to maintain order on every intransigent planet in Sphere. They needed a different strategy, one that would make an example of the rioters on Todesfeld and serve notice to rebels everywhere else. A &amp;quot;Purge&amp;quot; was decreed: the forced exile of every criminal, political and otherwise, to Todesfeld. There the convicts would eat the rebels alive and then kill each other for territorial rights, solving all of the Hegemony's problems at once. The master stroke was this: to pay for the adventure, the Hegemony would televise the ensuing battles across their domain for the entertainment of their lawful subjects. It was an overnight success. Violence and political dissent in the peripheral worlds of the Sphere declined sharply. It seemed like round-the-clock blood sport was just the sort of diversion that the overworked and overtaxed minions of the Hegemony were looking for. To enhance the drama the Hegemony started offering cash prizes and the elusive promise of clemency for those 'contestants' who fought the best. Gangs began to want to go to Todesfeld to show how tough they were and to win what loot they could.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
