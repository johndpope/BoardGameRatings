							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Todd&#039;s Adventures in Slime World</name>
									
			<description>From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;SLIME ALERT!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Todd, a bold and nearly fearless galactic explorer. Whether you are by yourself, or part of a two to eight man crew, you like nothing better than planets full of weird and dangerous creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On an exploration mission in the Andromeda sector, you dis- cover a mysterious drifting starship. You board the deserted ship, and retrieve part of the captains log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The log describes Slime World, a planet teeming with slime gooey &lt;br/&gt;disgusting life forms. You only have the first section of each dates entry, so the information is maddeningly incomplete. But when you reach the first reference to valuable slime gems, you immediately order the android copilot to set in a course for Slime World!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you arrive you discover that Murphy's Law works overtime on &lt;br/&gt;Slime World. Whatever can go wrong does go wrong. In many adventures a new and exciting monkey wrench is thrown into the gears. And every misadventure is populated with Maggots, Drools, and other revolting creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one adventure you discover that there is only one escape capsule and it's a one seater. Unfortunately there are more crewmembers than there are seats. Will you get to it first, or will you be stranded forever with nothing but slimeballs for neighbors?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slip and slide your way through six complex solo adventures and, if you are Comlynxed, six challenging multi-player adventures. Try not to get slimed, and keep those aliens from getting stuck to your face!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
