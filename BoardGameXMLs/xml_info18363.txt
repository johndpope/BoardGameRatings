							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keep On Truckin&#039; America</name>
									
			<description>Players complete trips across the united states as truckers. The game includes an oversized gameboard, money, various types of special cards (Dispatch Cards, Smokey Sez! Cards, Bonus Cards, Truck Scales Cards, Keep On Truckin' Cafe Cards, and Time Cards), and small plastic trucks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins by rolling for a dispatch card. Then players roll the die and move along their assigned route (from the dispatch card). Many spaces require that a user draw a card and follow the directions. Once a player finishes five trips he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is an attempt to present a realistic trucking experience. For instance (quote from the rules): &amp;quot;If a trucker cannot pay a debt or loses all of his money, he is bankrupt. Going bankrupt is one of the realities of trucking. The player cannot borrow money. He cannot continue to play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
