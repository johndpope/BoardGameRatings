							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Villa of Mysteries</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We first crossed a fancy gate that marked the entrance to the estate. Tall, spear-like trees&amp;mdash;cypresses, I was informed&amp;mdash;created a natural fence around the vast property and stood as soldiers flanking the path that led up to the villa proper. As we got closer, pairs of statues of creatures I&amp;rsquo;d only heard of in the myths of the invaders replaced the cypresses: centaur, pegasus, medusa, and the god they called Bacchus in a central and prominent spot right in front of the entrance to the house. A dark-haired, olive-skinned woman, Mirella Valerianus, unmistakably the mistress of the estate, awaited our carriage with a veritable army of servants. [...] Early the next morning we were escorted to our carriages by the lady Mirella, who extended personal, private invitations to the Ard Righ and myself to return at any moment to the villa, whether on an official function or not. As we pulled away, and I turned back to see the olive-skinned beauty waving us farewell, I thought I may just have to take her up on her offer.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; From the journal of Amergin &amp;Oacute; M&amp;iacute;l&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bardic Lore: The Villa of Mysteries details an Imperial-style villa for your d20 Fantasy game.
