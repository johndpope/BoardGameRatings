							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guild Ball: Union Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Union play style is one of role specialism and individual play. They have an array of strong options across attack. Their defensive game isn&amp;rsquo;t as strong due to their focus on assassin or surgical removal style play. You need a game plan; set them up to deliver it and you will win. Think of these like a team of precision scalpels - just don&amp;rsquo;t try chopping down trees with them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their strength and flexibility comes from matching the right players to do the job you need before proceeding. Each model is simply strong at what it does, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require assistance to do it. This is a team with little to no buffing. Want a big tanky guy taken down, send in Decimate &amp;hellip; Want their backfield defensive midfielder to stop playing out buffs everywhere, Snakeskin will deliver &amp;hellip; Just want someone messed up, Gutter&amp;rsquo;s the girl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one knows where Blackheart came from and no one knows how he accumulated so much power in such a short time period. What they do know is that The Union is a major player and here to stay. On any given day it is impossible to predict the style of play you will be up against. The Union has both the power and the skill to pound you into the ground or dance around you like leaves on the wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variety is the spice of a Union coach's life. Able to call upon the services of a wide range of degenerates, thugs, assassins and ballplayers, you must weigh up the options and make the right choices. The mysterious and deadly Blackheart can often be found in the company of his psychotic, fanatically loyal first mate, Gutter, and frequently employs the deadly blades and footballing talent of the mercurial Decimate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
