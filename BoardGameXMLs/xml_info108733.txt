			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;True20 is an adventure roleplaying game in which you, the players, take on the roles of fictional heroes having adventures in an imagined environment. One player, the Narrator, takes on the job of creating that environment and the stories for the other players to take part in.&lt;br/&gt;Together, you create your own tales of action and adventure, like your favorite novels, movies, or video games.&lt;br/&gt;The best part about adventure roleplaying is you are in control of the action! Literally anything you can imagine is possible, because you and your fellow players control the story.&lt;br/&gt;You may have played other roleplaying games, or this may be your&lt;br/&gt;introduction to new worlds of adventure. Either way, welcome to True20 and new worlds of adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
