							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Better Lairs and Dungeons</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you tired of one-off encounters with roadside bandits that serve as nothing more than an excuse to roll dice and collect some XP? Do you have trouble managing the power-gamer or the rules-lawyer in your group? Have you ever wished you could build a modular dungeon without spending a fortune on craft supplies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better Lairs and Dungeons is a guidebook for GMs of every system and every edition. Sourcebooks will give you the rules of how to GM, but few of them give good advice on how to do it well. Inside this book you'll find tips on how to write campaigns, build worlds, handle problem players, spice up typical scenarios, and adjudicate the material in your game. You'll also find information on general hobby gaming, with detailed idiot-proof instructions from making an awesome dungeon out of cardboard to a crash course in miniature painting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
