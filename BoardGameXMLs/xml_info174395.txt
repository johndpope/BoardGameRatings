							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">String Thing</name>
									
			<description>String Thing is a pen-and-paper dexterity game. Players draw maps with a start point and an end point, and goals and obstacles in between. Then they take a long string with a bead tied to one end, drop the bead at the start point of a map, and slowly lower the string, attempting to draw a line with it from start to end while connecting the goals and avoiding the obstacles. Crossing (or capturing) a goal gives points, while touching an obstacle subtracts points. If a player runs out of string before they reach the end point, they score zero for that map. After playing through several maps, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
