			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Gamemaster, you will always have that moment when the players do something for which you haven't planned. Consult Appendix Z! - and randomly generate an installation under siege by ravaging aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set comes complete with FREE Hive Aliens paper miniatures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below the waist&amp;hellip; all human resemblance left off. The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply. Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the hips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs&amp;hellip; terminated in ridged-veined pads that were neither hooves nor claws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenishyellow ichor which&amp;hellip; left a curious discoloration behind it.&lt;br/&gt;The Dunwich Horror, H P Lovecraft (1929)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those moments when your players have taken the inevitable path away from whatever you have planned, the Consult Appendix Z series provides the ideal tool for conjuring up a quick random solution to get you through to the end of the session or your next flash of inspiration. In 20 locked-and-loaded pages, the Another Bug Hunt supplement provides myriad options for the random creation of horrific biological weapons and insatiable xenoforms. Distant colonies and remote waystations fall silent as something writhes out of the darkness and consumes the flame of humanity. You can either roll randomly with a 6-sided die or flick to a random page and choose a numbered section, then inflict the content on your appreciative players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consult Appendix Z - #2: Another Bug Hunt is a system-free supplement and you can easily adapt it to your favourite game system or campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
