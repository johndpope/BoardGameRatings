			<description>The three catastrophes a child can encounter: Pa watches sports on TV. The TV is broken. Being grounded, TV ban!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled, and placed in 2 tiles beneath the board (TV cards, TV jokers, broadcast interruption and TV ban, TV allowed). The game has 2-4 players moving on a board by roll of a die. Landing on a yellow TV space means the player must draw a TV card. This means a TV card - a player must collect 4 of the same kind - or a TV joker which completes a 3-card-set. Or if unlucky a broadcast interruption card. With this card still on his hand a player cannot win. Players landing on a blue TV ban spot must draw a TV ban card. This tells the player why the punishment by grounding occurred and usually instructs the player to give one TV card (of his/her choosing) to the next player. This is usually bad, of course it could be good if the broadcast interruption card can be offloaded onto someone else. A TV allowed card lets a player draw additional TV cards.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to either collect a set of 4 matching TV cards or reach the end of the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
