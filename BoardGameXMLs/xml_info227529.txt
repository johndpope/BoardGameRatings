							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</name>
									
			<description>The game 20,000 Leagues under the Sea by Jaymar games is based on Walt Disney&amp;rsquo;s first sci-fi film of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by spinning the Nautilus (Captain Nemo&amp;rsquo;s Machine) to indicate the moving of their pieces.  The spinner contains R&amp;rsquo;s and L&amp;rsquo;s for Right and Left moves.  In front of each letter is a number specifying the amount in which to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rows of the board signify depth and are marked with a few special spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on &amp;lsquo;purple arrow&amp;rsquo; spaces, he submerges to the next level down and spins again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on a &amp;lsquo;green starfish&amp;rsquo;, he submerges two levels down or an additional 2000 leagues under the sea and spins again.  If the space is occupied by another player, though, he rises to the space above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on a &amp;lsquo;red octopus&amp;rsquo;, he rises 1000 leagues directly above the space.  He does not spin again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player lands on a space occupied by another player, he rises to the space directly above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to reach &amp;rsquo;20,000 leagues under the sea&amp;rsquo; to the treasure chest at the bottom.  The player must land on the red arrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
