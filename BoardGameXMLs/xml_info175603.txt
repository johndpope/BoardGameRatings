							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Allianz der Unterwelt</name>
									
			<description>A murder mystery dinner-style party game in which each player is assigned a role and players try to find out who the murderer is. Each player has his/her own information booklet, and five game rounds are spent discussing clues and inconsistencies until players vote on who to accuse of the murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This case offers a cast of 8 particularly bizarre characters, among them a power-hungry conductor, an extreme eco-terrorist, a genius inventor, an old lady suffering from actinic dermatitis and a man in a kangaroo costume. The 8 craziest gangsters of the world have met to capture their common arch-enemy Major Sunshine, whose secrets would grant them world dominance. But then a bomb goes off in the cell in which the Major is kept, and now they have to find out who betrayed their alliance and killed the Major.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
