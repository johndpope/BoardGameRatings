							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">College Football USA 96</name>
									
			<description>The series was renamed &amp;quot;College Football USA 96&amp;quot;, and was the first version to feature all (108 at the time) division l-A teams. It was also the first in the series to feature real bowl games (Orange, Sugar, Fiesta and Rose). Players could play an entire 11-game season (or shorter if desired) before advancing to one of the bowl games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were 400 plays from which to choose, and a new passing mode allowed players to select from five receivers on every play. Other new features and options included the following: four-player mode, three different game lengths, substitutions, injuries, audibles, fake snaps, spins, hurdles, dives, blocked kicks, interceptions and laterals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NCAA Football series&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
