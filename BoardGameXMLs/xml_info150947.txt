			<description>The PlayStation Camera is a motion sensing device for PlayStation 4. It includes two 1280&amp;times;800px lenses operating with an aperture of f/2.0, with 30 cm focusing distance, and an 85&amp;deg; field of view. The dual camera setup will allow for different modes of operation, depending on the target application. The two cameras can be used together for depth-sensing of objects in its field of vision, akin to the Xbox's Kinect peripheral. Alternatively, one of the cameras can be used for generating the video image, with the other used for motion tracking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PlayStation Camera will also feature a four-channel microphone array, which helps reduce unwanted background noise and may even be used to issue commands. It is tentatively set to be 186 &amp;times; 27 &amp;times; 27 mm (7.3 &amp;times; 1.1 &amp;times; 1.1 in) (width &amp;times; height &amp;times; depth), with a weight of 183 grams (6.5 oz). It will record video in RAW and YUV (uncompressed) formats and will connect to the console via an auxiliary port. The PlayStation Camera will be released as a separate, add-on accessory, priced at US$59/&amp;euro;49/&amp;pound;44.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Playstation 4&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
