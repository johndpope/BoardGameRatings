							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Base Ball</name>
									
			<description>This undated but early baseball game by Milton Bradley is a spin-and-move affair. The two players race from home plate around the bases and back to home on a field glued to the box bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 spaces on each side of the diamond plus the squares for the bases. Each side has a red circle, which causes a player landing there to lose a turn. The three bases and home plate must be reached by exact spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a 4-space spinner, players must spin a 3 to start the game, but go directly to first base if they spin 4 three times before getting a 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There also are four hazard spaces on each track. The first, right after 2nd base, means a player is out (and starts over). The second and third, on the final leg, send the player back to third base. And the heartbreaking fourth, on the last space before winning, means the player is out at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
