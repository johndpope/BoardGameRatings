							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Nazi Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A board &amp;amp; card game of abstract skirmish level space combat for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the Iron Sky movie. In 1945 Nazis, using flying-saucers, escaped to and colonized the dark side of the moon. They call themselves the Fourth Reich. Ever since, and unknown to us, they&amp;rsquo;ve been plotting their return. Their fleet is currently in low earth Orbit, bombarding New York with large moon rocks and sending down waves of Attack saucers. Unknown to the Nazis and to each other, each of the major Earth nations has secretly weaponized their communication and science satellites. These have now banded together to fight off the Nazi Invasion Fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is conducted on an 8x8 grid using chits, figures or miniatures to represent units.  Units start on the back two rows of the player&amp;rsquo;s side of the board. Units are of various classes (Dreadnought, Carrier, Flying Saucer Squadron, Large, Medium and Small ships). Each unit has a designated hit value, and may have specific capabilities. Players can elect to play from 3 different scenarios though gameplay is common to all three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck of movement, attack, defence and special cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tactical Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Draw 3 cards.  Max hand size = 5 cards.  Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Play (discard) a move card to move one of your units. The move card has a number indicating the number of spaces the unit moves. Moves can be diagonal or orthogonal. Units may move through (past) other units.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Fire Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Play (discard) an Attack card to have a unit attack. The attack card has a number indicating the range of the attack. Attacks can be diagonal or orthogonal. Units may attack through (past) other units.&lt;br/&gt;         Every attack does a base of 1 damage (target loses 1 hit). A unit reduced to 0 hits is destroyed. &lt;br/&gt;         Your opponent may play defence cards to negate your attack.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is achieved through complete destruction of the opposing fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
