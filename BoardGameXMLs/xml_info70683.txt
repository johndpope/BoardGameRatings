			<description>&amp;quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a third-person hack and slash game released for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox and PC. A hack and slash role-playing game version was developed for the Game Boy Advance. Released in late 2003 to coincide with the release of the film of the same name upon which it was based, the game was published by EA Games and developed by EA Redwood Shores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very similar to The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, released a year earlier and also developed by EA Redwood Shores. The Return of the King differs by adding multiple storylines, more playable characters and increased interaction with environments. The game follows three separate story arcs loosely based on events in the film. A two-player co-op mode is available for some missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Return of the King was developed in close collaboration with New Line Cinema, using many of the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props and other assets from the film. The game was met with positive critical reception: its graphics, audio and gameplay were praised; camera control was criticized.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
