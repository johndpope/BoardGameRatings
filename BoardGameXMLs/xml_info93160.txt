							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Greeny Grasshopper&#039;s Card Game</name>
									
			<description>In turn, players spin the spinner and may discard one card from his hand if it matches an object that the spinner points to.  Only one card may be discarded at a time even though a player may have duplicates.  If a player's spin lands on a &amp;quot;Bug&amp;quot; space, and the player can discard &amp;quot;Greeny Grasshopper&amp;quot; from his hand, he may take another turn.  Upon landing on the spaces marked &amp;quot;Take 1 or Take 2&amp;quot;, the player must draw the amount of cards from the discard pile, unless there are no cards in the discard pile at this time.  The first player to get ride of all his cards, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
