			<description>Test Drive 5 is a cross-platform racing game, released on the PlayStation and PC in 1998.&lt;br/&gt;There are 18 tracks in the game, with 17 real-world tracks, plus one fictional circuit.&lt;br/&gt;Winning in a checkpoint track unlocks a reverse version of the track. Winning in a circuit track unlocks a vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 28 licensed vehicles. In addition, police cars are available in Cop Chase mode. Police car and original cars become playable in Single Race and Drag Race modes by winning all tournament races.&lt;br/&gt;Some licensed vehicles are unlocked by winning a circuit track, while others are earned by winning tournaments, which causes different vehicles to be unlocked depending on tournament types.&lt;br/&gt;All computer controlled vehicles have the same top speeds, which are depended on difficulty and vehicle dynamics settings.&lt;br/&gt;Arcade vehicle dynamics cause vehicles to accelerate and decelerate faster, have higher top speeds, and have greater crash effects than Simulation setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Test Drive 5&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
