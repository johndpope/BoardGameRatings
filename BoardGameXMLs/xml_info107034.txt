			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free download includes six pre-generated characters for &amp;AElig;ternal Legends. While making your own characters in the R2R system is both fast and fun, sometimes you don't have time &amp;mdash; if you're running a convention game, you want some idea of the characters ahead of time, while other groups will prefer having example characters to spark their own character generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters presented Manifested a short time ago, and are still new to life as Legends. There's a good mix of Unaware and Aware backgrounds to highlight different aspects of the setting. The characters all share one connection &amp;mdash; they all had some contact with a burned-out synagogue. Recognising each other from the repair efforts, the Legends founded their circle around the idea that no strike against their community could go un-punished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document details the characters' traits in a short format for quick reference when running the game. The accompanying file has two-page character sheets for player use, with full details on each character's capabilities, and a set of empty Health tracks for running NPCs and enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you use these characters as PCs in a one-shot or convention game, introduce them as antagonists to your players' circle, or build off them as inspiration, they're a useful resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
