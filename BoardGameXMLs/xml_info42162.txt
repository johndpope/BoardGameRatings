			<description>Sixteen Fifteen is a game of competitively placing Tetris-style pieces. There are four colours of play pieces, and players have four 4x4 puzzles to fill. Each player chooses a starting piece for each of their puzzles and plays it face-down so they do not know the colour of that piece. Players then draw further pieces from a bag and add them to their puzzles. When a puzzle is completed it is turned over to reveal the colours. Players may then trade pieces between their own and other players' puzzles. The first player to make 3 puzzles of a single colour each wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
