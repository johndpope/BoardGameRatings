							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superliga: Intrigue and Expertise</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Superliga as you&amp;rsquo;ve never seen it before. You&amp;rsquo;ve battled the mightiest beasts that the Overseer can throw at you. You&amp;rsquo;ve fought monsters that are clear rip-offs of Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and even the Matrix. But now&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ll need all your wits about you to face down the Red Queen in the bloodthirsty sport of Croquet, or to keep your cool when taking tea with Lord Herschel Grobulous the Younger.&lt;br/&gt;Are you prepared for Intrigue and Expertise?&lt;br/&gt;Are you prepared to sheathe your sword (if only temporarily - don&amp;rsquo;t look at me like that) and unleash your wit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SO WHAT&amp;rsquo;S IN THIS BOOK?&lt;br/&gt;Good stuff and plenty of it. Intrigue and Expertise covers a wide range of skills, abilities, rules clarifications and optional fiddly-bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW DO I USE THE RULES IN THIS BOOK?&lt;br/&gt;The rules presented in this book are designed to embiggen the world of Superliga by providing characters with even more exceptional abilities. These skills can be used to create entirely new&lt;br/&gt;characters, to flavour your current characters with a new spice, or just as inspiration for creating new stuff for whatever it is you use Superliga for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
