							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Gaki</name>
									
			<description>Minion for the Resurrectionists. Its natural leader is Kirai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaki are pack hunters. With enough numbers they can consume even human-sized targets with notable ease, making them very dangerous. While they are Graverobbers they are selfish with the corpse counters they collect. Indeed Gaki can consume their own allies to act faster. While employable by any Resurectionist Master, they very much enjoy the company and commands of Kirai who lets them enjoy the corpses she ignores as she enslaves the escaping souls of her victims. Under the command and within the close presence of Kirai, Gaki become even more savage then when ripping their foes apart with their sizable maw&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While a Gaki will eat near anything, they love living flesh over anything else and will frequently move with more passion to consume a beating heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaki work well with most Resurrectionist masters, provided they come as a group (as mentioned, 4 Gaki will only cost you 12-stones). With Kirai however they get a few extra perks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kirai can cast &amp;quot;Spirit Food&amp;quot; on living or undead enemy models. If the model affected is killed, a new Gaki will be summoned (with Slow for that turn). This can add to the Gaki's growing numbers and increase their pack-size. However the model MUST be killed and not sacrificed (i.e.: not Devoured or Absorbed by the Gaki) for a new Gaki to appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaki within 6&amp;quot; of Kirai increase their damage potential to 3/3/5 (two successful Gorges from a Feeding Frenzy will do anywhere between 6-10 damage in Kirai's presence!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaki killed within 8&amp;quot; of Kirai produce Seishin, which Kirai can evolve back into Gaki by spending (1) AP and losing -1 Wound (or -2 Wounds with her trigger if she would like to Summon the Gaki 12&amp;quot; away from herself - possibly beside an enemy who is already in Melee with another Gaki; creating potential for a retaliatory Feeding Frenzy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Spirits, Gaki offer Kirai a place to teleport to. As Gaki can move 10&amp;quot; each turn (14&amp;quot; if they can see a living model in the Start Closing Phase), they are quite swift and can offer escape locations for Kirai to teleport to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
