							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Supervillain: This Galaxy Is Mine! â€“ League of Villains expansion</name>
									
			<description> Dear Villains! Colleagues and Friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are invited to participate in a fascinating experiment. As you already know, in a Galaxy far, far away, Superheroes have vanished. The local Villains were swift to use this opportunity and started a marvelous mayhem. They aren&amp;rsquo;t that experienced yet but have already laid hands on the antimatter and erected Secret Facilities on their planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our duty is to enlighten them by setting the poor things on the right path of mutual destruction. Share your experience, teach disastrous tricks to them &amp;mdash; and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to retreat before it gets too hot. As we always do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please submit three copies of your signed applications to the galactic cash register. The name of the lucky winner who is about to join the scuffle first will be announced separately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Shuffle New Legend with the Domination deck. Deal one Run for Power! card to each player. Put the upper Legendary Villain card face-up. When a Villain draws New Legend card from the Domination deck, replace the Legendary Villain card with the next one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Legendary Villain has a Salutation, Influence, and Superpower. Salutation comes into effect when the Legendary Villain enters the game. The Legendary Villain's Influence is in effect all the time while the respective Legendary Villain card is in play. Finally, each player may address the Legendary Villain for moral and physical support (activate his/her Superpower) by using Run for Power! card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may play Supervillain with League of Villains expansion as it is described in it's basic rules. Or... you may use it as an incredible source of new game modes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;League of Villains is the expansion bringing maximum variability to the game. In addition, it raises the replayability manyfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
