			<description>Place Your Verse, described as &amp;quot;a 'Know Your Bible' game&amp;quot; on the box, is a card game where players attempt to match dealt cards with bible verses under their correct headings.  A winner is determined based on score, where players gain points for correct matches and lose points for incorrect ones.  There are also &amp;quot;strays&amp;quot; which match no heading but players can still win points by naming the verse, or lose points by playing them incorrectly.  Although specified for 2-6 players, the instructions state that larger groups may participate by playing as teams, using the same rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
