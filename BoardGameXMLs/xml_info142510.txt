			<description>A fruit-themed dice game for children that combines elements from Yahtzee and Old Maid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme&lt;br/&gt;Players try to collect the biggest and ripest fruit for a fruit salad. But careful, don't get any moldy ones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Collect as many points as possible by rolling die combinations to win fruit tiles and avoiding the mold tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 fruit tiles (4 different types of fruit in three sizes). They are sorted according to size and type and placed in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the four dice up to three times per turn. They may set aside as many dice as they want. The dice show the different types of fruit on four sides, a joker on one, and &amp;quot;Moldi the mold&amp;quot; on the last. After a maximum of three rolls, the result is counted. Each roll of a fruit counts as two of that type, the joker can be used as one of any type of fruit. Four fruits of a type win the active player the small tile of that type, 5 the medium one, and 6 the large one. If a player rolls 7 or 8 of one fruit, he/she gets all the tiles of that type, even if another player has already won them. &lt;br/&gt;If one of the dice shows the mold side at the end of a player's turn, that player doesn't win any fruit tile and has to take the mold tile instead. The player who has the mold tile when the game ends gets two minus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no tiles left in the pool. Players count their points and the player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
