			<description>This childrens game, featuring Disney characters, is actually four memory/matching games in one. Each game is deals with &amp;quot;healing&amp;quot; a character. Each character has two sets of cards - three Aches and Pains cards, and three All Better cards. For example, the three Daisy Duck Aches and Pains cards depict her head looking dizzy, her body shivering, and her feet in a tub of hot water. These all connect to form one full-body picture. The three all better cards show the same three body parts but the character is smiling and healthy. Typically, a game involves spinning a spinner that selects a character, flipping up an All Better card in hopes of finding a card for that character, and (if a match is made) placing the All Better card over the corresponding Aches and Pains card to heal the character. The &amp;quot;Go-Along&amp;quot; in the title references how each game increases in complexity as your child grows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
