			<description>From the Webpage&lt;br/&gt;There is nothing shocking in this game for those familiar with fantasy RPGs. It is intended to be a simple base system for a GM and group of players wanting a game with deadly monsters, huge armies and adventurers that gain treasures, fame and become legendary figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is perfect for a group wanting to quickly have a fantasy adventure as there are few rules to learn and the document is free.&lt;br/&gt;From this foundation a GM can create their own monsters to break from the classic examples given, using them to populate a world straight out of his imagination. It could be as simple as a one-off dungeon crawl or it could be a full world with empires and warring gods. With this in mind the rules are intended to be as straightforward and open to modification as possible to aid creation of new content and keep the amount of calculating, memorising and paperwork at the game table down to a minimum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
