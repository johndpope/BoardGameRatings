							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sheoloth: The Sprawling City</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far below the skies of the surface world, beyond the notice of many of the cities, towns and villages above, lies Sheoloth, a city of mystery, intrigue, and danger where the formidable and cunning dark elves live. A city full of priestesses that worship alien beings of immense power, creatures bending reality to their whim, drawing upon primal fears to shape their forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Mother&amp;rsquo;s plots and plans ensnare the whole city in a layer of subtle and not-so subtle-machinations. There in the shadows of the city she watches from her lair, eyes never leaving the most promising of her servants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noble houses constantly vie for power; the most powerful can be lost in seconds should they fail in their schemes, so they all try to curry favour in the Dark Mother&amp;rsquo;s court and protect their positions, all the while making sure daggers are firmly placed in the backs of their enemies and the throats of their allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dark elves here need to be careful, for they have enemies above and below, and have to content with their own callous natures. Unknown to them, they have enemies within the city&amp;rsquo;s own shadows &amp;ndash; the ovarisites, a strange race of highly intelligent creatures that plot and plan their demise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have concocted bizarre birth ceremonies to ensure the dark elves need them and allow nigh on unrestricted access to the young. Not even the Dark Mother or other gods of the dark elves are aware of the true danger these cunning beings pose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are other factions in the streets and alleys of Sheoloth, other branches of dark elf society that seek to seize control one way or another, from the Church of the Killer, the masculine god who attempts to wrest power away from the Dark Mother, to the Incabulos &amp;ndash; dangerous heretics misguided in their belief that the power of the priestesses can be stolen, rather than offered as a gracious gift by the Dark Mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The residents of the city must also contend with squabbling merchants, wily thieves and deadly assassins. The shadows cast by these groups interweave with common folk and nobility alike, and not a day goes by when some plan fails or succeeds, resulting in loss of life or freedom either way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book allows players to create dark elf characters and explore the City of the Dark Mother from top to bottom, immersing them in dark elf culture for the Legend RPG while providing up new advanced skills such as Style and Intimidation. New professions such as Assassins and Warlocks open the door to the dark elves&amp;rsquo; magical and vicious natures, while the dark elven magic of Shadowcraft, the ability to shape shadows into living beings or objects. Fleshcrafting, too, has its own dark secrets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So prepare to explore the city from the Ashen Bulwark to the Lair of the Dark Mother; just keep one hand on your dagger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Sheoloth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
