			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to In The Shade of the Pango Tree. This is  the first in a series of Fighting Fantasy Micro-adventures that come free with your copy of the monthly Fighting Fantasy Newsletter. All you need to play are a pencil, an eraser, and dice. Read the rules and background, enter your adventurer&amp;rsquo;s details on the Adventure Sheet, and begin your adventure by turning over the page!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Run away!&amp;rsquo; yelled the captain of your mercenary battalion as you were attacked by a horde of nomad horsemen at the border where the Mauristatian foothills meet the rolling plains of Lendleland. You and several comrades managed to flee the carnage and run to the hills, finally finding refuge at dusk. You camped in a wooded hollow at the base of a grassy hill surmounted by a single large, broad-leafed tree. Not wishing to light a fire that would give away your position, you fell into a fitful slumber - all except Mhurg Ironhelm, who took the first watch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What was that! You awaken with a start in the clear light of morning, but there is nothing there. In fact there is nobody here! All of your fellow mercenaries, including Mhurg, have disappeared! In their place are a series of messy bloodstains, culminating in a crimson trail of gore that leads up the grassy knoll towards the lone tree at its summit. Drawing your sword, you begin the ascent, determined to find out what terrible doom has befallen your comrades in the shade of the Pango tree...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
