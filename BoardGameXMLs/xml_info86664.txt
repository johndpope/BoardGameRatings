			<description>Le Super Morpion Tournant (The Great Turning Tic Tac Toe) is a &amp;quot;tri-dimensional turning tactical game&amp;quot; according to the label on the side of the game box. The game is 3D four-in-a-row game with some distinct differences from the common forms such as Score Four:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for two or four players.&lt;br/&gt; The game box contains a brief rule sheet in French, a game board, and 64 beads in four colors, 16 of each color.&lt;br/&gt; The middle of the game board consists of a four by four array of 16 rods, the central four of which are placed on a turntable. Thus, the central four rods may be turned relative to the board. In the periphery of the game board is space for an additional 16 rods which may be arranged in the corners (four player game) or along the ends (two player game). Each rod is able to contain a stack of four beads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game each player starts out with 32 beads, eight of each color (two player game) or 16 beads, for of each color (four player game). All of beads are positioned at the peripheral rods at start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On turn, each player is either placing one of his/her beads on one of the 16 central rods on the game board, or turning the central plate 90 degrees clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to create alignments of four different colored beads. Each such alignment earns the player one point. The player with most points at the end of the game (when all the beads have been played) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
