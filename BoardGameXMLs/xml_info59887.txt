			<description>Each player has eight cards with goblins on them who are in hiding. These cards are placed face-down in front of each player. A black figurine is standing on a long game board. Now a goblin color is randomly chosen and the players take turn looking under their opponent's tiles. The first player to find the goblin in question moves the black figurine toward the opponent's side of the board. This continues until a the black piece reaches one edge of the board. The player sitting on that side is the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
