							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bears, Foxes &amp; Hares</name>
									
			<description>A game for Icehouse pieces (the rules are written with the Rainbow Treehouse set in mind. If you are using the Xeno set or your own stashes, adjust the color reference accordingly. You will need one pyramid of each size of 5 different colors.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The animals in different parts of the forest have sent teams to compete in the annual contest. Each team has a grumpy bear, an impatient fox and a nervous hare. They all race to get to the center of the board. Along the way you will have opportunities to push your opponents out of the way, pin them motionless, leap over them, swap places with them and hitch a ride with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
