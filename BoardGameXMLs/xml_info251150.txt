			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you think of yourself as an empathetic person? Are you good at reading other people&amp;rsquo;s feelings and emotions? Then Empatia is right for you! In Empatia you&amp;rsquo;ll try to guess what other players like, and what is not their cup of tea. Empatia is a game filled with marvelous eerie illustrations &amp;ndash; and your task is to find among them the ones that other players like the best. You have to empathize with them to choose correctly; you have to discover why they like a given picture more than the others &amp;ndash; Is it the colors? Shapes? The person in the middle? A cute animal? Empatia is not a game for the cold-hearted, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- What&amp;rsquo;s in the box? 68 large-sized cards with illustrations; 12 cards with numbers; 6 plastic diamonds; 1 cardboard scoring sheet; 6 wooden player tokens; 36 cardboard tokens; rulebook&lt;br/&gt;- Beautiful and magical artwork&lt;br/&gt;- Easy-to-learn rules&lt;br/&gt;- 2 game modes &amp;ndash; competitive and cooperative&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay (basic version):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 6 cards in their hands. One player will be the judge of the round and gets rid of one card of which he thinks he will not need during the next rounds. His fellow players all choose one card (or two if there are only two or three players) they think the judge will like most. The judge shuffles the cards. All pictures are then shown face up. The fellow players try and guess which two cards the judge likes most (and which of these two is the absolute top) and get points according to the accuracy of their guesses. The first player to get 30 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay (cooperative play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve cards are laid face up on the table. The first player must find a key of exactly two words (prepositions and conjunctions don't count) that matches 3 of the cards on the table. The fellow players must then try and find not only those 3 cards, but also in which order the player would line them up (from the one that matches best the key to the one that matches it only better than the 9 remaining cards). The team then gets points according to their answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose is to get most point as a team. According to the number of points reached, you will know how well you know each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
