			<description>The Story:  The year is 1702. As a humble bean farmer, you have grown restless and yearn for adventure. You gather your belongings, sell your farm and purchase a small sloop from the local shipyard. With entrepreneurial vigor, you set sail for the nearest island, hoping to turn a meager profit on your final barrel of beans. The leaders of your nation soon hear of your courage and petition your service. They provide you with a small satchel of gold, a crew, and Letters of Marque. As a newly commissioned privateer, you must navigate the treacherous seas, and bring home great riches and glory to your country of origin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:  A player&amp;rsquo;s turn begins by drawing one adventure card and selecting one action card. Depending on the type of adventure, the card may be resolved immediately (e.g. a group activity), or the card may be placed on the ocean map by the player. The player then sails to an island or ocean space, choosing to either experience an adventure, or trade in the market. The market is the heart of this game. Players aim to buy low, sell high, carefully watching future prices, hoping to turn a profit. The action cards provide one-time bonuses to fight pirates, escape disasters, trade in the market, etc. Gold is used to upgrade ships, explore shipwrecks, gamble, etc. The game ends when a player&amp;rsquo;s ship is upgraded to level 10, and victory goes to the player with the most gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
