(Can be played in 3D with a special Torchlight fantasy products dungeon pack now available)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Hawk: This issue features a double-length scenario from the Zhalindor Campaign (a challenging series  of independently playable pull-out modules for experienced AD&amp;amp;D players).

Will they be able to find the hero's tomb and obtain the help they need?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pygmy Island: A solo role-playing adventure for complete beginners. Command a party of six adventurers, cast powerful magic spells, fight with hideous monsters and make life-or-death decisions in your quest for the legendary treasure.
