			<description>These rules for refighting battles from the Indian Mutiny of 1857 - 58 follow on from previous sets in this series ~ A Good Dusting and Washing the Spears ~ which have received a very positive reception from gamers. They are designed not for competition play but with enjoyment between like-minded friends firmly to the fore and focus very much on throwing loads of dice and feeling the brush of the Devil's Wind across your cheek in the process! Games should play out satisfactorily in two to three hours on a table about 7' x 4' or so. There is no figure, time or ground scale to worry about, just cut straight to the action on the road to Lucknow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanisms allow all players in the game to take on commands within an Honourable East India Company or Regular British force, with the Mutineers controlled by all of the players in accordance with the auto generation and action rules. It is equally possible for two or more players to take on opposing Mutineer and HEIC/HM forces and play the game out conventionally. The rules aim to give you an enjoyable game where, if correctly wisely and blessed by the dice gods, the Mutineer forces may win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full colour rules include numerous illustrations of action on the tabletop here in GHQ, units and individual character figures; scenic items to enhance your tabletop battlefield; a sample scenario to get you started straight away; a play sheet which can be photocopied; a short reading list; and a suggested list of figure manufacturers, in 28mm at least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
