			<description>In Futedado, soccer / football goals scored and conceded are dictated by a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This die is rolled more often the better the team is, both in terms of their coach, or their players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more we invest in the team more times we can roll the dice and thus have more chances to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay (from the website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://futedado.blogspot.pt/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://futedado.blogspot.pt/&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses the country or countries they will represent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tournament begins with the group stage, varying the number of groups depending on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each country is seeded, we know who plays who, match day to match day within your group, with the help of league tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with five credits of confidence (CC) times the number of countries that have or selections. The credits can be applied in the team or teams the player chooses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To increase the confidence level of their teams and play in more times the dice to win games, each player must manage the trust claims as best they can. Thus, the CC can be invested in two types of resources: players and coaches. Both types are rated as &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;outstanding&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all matches, the last dice roll made by a player is the one the counts for the final score of the match. For example, if you can throw the dice three times, but if you are satisfied with the 2nd roll, you don't need not make the final one. The latter roll is the one that counts, whether or not the most favorable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; team may choose to re-roll the final dice of both players, by using the &amp;quot;home factor&amp;quot; card. Once rerolled the results are final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each victory is worth 3 points and 4 CC, each tie is worth 1 point and 2 CC and every defeat is worth 0 points and cost one CC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This increase or decrease of confidence in players and /pr coaches and the gain or loss of CC are accounted at the end of a match day, and before the next match day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the group stage, only the two or four best teams from each group (depending on the number of players) advance to the next stage. The tie breakers are: &lt;br/&gt;1st: point gained;&lt;br/&gt;2nd: greatest goal average;&lt;br/&gt;3rd: most goals scored for.&lt;br/&gt;4th: result of the match between the tied teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All other teams are eliminated from play at this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each stage a team advances, the controlling player receives 2 CC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quarter finals (if applicable),  the semi finals and final games are to be elimination games. If they end up tied, they go to penalties, using the &amp;quot;penalty die&amp;quot;. A series of five penalties for each team is rolled, and if the score is still tied, each team roll once until the tie breaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the European football championship is the one whose team win the final of the competition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
