			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the outer edge of the galaxy Beacon 04523N continues its lonely vigil. Positioned at a major interstellar junction, its nanowave transmissions reach deep into space to guide intergalactic travellers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with most modern-day space stations the routine operation of the beacon can be handled perfectly adequately by droids, but to comply with federal regulations an N-class space station requires three human personnel on board at all times, so Fleet Command has assigned to the beacon three of the least dependable and most dispensable officers in the fleet. Held in a stage of cryogenic suspension, they will be defrosted only in the event of a major malfunction or if the beacon comes under threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALERT +++ ALERT +++ UNIDENTIFIED LIFEFORMS APPROACHING BEACON +++ SELECT AUTO DEFROST +++ INITIATE 60 MINUTE COUNTDOWN TO SELF-DESTRUCT +++ CONDITION RED +++ THIS IS NOT A DRILL +++ REPEAT +++ THIS IS NOT A DRILL +++&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're here &amp;ndash; and they're hungry! Plasmodians &amp;ndash; slimy green blobs from another galaxy &amp;ndash; are heading for the beacon. All they want is food &amp;ndash; but after travelling for 3 billion years the beacon looks rather tasty. They'll even eat the crew, turning them into indestructible mutant jelly monsters, or take over the droids, making them flip their lids!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you let the plasmodians take over the Gravity Control Room the droids will float helplessly around the station; allow them to overrun the Atmosphere Control and you'll be gasping for breath! Don't, whatever you do, let them take over the Generator Room or you'll lose all your power! And above all, remember to keep the Beacon's four bulbs in alignment (that's why you're there, after all).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have just 60 minutes to eliminate the alien invaders before the beacon self-destructs, destroying everything &amp;ndash; and everyone &amp;ndash; on the station. Succeed and you could be in line for promotion; fall and you'll be listed as 'missing, presumed dead'. Your fate is in your own hands. Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Realistic 8-way scrolling isometric view&lt;br/&gt;- Use the 'Zippway' shuttles and the glass-sided elevator to move quickly around the ship&lt;br/&gt;- Fight the aliens inside &amp;ndash; or outside as you use your jetpack to fly around the beacon armed with a deadly plasmicide spray gun&lt;br/&gt;- Clean up the plasmodians with the 'Space Hoover' battlepod&lt;br/&gt;- Up to ten programmable droids active at any time, each with its own personality&lt;br/&gt;- Atmospheric sound effects by David Whittaker&lt;br/&gt;- Theme music by Warren Cann of Ultravox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
