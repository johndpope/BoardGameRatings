			<description>Welcome to your last semester of college!&lt;br/&gt; Dropout is a humorous take-that card game for up to four players who try to raise their G.P.A in order to graduate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, there are so many distractions to your studies: parties to attend, movies to watch and beer to drink.  Each one of these distractions will lower your G.P.A.  However, if you study, do your homework and avoid temptation, you might be able to raise and your G.P.A and graduate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players will place activity cards to increase their G.P.A and distraction cards on the other players to lower theirs.  After four rounds of triumphs and defeats, one semester has passed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earn the highest G.P.A in four semesters and become the one who doesn't Dropout&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
