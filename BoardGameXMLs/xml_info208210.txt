							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fimir: A Supplement to the Old World Bestiary</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fimir are a race of cyclopean humanoid swamp dwellers that fear the light of the sun, which they call 'The Great Burning Eye' in their degenerate tongue. Direct sunlight disorients them and they prefer to move about under the aegis of a mystic fog which some of their race can invoke. They are quick to put buildings that other races have discarded to their own uses. Fimir abide by a strict caste system that they are &amp;ldquo;born&amp;rdquo; into. The Fimir have great barrel chests with short legs and three-toed clawed feet that are excellent for gripping marshy ground. Their bodies appear to be flabby, but they hide deceptive strength. Their large heads are mostly hairless and taper to a noseless tusked snout. Their infamous single eyes are pupil-less and are typically coloured either amber or milky-white. They have long snake-like tails and smooth leathery hides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
