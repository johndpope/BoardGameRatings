			<description>Published in Command # 16, Operation Desert Weirdness  expands the Desert Storm: The Mother of All Battles base game. This expansion adds new counters for Japanese, Soviet and Iranian. And new rules and scenarios for iranian intervention in the Iraqi side, and Soviet intervention in the iraqi or Coaltion side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Desert Storm: The Mother of All Battles base game is a one- or two-player operational simulation of the Gulf War. It focused almost exclusively on the Coalition ground war that liberated Kuwait and shattered the occupying Iraqi army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game included a 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; hex map of the significant terrain in the Kuwaiti Theatre of Operations, 192 counters, and 20 pages of rules, charts, and tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are split into both a basic and an advanced game. There are separate rules for solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S./Coalition player had to completely liberate Kuwait to have a chance to win. If Kuwait was liberated within 12 game turns, the player who has gained the most 'points' in inflicting losses on their opponent, was the winner. The Coalition player had to be aggressive in order to completely clear Iraqi units from all Kuwaiti cities, towns, oilfields, and airfields, otherwise the Iraqi player would win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
