			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages ago, in a much simpler time, a young boy embarked upon his very first epic adventure. A dungeon was entered, a friend was made, monsters were fought, and a friend was lost. This is that boy's tribute to the memory of his long forgotten friend. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shrine of St. Aleena is a Labyrinth Lord adventure designed for 3-6 characters of 1st-3rd level (about 12 levels total). A diverse range of classes is recommended, however, at least one character should be of Lawful alignment. The Shrine of St. Aleena involves a mixture of roleplaying, problem solving, and dungeon crawling. The adventure takes place in a cave complex known as the Shrine of St. Aleena which is set in the Chronicles of Amherth&amp;trade; campaign setting, but may easily be dropped into any remote wilderness region of any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: In true old school fashion, a number of the encounters in The Shrine of St. Aleena involve save or die-type mechanics. The Labyrinth Lord is free to alter these effects for groups who prefer less random mortality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
