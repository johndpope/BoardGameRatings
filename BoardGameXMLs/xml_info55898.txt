			<description>Ampumahiihtopeli (translation from Finnish: The Biathlon game) is about biathlon, the combination of cross-country skiing and shooting targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players compete to be the first to reach the goal line, by moving along a track on the board. In individual competition, each player will visit the shooting range twice and at each time try to hit all the five targets at their slot on the range. Shooting takes place through rolling the die, and trying to hit the numbers 1-2-3-4-5, in any sequence, per time at the shooting range. For each miss, the player will have to do an extra penalty lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was approved by the Finnish Biathlon Association, and probably originates from late 1970s - early 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
