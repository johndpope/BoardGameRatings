			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Tweak &amp;amp; Toss &amp;quot;adventure seed&amp;quot; tasks the party to investigate a small mystery that might seem rather benign, but is of utmost importance for the local village. The design is deliberately vague in several areas to make it easy to integrate with your current campaign. Perfect for when the party goes &amp;quot;left&amp;quot; when you expected them to go &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;, any GM/DM/Judge can easily drop this into the current campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea behind this Tweak &amp;amp; Toss is that a village holy man needs the party to investigate why the ravens have dissappeared from the small island in the lake next to the village. The party, as outsiders, are able to investigae where the holy man cannot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is intended to print this file two-sided and fold in half, zine-style. Just select &amp;quot;booklet printing&amp;quot; and make sure that you have duplex set up on the short edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF download consists of three pages of content (map, area information, and basic set-up). There are a couple of hotlinks within the file taking you to some additional resources, one of which is the Patreon site where you can download better versions of the maps if you so desire. There is also a related one-page &amp;quot;Ecology of&amp;quot; free download, also on Patreon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
