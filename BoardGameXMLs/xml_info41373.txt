							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Making Money</name>
									
			<description>The game is called Making Money, and the goal as you can imagine is to make as much money as you can, anyway you can. This is done by moving around the streets of a city while buying up and developing property. Money can also be made by buying and selling stocks that go up and down in value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game involves some chance from drawing cards and rolling dice, without a good strategy you will quickly find yourself well on your way to financial ruin. The game is very easy to learn and during play testing has been a lot of fun! To win the game, simply keep making money while trying to stay ahead of everyone else. The game is played for a set number of rounds and the player with the most money at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I welcome everyone and anyone to jump in, give feedback, and play test if you can. Play testing takes place in New York City, upcoming dates and locations can be found on our website, link is below in this listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
