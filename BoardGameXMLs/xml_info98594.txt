			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mysterious bright light has appeared in the Delaris Mountains, roughly ten days from Jerris. While the light cannot be seen from Jerris, it has been spotted by several passing airships and it can be clearly seen from a small group of villages situated in the foothills of the mountains. The light shines throughout the night and vanishes at dawn, just like all those who have tried to discover its source. Investigating the strange light, the characters discover a recently abandoned kaer &amp;mdash; as well as a cabal of deranged magicians who have been holding the former kaer&amp;rsquo;s residents hostage since the beginning of the Scourge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher: This scored First Place in the Earthdawn Adventure Resource Contest of 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
