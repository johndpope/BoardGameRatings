							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enclave of the Exterminatus</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While enjoying a nice honey wine in the backwater community of Bench you discover citizens have been kidnapped from the surrounding area. After further investigation the mystery leads to a compound being built by the Exterminatus! With the danger mounting can the party slow the march of the evil cult and maybe pick up a few more pages of the arcane tome? Are they stealthy enough to infiltrate the stronghold? At almost 50 pages this adventure has the Precinct of Bench and the large compound of the Exterminatus each of which can be used in separate campaigns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Quest Campaign for a group of mid-level adventurers and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
