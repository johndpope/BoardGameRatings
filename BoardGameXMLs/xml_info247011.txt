			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These acrylic ACE Aircraft Management Tokens are the perfect way to keep track of the status of your aircraft during a game.  This set will allow you to track what your last maneuver was, how long your guns are jammed, rather or not you have an Aim Bonus on an enemy aircraft, and also if you have engine damage.  With multiple restrictions on which maneuvers can be done based on the previous maneuver, the yellow Last Maneuver tokens will make it easy to keep track of everything during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser cut and engraved both sides for the highest of quality, these tokens will last as long as your miniatures.  Each package includes 10 Last Maneuver tokens so that you can track what maneuvers are legal for your selection, 3 Guns Jammed tokens to track those pesky jammed guns, 1 Aim Bonus token to help you remember when to add that extra damage to your enemy, 1 Tailing token, and finally an Engine Damaged token to remind you of the those restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACE (Advanced Component Equipment) tag in this product's name indicates that it is made with the highest quality materials available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
