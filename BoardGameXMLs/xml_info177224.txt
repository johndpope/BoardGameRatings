			<description>Dragon War: Riders of Ashara is a table-top miniatures game of riders and their dragon steeds.  Set in an original world drawing upon dragon mythology from the many legends of our own world, Dragon War: Riders of Ashara focuses on dragons and riders fighting against air, ground and sea adversaries.  Their foes come from the nine kingdoms of man across three separate continents- each with their own motivations and machinations. Ashara is a world of incredibly high mountain ranges that divide the continents, meaning that wars must be fought either from the air or by sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ashara, being the known lands of the kingdoms of mankind is at war.  The year is 1448, being the 120th occurrence of the year of the Falcon in the Zodiac of Shen. Nations battle for conquest, glory, and power. Dragon riders, highly trained warriors and the pride of their nations, sit atop powerful dragons to do battle with one another and defend against threats from the skies, lands and seas of Ashara. Dragons fight with tooth, claws and their mighty breath weapons of fire, ice, lightning, poison, acid, wind or the mysterious life stealing power of the rend. Choose your dragon and the nation you defend as you take to the skies from the back of a young and agile drake or an ancient and powerful wyrm. Or, choose to register as one of the many mercenary wings, small bands of dragon riders fighting for the highest bidder or for your own personal crusade. The time has come for heroes and their mighty steeds to take to the skies. This is the age of the Riders of Ashara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
