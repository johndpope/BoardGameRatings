							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Remnant: A Fellowship Expansion Pack</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My people are dead. Our cities are ruins. Our culture is lost. But some small part of me can't let go. I can't watch it happen again, happen to more of you living folk. I can't let this pain I feel be felt again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have seen this Overlord you all fear. You have good reason to. It's happening all over again. More will be lost, more destroyed. The world is ending, you know? I can't help but despair. This is all so very hopeless. We'll never make it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But I can't help but try. I can't let it happen again. I can't watch another become like us, so hollow, so hungry, so empty and angry and hurt and empty and hungry and hurt and... and...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgive me. I am but a Remnant of the past. And I can't let go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Remnant is the fourth Fellowship expansion pack. The Remnant are a people who have been lost, destroyed, but somehow still remain. They are a champion who has defied all odds, endured a pain the rest of the world can barely comprehend, and come out the other side still trying to save it. The Remnant is a survivor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Remnant turns pain into advantage. Being hurt does not hinder the, and they heal by hurting their enemies. They never go down, they never die, but if they fall too far they become a wild beast, lashing out at everyone around them. Remnants hurt, and they share that hurt with the world that wronged them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
