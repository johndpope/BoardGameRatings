			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book lets players play dragons. Combined with a setting, dragon information has been compiled so that players may easily create a character with this book and corebooks without rummaging through three to five books. Some of the information has been duplicated for ease, but it also directs players to the corebooks to keep from becoming too redundant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The types of dragons are called Wyrmsworn dragons while the dragons in the Monster Manual (D&amp;D 3.5e) are known as True Dragons. A different type of dragon was created to help the players easily create balanced dragons, but still be different from each other. Players can choose the True Dragons, and this would not be too hard if everyone understood how the dragons work exactly. The other aspect of the dragons is their power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
