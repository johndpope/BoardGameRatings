							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fabled Lands Core Rule Book</name>
									
			<description>from the publishers website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fabled Lands Core Rule Book and twelve source books are based on the Gamebooks written in 1995 by Dave Morris and Jamie Thomson and brought back to print in this core rulebook by Shane Garvey and Jamie Wallis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harkuna is a world of mystery, intrigue and high adventure. Create campaigns and quests based in your favourite territories from The Fabled Lands: The War-Torn Kingdom of Sokara; the prosperous cities of Golnir (Cities of Gold and Glory), the Purple Ocean (Over the Blood-Dark Sea), north through the Spine of Harkun to The Plains of Howling Darkness, further west to The Court of Hidden Faces in Old Harkuna or east across the ocean to the oriental Lords of the Rising Sun in AkatSuri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Role Playing Game has been designed using rules that are based on the original gamebook rules but have been expanded to achieve a party, role play experience. The twelve source books will detail the 6 previously published gamebooks as well as the 6 unpublished ones. Both Dave Morris and Jamie Thomson have had a side-line interest in what has gone into the role playing game to ensure that the original Fabled Lands feel remains intact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
