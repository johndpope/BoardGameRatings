			<description>In La Chasse aux Lutins, many cute elves are hidden in your house. The player needs to find where they are hidden and catch them before anyone else can, and whoever collects more elves on his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do the elves hide in your house? They get a little help from the players. In the basic game, the cards have one, two or three elves on them, and these cards are split evenly among the players. The players then go into different rooms in the house and hide the cards, with the one elf cards being fully visible, the two elf cards being half hidden, and the three elf cards being completely hidden. Players then start from a central location and hunt for cards, staying away from the room in which they hid cards since they already know where to find those elves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Chasse aux Lutins includes a variant that uses cards with mischievous elves. These are hidden along with the other elf cards, and if a player finds at least three of these cards, he scores an additional three points that's added to his elf score. If he finds only one or two of these cards, however, he scores no bonus and must throw away one of the elf cards he collected!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
