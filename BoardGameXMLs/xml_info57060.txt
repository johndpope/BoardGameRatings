			<description>The concept of the game is to translate the abstract number range of 1-10 into a number landscape, where children can grasp and comprehend numbers as something concrete. The Numberland (Zahlenland) concept has been developed continuously since the 1950&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; notably by one of the designers,Dr. Gerhard Friedrich. The basic idea for this game is taken from the German bestseller &amp;ldquo;Komm mit ins Zahlenland&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Come with me to Numberland&amp;rdquo;) by Friedrich de Galg&amp;oacute;czy. The game can be used for as preparation for school and as a learning companion during the first school year. The following mathematical concepts and skills are addressed in gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cardinal number aspect (quantity aspect): Numbers are used to indicate the number or cardinality of the elements of a set (e.g. 6&lt;br/&gt;apples, 3 pine cones).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ordinal number aspect (order aspect): Numbers are used to indicate position in an ordered set (e.g. first, third etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arithmetic aspect: Numbers indicate the result of an arithmetic operation, e.g. an addition (e.g. 5 = 3 + 2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric number aspect: Numbers are used to identify geometric shapes (e.g. pentagon, triangle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numeric image: Numbers are represented with the aid of numeral and dice images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Numberland consists of 10 number houses, in each of which a number lives. Numberland has to be constructed correctly. But the number goblin, Jumble, is on his way from Mistake Forest to bring disorder to Numberland. Can the players stop him and build Numberland? Luckily they have the Number Fairy to help them. The players roll a die and if they roll a Numberland symbol they can construct on one of the buildings (which are completed in numerical order). If the players roll the Number Goblin their constrcutions will be mixed up and remain so until someone roll the Number Fairy, then the mix up can be corrected. Once all houses are finished we will see if Numberland is still jumbled or correct!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
