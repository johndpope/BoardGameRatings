			<description>You are feeding the hungry fish a fist full of worms (hand of worm cards).  The goal of the base game is to be the first to feed all your worms to the fish (empty your hand).  The fish mechanism gets programmed to know where all the players.  The fish will make jokes, chuckle at players, ask for food, and make other comments while the game is in progress.  When the game finishes, the fish will automatically announce the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, every player gets a hand of cards that evenly distribute the 12 worm cards.  The Fish mechanism gets setup by placing it on the base and pushing it's fin.  The fish will spin and ask &amp;quot;Are you ready to play&amp;quot; at one of 4 player positions.  If there is a player at the position, hit the fish fin to confirm.  If not, wait a few seconds and the fish will skip to the next possible player position.  Then the fish spins and randomly stops to face a player.  It makes an automated comment like &amp;quot;I'm hungry&amp;quot; and waits for the player it's facing to add a worm card to it's mouth.  Players need to be quick or the fish will skip the player.  Once you put a worm in the fishes mouth, the fish will make a crunch noise, spin and then randomly stop on a player position, spit the worm card out and chuckle.  It may spit the card out to the player who put the worm in it's mouth in the first place.  This process will repeat and eventually one player will have no cards left in their hand and win the game.  The Fish will announce the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an advance game play variant:  To start the game, separate the cards into stacks by color. Each player chooses the stack of cards that match the color of their player number on the game base. Turn Fish Food ON, and all players press the fish&amp;rsquo;s fin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feed the fish when he spins to you, but instead of trying to get rid of your card, try to collect three cards of another player&amp;rsquo;s color! When you have collected three cards in another color, press the fish&amp;rsquo;s fin once - you&amp;rsquo;re the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers website:  Fish Food is the FINtastic game with the smart fish that knows how to play! If he lands on you, feed him one of your cards. Watch out on the next spin &amp;ndash; he may spit the card back to you! Get rid of all of your cards to win. The fish knows who wins and will call out the winner at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
