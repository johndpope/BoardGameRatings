			<description>King of Tortuga is a pirate-themed player elimination card game for up to eight players. The setting is the pirate enclave of Tortuga during the heyday of piracy in the early 18th century where a number of crews are in the city and decide to fight to see who is the best. As the Captain of the crew if you are successful you will be declared the King of Tortuga and the the most powerful pirate this side of Blackbeard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is easy - each player is given five cards that have a variety of attack, defense and special cards. Each card has either a point value and/or an explanation of what they do to let you know what to do.  Each player also is given 12 markers. The markers represent your crew.  As your crew inflicts damage your opponents will lose more crew members until eliminated until opponents are gone... but you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
