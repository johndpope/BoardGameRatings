							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strategic Conquest</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Strategic Conquest is a two-player turn-based strategy game for the Apple II and Apple Macintosh, similar to Empire. It was published by PBI Software and the Macintosh version was continued by Delta Tao Software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategic Conquest allows the player to control modern warfare units and conquer cities. It can be played either by two humans, or with a computer opponent. It also has the capability to be played over an AppleTalk network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's objective in Strategic Conquest is to defeat the enemy and conquer the world. The world is divided into a rectangular grid made up of randomly-placed islands, which contain cities. Cities can belong to either player, or they can be neutral. When controlled by either player, Cities can produce military units. Victory is achieved when all enemy cities have been conquered or when either player surrenders.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Strategic Conquest II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
