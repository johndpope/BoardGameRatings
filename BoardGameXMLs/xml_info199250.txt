			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthos is a strategy-based board game with features rarely, if ever seen in most board games today. Your objective in the game is to defeat your opponents by increasing technology, making strategic invasions and occupying enemy planets. Other strategic aspects of the game include rotating planets and moons, as well as random wormholes which allow units to move randomly. Politics can also play a pivotal role in match-ups with more than two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One last important highlight is the fact that each and every game can be a new experience. With the ability to change the shape of the board, pair up for team battles, and do much more, every game should be packed with fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
