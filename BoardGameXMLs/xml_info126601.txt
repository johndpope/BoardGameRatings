			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cybotron is a clone of the Williams classic 'Robotron', written by Darrell Etherington and published by Anirog Software (who would later become Anco).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a human who starts in the middle of the playfield surrounded by robots. The user controls the human using either one or two joysticks. With one joystick the human continually fires in the direction that he is walking. With two joysticks, one controls the direction of movement and one controls the direction of firing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as robots, there are other humans which the player can touch for bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
