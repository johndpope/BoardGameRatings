							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">At The Crossroads of Sanctuary &amp; Salvation</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Guided Play Scenario is designed for one-shot, introductory, and convention play of Annalise. It provides a setting, a situation, characters and some of the surrounding fiction (some NPCs, Claims, and so forth).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 1947 and Sanctuary is the picture perfect model for small town living in the American South. Everyone knows each other&amp;rsquo;s names, goes to church on Sunday, and knows that Bascomb&amp;rsquo;s Diner has been serving the best grits for over thirty years. The mayor will tell you they call it Sanctuary because folks know how to keep their problems behind closed doors; when trouble starts they have the decency to mind their own business. All of that changed one humid summer day when a mysterious traveling salesman named Quentin Drake came to town. With his felt hat, crisp wool suit and shiny leather shoes, everyone knows a perfect gentleman when they see one. And while it may not come out of that fancy looking case he carries, he always has what you need. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the cost; you needn&amp;rsquo;t always pay in cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
