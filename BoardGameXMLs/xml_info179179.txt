			<description>Tingo Tengo Ecuador is a set collecting and memory card game. The aim of the game is to collect the majority of the four-card sets of fourteen cities of Ecuador.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two phases: in the first phase the players try to guess which other players have the cities they are dealt at the beginning (with a correct guess the player receives the card; with a wrong guess the turn goes to the next player); in the second phase the players try to remember which four-card sets the other players have collected in order to steal the cards fro the other players. The first player to get all four-card sets is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
