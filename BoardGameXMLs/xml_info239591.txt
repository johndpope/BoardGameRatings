			<description>A nice walk in the ancient little town, between workers, games and duties. King is waiting for you, will you be able to be in time at his presence?&lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice.... and find it out!&lt;br/&gt;Move your pawn along the path by the result of the dice and, the read the instruction on the stop where you land. You could move faster, re-roll or go back to the start depending on where you land. The first who will reach the end of the path, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
