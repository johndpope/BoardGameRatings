							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Everyday Mathematics Family Games Kit for Early Childhood</name>
									
			<description>A collection of rules, game boards and numerous bits for playing twelve different educational games, all with a focus on early childhood mathematics. While designed for home use by parents, many of the games in the kit are also suitable for classroom use with larger groups. The rules booklet and each game includes an introductory section about the purpose of the collection and each game. The games included in the kit are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Coin Exchange (Money Cube Game 1) -- A two player game using play money and two special dice, each marked with 2 pennies, 2 nickles and 2 dimes. Players simply roll the dice and collect money from the bank. The winner is the player with the most money when the bank runs out of dimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Concentration with Number Cards and Dominoes -- A two player game using a special deck of numbered cards (0 through 9) and 10 dominoes from a standard set that have a total of 0 to 9 pips. The cards and dominoes are shuffled and arranged in a face-down tableau, and the players take turns flipping over one card and one tile, collecting matching sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Disappearing Train -- A two to four player board game a special board, 16 counters for each player and a special die with sides -1, -2, -3 and +3, with two other blank sides. Players make trains out of 12 of their counters and remove counters from the train according to the die roll, but the player has to roll a positive number to begin and an exact number to end. The game ends when a player collects 12 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Double-Digit Dice Game -- A game using two special dice, one marked 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the other marked 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0. Players roll both dice in turn and try to make the largest two digit base ten number. A suggested variation is to go for the smallest number. It could also be played as a press-your-luck game. It's suggested for two to four players, but any number can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     High Roller -- A simple dice game suggested for two to four players, but any number can play. In turn, players roll two regular six-sided dice, then re-roll the lower, keeping track of their score. This is for the youngest players who are just learning how to count pips. The highest score after two rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Matching Coin Game -- A game about matching coins rolled on a special die showing pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters, and placing them into the correct segments of a money tray. It's suggested for four or five players, but any number could play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Monster Squeeze Game -- A two player guessing / deduction game using a special board and monster figures to keep track of high and low guesses on a number line. Each player in turn thinks of a number from 0 to 10 and the other makes guesses, moving the monsters until the number is guessed correctly. Fewest guesses to get the number wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One-Dollar Game -- A two player game where the object is to be able to collect enough change to be able to exactly exchange for a dollar. Players collect coins according to a special die with coins on the faces, making change for larger coins along the way. A special board helps players keep track of things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Paper Money Exchange Game (Money Cube Game 2) -- A two player game where the object is to be the first to collect $100 by collecting bills shown on a special die, making change for larger bills along the way. A board helps players keep track of things, and variations are given for collecting $1000 and adding another special die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Plus or Minus Game -- A territorial game played on a checkers board (included in the kit). Players roll a special die with faces -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3, placing or subtracting counters from the board. Suggested for 2 players, it could be played by up to four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Spin a Number (1-10) -- A simple spin and move race game played with a single counter for each player on a track board. Suggested for 2 to 5 players, but any number could play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Top-It -- A two player card game similar to &amp;quot;War&amp;quot; played with a special numbered deck. The object is to either get the most or fewest cards after one trip through the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
