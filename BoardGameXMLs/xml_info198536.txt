			<description>You are a crew member in an alien ship. Alien for humans of course. The ship is malfunctioning and you are stranded in the human solar system.&lt;br/&gt;Using primitive detectors, you are trying to identify as many planets as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quest is finished when Earth has been claimed and no one disproved the claim after 2 rounds or when a crew member receives maximum influence from their captain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the crew member with the most influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player holds a detector card and a bunch of colored tokens.&lt;br/&gt;Each round players execute 2 actions each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possible actions are: Detect, Claim and Disprove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detecting&lt;br/&gt;Players use the detector cards and place them under each hidden planet.&lt;br/&gt;Once flipped the player secretly sees a part of the planet and notes down the information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claiming&lt;br/&gt;Players move the claimed card from the game board onto it's claimed location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disproving&lt;br/&gt;Players use their detector card to disprove an existing claim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
