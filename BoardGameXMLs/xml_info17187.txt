							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbie Sparkle Kingdom Game</name>
									
			<description>The Barbie Sparkle Kingdom game is very much like a Barbie themed Candyland.  Rather than drawing cards with colors on them, the player spins a spinner, chooses a flower on the spinner, looks under the flower for the color and moves their piece to the next space on the board of that color.  If that space has a flower, the player gets another turn.  If the player lands on a bumble bee, they have to go back to the spot of the previous bumble bee on the board.  There are short cuts (Rainbow Bridge, Butterfly Trail, Crystal Path) to speed you along your route.  The winner is the player to be the first to Barbie's Jeweled Palace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;1 glittery game board&lt;br/&gt;4 Barbie playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;1 flower spinner with base&lt;br/&gt;5 plastic flowers&lt;br/&gt;50 glittery stickers&lt;br/&gt;1 spinner and playing piece label sheet&lt;br/&gt;Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
