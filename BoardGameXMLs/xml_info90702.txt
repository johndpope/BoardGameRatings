							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heart of Darkness</name>
									
			<description>Heart of Darkness is a 1998 video game by Amazing Studio and released by Interplay for Microsoft Windows-based PCs and the PlayStation. A Game Boy Advance port was announced in 2001 but never released. It is the first game to have its score recorded by an orchestra though because of delays, it was not the first to be released with a full orchestral soundtrack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows Andy, a child who hates his abusive teacher, loves his dog Whiskey, and is afraid of the dark. One day, Andy and Whiskey head for the park. A solar eclipse occurs while they're there. During the eclipse, Whiskey is taken away by an unseen creature. Andy then rushes to his treehouse, where he keeps his inventions, and jumps inside a spaceship to find Whiskey. He takes off and finds himself in the Darklands, which is a portion of the Heart of Darkness. Inhabited by creatures of the night and ruled over by an evil sorcerer that's known as the Master of Darkness, the Darklands are extremely dangerous. Andy must find it in himself in order to rescue Whiskey and find a way home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an extra gimmick the game came with a pair of red/green 3D glasses so certain scenes could be viewed in 3D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Heart of Darkness (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
