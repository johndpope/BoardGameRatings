							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Winx Club: Die gestohlenen Kristalle</name>
									
			<description>A Winx Club themed die-rolling game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil Trix (witches Darcy, Icy and Stormy) have stolen wonderful crystals from the fairy boarding school Alfea. Lead the Winx in a magic die battle to defeat the Trix and get the crystals back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: A course is laid out with the 24 Winx tiles. Tiles with the same value (1-6) must not be placed next to each other. The 12 Trix cards are sorted into three stacks by value (4, 5 or 6). Each of the three stacks is shuffled and placed face down. The top card is then turned face-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Players take turns. The active player rolls the die and puts a crystal on the first card with the number corresponding to the die roll. He/she can either stop then or continue. &lt;br/&gt;If you stop, you count the crystals that are laid out. If there are 4-6 crystals, you get to take the top Trix card from the corresponding stack. If there are fewer than four crystals, you get to take one of the Winx tiles that you have put a crystal on.&lt;br/&gt;If you continue, you roll again and put a crystal on the next Winx card with the number corresponding to the die roll (counted from the last crystal, not from the start of the game). If you cannot lay out more crystals (because the result of your die roll isn't shown on any further tiles of the course), you've taken too big a risk and have to remove all the crystals from the course. Your turn ends and you don't get to take a Trix card.&lt;br/&gt;Collected Winx tiles can be used to steal another player's Trix cards if you have collected Winx tiles in all the colours that are shown on the Trix card. The Winx tiles that were used to steal another player's Trix card are put at the beginning of the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who has collected each of the three Trix wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
