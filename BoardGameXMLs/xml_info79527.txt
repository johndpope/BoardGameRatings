			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A traditional roleplaying experience, without the dice. The RoShamBo Diceless System is designed to keep the story moving and keep the interaction between the GameMaster and the players at a quick and constant pace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic mechanic of the game work like this: When a player encounters something that requires a resolution, they choose one of the available options. In Combat, for example, those options are Attack, Defend or Action (performing a maneuver or using a non-combat skill such as casting a spell) and the situation is resolved using the same system as Rock~Paper~Scissors. In the event of a tie, the characters' skill points are compared and the winner takes all. That's it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find everything you need to get started in ten pages; rules on how do deal with everything from combat, to magic, skills and everything else a gamemaster could want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What have you got to loose? Its free!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
