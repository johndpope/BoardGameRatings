			<description>War has broken out in the otherwise peaceful Woodlands. Raccoons are attacking Skunks. Even the Squirrels and Foxes are invading the Badger's burrow. To insure their survival, players must choose their loyalties wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of Woodlands is to influence the war in your favour, and align yourself with the right Clans at the game's end. This is a done using a hand of 7 Warrior Cards. As the game progresses, players will shift their loyalties to suit their agenda. But only at the end will their final allegiances be revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect 1 Loyalty Cube for each successful attack or defence between their chosen clans. The player with the most Loyalty Cubes wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn players will be placing 1 or more cards from their hand, next to a chosen Burrow. These represent Warriors preparing to attack or defend a Burrow. Players will then draw back an equal number of cards from any of the 5 Burrows. This continues in a clockwise manner, until 2 of the 5 Burrows have been emptied of Warriors (there are no cards left to draw).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the war has ended (2 of the 5 burrows have been emptied of warriors), the most loyal players score points for their chosen clan's successes. Each player's loyalty is determined by the 7 cards in their hand. The player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
