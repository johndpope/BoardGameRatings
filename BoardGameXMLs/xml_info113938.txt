							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cooking With Class</name>
									
			<description>From the product page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food occupies a strange place in RPGs. On the one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s universal: everyone has to eat. (Except undead. And constructs. And elementals. And...okay, maybe not so universal.) On the other, almost no one actually pays attention to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However. just like minuscule portions of seasonings can change the flavor of an entire dish, creatively using food in your campaign can bring a whole new feel. Food shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the focus any more than you should make a dish mostly out of cinnamon, but a pinch of culinary flavor here and there can make the entire world come alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what this book is for. In Cooking with Class, you&amp;rsquo;ll find dozens of such seasonings you can throw in to your campaigns, from typical grains and vegetables to alcoholic drinks to how to eat things like purple worm and dragon (and the proper etiquette for doing so). While some could be the focus for an entire campaign&amp;mdash;such as a magic blight destroying the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s staple food supply&amp;mdash;most will simply add flavor and variety to your game. So take a pinch from here and a dash from there, sprinkle liberally with adventure, and see where they take you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooking with Class gives you loads of information about food, spices and alcohol, provides tons of food related adventure hooks, cooking methods and exotic ingredients, etiquette, new poisons, 3 prestige classes (Adamantine Chef, Synergistic Chef, and Toxicant), new feats, new magic items, magic drinks, new spells, sample menus for eating establishments, sample locations with backgrounds and npc's, and some new food themed monsters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
