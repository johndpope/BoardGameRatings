			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greatest Treasure in the Galaxy is a six-scene adventure of normal difficulty (60-90 minutes) for the Hero Kids RPG that uses the Hero Kids &amp;ndash; Space Heroes expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their summer camp in the Wasgren planet, the kids discover an evil conspiracy while exploring the planet's archeological excavations that will bring them across the galaxy and back to save the day. What is the secret of the stone colossus? What do the evil Gruuk have to do with it? Only a group of brave kids can find the Greatest Treasure in the Galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure includes printable quizzes, print-outs of the encounter maps, and character cards and stand-up minis for monsters, starships and mechs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure also contains a set of combat rules for space vehicles to be used when the heroes fight using starships and mechs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You set the price for this adventure; my suggestion is: get it for free, play it, and only if you like it spend your money. All the profit obtained through this adventure will go to a charity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, this adventure is available both in English and in Spanish!
