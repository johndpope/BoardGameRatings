							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Geschenke für den Radscha</name>
									
			<description>Taken from Board Game News&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can a Rajah Ever Have Too Many Gifts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, alas, for the Rajah's soul is empty and he requires physical objects to fill the void within himself. That's good news for you, though, as you have a chance to deliver what the Rajah thinks he needs to overcome the pain of being chosen last for the kickball team in tenth grade at Vidyapur High.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Geschenke f&amp;uuml;r den Radscha, you need to make your way through the desert to find a magic lamp and a flying carpet and get them in the hands of the Rajah before he cracks entirely and refuses to take showers anymore or eat anything that isn't liquified. Problem is, the roads that you use disappear in sandstorms, so you need to find new ways home &amp;ndash; while avoiding your fellow flying carpet finders naturally as they fancy themselves to be Freud as well...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
