			<description>Double Take is a charades game built for two, so to speak. Each round, time willing, two players will present clues for a half-dozen familiar phrases that all have something in common. A sample category, for example, is &amp;quot;Something's Wrong&amp;quot; with the words to be guessed being divided as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Play | Foul&lt;br/&gt;    In the Closet | Skeleton&lt;br/&gt;    Sheep | Black&lt;br/&gt;    Gun | Smoking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each clue giver acts out one side of the card, and since they're facing the guessers, the phrases will be acted out in left-to-right fashion (&amp;quot;Black Sheep&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Smoking Gun&amp;quot;, etc.) If someone guesses one side of the card, that player scores &amp;ndash; but the clue givers score only after both sides of a phrase have been guessed, so they need to work together &amp;ndash; but separately &amp;ndash; to make their clues clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
