			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is no ordinary crossword game...it's unpredictable, it's fast-paced, it's Stir 'em Up! Scoop the letters out of the bowl, but don't get attached - the die may force you to flip them or switch them. And once it's time for everyone to make their own crosswords, don't dawdle - you've got 30 seconds to use more letters than everyone else!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone has their letters, roll the die to stir things up! If the die shows a color, everyone must flip over those color tiles they have. If it lands on &amp;quot;right,&amp;quot; they take two tiles from the person  to their right. If it lands on &amp;quot;left,&amp;quot; they pass two tiles to the person to their left. Now ask them to&lt;br/&gt;try to form a word with the tiles. The word must have at least three letters (no&lt;br/&gt;one- or two-letter words). The person to announce a word gets the points for that word. Continue playing until all tiles have been used or you run out of room on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
