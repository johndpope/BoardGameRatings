			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of 100 different illusionist, or stage magic, supplies, items and equipment that could be found. These aren't actual magical items, but those used in modern illusionist tricks, whether stage or street magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These can be found by players in a number of places, from magical supply shops to theatres and stages where performances are carried out. Some of the items are useful, or even potentially dangerous, whilst others may be simply clutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;58. Lock Picks (A set of metal lock picks, possibly in a small wallet that can be easily hidden in clothing or about the person)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
