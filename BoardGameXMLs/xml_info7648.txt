			<description>This 1966 Tod Lansing creation bears no relation to the more widely known Championship Baseball marketed by Milton Bradley. It featuring two sets of 25 &amp;quot;chips&amp;quot; (thin counters) each of which represents a player on a 25 man roster for each team, plus offense and defense strategy cards. A cross-index of offense and defense cards determines play selection, and die rolls determine the exact results for each situation. Several different levels of play are offered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both teams sets of player &amp;quot;chips&amp;quot; are identical; i.e., each player has the same 25 players to build their respective lineups from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
