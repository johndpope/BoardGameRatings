			<description>Try to find Dutch places. It's a Dutch topography game.&lt;br/&gt;Every player starts with four chips. There's one card with a city name placed on the table. The player gets a card and places the city above or under the card on the table. If he/she thinks the city lies to the north of south of the city already on the table. Or the players places the card left (west) or right (east) on the table.&lt;br/&gt;Other players can correct the player who has played the card. The player who gave the correct answer gets a chip from the other player who placed the card.&lt;br/&gt;After 15 cards everyone counts his/her chips. The player with the most chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Op zoek naar Lutjebroek&amp;quot; is the Dutch version of Ausgerechnet Buxtehude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
