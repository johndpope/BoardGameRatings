							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Haunted Manor</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rising near the dangerous cliffs of Darkwood, the haunted manor is an old building made of dark rock and crimson rooftops. It is said a long-dead noble family who is whispered to have strong relationship with obscure deities of the past inhabited the manor. People of the nearby town say the noble family unearthed something from the ancient circle of monoliths, something that changed their life. No one dares to approach the manor even if a bold woodcutter named Isaac does live near the manor. Isaac is a strange man, though. Some people say that smugglers made their hideout beneath the manor, in the underground dock; this rumour would be confirmed by the strange dancing lights one can see during the night around and in the manor.&lt;br/&gt;The manor is said to be haunted because it lies empty. But, oddly, all its content is perfectly preserved. A thick layer of dust covers everything but no part of the building shows signs of damage. Anyone tried to claim the manor didn&amp;rsquo;t pass the first night inside the dark walls, fleeing on the following morning having the devil on his backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkwood Cliffs&lt;br/&gt;An area map depicting the manor, the Darkwood cliffs, the circle of monoliths and the woodcutter&amp;rsquo;s cottage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haunted Manor &amp;ndash; Ground floor&lt;br/&gt;The ground floor belongs to servants&amp;rsquo; apartments, guard barracks, kitchen and warehouses. A small courtyard featuring a well and a portico is located in the middle of the building. From the courtyard you can access to a small chapel and to the dining room, as well as to the stables. Four spiral staircases lead up to the first floor and down to the dungeon. A couple of marble-finished large staircases lead to the first floor from the foyer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haunted Manor &amp;ndash; First floor&lt;br/&gt;The first floor was the &amp;ldquo;noble&amp;rdquo; floor since it features nobles&amp;rsquo; apartments featuring rich, marble-covered bathrooms and lush furnishings. A wide hallway, flanked by grim-looking stone statues of strange men lead to nobles&amp;rsquo; wing as well as to library and dinner wing. The library remains absolutely untouched, with even some open books on the tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haunted Manor &amp;ndash; Dungeon&lt;br/&gt;Part of the dungeon is now a warehouse and a dock serving daring smugglers, who didn&amp;rsquo;t believe to the rumours floating around the manor. Still they didn&amp;rsquo;t dare to venture far into the dungeon or in the manor, using a small part of the dungeon as dock and storage. The rest of the dungeon features three crypts and some secret rooms where are hidden secrets too horrible to be revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woodcutter&amp;rsquo;s Cottage and Circle of Monoliths&lt;br/&gt;The woodcutter&amp;rsquo;s cottage is a large wooden building consisting of one large room and a wood storage. In the large room, featuring a fireplace, a working bench, tables and beds, dwells Isaac the woodcutter.&lt;br/&gt;The circle of monolith is an ancient monument of unknown origins, it features a large area encircled by ancient standing stones and a blood-spattered altar. The blood on the altar doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem too old though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
