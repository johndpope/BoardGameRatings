			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the dawn of the 23rd century technology had replaced the concept of Humanity with that of Sentient. The advances in nanotechnology, genetics and cybernetics populated the world with a variety of intelligent beings (AIs, robots, uplifted animals, synthetic humanoids, cyborgs) whose rights had to be recognized and regulated in order to avoid social unrest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the same time the consumption of material resources had finally forced the Earth Unity of Sentients (also known as EUS, a &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; world government that had replaced the UN) to a concrete effort in the colonization of&lt;br/&gt;the Solar System.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Ten centuries have passed since the collapse of the EUS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
