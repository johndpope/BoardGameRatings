			<description>From the title page of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory Alpha was the fabled &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; adventure: published in limited numbers, the original was lost and the GDW library did not receive a copy.  This text was made available through the efforts of archivists Paul Sanders and John Macek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short adventure was originally produced by Game Designers'&lt;br/&gt;Workshop as a tournament adventure played at GenCon and Origins in 1984.  A variant was produced for the T4 edition of Traveller (set in the early Imperium).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the description inside the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is a Traveller tournament for any number of teams, each team consisting of eight characters. It is a single session scored adventure, which means that the team of players which best handles the situation (as scored by the referee) are the winners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A synopsis of &amp;quot;The Situation&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your group of travellers have spent years searching for the Rift Passage, &amp;quot;a path of refueling points which crosses the Great Rift&amp;quot;.  This discovery could be worth a fortune but your ship has been having issues with it's power plant.  While looking for work to help pay for the repairs, the group encounters a well dressed patron who offers them a high paying mission.  The only catch is he insists on a memory wipe on completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
