			<description>Scr-e--ech has almost exactly the same board-play mechanic as Master Labyrinth but a slightly simpler supporting card play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of 16 non-movable square road tiles. There are 3 vertical and 3 horizontal rows for the 34 seperate, loose road tiles to be placed randomly. 33 tiles go onto the board leaving one extra tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tile has road section printed on them, straights, turns, and 3-way intersections.&lt;br/&gt;There are also 19 &amp;quot;Success Symbols&amp;quot; printed on 19 of the moving and immobile tiles corresponding to the symbols printed on the Success Deck cards.&lt;br/&gt;The Success cards have money rewards ranging from $100,000&lt;br/&gt;to $300,000, paid when the player reaches the proper symbol on the board as printed on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place their car tokens on the proper corner start space and draw a Success card to indicate their current destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to form a road path to their symbol by using the extra road tile to push one of the tile rows. This shifts the tiles so that the end tile comes off the&lt;br/&gt;board, to be used by the next player.&lt;br/&gt;A player who reaches his symbol is paid the Success Card amount and draws a new card. First player to amass $1,000,000 and return to his/her start point wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
