							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der Kleine Prinz: ZÃ¤hmt den Fuchs</name>
									
			<description>One in a series of children's games featuring the character &amp;quot;The Little Prince&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game the players have to capture or tame the fox, which they do by making their way down a path based on their ability to predict which of four 'locations' the fox will appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player acts as the fox and receives 12 cards comprising three each of four different locations - he shuffles these and places them in a pile face up in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players (up to three) represent the Little Prince and have to make their way down a path formed from 5 route cards.  Each of the route cards shows the four locations where the fox might be hiding.  The path is connected to a tile on which the fox playing piece is placed. They Prince players each have four tiles representing the four locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn they try and predict at which location the fox will appear by laying one of their tiles face up.  The fox player then turns over his top card and 'appears'.  If any of the other players have a match then they move down the path to the next location on the route showing that location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over twelve rounds players progress down the path towards&lt;br/&gt;the fox - the first player (if any) to reach the fox is the winner.  If no-one manages to reach the fox then it is the player that progressed the furthest down the path that is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
