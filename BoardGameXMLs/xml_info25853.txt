							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNO: New York Yankees</name>
									
			<description>A series of Uno variants based on assorted major league baseball teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: The Yankee Stadium Card. If a Draw 2 or Draw 4 card is played against you, play this card to block it. After discarding the Yankee Stadium card, designate a color of your choice and play resumes. This card can also be played at any time as a Wild card; you do not need to use it to block a Draw card. This card can also be played as your last card. The point value of the Yankee Stadium card is 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
