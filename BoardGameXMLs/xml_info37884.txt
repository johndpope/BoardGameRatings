							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Fighting System: ShadoWar</name>
									
			<description>In a history that never was, the greatest empires of Earth's past stand at the apex of their glory. In Rome, gladiators do battle in the Circus Maximus. The Pharaohs of the Nile raise great pyramid monuments to their own mortality. China builds its Forbidden City, and in India a young prince sits under a pipal tree and finds Enlightenment. In the north, the furious Vikings launch their long ships for another season of plunder and pillage, and beyond the Great Wall the Mongol clans gaze at the great Empires with greedy eyes. But behind the opulence and grandeur of the empires, beneath the petty border conflicts and barbaric raids, rages a hidden, secret war&amp;hellip; the ShadoWar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keepers of a forgotten truth, the Order of the Celestial Dawn devote themselves to bringing Enlightenment to all mankind. They are opposed by the Covenant of Twilight, a secret organization bent on using their power to rule all the empires of man. With guile, wisdom, treachery, and stealth they fight in the shadows for the destiny of humanity, turning the course of history towards their own ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this land of mystery and wonder walk men and women possessed of supernatural power and ability. With bodies and minds honed by constant practice, these warriors are the forefront of the ShadoWar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ShadoWar is a Customizable Card Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
