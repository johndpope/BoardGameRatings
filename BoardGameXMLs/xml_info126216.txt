			<description>Big Bag of Schwag is a set collecting game for 2 to 5 players. Players must try to complete their stash first while trying to thwart their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the familiar &amp;ldquo;draw one, play one&amp;rdquo; mechanic, players can work on building their stash as they play Weed card. Or go on the offense and use Action cards to thwart your opponent. Compete to get a full stash of 5 one strain, or collect one of each variety of the 6 strains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hassle each other with action cards like &amp;ldquo;Spider Mites&amp;rdquo; or try to benefit yourself with one of the Stoner cards. Play Events to change the rules of the game, at least for a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end the one with the big bag of schwag is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARNING: This game features adult themes and has a variant that should only be used after consulting your local use laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
