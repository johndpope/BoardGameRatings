			<description>From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haley's finally back at Hillsdael High after a New England vacation with her family. She's got a new haircut and some great new clothes, but the same problems-and the same people- have followed her. Queen bees Coco and Whitney want to groom her to become the next Coquette now that they've kicked Sasha to the curb. But is Haley ready to remake herself in Coco's image for a shot at being popular? Free spirited Sasha's dad is MIA and Sasha doesn't know how to deal. When she starts trying to cope in some seriously unhealty ways, can Haley help? Funny, artistic Irene is ready to head off to Sand Francisco with Haley. But mixing old friends with new ones can cause an unpredictable-sometimes explosive-chemical reaction. If Haley can't make new friends and keep the old- whom should she choose? Meanwhile, teacher's pets Annie and Dave are getting hot and heavy- believe it or not! But Haley's got a love interest of her own.... Should she tell him how she feels, or wait for him to approach her? So many possibilities! So many choices!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
