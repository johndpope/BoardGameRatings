							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crime Czar</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Finger in Every Pie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Augustus Shaw, AKA Crime Czar, became a social philanthropist after entire neighborhoods of Manhattan were destroyed in the 2004 battle between the Sentinels and the forces of Hecate. Under this guise, the put his own people into local businesses and construction to allow his criminal enterprises to flourish right under the noses of the NYPD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With most of the criminal operations running through Mordechai Graves, Augustus Shaw is able to &amp;ldquo;keep his hands clean,&amp;rdquo; and keep himself off the radar of most heroes and law enforcement officers. But he often comes into conflict with the local neighborhood heroes, such as the Jersey Devil, Recluse, and the White Hats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iconic Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting her for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
