			<description>In Chroń Przyrodę z Celnikami (Protect Nature with Customs Officers) the players command special groups of customs officers, whose task is to break the grid of smugglers involved in the illegal importation to Poland endangered animals and plants covered by CITES. You have to use your wits, sense of observation and vigilance to detect in the offices of customs as much as possible attempts of smuggling of illegal goods and thus discourage smugglers to their future business. Remember! On your effectiveness depends the fate of endangered animals and plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn the player takes an officer (represented by a cube) and puts it on the end of one of several lines (which number is determined by the number of players) leading to the customs office of specific kind. In each customs office there are 6 cargo. 2 of them are revealed and others are hidden. Each player know the content of one of the hidden stacks. The players form those lines to be the first to catch illegal cargo which grants the points to the them. After four rounds of play, the player who has the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
