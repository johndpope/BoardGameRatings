			<description>Player: Thomas turns the foul priest&amp;rsquo;s minions. (Rolls dice)&amp;hellip; Yes, they all run from my righteous presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: The evil priest just grins and laughs &amp;lsquo;Your puny attempts to stop me are like the nuisance of gnats.&amp;rsquo; He then uses his one Priestly Might to cancel your turning. (Reaches for dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: You can&amp;rsquo;t cancel my ability to turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Why not? Let me look this up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a familiar scene. A simple, logical progression of combat leads to the game grinding to a halt as books are opened and rules are referenced. This is particularly true when spell casters are involved. All those seemingly conflicting rules and minor variations can lead to a major headache and a stoppage of game play. Well, have no fear; your friends at Healing Fireball Publications have the answer to this problem in the form of the Combat Cards. The Combat Cards: Caster Tactics are a collection of index card-sized cards with a quick reference to some of the most common spell caster combat rules. From Countering spells, to turning, to the intricacies of touch attacks, they&amp;rsquo;re all right here. Never stop to search through a book again - with Combat Cards the rules are at your fingertips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of cards contains both a set of the color cards and the printer-friendly black and white set of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This set does not contain the rules for any specific spell; it is instead concerned with giving the overall game rules for magic-based combat maneuvers that often confuse players such as how to turn undead, counter spell, how bonuses stack and the use of the oft-underutilized touch attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Publisher Blurb]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
