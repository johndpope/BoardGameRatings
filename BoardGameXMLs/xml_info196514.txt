			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;News has just come in that Baron Greenback and his gang have spent the last fortnight building a 32k RAM DMOS ROM Electrically Erasable Mega Micro-Mouse hardware unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Good grief&amp;quot; cries DM. &amp;quot;Those initials stand for Robot Artificial Mechanism, Danger Mouse Operating System, Really 'Orrible Mouse!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Absolutely&amp;quot; said K, &amp;quot;An android Danger Mouse.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Trouble is, DM, the electrically controlled DMOS loading sequence has been initialised and the release is due at tea time!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can DM save the world by tea-time? Or is it Greenback's micro chips with everything?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it two for tea and no tea for two???! Find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Danger Mouse and Penfold in their first ever computer adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 exciting episodes spread over four screens of amazing animation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a series of three games featuring the popular cartoon character Danger Mouse, the World's Greatest Secret Agent, reluctantly assisted by his bungling sidekick Penfold in their struggle against the evil Baron Greenback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is split into three scenes. In the first, Danger Mouse must pilot the Mark III (his flying car) to the jungle where Greenback has his hideout. However the Baron has released a horde of robots to try and impede the White Wonder. Different robots can be repelled by playing the correct tune on the car's radio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second scene DM and Penfold must traverse the forest through swamps and trees, avoiding pumas, snakes and monkeys, while using crocodiles as stepping stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the final scene, Danger Mouse must use a 7th level Yoga-Hopping Trance to hop on one finger across a 4x4 grid of lit buttons. He must time his hops with the buttons that Greenback is pressing to extinguish a chain of green lights. If he is successful then the android clone is disabled!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
