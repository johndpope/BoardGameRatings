							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hidden Book Titles</name>
									
			<description>This title includes three series of rebus-puzzle type cards. The cards were large, about 7.25&amp;quot; x 4.5&amp;quot;, with a series of images on the front and a number on the back. The back of each card also included the copyright and publication date (October 1899).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The series were sold separately, with the Series A box including 30 cards and the Series B and C boxes holding only 15 each. Each box included a sheet with all the correct answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards were sold as a competitive party game, with guests vying to see who could name the most book titles correctly as the cards were displayed. For instance, the answer to a card showing two babies playing followed by a squashed capital A was Innocents Abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
