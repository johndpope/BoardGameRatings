			<description>Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is for players to follow the Exodus route (from Zona to Jerusalem) arriving the&lt;br/&gt;destination as soon as possible. The player arrives at Jerusalem first wins. When the player uses up the&lt;br/&gt;lifesaver lines and money, he/she must quit the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chevron Rules&lt;br/&gt;1. Different chevrons represent different places the player will land on. Each time the players should&lt;br/&gt;follow the words in the chevron to know how many chevrons they will move forward or backward.&lt;br/&gt;2. When the player lands on the question chevron, she/he must read out the question and answer&lt;br/&gt;them. According to the difficultly of the questions, the player can get different value of money.&lt;br/&gt;3. When the player lands on Angel chevron, then he/she can get two lifesaver cards&lt;br/&gt;4. When the player lands on Evil chevron, he/she will lose one lifesaver card&lt;br/&gt;General Rules&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player gets 40$ at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;2. Each player rolls the dice once; the player who rolls the highest goes first by rolling it again.&lt;br/&gt;3. Each time every player should follow the words in the chevron she/he lands on to know how many&lt;br/&gt;chevrons they will move forward or backward.&lt;br/&gt;4. When the player lands on a question chevron, he/she should answer the question. If the answer is&lt;br/&gt;right within one minute, the player can get cash. If answer is wrong or the player cannot answer it&lt;br/&gt;within one minute, he/she could choose to use his/her lifesaver cards if he/she has one. But&lt;br/&gt;lifesaver cards can only be used up to five times for each player. If the player has used up their&lt;br/&gt;lifesaver cards, he/she should quit the game. However, each time the players can choose not to&lt;br/&gt;answer the question by paying the same amount of dollar as they can get if the answer is right.&lt;br/&gt;5. If the player lands on the Angel chevron, he/she will get two lifesaver cards; if lands on the Evil&lt;br/&gt;chevron, he/she will lose one lifesaver card.&lt;br/&gt;6. If a player is leading by 10 chevrons, then he/she could challenge the opponent with his own&lt;br/&gt;question which is related to Bible. If the opponent wins the challenge, then he/she can move&lt;br/&gt;forward 2 steps. He/she has to back up three steps if he/she loses.&lt;br/&gt;7. The player reaches the destination first wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
