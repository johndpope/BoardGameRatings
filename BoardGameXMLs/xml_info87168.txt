For some, they are the advanced weapons created by companies like Armorcorp or Colt Springfield. For others, they are the magically-imbued objects that they create while intoning powerful forces in darkened mystical spaces.

To the Ashcroft Foundation, they are the children of arcanotechnology - the melding of science and the arcane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Aeon War.
