			<description>The World War:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without an exact translation this is an estimation of the actual rules.  The games main mechanic is jumping other pieces and is a game for 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side gets 30 pieces.  Alternatively each player puts one piece (name tag down) on an enemy land square.  Once all the pieces have been placed they are moved alternately either to an adjacent empty space or by jumping over an adjacent piece; multiple jumps can be made as long as empty spaces exist.  As each piece makes its first move it is turned upright so that the name shows.  If a player is able to get a piece to the city on the map that matches the name tag of the piece then he turns it back over to signify it no longer moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player can be the first to have only his units present in cities of his home country then the game ends and that player is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
