							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Army: The bloody card game</name>
									
			<description>The goal as the name suggests is to form the largest army of zombies as possible, attacking your enemies and &amp;quot;zombifying&amp;quot; them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, each player must pick a card in the package identified as HUMAN, this is an open card depicting their character to start the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, players are distributed a package of 7 ACTION cards each. These are the cards that will enable them to attack or defend themselves against their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zombie Army, the player that is attacked by a zombie is considered out after three strikes, same as Baseball.&lt;br/&gt;So in order to make a human become a zombie: &lt;br/&gt;Zombie attack: Strike one&lt;br/&gt;Neck, arm or leg bite: Strike two&lt;br/&gt;Human infected: Strike tree, you're dead&lt;br/&gt; In turn, clockwise, players must attack their opponents using strategy and luck in order to &amp;quot;zombify&amp;quot; the characters of their opponents and take possession of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who has the most HUMAN cards in their army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is extremely simple to play based on the principle of action reaction, it is &amp;quot;addictive&amp;quot;. It combines strategy, luck, scheming and friendship and it is easy to carry and play everywhere. No board game, no dice, no pieces, no calculation or complicated numbers, only cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
