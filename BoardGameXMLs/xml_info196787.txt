			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Found an Empire: Book Two&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Ponyfinder Campaign for a group of third level adventurers with all party sizes from 3 to 7 supported. This module contains enough material for a good number of normal length adventuring sessions and will allow your players to gain two levels as they play through it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gem Gnoll War continues from where events in The Unicornâ€™s Crown left off. You can play this module without playing the other one first but you will get the most out of it by playing them through in order. The Gem Gnolls have massed on the border and invasion is coming, our heroes have a party to play in thwarting the invasion and without them the Kingdom will suffer greatly. They will investigate crimes, hunt raiders, take on vital diplomatic missions and embark on a dangerous underground journey before their quest is done!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Found an Empire explores the world of Everglow just before the formation of the Pony Empire. Our heroes will see the kingdoms and tribes that came together to form the empire and maybe even experience that transformation themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
