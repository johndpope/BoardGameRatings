			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He stands upon the jutting corbel of a city gargoyle, gazing down upon the dark streets and alleyways below. His cape billows behind him, ethereal as the wind, while before his great muscular chest he folds his arms, biceps rippling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is his domain; the people who sleep below are his people. He feels a sense of duty, a sense of belonging. He is needed. His prowess, his strength and his super-human abilities are vital to the ebb and flow of the mean city streets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And beyond. His calling may take him to far flung parts of the world, to other countries, to the dense forests, the high mountains or even deep underground. There is no environment he cannot handle, no hardship he cannot shrug off. For he is one of the elite; a man evolved beyond mere men. The world has long required a hero. And now he is here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No stats are provided in this file, and no one ruleset is favoured. This is a generic module, designed to save the referee endless pre-session preparation without specific reference to any preexisting game system. For this reason we recommend you keep your game manual and any other core-rulebooks handy as the adventure unfolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
