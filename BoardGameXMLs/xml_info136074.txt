							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malice Blade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Janissaries are part knight, part monk, and part sorcerer. With their unparalleled powers over the mind and blade alike it is no wonder that they would produce powerful and exotic weaponry best suited for their unique form of combat and philosophy. Perhaps one of the most bizarre weapons crafted by the Janissaries warriors was a red crystal blade forged from purest emotional anger and hate known as the Malice Blade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasures of NeoExodus: Malice Blade is created for use with your NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting home gaming for the Pathfinder RPG. The Treasures of NeoExodus series focus on creating unique and interesting magical and mundane items that you can use in your NeoExodus home games that give you more a personal connection to the item. This PDF comes with a background and history of the Malice Blade, its special mundane and/or magical qualities plus magic item containing detailed information and blank versions of the cards. Everything you need to incorporate Malice Blade into your character&amp;rsquo;s background and your gaming sessions is here making them even more appealing, special and personal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
