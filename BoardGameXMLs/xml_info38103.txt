			<description>&amp;quot;Players are Therapists trying to cure their patients and themselves.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a square track with 13 spaces on a side. Each player has a set of pawns that move around the board, one of which represents the player's therapist and the rest of which represent the player's patients. A player can have a maximum of five patients at one time. The player attempts to cure patients by reducing the Neurosis Points score for each patient to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after exactly one hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Winning: The player with the most Total Victory Points (VP) wins. Gain 10 VP for each patient you cure. Lose 10 VP for each patient you fail.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
