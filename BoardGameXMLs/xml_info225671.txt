			<description>&amp;quot;Violent Storm (バイオレントストーム?) is a 1993 side-scrolling beat-'em-up for the arcades produced by Konami.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The 1990s, World War III has at last expired. The people are left to pick up the pieces and rebuild their civilizations. However, vicious gangs that prey on these defenseless citizens are obstructing the reconstruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main protagonists are Boris, Wade and Kyle, vigilantes who protect the feared and helpless. Their largest problem is the corrupt, incorrigible, ruthless and lethal gang known as &amp;quot;The Geld Gang&amp;quot;. They have commissioned every type of person imaginable. Purple-haired, leather-clad, chain-wielding, lead-pipe swinging, masked, martial art, orange-mohawked and men so strong and immune to pain they use manhole covers as shields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, when the trio is patrolling the streets, alert, ready and able to help those in need, they see a woman named Sheena (a friend of theirs) waving at them walking across the street out of a supermarket with groceries. A moment later, Lord Geld's right-hand man, Red Freddy, snatches her away while riding on his purple hog. Now, the three braves must save Sheena from the grips of Lord Geld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Violent Storm, up to three players can choose between Wade, Boris and Kyle, who have different fighting styles, speed and moves, some of which are hidden. Players must guide them through 7 different stages, in order of appearance: a declined town, a runaway train, in the taverns with trap doors, inside a metal furnacery, a botanic garden, a bay area near the sea and finally Lord Geld's museum. Along the way, if the players clash any enemy, they will wallop, sock, pommel, whip and slug against the players, sometimes with weapons like knives, lead pipes, bombs, bolts of electricity, spiked balls on chains, garbage cans, vise grips, molten metal and a myriad of other deadly armament.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Storm Violent Storm]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
