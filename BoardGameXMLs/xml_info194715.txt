							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Emoji Cards</name>
									
			<description>Four or more players divide into two teams, then lay out 40 emoji cards on the table. When it's your turn, you pull a clue card from the deck -- it could feature any category from &amp;quot;Blockbuster Movies&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Rock Stars and Legends&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Children's Books&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Animated TV.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have 90 seconds to use the emoji to get your teammates to guess as many of the five clues on your clue card as possible. While you can't talk or make noises, anything goes with the emoji cards -- move them around, point at different parts, combine them however you need. After your turn, tally up your points and replace the emoji you used with new ones from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
