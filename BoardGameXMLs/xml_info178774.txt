			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the new horror rule set by Solace Games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I first started playing the d6 system when West End Games first published their ever famous space setting going on thirty years ago and fell in love with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the rules are open content now I decided to use them in my first horror game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wanted to maintain the integrity of the rules so the basic rules from the d6 system are unchanged and used as they were originally printed but there is more added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new way of creating characters is introduced where you pick first your background, then educataion, your profession and finally any finishing bonuses. There are also a handful of new Advantages to pick from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spell and psionic section is much expanded using converted spells and psionics from the d20 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well a detailed sanity system, after all what would a horror setting be without the chance of losing your mind?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A handful of mosters are in the back of the book as well to get you started until I can publish a horror bestiary for everyone to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
