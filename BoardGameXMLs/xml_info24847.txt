			<description>Buzzword -- The Fastest Word Game Ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll out their letter dice, then take turns making words from the upturned letters.  The first player places the first word on a &amp;quot;start square&amp;quot; on the 13x13 board.  All subsequent words must use a letter from a word already on the board, or must extend or alter a word already on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have one minute to complete each move.  If time runs out before all the player's letters are in place, the turn is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until neither player can place any more dice, or until one player has used all of their dice.  That is the end of one round -- three rounds constitute a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before each round, players take turns selecting a &amp;quot;buzzword,&amp;quot; which is any four-letter word.  If during play, a player is able to make the buzzword, they get a 25-point bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
