							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Its Ravenous Light Craves All Things</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A blazing islet. The incandescent beacon which now rages atop its lighthouse is an unsetting sun throwing deep shadow for leagues and raising a wind which draws into its swirling haze the unsecured, the inquisitive and the opportunist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It presents core ideas and key numbers to fall back on, with general approaches that can be applied in other situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted islet as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including various arrivals, a weakened lighthouse, vessel and floor contents and a liminal material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The surrounding airs and waters could be detailed using Elaboration: Atmosphere &amp; Liquid, while the seafarers could be developed using Character: More or Less Promising Olde Worlde Adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
