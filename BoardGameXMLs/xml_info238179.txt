			<description>ULTRA is a 2-6 player dice and cards game in which players compete to be the last standing robot in the arena. The game is composed by 3 stages in which you have to build your very own robot, build the arena and filled with traps and last but not least....fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you have to choose at least one of three available actions: move, attack or push your enemy against walls and traps to deal damages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes from 30 to 40 minutes per game, with simple and easy to learn rules. ULTRA is a fast-paced game and was designed primarily as a party game that can be enjoyed both from non-boardgames players and hardcore players (we all need a party game in our library!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ULTRA can be played as a single match or, if you have multiple players, tournaments can be arranged!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike others Robot/Wargaming boardgames ULTRA has unique features that you won't see in other boardgames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We made up a tailored draft mode that allows you to build your robot relying not only in lucky but also in strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to build your own Arena and fill it with different traps, each game won't be the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead players can still play! As a dead player you can perform one out of three actions to change the course of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As mentioned before, after building you robot through the draft, you have to build the arena by just placing the tiles on table following just one simple rule: each tile has to be connected with at least two squares. Then traps will be randomly picked up and placed by each player wherever they want. Now it's time for players to put the robots into the arena and that's it! You're ready to fight!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn you have to perform at least 1 action from 3 available: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Attack: Use your main weapon to deal damage to the enemies by rolling dice &lt;br/&gt;     Move: Use your movement points to move around the arena &lt;br/&gt;     Push: Use your movement points to push enemies against walls or move them into traps. If you kill an enemy you will receive 1 Gear Point but, if you have all your Gear Points, you won't over-exceed them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're dead? Don't leave! Because you can still have a role in the game! As a &amp;quot;dead player&amp;quot; you have to perform 1 action between moving a trap to a free square in the arena or swapping a trap in the arena with another one not in the arena. Revenge time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy, simple and funny! That's it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
