			<description>Do you like duck! duck! GO! but you have younger children that love the ducks? duck! duck! GO! Junior is a 16-card expansion for the beloved rubber-ducky racing game. These cards are an alternative deck for use with younger players. The cards ease players into the game by including numbers instead of hex space symbols. As players become used to the game, they can gradually switch to increasingly complex hex space cards. The duck! duck! GO! Junior deck is a great way to introduce players to your favorite rubber ducky game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
