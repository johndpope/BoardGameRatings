			<description>Treacherous is a sci-western hidden identity game taking 2-7 players into a dangerous saloon where the law ends at the swinging doors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Treacherous, players compete to have either the most money after the final round or to be the last player still at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each round, the first player will ante to the pot. Then, in clockwise order, each player will use either a card action and a standard action OR if you're willing to gamble a little of your gems, 2 standard actions. Standard actions allow the player to draw new Grifters or Lady Luck cards, or take income in the form of a gem from the bank. Card actions are found not only on the Grifters, but also the Lady Luck cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have a hand that consists of three Lady Luck cards and 1 Grifter card. The grifter is 1 of 7 vile characters from across the universe that you will use to guide you, lie about, or pay to exchange. The Lady Luck cards are poker style cards with abilities of their own and if you're lucky, could win a poker game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dismissed when they lose a challenge. Once dismissed, they may pay gems to challenge the dismissing player to a duel. If they challenge and win, they are back in the game. If they challenge and lose, they are eliminated. They play rounds equal to the number of players plus two OR until only one player remains. If they make it to the end, the active players play poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, none of this truly matters to the criminals that wander into this saloon. LIE all you want. Just don't get caught! Or...get caught and challenge your accuser to a duel in the street to win your way back into the game and unlock an amazing Vengeance ability that could turn the tide of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So GAMBLE, CHEAT, DUEL, DISTRACT, or TELL THE TRUTH...Just WIN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
