			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore Barsoom during the early days of John Carter&amp;rsquo;s arrival, his life among the Tharks, and his early exploits before all Barsoom knew of his legend. Focused on the characters, places, and important events of A Princess of Mars and the status quo on Barsoom at the time of Carter&amp;rsquo;s arrival, this sourcebook also provides expanded discussion and character background options for playing Earthborn and Green Martian characters. Includes advice on running both canonical and alternate versions of the Carter stories set during this period, using Burroughs&amp;rsquo; work itself as a roadmap for designing and playing your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
