			<description>Based on the Australian TV series, this video game for the Super NES console was released in the U.S. market by Malibu Games in April 1994 (although some sources list December 1993). A Mega Drive version was also planned but never released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Description: Do you have the guts to step into the shoes of Fugitive Retrieval Officer, Darien Lambert? Travel from the future to today's criminal underworld in an attempt to capture some smart thugs from the 22nd Century. Of course, your weapons and fighting skills will be years ahead of their time, but then so will your enemies. Taking place in our nation's capital, the game sends you out on a massive hunt for scientist Mordicai Sahmbi, an assassin known as Sepp Dietrich, and a host of other bad dudes. Intelligent enemies, awesome combat maneuvers, and richly varied missions mark this epic chase through the centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Time Trax&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
