			<description>Army of Orkness: A 2-Bit Tower Defense Card Game (2nd Edition) is a lighthearted fantasy themed cooperative tower defense card games for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Army of Orkness: A 2-Bit Tower Defense Card Game (2nd Edition), players must work together to defend the castle against the relentless onslaught of the invading Orc horde. To do that, the active player must roll dice and determine what kind of actions to take during the turn: 1) buy towers and strategically place them along the path, 2) attack the Orcs from an existing tower, or 3)discard a die and reroll all of the remaining dice. In addition to the Orcs, players must also deal with constantly cycled Event Cards that can help them or hinder them during the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either: 1) Wave 5 of the Orc assault is completed. If the Castle has at least 1 Life remaining, the players win, or 2) the Castle takes damage greater than or equal to its Life and is destroyed, in which case the Orcs win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
