							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BPR-8 Binary Propellant Rifle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the archives of the BlackHammer Project comes the new state of the art in projectile weapon systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early years of Progress Level 6, the first successful personal weapon system using binary propellant technology was developed in a partnership between Dorland Chemicals and SIGarms. The BPR-8 uses a unique 8mm round and a binary propellant injection system in order to fulfill nearly any role where a rifle could be required, from silent operations and varmint hunting, to fire suppression and light antimaterial rifle roles. One of the most versatile weapons in the history of ballistic weapons, the BPR-8 can be used in just about any tactical role, and is easily adjusted in the field as required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This five-page PDF (plus cover and OGL)describes the technology behind the BPR-8 weapon system as well as the firearms themselves, from the BPR-8 rifle as well as sniper and carbine variants, to the BPR-8MP machine pistol and automatic pistol models. All models are provided with full descriptions and d20 stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
