			<description>The Mayor of Chicago is hosting the event of the year at the Hard Knock Caf&amp;eacute;. Everyone who is anyone will be there and you don't want to miss out. The year is 1926 and the times are roaring! It is not unusual that crime runs rapid in this section of the city, but with all the big names attending, security is bound to be very tight. You decide this is as good a time as any to check out the infamous Hard Knock Caf&amp;eacute;. However, be prepared to experience all that there is to be had in the dark underworld of Speakeasy Street , including a murder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
