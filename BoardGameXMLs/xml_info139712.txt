			<description>Far from Home is a SCIFI board game where two space crews vie for survival. Only the destruction of the enemy capital ship will ensure the future of your crew.  Out thinking your enemy and the successful allocation of your resources are your only means of success. The timely deployment and upgrading of your ships may provide a necessary advantage but watch out, your enemy will do whatever it takes to survive. You do have an ace up your sleeve, the powerful Capital Laser. But its success is dependent on a roll of the die and your opponent&amp;rsquo;s resolve to shield it. Do you have what it takes to survive far from home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far from Home is a Print and Play SCIFI wargame for an audience looking to scratch  the SCIFI wargame itch in under an hour.&lt;br/&gt;The game itself prints on two 8 1/2 x 11 sheets of paper: 1 sheet with Map and the other sheet with ships-double sided, required tokens, and a tech tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pennies are used for action points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule book is 5 pages long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
