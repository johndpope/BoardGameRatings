			<description>This is a Swedish racing game, endorsed by the former F1-driver Reine Wisell. The race track is filled with squares, but you drive on the crossed line points. The steering mechanism is a simple grid, on which you move your marker according to where you want the car to be after your next move. You can have up to four players racing or you can race against a clock, that counts your number of moves.&lt;br/&gt;The game contains the rules, one race track, 4 cars (plus 4 extras), 4 markers to the gearbox/throttle, clock hands and some hay barriers to change courses or make a chicane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
