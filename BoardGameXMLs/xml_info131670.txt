			<description>A children's game in which judging length and shape by touch is the central element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game idea: A long time ago Schnuffel, the dog, and his friends hid many bones in the garden. Now they want to dig them up again but not any old bones, it has to be specific ones. The bone has to be the right shape and size. And the dogs are chasing away each other too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game: To find the correct wooden bone by touch as quickly as possible in order to collect the most bone cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it is played: The board shows a circular path consisting of single-colour spaces and multi-coloured dog-house spaces. Arrows next to the spaces show the direction in which the dogs move. Each player has a dog-shaped player piece. A colour die determines movement. The active player puts his/her dog on the next empty space of that colour. If he/she lands on a dog-house space, he/she is allowed to search for bones. This means that he/she puts his/her hand into the bag with the wooden bones and tries to find the bone that is shown on the top bone card. While he/she is trying to identify the correct bone by touch, the other players continue taking turns rolling the die and moving their dogs. As soon as the active player thinks he/she has found the correct bone, he/she shouts &amp;quot;Stop!&amp;quot; and the other players stop rolling. The chosen bone is compared to the one on the card. If they match, the active player gets to keep the card. The wooden bone is returned to the bag. Then the active player starts searching for the next bone. His/her turn ends as soon as either one of the other players lands on a dog-house space, or he/she chooses the wrong bone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of game: The game ends when all the bone cards have been used up. The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;- game board&lt;br/&gt;- 4 dog-shaped wooden player pieces&lt;br/&gt;- 9 wooden bones (different lengths, round piece on one end, or on both, or none)&lt;br/&gt;- 18 bone cards (showing the different lengths and shapes)&lt;br/&gt;- color die&lt;br/&gt;- cloth bag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
