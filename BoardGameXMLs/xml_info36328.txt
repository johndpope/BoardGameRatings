			<description>From the Firefight Games website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mamontov&amp;rsquo;s offensive was launched by Denikin on August 10, 1919, and quickly broke through the front in the vicinity of Novokhopersk creating a serious threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consisted primarily of the 4th Don Cavalry Corps (8500 Cavalry), 3000 infantry, although fully supported with a few tanks, armor cars, and aircraft. Over 300 vehicles provided various duties, as well. The chosen sector for the attack lay between the Red 8th and 9th Armies and was not covered well&amp;mdash;it was very porous. The Red 36th and 40th divisions held the 100 km section of the line (with gaping holes where 40km was not covered) through which Mamontov's corps&amp;rsquo; passed. Mamontov used air reconnaissance to find a sector where his cavalry could slip through without serious opposition to avoid contact with Bolshevik units and struck deep into the Red rear with orders to wreck the rail lines and destroy military stores as they advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mamontov Offensive ripped through the Red lines and at lightening speed made incredible advances into the rear of the Red beast- 125 miles! Both Trotsky and Lenin were very concerned about the White advance and the ineptness of their own troops, many of which defected to Mamontov at Tambov, a supply center. Like the panzers of WW2, the White cavalry seemed unstoppable. So much so, that Red air units were sent flying to find them and attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all White attacks, it too, had begun well. However, Mamontov's men were not professionals, they more like mercenaries and were easily diverted to looting, mayhem and rape, which turned the local population against them. By Sept 10, many of his men had simply went home with the loot and soon he found himself and those that remained in a &amp;quot;situation&amp;quot; at Voronezh nearly surrounded as Red troops had finally gathered. Denikin ordered his Kuban Corps to attack from the south to divert Red divisions against Mamontov, and for the next week, a bitter battle ensued with Mamomtov trying to breakout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a 22x17&amp;quot; map, 280 counters, rules. Scale is 3 days to a turn, 3-4 miles a hex, brigades. A very fast moving game as time plays against the Whites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Rules are split between an 11-page &amp;quot;Russian Civil War Series' core rulebook (actually 11 loose sheets printed single-sided), and a 5-page double sided Rampage special rules book (joined by a single staple). Counters are on a single sheet of paper and must be mounted &amp;amp; cut. The map is on two 11x17&amp;quot; sheets and must be joined together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
