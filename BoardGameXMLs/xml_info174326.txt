							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business â€“ Confederate Rebellion Faction Bundle</name>
									
			<description>Wild West Exodus is a table top miniatures game set in a sci-fi filled 1800's America. Technology and greed rule the old west. Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business introduces 4 new factions to the game; The Confederate Rebellion, Dark Nation, Golden Army, and The Watchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About The Confederate Rebellion:&lt;br/&gt;The Confederate Rebellion army has seen death and destruction ravage their states.  Beaten by the Union during the Civil War, the leaders of the Confederate States of America have abolished slavery and joined forces with all men and women of the South.  Their fight against a stronger and more advanced enemy has ignited a strong love of state and government.  The CSA generals fight side by side with their men and want nothing but the complete destruction of the Union army.  They use surprise assaults and gorilla warfare to even the odds against much more powerful foes.  Their men and women are supplied by Dr. Carpathian Industries allowing access to deadly and corrupt weapons.  Rumors of Voodoo magic and the undead fighting alongside Rebel troops have been whispered about for years.&lt;br/&gt;Wild West Exodus is a Sci-Fi Wild West Miniatures Game set in an alternate history wild west. Strange technologies corrupt the land and death lurks at every corner. RJ-1027, the infamous power source created by Dr. Burson Carpathian is the catalyst behind the constantly escalating arms race between the factions that make up Wild West Exodus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Wild West Exodus:&lt;br/&gt;Wild West Exodus is a miniatures game played by 2 to 4 players in control of the faction of their choice.  In the world of WWX, every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  The game mechanics and rule set feature exciting game play from the first dice roll.  Each player will be allowed to field a posse of 6 to 60 models or more.  The WWX rules have been designed to allow for scaling of the game to high or low model counts without causing rules issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool.  The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice.  Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn.  The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Halo that each model possesses creates an area of assault around the miniature allowing for fast and deadly close combat.  This helps move the game along quickly and gives each fight a more cinematic feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild West Exodus also benefits from an alternating 1-3 model activation system.  This system lets both players choose the most strategic way of advancing their characters across the battle field.  This means that you never have to wait more than a minute or two before taking control of your own posse for your next activation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each posse consists of a structured army list.  All factions will have 1 Boss model, 0 to 4 Underboss models, 0 to 8 Sidekick models, and an endless amount of Hired Hands.  Heavy and Light Support vehicles also make up an army list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This really gives the gamer the option to field a force led by one mighty general commanding a horde of troops or the complete opposite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some gamers may choose to load up on skilled Sidekicks and Underbosses or go heavy on Hired Hands for a true horde army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter what option you take, the world of Wild West Exodus will engulf you in fun and excitement from your very first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
