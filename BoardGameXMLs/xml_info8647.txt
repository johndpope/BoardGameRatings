			<description>In this game players travel around the board, which represents all the letters of the alphabet, collecting letters for the word card they have selected. The first player to fill their word card and make it back home wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game teaches letter recognition but does not require any reading. It is also simple enough for young children to play by themselves after a couple of times. Lots of fun for the kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
