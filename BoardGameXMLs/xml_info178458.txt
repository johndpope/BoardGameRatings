			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dance on the Wild Side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal companions. They&amp;rsquo;re practically characters in their own right, and a surprisingly large number of classes have access to them, but somehow, through a mix of being difficult to roleplay and having much less options for customization, they always seem to wind up forgotten in the background. Don&amp;rsquo;t let this fate happen to your animal companion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a variety of new options for customizing animal companions and making them more relevant in your game. First, the book presents several new classes specifically for animal companions, allowing you to choose what type of animal companion you want: from the ferocious fearsome beast, to the implacable stalwart sentinel. Those looking for a less combat-inclined animal companion might look to the sage counselor&amp;mdash;which responds particularly well to its handler&amp;rsquo;s magic&amp;mdash;or the sly varmint, which allows the animal companion to serve the utility role of a rogue, to a lesser extent. The noble steed is perfect for paladins and cavaliers, and the spirit guide reinforces a cleric or inquisitor&amp;rsquo;s zeal and moral views.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond this, there are a wide variety of new feats and spells that feature animal companions, including several feats made specifically for animals, and a collection of teamwork feats for animal companions and their handlers, helping the two to fight in sync. Finally, a brief section discusses some of the common pitfalls and difficulties of roleplaying an animal companion, and some ways to combat them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your animal companion deserves to be just as special and customized as the character that it comes with. Don&amp;rsquo;t just settle for the defaults. Pick up this book, and never look at animal companions the same way again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
