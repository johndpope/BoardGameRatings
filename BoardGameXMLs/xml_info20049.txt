							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Generic Game</name>
									
			<description>Remember generic foods from the eighties? These foods were cheaper alternatives to brand name goods but quality was distinctly inferior. Well, those characteristics apply to The Generic Game. It is packaged in a white box with two green and black stripes with the word &amp;quot;GAME&amp;quot; in large letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a pawn. Each pawn begins at start. Each player chooses one of three paths to travel. On your turn you roll the die, move the pawn and preform the act on the space your pawn lands. The first to land on the square that says &amp;quot;You Win&amp;quot; is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a money back guarantee: &amp;quot;If for any reason you are not satisfied with your Generic Game, just return it to your closet and we will cheerfully keep your money.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
