							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hipsters: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Can you become the biggest hipster? Collect cappuccinos, canvas bags, and LPs while avoiding mainstream items to prove your Cred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is uniquely assigned two traits (from the pool of Academic, Activist, Elitist, or Grungeling) and is dealt a hand of eight items. An item has a trait - one of the above four or the detestable Mainstream. In turn order, each player selects a card from that hand to play. A player can play the card on himself, which will give him positive score if it matches one of his traits and negative score otherwise. If the player already has a negative scoring card, he can play a negative scoring card on another player. After each player has chosen played one card, everyone rotates hands to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each trait has one card of each of ten point values. If a card is played on a player who already has a card of that value, the new one covers and replaces the old card. At the end of the game, each player totals their score and adds or subtracts points for a run of at least two cards of the same color - scoring or losing a point for every card in the run, depending on whether that color is positive or negative for the player. Highest total score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
