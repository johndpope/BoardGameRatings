			<description>Straits is a Chess-like game for two, played on a 9 x 11 hourglass-shaped grid of checkered squares.  Each player has nineteen pieces of his own color: one Flag-ship, 7 Turret-ships, 8 Torpedo boats, and 3 Gun-boats.  Their rules of movement are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;)Flag-ship - it moves and captures like a Queen in Chess, but it cannot be captured and must not move into check or remain in check.&lt;br/&gt;)Turret-ship - it moves and captures like a Rook in Chess.&lt;br/&gt;)Torpedo boat - it moves and captures like a Bishop in Chess, and is consequently bound to squares of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;)Gun-boat - it moves one square in any direction, but can capture only diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move his Flag-ship to the board's central square or who checkmates the Flag-ship of his opponent wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
