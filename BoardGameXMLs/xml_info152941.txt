			<description>Every player gets a car and has to get from the starting space at the gas station to his garage. On the way the players have to mind the traffic rules. On spaces with a blue or black disk, the player has to draw a card and must follow its instructions. The first player to reach his garage wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has to be been published in 1952 or early 1953 because the logo &amp;quot;BV Aral&amp;quot; was first used in 1952 and the traffic signs were revised in 1953. &amp;quot;Halt, Vorfahrt auf der Hauptstra&amp;szlig;e beachten&amp;quot; was changed to &amp;quot;Halt, Vorfahrt achten&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
