			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine the children in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. They visited a magical land, fought battles alongside talking animals and centaurs and won a war against a powerful and evil enemy. Then they returned home, no-one would believe them and they were back to war time rations and maths homework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What does that feel like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you live with the memories of what you saw?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How did Edmund deal with the fact that Aslan was tortured and killed for him? How did Susan and Lucy deal with watching Aslan die, even knowing he was later resurrected?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did Edmund drown his sorrows in alcohol and drugs, did Lucy vent her repressed rage by being violent towards her loving husband?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did they end up in therapy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
