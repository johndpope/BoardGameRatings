							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peninsula: North Korea Crisis</name>
									
			<description>Peninsula is a 2-player asymmetrical strategy card game capturing the tension of the 2017 North Korea Crisis. One player controls North Korea, the other the United States. As the crisis unfolds, players will try to use a combination of diplomacy and military posturing in a bid to claim victory without the situation devolving into a conflict that could leave both sides in ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to reduce their opponent's resolve and control regional tension by playing diplomacy and progress cards. When tension rises above certain levels, players receive more progress cards and the crisis develops, yet these cards are the most powerful way to reduce opposition resolve. Each decision could have far-reaching consequences and the challenge is to claim victory in the crisis without both sides destroying each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
