							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conquest of Arthenia</name>
									
			<description>A efficiency engine/resource management collectible card game that is so similar to Magic: the Gathering that rather then providing a description of the game on it's own merits the pubslisher just lists how it's  different from other CCGs (i.e. Magic):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is Conquest Different From Other CCGs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Faster pace. With 2 resources acquired per term (most every other CCG is 1) plus the ability to barter 1 resource and acquire a third resource each term, every term is exciting and brings new twists into the fray. Never suffer through another, &amp;quot;Draw a land. My turn is over&amp;quot; term again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Multi-region system. With 4 location regions per commander and a central battlefield region, you have far more options and therefore strategy is kicker. Like in a game of chess, in Conquest you need to think about positioning for your units. In most card games, it's simply your army vs. your opponent's army, 2 regions, and whether to attack or defend is a very simple matter of arithmetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Various strategies to pursue. Because locations and upgrades, commanders' sources of income, are vulnerable to attack and destruction, commanders have more options for how to seek a victory--a straight out offensive on the enemy domain to flat-out win or a more subtle wearing down of the opponent's income. Also, with 2 types of income (gold and mana), you can try to isolate one of these sources to cripple the opponent's army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
