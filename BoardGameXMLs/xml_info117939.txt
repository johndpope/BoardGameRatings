			<description>Paper-and-pencil game where from 2 to 4 players must score the most possible points by filling the 16 central spaces of an 8x8 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts from a corner of the board and marks with their own symbol (dot, circle, square or cross) a square two or three spaces away in a straight vertical or horizontal line from the square previously marked; a square can be marked by all players. The distance from one marked square to the next has got to be two squares on one turn, three in the next one, then two squares again, then three and so on (the player can choose which value goes first). A player can't land on a square already marked with their symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the 16 central squares of the board have been ticked. Players score for the central squares they have ticked: each square brings as many points as different symbols have been marked on the square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
