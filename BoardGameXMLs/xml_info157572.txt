			<description>Serfs &amp;amp; Soldiers requires you to oversee your Serfs in the exploration and collection of resources in the surrounding land, and command your Soldiers in guarding against foreign attack as well as exploiting the land of your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose from 3 alternate paths to victory: Hoard all the gold in the land, build the ultimate fortress, or conquer your opponent's land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolutely no dice or event cards are used in the playing of this game! The luck is in the discovery of resources, which will change every time you play! After the resources are discovered, the win is determined by strategic skill in maneuvering your Serfs &amp;amp; Soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiles are placed upside down on the map.  Players send their serfs out to explore the tiles.  They will find resources, events, and helpful discoveries.  Players put their serf to work collecting resources from the map in order to build more serfs, soldiers that can attack your opponent's units or control their resources, or fortress buildings that give unique play bonuses and protect your land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
