			<description>In this dexterity game for children, players help the squirrel make his way up the tree without losing the nut he just found. Using the two strings to lead the squirrel in the right direction, players must be careful because there are holes in the tree which make things tricky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who manages to get the squirrel and his nut through the tree without dropping the nut through any of the holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.bestqualitytoys.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.bestqualitytoys.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;The little squirrel has found a delicious nut.
