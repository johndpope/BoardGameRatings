			<description>Dodgem is a simple abstract strategy game invented by Colin Vout and described in the book Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays. It is played on an n&amp;times;n board with n-1 cars for each player&amp;mdash;two cars each on a 3&amp;times;3 board is enough for an interesting game, but larger sizes are also possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is initially set up with n-1 blue cars along the left edge and n-1 red cars along the bottom edge, the bottom left square remaining empty. Turns alternate: player 1 (&amp;quot;Left&amp;quot;)'s turn is to move any one of the blue cars one space forwards (right) or sideways (up or down). Player 2 (&amp;quot;Right&amp;quot;)'s turn is to move any one of the red cars one space forwards (up) or sideways (left or right).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cars may not move onto occupied spaces. They may leave the board, but only by a forward move. A car which leaves the board is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who first has no legal move on their turn because all their cars are either off the board or blocked in by their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgem&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
