			<description>From the Pulisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Way Inn travelers! Let the inn&amp;rsquo;s renowned stew satisfy your hunger and its red-ruby wine quench your thirst. If your horse needs iron for its hooves, you can go straight to the smith and to the stables. Instead if you need equipment head to the emporium, just right to the inn. For any trouble you can meet in this place, you can knock at the door of the guardpost where some guards will hear you. The Way Inn is a small complex rose around a major caravan route; it includes a very large inn, which can house dozens of travelers, a well-furnished emporium, a smith and stables, a guardpost and a large square to accommodate the caravans for the night. The Way Inn could be the backstage for many adventures, here are some hints to use the Way Inn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     While resting in a room of the inn the PCs hear a bustling sound downstairs; a high elf ambassador is complaining loudly with the owner of the inn. The following morning the owner is found dead and the ambassador disappeared, only a strange, shining object shaped like a small bear is found on the murder place.&lt;br/&gt;     The PC arrive at the Way Inn and found all the guards and the other inhabitants of the Inn besieging the smith, calling him monster and aberration and asking for his immediate death. The smith is barred inside his shop and menacing all of the people with his heavy crossbow. Actually all the inhabitants of the way inn have been infected with werewolf disease, except for the smith. If the PCs help the watchmen to capture the smith they will be rewarded during the night which will be, of course, a full moon night.&lt;br/&gt;     When the PCs arrive at the inn escorting a caravan they find, in the middle of the caravans&amp;rsquo; square, a gigantic troll who is challenging a stout, bearded, woodcutter. Many people, including other escorts, are betting upon the fight. In the meantime a band of thieves, obviously allied with the troll, are stealing goods from the caravans&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
