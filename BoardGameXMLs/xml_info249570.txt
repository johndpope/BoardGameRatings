			<description>Fair Play is a card game played in two phases. First, the game chips are distributed evenly and given the cards in turn. In this case, a hidden stack is formed. The dealer may now decide whether he wants to play with his cards or takes the covert pile. If he keeps his cards, the other players are allowed to bid on the face-down stack. The highest bid is placed in the middle of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase, the game chips are then distributed in the upper part of the playing area. These are the fields labeled &amp;quot;Joker&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Queen of Spades and Jack of Diamonds&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sequent of 3&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;10 of Diamonds and 2 of Spades&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Poker&amp;quot;. If a combination does not exist, the chips remain for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase, the remaining cards are placed in ascending order starting with the smallest. If one of the cards is placed on the edge of the lower part, the player receives all chips in this field. If a player manages to discard all his cards, he receives the chips in the middle of the board and as many chips as any other player has left in his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then begin a new round of play, as described at the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
