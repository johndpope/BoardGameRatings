			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muchi Muchi Pork! is a 2007 shoot-em-up by Cave, programmed by ex-Raizing employee Yagawa. It has many features typical to the games Yagawa made while he was with Raizing, including large hitboxes; large, elongated bullets; multiple shot types on every character; and a &amp;quot;dynamic difficulty&amp;quot; system that causes the game to become more difficult if the player does not die for a long period, and causes the game to become easier if the player does die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
