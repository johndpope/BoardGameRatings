			<description>Merchants of Medieval Europe&lt;br/&gt;Game by Alex Fiks; Art Design by Daniel Chou; Published by CHOU! Games; Ages 12+; Players 3-6; Game Time 45-120 min.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 180 good crate cards, 6 Pawns, 6 quarter mats, 54 poker cards, 18 slider clips, 8 colored discs, 1 Manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Become a merchant traveling across a section of Western Europe. Leave your family and home with 5 coin in your pocket and try to make a living buying and selling goods for the best price at the whims of the fluctuating market. During your travels one thing becomes clear: the road to success is laden with risk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buy silk, wine, spice and more all from historically accurate locations. Borrow funds from the Merchant Bank of Europe and accept contracts from wealthy nobles to find and deliver prized goods. Stake your family's livelihood on one big deal or diversify your goods!&lt;br/&gt; Will you build a merchant house that will last for eternity, admired by princes and princesses while your merchant rivals suffer in silence surrounded by pestilence and disease for generations to come?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;A Round&lt;br/&gt;Every round has two phases. Phases are linear. A round ends when every player has taken a turn. &lt;br/&gt;Market Phase&lt;br/&gt;1.    The first player flips a market card and places it on top of the market discard deck.&lt;br/&gt;2.    Players adjust the market good trackers to their new values dictated by the drawn market card.&lt;br/&gt;Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;1.    The first player begins their turn and takes up to four actions.&lt;br/&gt;2.    Play continues clockwise until every player completes their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Turn&lt;br/&gt;A player can take up to four actions per turn in any order and can repeat an action any number of times until they run out of actions.&lt;br/&gt;A.    Move their token: A player can move their token from a region to an adjacent region. Their token can be upgraded to move &lt;br/&gt;    farther for a one-time fee.&lt;br/&gt;B.    Accept a Contract: A player can accept a contract by drawing two cards and choosing one from the top of the contract deck. Its details can be kept secret or made public. Contracts can&amp;rsquo;t be discarded until completed.&lt;br/&gt;C.    Buy: A player can buy as many goods as they can afford     from the resources stockpile, so long as they are in a region     that sells the desired good and the good is in stock. Purchased goods are placed on the player&amp;rsquo;s cart/wagon mat.&lt;br/&gt;D.    Sell / Fulfill a Contract: From any region, a player can sell any number of goods back to the stockpile for their current market value as dictated by the Perimeter Market. Alternatively, they can fulfill a contract by selling a designated number of goods to a designated region, according to the contract card, at their current value plus a bonus as indicated by the contract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the following decisions do not expend an action and can be done during a player's turn at any time:&lt;br/&gt;1.    Upgrading from a cart to a wagon.&lt;br/&gt;2.    Incurring or paying back bank debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
