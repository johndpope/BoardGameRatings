							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Green Beret</name>
									
			<description>Green Beret is a game for two players simulating the military situation in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in 1964-65. Viet Cong (VC) guerillas and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) regulars faced off against the poorly motivated and unprepared Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). and Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (CIDG): units of irregular light infantry raised, trained, and advised by US Special Forces A-Teams - the Green Berets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many areas, these forces were all that stood in the way of the Communist forces attempting to cut Vietnam in half. The VC player attempts to infiltrate supplies through to the coast, gain control of the population, and destroy CIDG units were possible. The Free World player attempts to stop this by detecting, interdicting, and destroying VC and NVA units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2001 edition:&lt;br/&gt;Card and counter game played on an abstracted map of the Vietnamese highlands made of 9 cards. The game comes with 60 color markers, 100 black &amp;amp; white cards, a turn record card, two players charts, and rulesbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2014 edition, both BTR Games and One Small Step Games:&lt;br/&gt;Map-and-counter revised version of the game; same topic and treatment. 140 colour double-sided counters, colour area movement map, rules and charts. Scenarios: 1964-65 free deployment (two different methods), 1964-65 historical, 1962-63 Operation SWITCHBACK scenario to show the CIDG program at an earlier stage before it was placed under MACV control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
