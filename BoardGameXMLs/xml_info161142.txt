			<description>Across the Void is a Space Trader board game for one to four players that focuses on trade negotiations with alien merchants, as well as management of and interaction with crew members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the captain of a small deep void trade ship. Under your command are five crew members; each with specific skills. You must manage your crew so their overall Morale, Loyalty, and Efficiency Ratings are as high as you can get them. That way, your crew will perform their tasks more efficiency when needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel through Hyperspace is dangerous, and requires successful Skill Tests of your crew. Sustaining damage is costly, in terms of spending money on repairs, and the potential loss of crew, ship's systems, and cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first Captain to accumulate 1000 Galactic Credits by buying Goods, transporting them safely through Hyperspace, and then selling them at negotiated prices on distant worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player vs Player interaction occurs, as well as card-driven NPC combat events. In addition to accommodating multiple players, this game is designed for Solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
