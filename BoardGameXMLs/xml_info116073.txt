							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gods of Mor Aldenn: Ehlora</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mor Aldenn is the City of Mages, but ever since its founding more than 300 years ago, the moraldenns have worshiped a variety of gods and goddesses. Afterall, isn't divine magic as much a part of the world as the arcane? Clerics of all faiths travel through the city, a few even stay for a while, but you'll only find one temple in Mor Aldenn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This temple is called the Temple of the Three and houses followers of three deities important to the moraldenns. These are Ehlora the Scholar, Calmorrun the Leader and Vhorann the Protector. This pdf details one of the Three, the goddess of ancestry, death and knowledge, Ehlora. Within these pages you'll find information about the goddess herself and her followers. You'll also find a new feat, a few NPCs and even a small selection of new spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
