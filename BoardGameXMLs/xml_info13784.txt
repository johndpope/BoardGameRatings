							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Corner Grocery</name>
									
			<description>This old card game comes with 40 grocery cards, and 112 money cards whose cash value equals the cost of all the grocery cards. The money cards are all dealt out face down to the players, and 5 grocery cards are placed face up on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you draw the top money card from your pile, and if it proves to be the exact price of one of the 5 groceries laid out, you buy it. You may also combine 2 or more cards provided the sum of their prices equals the value of your money card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the value of your money card is less than all the grocery cards, you may pay the card &amp;quot;on account&amp;quot; towards 1 of the items. If your money card is greater than all the grocery cards, you may ask for more grocery cards to placed on the table, or you may group 2 or more cards together and pay on account toward the lot. To pay on account, you place your money card next to the grocery card(s) you wish to buy and try to pay the exact difference on a later turn. Your opponents, however, may also pay the exact difference and steal your purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the greatest value of purchases when all the grocery cards have been bought is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
