							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El Peregrino: das Kartenspiel</name>
									
			<description>Card game based on the Way of St. James. The game consists of cards which have photos of places along the pilgrimage route on one side; and trivia questions on the other side. &lt;br/&gt;Four cards are placed on the table, picture side up. Each player receives three cards at the beginning and must try to be the first one to get a consecutive set of eight cards (10 with 2 or 3 players).&lt;br/&gt;The active player chooses a card from the four on the table that he/she would like to have. Another player then reads one of the questions on the back to him/her (the number of the question is determined by the position of the card on the table, i.e. 1-4 positions away from the draw pile). If answering correctly, the player can keep the card; if wrong, the card is discarded. A new card then replaces the old one. &lt;br/&gt;No player may hold more than 12 cards; excess cards have to be discarded. There are also some wild cards which help complete the sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;55 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First print run limited to 3,000 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
