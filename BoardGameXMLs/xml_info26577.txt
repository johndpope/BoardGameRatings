							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marble Roll</name>
									
			<description>A game of marble rolling skill.  Each player propels their marbles toward a scoring target area that is separated into point values from five to 25.  The higher point areas are smaller and harder to hit than the low point areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of players is limited only to the amount of time a player is willing to wait for their turn.  It easily scales in the number of players, number of marbles and how far away the scoring target area is placed from the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
