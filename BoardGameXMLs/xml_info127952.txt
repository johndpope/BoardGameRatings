			<description>Terapia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is composed of a quad-fold board, the rules are printed on the back side of the box, 6 pawns (black, orange, red, blue, green, yellow) and 600 question cards. Themed on medical science, all questions are about medical (but not psychological) affairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game goal is to be the first to move your pawn along the complete circle on the board from your starting color rectangle to the same position. There is a single pile of cards in the center of the board. Rectangles and cards are identified with 3, 2 or 1 dots. The player at your right asks you the question on the upper card of the pile. You must give right answer to the card question to be able to advance a single rectangle or 3 or 2 if dots stated in your actual position match the current question card dots. That has a maximum of three consecutive advances. Then the turn goes to the player at your right. If you fail a question the pawn moved is the one belonging to the player who asked the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
