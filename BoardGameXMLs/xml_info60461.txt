							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Folnar&#039;s Dagger</name>
									
			<description>User Notes: For evil characters, levels 5-7&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether by luck or by the hands of your dark lord, you have finally tracked down the location of the sacred dagger. With the blade, you can finally summon the demon R'Godae to this world and claim him as your vassal. If you believe the tales, and you see no reason to doubt them, R'Godae will be at your beck and call, forced into servitude in exchange for an end to the curse that banished him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, claiming the dagger won't be easy. According to your information, the weapon was once the possession of the wizard Folnar, a champion of justice and a bitter enemy of darkness. The dagger now rests within what was once his home, a place dedicated to training wizards and warriors who follow in Folnar's heroic steps. Striking there not only claims you the dagger, but also deals a grievous blow to the forces of good, ending the careers of some of its most promising young champions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
