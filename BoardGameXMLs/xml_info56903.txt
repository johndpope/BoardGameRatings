			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sir Jeteki quickened his pace and moved his hand closer to the hilt of his sword as he scanned the shadows for signs of movement. He had left his friends back at the bar and his armor back at the palace. Now he was seriously regretting the entire outing. Suddenly, two men stepped out of the alley just ahead of him. As they drew short swords from under their dark cloaks, Jeteki glanced over his shoulder to see a third man stepping out behind him, a glint of metal reflecting moonlight under his cloak as well. He quickly considered his options. Three on one was a dangerous fight, even for the greatest swordsman in Trent, especially without armor, and there was no knowing how many more were lurking in the shadows. As the two in front closed on him, spreading to encircle him, Jeteki drew his sword and slipped it past one man's feeble parry and into his gut, dropping him instantly. He nimbly dodged the attack of the second thug and turned to face both remaining assailants while slowly backing in the direction of the city gates', and safety...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Fantasy Earth, a world of gritty, low fantasy role-playing, where even mighty warriors fear a knife in the back and powerful wizards get nervous around loaded crossbows. While Fantasy Earth is filled with action, role-playing is emphasized. The success of an adventure often depends more on careful planning than heroic battle, and your list of allies may matter more than your list of spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Earth breaks the traditional rule that realism requires complexity by replacing pages of tables and charts with a simple target number resolution system. Non-combat skills are resolved on a simple d10, and many combats can be run without even opening the book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Earth features:&lt;br/&gt;- A random, but fair, character generation system&lt;br/&gt;- A skill-based system in which any character can learn any skill, just as in real life&lt;br/&gt;- Detailed and ready-to-use skill descriptions for over 100 skills&lt;br/&gt;- A realistic yet playable combat system: skill counts heavily, but all characters are vulnerable&lt;br/&gt;- An experience system designed to compliment role-playing rather than interfere with it&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book does not contain the rules for magic. You must also have the Fantasy Earth Book of Magic to use the magic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
