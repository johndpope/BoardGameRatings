							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mutants &amp; Heretics Source Book</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Unrivalled &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden amongst the shadows of abandoned buildings and crawling through the very bowels of the city are the misunderstood and the corrupt, those twisted mutants and insane Heretics that hide from the Light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the common man on the street, mutants are as contemptible as Heretics. But what are mutants really? Are they a vile by-product of the Dark Legion&amp;rsquo;s influence, or something else entirely? And what can be said of the true nature of a Heretic? Were these men and women born to become servants of Darkness, destined for evil, or are some drawn to the power that is offered in the hopes of turning it against itself? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Heretics: What motivates a Heretic? Are they all of purely evil intent, or do shades of moral grey indeed exist? Is it really possible for a human to walk the razor&amp;rsquo;s edge between Darkness and Light? &lt;br/&gt;    Mutants: What sparks mutation and what does it truly entail? Learn the truth about their twisted DNA and the intrinsic power that it brings to these enigmatic beings. &lt;br/&gt;    The Ancients: Strange vaults and undisclosed finds amongst the stars have led to advanced relics and unidentified ruins. But what ancient race left them behind? And to what purpose? &lt;br/&gt;    Vast Powers: Despite relentless persecution, mutants have been able to hide from both the Brotherhood and the agents of the Apostles. Discover the immense powers that allow them to stay one step ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
