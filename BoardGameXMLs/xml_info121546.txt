							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Common Criminals: Companion Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mean streets are full of criminals from all walks of life. Some have taken up crime as purely as a means of survival while others simply choose to get ahead in life by breaking the rules. Regardless of their situations in life, all these individuals have one thing in common. They have become outlaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common Criminals is a new series of system generic products from Fishwife Games. Rather than exploring characters with supernatural abilities, powerful mutations, or access to larger than life technology, focus is placed upon criminal characters from a more realistic perspective. While the characters provided in the series are fictional products of the author's imagination, the criminals are presented in a manner that makes them more believable. In other words, beyond made up names and background details there is little difference between the presented characters and real life modern outlaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the intended setting for Common Criminals is modern day times, the criminals can be easily ported over to near dark future settings. Likewise, these supplements are fine additions to more cinematic settings, such as the super hero genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current intended location for Common Criminals is the United States of America. As Fishwife Games has a strong customer support base in Europe and other parts of the world, there are planned future spin offs that focuses on the criminal element of other parts of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This guide was created for the purpose of providing a freely available source book for assisting Game Masters in the conversion of other Common Criminals products into pre-existing games. In an effort to maximize the information provide in the Common Criminals supplements to fullest potential while still maintaining a system generic standpoint, the author of the Common Criminals series decided upon creating a separate conversion guide. In the interest of satisfying customer needs, it was determined that this guide should be freely available for download. Likewise, the information should be simple as possible while still offering a great deal of flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
