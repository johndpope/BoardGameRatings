							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Day of the Witch</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve years ago the evil and monstrous sorceress, Strega, was captured by the heroic Redhawk adventurers. She was killed two days later trying to escape. The evil witch then rose as a ghost &amp;ndash; only the bravery of the Redhawks saved the city from her evil.&lt;br/&gt;Of course, history is written by the victors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But sometimes the past doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strega has returned. She wants revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if she continues in her plan, two innocent women are going to die, and an appalling evil will continue to afflict the city. Can the player characters find a missing friend, unravel the truth, and stop the forces of darkness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 45 page city-based adventure for two to four 3rd-4th level characters that should take around three to four hours to play, depending how long the characters spend chatting to the NPCs! It is not combat-heavy - the PCs need to investigate to work out what is really going on. It is set in Waterdeep, but could fit into most cities without any difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
