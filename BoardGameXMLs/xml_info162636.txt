							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Dream of Mars</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Native to the dead seas of Mars, green martians are towering, four-armed humanoids who eke out a tribal lifestyle in the forsaken landscape of the dying planet. Green of skin, these aliens resemble extremely tall men with second torsos atop their normal ones, complete with a second pair of arms.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's right. We are diving into the world of Edgar Rice Burroughs' seminal science fiction work to bring you all a taste of our &amp;quot;A Dream of Mars&amp;quot; product line. &lt;br/&gt;Our first product, &amp;quot;Green Martians&amp;quot; is going to feature the savage species themselves- right from the pages of the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The products covers the basic statistics of a green martian, the basic ways of life on the savage world of Mars, and outlines some basic rules for the setting. &lt;br/&gt;We have a lot more material written up and would love to work on more but we wanted to get a read on how this product is going to be received before we dedicate ourselves to a larger product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh yeah, and we have the AMAZING Jack Holiday (Dragon Tiger Ox) providing artwork for this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disclaimer &lt;br/&gt;As a disclaimer, we are working only with material found in the public domain within the United States.
