			<description>Players try to score the best poker hand on every column and row of an 8x8 grid. One player has all the red cards of a standard deck; the other player has all the black. Players draw the top card off their respective stacks and place it on the grid until the board is full. Each row and column has one blocked-off spot which explains the game title. The higher hand in each row gets the points. Included with the board game is a CD-ROM version to play against your PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
