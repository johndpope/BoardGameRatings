							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Not the Face! Tanks Volume 2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything has a role, and these ones are tanks, tricksy, deceptive tanks who are more than what they seem. But your role doesn't define you any more than the name of your class does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this you will find 3 characters with backstories full of fluff and build guides to help you create them at any level from 1 to 20 as a character or NPC in your game. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Grimshank, a gnome fighter who works hard to make people believe he is an illusionist.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;Aacute;shild Vefr, A Half Orc whip master with a tragic past, and a penchant for freeing slaves.&lt;br/&gt;    Silvanu, an honorable champion of the woods who is much more than he seems, all while being just a normal human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end is an new class to use, the Templar of the Living Flame, a mortal that loves fire just a wee bit too much for most people's tastes, who can be good, evil, or just accidentally burn the neighborhood down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
