			<description>This RPG, released in 1978, was the first licensed Star Trek roleplaying game product. It is based on The Original Series and The Animated Series, but emphasizes &amp;quot;dungeon-crawl&amp;quot; exploration (combat, traps and so on) over Star Trek's themes of space exploration and alien contact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was adapted directly from designer Michael Scott Kurtick's (credited here as Michael J. Scott) previous game, &amp;quot;Space Patrol&amp;quot; (Gamescience, 1977). It was primarily released to support Heritage Models' line of Star Trek 25mm lead miniatures. Other than the miniatures, no additional supplements for the game were ever released by Heritage, though the game appears to have been republished with a different cover around 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook is divided into two sections, the Basic Game and the Advanced Game, and includes a scenario adventure with maps for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BASIC GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book opens with an Introduction, going into background on Star Trek itself; the concept of a role-playing game; and a plug for Heritage's line of Star Trek miniatures. Next, the concept of the &amp;quot;Mission Master&amp;quot; and game preparation is introduced. Virtually everything in the game is resolved with 6-sided dice or 20-sided percentage dice. Others (4, 8, and 12) are rarely used and there's no real consistent game mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basic Game section outlines the game as played with the standard Trek characters (character creation is covered in the Advanced Game) and limited equipment rules. Each character has six abilities with a value between 3 - 18: Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX), Luck (LK), Mentality (MN), Charisma (CH), Constitution (CN). There is no Skill or Talent system. Instead, each of these abilities applies to the resolution of specific tasks as you would expect, except CN which is really a hit point metric. The available Player and Non-player characters are the standard &amp;quot;Star Trek Personalities&amp;quot; from The Original Series and The Animated Series. Psionics are introduced, but only used in the Advanced Game. Creatures have only one stat, the Ability Rating (AR). Stats for classic creatures (such as the Horta, Mugato and the Salt Vampire) and others are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVANCED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Game introduces custom character creation (rolling dice for attritbutes), Psionic Powers (Empathy, Telepathy, Telekinesis, Clairvoyance, Precognition, Mind Control or Teleportation), Creature Creation and Advanced Combat rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No additional supplements were released for the game, but two fan-written works (published years apart) in &amp;quot;Different Worlds&amp;quot; magazine would add additional rules to STAGFF to make it more like the series upon which the game as based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(description submitted by Robert Saint John, based on portions of his articles originally posted at his Groknard History of Star Trek RPGs website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
