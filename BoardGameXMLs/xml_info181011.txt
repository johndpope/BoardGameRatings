							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der Schatz des KÃ¤pt&#039;n Flint</name>
									
			<description>Generations of seafarers have spent their time searching for the fabled treasure, but none have managed to find it. But now Flint's old chart has turned up, on which the hiding places are marked. Multiple pirate ships simultaneously reach the island group in which the treasure chests are hidden. But the restless ghost of Flint is guarding the treasure. Who will be successful and recover the most valuable treasure chest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents: 1 board (included in the magazine, showing 7 spots with 3 to 5 treasure chests on an island), 8 small and 8 large markers in two colors (not included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player plays with 8 large and 5 small markers, the other one with 8 small and 5 large markers. Players alternate taking turns placing their markers on the spots, never identically repeating the opponent's move. The game ends when both players placed all their 13 markers on the 7 spots of the island. The 7 spots are scored one after each other; at each spot the player with more markers (or in case of equal numbers, more large markers) wins; in case of a tie no one gets the treasure chests. The player with the most treasure chests found wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
