							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadly Encounters: In a Manor of Speaking</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the master of the house in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over two hundred cycles ago in a remote town, a lord and his family mysteriously died in their manor. At least, that's how the story goes. The only thing known for certain is that one day they entered the estate, and they simply never came out.&lt;br/&gt;Ever since then, strange noises coming from the old estate have been heard by the inhabitants of Daroksville. The natural conclusion was that the house is haunted.&lt;br/&gt;Rumors of the unspeakable horrors wandering the halls have kept most people away, but more recent rumors of infinite riches have drawn several adventuring groups, as well as many a stranger claiming some relation to the dead Lord. None have ever emerged from the manor or been heard from again.&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a young lad has arrived to claim ownership of the accursed abode. Before moving in, however, he would like to hire someone to do a little housecleaning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In a Manor of Speaking&amp;quot; is a short stand-alone side quest adventure for four 3rd-level characters, designed for use with the Creatures &amp;amp; Chaos and d20 line of products. It takes place in a 3-story manor filled with undead, puzzles, riddles, and traps. Characters must find clues and special items in order to advance through the manor and eventually escape its deadly curse. This adventure also introduces a new undead template: the Poltergeist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
