			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mi-Go have secretly been dwelling on Earth for many years. Over time, their attempts to disguise themselves in the human world have brought them closer and closer to our culture. In the past several decades, some of their attempts to blend in have been a little too successful. Now, a small band of Mi-Go has become addicted to Yog Radio and Yog- Sothoth.com. They&amp;rsquo;ve been following the cephalopodcast and its website almost religiously since it began in the mid 1990&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
