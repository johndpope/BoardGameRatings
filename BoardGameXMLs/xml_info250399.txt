							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Colorado Winter (Perkins, CO)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The holiday season in Colorado is always magical. Being in the mountains, there&amp;rsquo;s always snow, and the skiers passing through give the town a good financial bump right before the holiday bills start coming in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even before the winter recess, students wake up each morning to a surprise: is it going to snow enough that school will be closed? Usually, that means about half a foot or more. Coloradans are tough. Even if school is open, Mr. Gretch, the gym teacher, usually lets you have a snowball fight for gym class, much to the dismay of Principal Smith (no relation to the John Smith the middle school was named after... probably). Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s the most wonderful time of the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it does get dark earlier, and it&amp;rsquo;s very cold out. The winds howl &amp;mdash; and it seems like maybe other things are howling in the wilderness, too &amp;mdash; and this is the time of year when all those kids went missing five years ago, vanishing from their homes mysteriously in the middle of the night. But that won&amp;rsquo;t happen again, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
