							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sword Shaman</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Worshipper of Weapons&amp;quot; has devoted his life to one weapon, to the exclusion of all others. In giving up every other weapon, the Sword Shaman gains a spiritual bond with his sword (or melee weapon of his choice). He can throw it, control it from afar, and even absorb spells into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Prestige Class comes with all the information you need to create this character. It also includes a sample character and 5 story starters to insert the Sword Shaman into your campaign. There are also 4 new spells, although 1 of them, Energy Shock, also appears in my Winter Warrior Prestige Class book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who play 3.5 edition or Pathfinder rules would get the most out of this class, but there is inspiration here for any fantasy roleplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
