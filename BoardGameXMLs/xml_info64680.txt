							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lurkers Guide to Gaim</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The League of Non-Aligned Worlds is a strange and eccentric lot, but the Gaim are the most bizarre and unique. A race of insectoids that evolve from one generation to the next as needed by their unfathomable and powerful Queens, the Gaim have been the source of more questions and controversy than most other league races. They are undeniably influential, and their secrets are unknown to all those that do not have the antennae to decipher them, except for those who hold this book in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lurkers Guide to the Gaim is a detailed look at the Gaim intelligence, seeing them in a way that has never been revealed before. With the information covered in this book, players and Games Masters can manifest a host of new bio-adaptions upon the various breeds of insectoid, Gaim-specific feats, skills and prestige classes give players and Games Masters alike many new avenues to explore. Although those living within the Babylon 5 universe may never be able to understand how and why the Gaim function within their endless Hive Mind, readers now can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
