			<description>Strap in and prepare for lift off, with the first issue of Daring Tales of the Space Lanes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triple Ace Games&amp;rsquo; new line of high-octane, two-fisted tales takes the heroes into space, where fighting evil crimelords, dodging bounty hunters, and evading asteroids while blasting at enemy fighters is all part of a day&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This inaugural issue contains two short adventures and a special rules appendix.&lt;br/&gt;Waylaid on Wayland: When a senior political figure offered the heroes a tidy sum to deliver a small package it seemed like easy money, but that was before people started trying to kill them. What begins as a simple cargo run quickly has the heroes involved in a running battle over who gets to control a powerful political organization on the industrial world of Wayland. Trash incinerators, acid rain, high speed chases through chimney stacks, and a showdown where the scenery is just as dangerous as the opposition await!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunboat Diplomacy: Sure, helping a guy being blasted at by an armored goon was the right thing to do, but it&amp;rsquo;s embroiled the characters in the start of a potentially nasty situation. When an entire space navy is trying to kill you, you know it&amp;rsquo;s not a good day to take to the stars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Dangers: A special appendix detailing numerous space hazards you can throw into your own space tales. From asteroids to gravity wells to wormholes, that cargo run just got a whole lot more dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
