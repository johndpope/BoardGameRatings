							<name  sortindex="1">Zombicide: Ross the Manager</name>
									
			<description>Ross was leading a peaceful life as a warehouse manager when the zombies appeared. Ross, however, is more than he appears. He left the army twenty years ago with scars and PTSD but believed he had moved on. The invasion triggered something in him, something dirty he had thought buried forever. His soldier's instincts came roaring back, along with old wounds. His tactical awareness and skill with weapons, however, are priceless to any survivor team. If he would just put down his bowling ball...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ross is a promotional character available as an option for backers of the Season 2 Kickstarter campaign.  The figure includes English, French, and Spanish language versions of the weapon card &amp;quot;Ross' Bowling Ball&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
