			<description>Corporation Incorporated : A game of bluffing and resource management for 2-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the humble beginnings of a swamp-lawyer farm on Bungle Prime, Corp Inc. has grown its empire across the galaxy making most of its profit from interplanetary sewage disposal and virtual casinos. Corp Inc. now employs over 60% of sentient beings and controls near 80% of the non-sentient labor force in the known galaxy. The difference between the two is considered a grey area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player runs a department in a mega-corporation. They compete for resources from the corporation to fund their projects and may have to lie, cheat and steal to get the resources to do so. Though they should beware that the company does not become too corrupt or the company will be closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
