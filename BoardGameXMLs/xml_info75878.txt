							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Echo City Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core rules for Resolute the Superhero RPG 2E outline the city of Nativity, the most powerful city in the world, and the home to the most colorful heroes and villains. However, just to the south of Nativity is its former twin, Echo City. Before the messari invasion, Echo City and Meridian were called the &amp;lsquo;twin cities&amp;rsquo;, separated by an expanse of the Heart River. While the messari targeted Meridian, Echo City was only marginally affected by the strike. While Meridian&amp;rsquo;s destruction was swift and ultimately paved the way for its grand rebirth, Echo City has seen a steady decline over the last decade, as all major trade, business and enterprise has moved northeast across the Heart River and into the resurgent city of Nativity. Slowly, criminal groups have gained greater and greater footholds in Echo City, amassing power while such organizations as the UWC and Project Javelin turn a blind eye to the problems bubbling beneath the surface. The criminals of Echo City are smart enough to stay beneath the notice of such power players as the Ambassadors, using the relative unimportance of Echo City on the world stage to their advantage while the people of Echo City suffer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
