			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product features a large-scale panoramic view of a modern city with four city blocks represented. The map features over 40 buildings.&lt;br/&gt; This map can be used as a base city for a modern setting, the place where the Player Characters live, eat, work, and sleep when they are not on adventures which may be an excellent setting for downtime in modern-based or super hero games.&lt;br/&gt; This dynamic map allows for larger scale adventures and scenarios than normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first scenario is a chase scene, where either the Player Characters are being chased by Game Master Characters out to get them or vice versa. The Player Characters could also be tailing Game Master Characters who if they don&amp;rsquo;t notice the Player Characters first will lead them to an important meeting. For example, the city parking lot where a deal is going down in the middle of the night. The four city blocks have several hazards; other vehicles on the roads, the center traffic signal, and stop signs at the end of the main roads. These can cause complications in the chase, and even bring police into the chase for not following the traffic laws. There are also a couple of back alleys for cars to try to slip through and sneak around, one of them being a dead end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second scenario is a monster rampaging through the city. Maybe the Player Characters are a team of super heroes coming in to fight a gigantic, super villain created monster intent on destroying the city. The humongous creature sends cars flying, debris tumbling down from buildings, and wreaks havoc upon the city. The super heroes have to save as many people as they can and somehow defeat the ginormous monstrosity at the same time. Perhaps the Player Characters are the massive monsters and the Game Master is controlling police and military forces (or even superheroes or other huge monsters) intent on stopping them from annihilating the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third scenario is a military assault scenario. This city holds an important objective for two different military armies, and they roll into it at one of the four roads leading into the city featuring an array of tanks and armored personal carriers. One of the army&amp;rsquo;s goals is to protect and defend the objective building, and the other army&amp;rsquo;s goals could be to either take over or destroy the objective building. The objective building could be a hospital actively treating soldiers, a TV station that is blasting out propaganda, a hotel where a VIP is staying, etc. The Player Characters could be an elite unit dropped onto one of the roof of the objective building by helicopter. The elite unit&amp;rsquo;s job may be to infiltrate the key building and then either extract or eliminate the VIP. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s their job to secure and defend the building or use explosives to blow it up before escaping. Perhaps they are taking control of the highest rooftop in the city in order to lend sniper support to the battle below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can either print it out with our easy to print instructions or use in any VTT software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map product is a full-color, 40 x 30 inch, 4 City Blocks. The ZIP file includes VTT images for your online gaming needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
