			<description>User Note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally titled Hellspawn, Daring Entertainment changed the title during the production process to avoid potential litigation. Daring Entertainment published the product for several months but then decided to withdraw it from online sale in Sept 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Hellbrood: Countdown to Invasion is a complete volume of a six adventure miniseries which launches the massive comic book style mega-event, where you will not only face the world's deadliest supervillain, but also battle on the front lines of a war against an alien race determined to destroy the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(It) is an adventure book that introduces players and GMs to the initial super-heroic setting, establishing not only the player-characters, but also the various heroes and villains around them. Containing the beginning Setting Rules required to play, and taking full advantage of the Super Powers Companion from Pinnacle Entertainment, Countdown to Invasion throws the player-characters head first into the massive invasion by the alien Necroleans, and the transformation of humanity into the ultimate form of Living Dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
