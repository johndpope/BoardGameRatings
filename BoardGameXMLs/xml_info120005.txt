			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a dark time for the Rebellion...&lt;br/&gt;The embattled Rebels are about to be driven from their headquarters on Hoth. Luke is about to take a significant but dangerous step forward in his exploration of the Force. And Han's sordid past is about to catch up with him. &lt;br/&gt;Join historian Voren Na'al as he covers the locales and people that had such a decisive impact on the Battle of Hoth and its aftermath. Explore the frozen wastes of the ice planet and the teeming swamps of Dagobah, and delve into the hidden secrets of the asteroid belt and Bespin's Cloud City. Meet the nefarious Imperials, brave Rebels, and assorted bounty hunters and scoundrels who figured in those crucial weeks centered around the Imperial strike against the Alliance's secret headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galaxy Guide 3 is the comprehensive guide to Episode V of the Star Wars saga, compiling information and facts from the movie, radio play, novels, and comics. You'll find within these pages a definitive collection of backgrounds, statistics, and information on the heroes and villains from The Empire Strikes Back, many of whom make their first appearance in a roleplaying supplement. Plus, join the adventure in an all-new scenario set in the luxury mining town of Cloud City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
