			<description>Can't find a tabletop wargame opponent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This easily-readable guide provides the tools needed to undertake tabletop wargame campaigns without the need for other players.

Novices and veterans alike can employ these ideas and innovations to further the thrill of pitting army against army without the need for another player. Features methodologies for campaigns (mobilization, weather, logistics, morale, alliances, revolts, sieges, and mutinies), sea campaigns, integrating fantasy, tactical actions (terrain, weather, commander's competency, concealment, ambushes, and minefields), and air warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
