			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You who are about to game, I salute you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 4th Edition of The Savage World of My Little Pony is the culmination of over a year and half of work, both by myself and by the numerous others who contributed to its continuing evolution since its conception in early February of 2011. It is my labor of love and gift to the greater My Little Pony fandom at large, and I am sure that you will be able to see the amount of exacting detail and work that has been put into making it as complete as possible. I hope that it inspires others to use their own skills and create something that they can then bring to others and share in the sense of community that this game has created for me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Savage Worlds system is designed to be Fast, Furious, and Fun; a perfect game for new and experienced players alike. Few games offer this combination of streamlined simplicity and simultaneous complexity, and is a perfect way to introduce people into the world of roleplaying games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fact that you are reading this means that it is likely you are a fan of, or at least aware of, the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and are interested in the unique things that it&amp;rsquo;s universe has to offer the roleplayer. I have conceived this system as a means to play almost any sort of story in the Friendship is Magic universe that one might think of, from episodic slice-of-life stories to grand epics that see the players match wits with terrifying foes and daunting challenges. The only limit is your own imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
