			<description>Once, every hundred years, Crabitron descends upon the civilized galaxy to teach humanity a brutal lesson &amp;mdash; to stop eating his delicious crustacean brothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity never learns. It's time for their lesson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Touch, pinch, and fling your claws to cause destruction&lt;br/&gt;    Battle against waves of enemies, including sharks with frickin' lasers&lt;br/&gt;    Gobble Burgers of Power, burp fireballs and suck in everything&lt;br/&gt;    Snap, crush and ruin everyone's day... or life&lt;br/&gt;    The world's most realistic Giant Space Crab simulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crabitron is designed around multi-touch interaction, encouraging players to play with four fingers at once for best results. Players place two fingers on each giant claw and can then pinch, snap and fling them to cause destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Millard, co-founder of Two Lives Left describes Crabitron as, &amp;ldquo;Like a huge, physics-driven puppet that players can push and pull with their fingers. He's this loveable, ugly crab with a wonderful personality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to releasing Crabitron, Two Lives Left has announced their reverse-funding campaign &amp;ldquo;Crabstarter&amp;rdquo;. Crabstarter is a semi-serious parody of Kickstarter that bills itself as a &amp;ldquo;reverse Kickstarter&amp;rdquo; campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crabstarter presents Crabitron as a fully funded and finished game and asks players to back the project by buying the game on the App Store. All sales data for Crabitron, such as revenue and chart position, are made available to the public directly on the Crabstarter website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Lives Left co-founder Simeon Sa&amp;euml;ns comments, &amp;ldquo;We'll be making all of our sales data public. You'll be able to see exactly how much we're earning, whether Crabitron is succeeding or failing, and where it sits in the charts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Lives Left has estimated that Crabitron cost approximately $100,000 to develop, and this has become the funding goal for their Crabstarter campaign. In addition, Two Lives Left has added &amp;ldquo;stretch goals&amp;rdquo; for additional features and updates to Crabitron once the initial funding goal has been reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
