			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are still the one and only Captain Johnny &amp;quot;Jimbo Baby&amp;quot; McGibbits, The Infiltrator. It seems like only yesterday that your daring heroics left the Mad Leader in ruins, nipping his plans for world domination in the bud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But intelligence reports indicate that the Mad Leader has risen from the smoldering ashes in which you left him. Once again, the world is in peril and only you--world-class sprinter, aerospace engineer, consultant to every free-world leader of the last two decades, and ace helicopter pilot--can stop the Mad Leader. Too bad; it looks like you'll have to postpone the christening of the USS McGibbits and that little soiree you had planned with Vanna this evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all, you'll be busy flying your Gizmo (tm) DHX-1 Attack Chopper behind enemy lines in search of the Mad Leader's new headquarters. Once there, you'll begin an all-new series of ground missions to thwart the Mad Leader's revitalized troops. But be careful! This time, the Mad Leader knows who he's up against!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Three completely new ground missions&lt;br/&gt;     Realistic helicopter flight simulation&lt;br/&gt;     Great graphics and sound&lt;br/&gt;     A new challenge in this follow-up to the best-selling Infiltrator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
