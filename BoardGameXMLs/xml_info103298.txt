							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Patton Strikes Back: The Battle of the Bulge</name>
									
			<description>From the back of box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drama of a documentary. The challenge of chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patton Strikes Back plunges you into the chaos and confusion of World War II's decisive Battle of the Bulge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you play, you'll be bombarded by newsreels of digitized World War II film clips ... battlefield photos and bulletins ... along with dozens of historical anecdotes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, thanks to the elegantly simple command system, even a rookie can quickly take charge of either side. Like chess, the basic moves and strategies are easy to learn. But, also like chess, mastering the nuances can take a lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patton Strikes Back is a radically new kind of strategy game: Historically credible without being incredibly complex. Endlessly exciting ... but never mindless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     On-call information displays show you the strength and readiness of each unit, supply lines, and more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play with actual reinforcements and weather. Or choose random variations for fresh challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A barrage of digitized battle sounds and film footage. And enough &amp;quot;war stories&amp;quot; to fill a scrapbook. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Five levels of difficulty. As your leadership skills improve, your enemy becomes more challenging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chris Crawford, the creator of Patton Strikes Back, is perhaps America's best-known name in the field of strategic game design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among other items, he has designed Eastern Front, Balance of Power, Balance of the Planet and Patton Vs. Rommel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crawford is also author of The Art of Computer Game Design and editor of The Journal of Computer Game Design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
