							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Relate</name>
									
			<description>Relate is a 2-player game where the goal is to move one's blocks from his or her starting space to the starting spaces of the opponent.  A player does so by pushing the block into an orthogonally adjacent space, which will typically change the color showing on the top of the cube.  The key to the game is that a player cannot move one of his or her pieces so that both cubes show the same color, and if a player moves a piece so that the color on it matches the color of an opponent's block, the opponent must then move the block with the matching color.  The first player go get both blocks to the opponent's starting spaces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
