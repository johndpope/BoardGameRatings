							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Race 2000</name>
									
			<description>Space Race 2000 was developed after 2 1/2 years research and testing by its Seattle, Washington inventor. The game provides basic planet information such as names of all the planets, how many planets are there? Which planet is closest to the earth? Many other questions are answered as you never lose interest in the excitement of the game. Excellent learning tool for all ages as our progress in space continues. (Not a trivia game)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll-and-move around the ring-shaped board attempting to land on every planet of the solar system. Collect all 8 planet chips plus one moon chip and then return to Earth to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
