							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Shift</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you've worked for all your life, is about to become worthless&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coalfell has been the home of the fourth largest Christmas ornament factory in the country for nearly a century, but now the influx of foreign imports has cut their market share to the point where the owners, the Parsons, historically true pillars of the community, are unable to keep the doors open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The factory has been the biggest employer in the town for generations. Other opportunities: nonexistent. Everyone knows the loss of the factory will devastate the local economy, but no one has been able to bring forth other options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the last shift before the bank comes in to close the doors. The mood is grim, as the last deliveries are being prepared. Some hold on to some desperate hope, some are looking forward to drowning their sorrows in booze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gladly, no-one is about to do something rash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
