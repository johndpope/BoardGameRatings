			<description>Stack-22 is a tile-stacking game that uses polyhexes of 5 hexagons, called pentahexes. There are 22 different pentahexes (hence the name of the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stack-22 is a new addition to the Pile-Omino family (SEVEN, Pent-Up and Counterplays) by the same designer. All of them play the same, but Stack-22 can be considered a step up from Seven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: this is not a game for the casual player. It is recommended that you at least master SEVEN, Pent-Up or Counterplays before playing Stack-22, as if you don&amp;rsquo;t know the tactics it can feel a bit cold at the start during the first games. Its depth can be overwhelming (22 opening moves and more than 3000 second moves; the branching factor is crazy), but it rewards those who dare to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary of gameplay: Players alternate turns placing one of their tiles according to some simple rules, trying to get the most of their pieces on the topmost layers when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) The tile must be aligned with the hex grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) The selected tile must be placed on the highest level on which it can be placed legally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c) The tile must be placed either on the table and adjacent to a piece already on the table, or atop at least 2 tiles, regardless of their colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d) The tile must lie flat, with every hex directly supported, either by the table or by a lower tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
