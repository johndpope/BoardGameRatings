			<description>Roll the Haul before you Lose it All!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buckle up. Keep On Rolling (KOR) is the bold press your luck dice game geared to get your wheels spinning AND have you screaming for the air brakes at the same time! Every player is in the drivers seat on their turn and rolls the jumbo dice to log 25, 50 or 100 miles at a time. Each roll (haul) must obey the rules of the open road. How many times does a player roll the dice on their turn? As many times as possible and they Keep On Rolling until no miles have been rolled or they run into a dead end, Players can roll their turn to a slow and steady STOP or lose everything they have rolled by hitting a DEAD END! Roll a U-TURN and you pass the dice to any player, who then is U-TURNED and rolling against their score! The first player to log 6,000 miles wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
