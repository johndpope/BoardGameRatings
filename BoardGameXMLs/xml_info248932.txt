			<description>Sustainable development geek is a trivia/debate game based on questions about the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). Question cards are associated with one of the 17 SDGs and provide 2 possible answers (A/B). The correct answer is listed on the back of the card with an explanation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two game modes are available:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Achieve them all (2-4 players)&lt;br/&gt;     The great debate (5-10 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two additional &amp;quot;animation&amp;quot; modes are described:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     General assembly (10-70 people)&lt;br/&gt;     Facilitation (any group events)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;achieve them all&amp;quot; game mode, each player takes a turn answering as many questions about SDGs as they want. They receive each card they answered correctly, but the card is only saved once the player decides to stop. Whenever a player gives a wrong answer, all is/her unsaved cards are discarded and his/her turn ends. The next player then takes his/her turn. The first player to collect cards for all 17 SDGs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;great debate&amp;quot; game mode, 2 players (debaters A and B) are picked to argue for 30 seconds in favour of answer A or B. Other players (deciders) then vote on which answer is correct. The debater who got the most votes keeps the card (counts as 1 point). Deciders who found the right answer score 1 point. The game ends after a set number of turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
