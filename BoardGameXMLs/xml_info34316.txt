			<description>Knaves of Charlemagne features an original, fast-paced card game in which 2 players vie for position as an attacker or defender. The player who has no cards in his or her hand after the deck as been emptied is declared the winner.  The set includes two decks of woodcut-style illustrated cards inside a hand crafted wooden card box.  In addition, the game includes rules for 11 classic card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
