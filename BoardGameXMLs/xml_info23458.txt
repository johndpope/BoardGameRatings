			<description>Players take turn rolling the dice and trying to acquire cubes of the color shown by the dice.  The cubes are hidden from view in bins called airports and players must remember where the cubes are hidden to fulfill their order. If a cube is rolled with the color purple showing it means bad weather and the player cannot fly that round. (miss a turn).&lt;br/&gt;If the player chooses an airport without one of the colors rolled their turn ends. If the airport has the color they need it is loaded into the biplanes wings and the plane flies for home.  Before a plane lands it is flipped over and any cubes that fall out are lost.  All other cubes are worth one coin when delivered to the airport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 7 coins wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
