			<description>In Panzer Squadron each player takes control of a number of miniature tanks. The game is played on a modular playing board made out of hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tank has an associated game card made up of 2 sides. One side gives the history and technical specifications of the tank; the other side provides information necessary to play Panzer Squadron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes 15 Tiles and places them on the game-play mat in turns. Then each player places their tanks on a hexagon bordering their side of the game-play mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Throw a 10-sided dice (D10) to determine which player has initiative that turn. The player with the highest roll controls the initiative. &lt;br/&gt;2) The player who controls the initiative chooses one of their tanks and activates it.&lt;br/&gt;3) The other player then chooses one of their tanks and activates it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When You Activate A Tank You May Choose One Of Four Actions: &lt;br/&gt;-Move the tank&lt;br/&gt;-Fire on another tank&lt;br/&gt;-Move the tank and fire on another tank &lt;br/&gt;-Leave the tank in its current position to ambush passing tanks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the player who has tanks left at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.panzersquadron.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.panzersquadron.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
