							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Realms of War</name>
									
			<description>Realms of War is a game of fantasy battlefields, of monsters, soldiers and magic. Players take the roles of commanders of huge armies in a game that&amp;rsquo;s never played the same way twice, even if players use the same army over and over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Realms of War, cards represent units, commanders, magic, random events and terrain.  The key to the game is not only getting the right cards at the right time, but playing them at the right time much like a general must recognize and take advantage of his opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other card games that represent fantasy battles, there are no contrived effects or cutesy, gamey rules.  Realms of War plays like a real, epic battle with units, flanks and tactics.  There are no cards to collect as Realms of War is NOT a CCG; each set contains everything you need to immediately begin fighting fantasy battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the big attractions of this game is the free, downloadable armies from several popular fantasy genres such as D&amp;amp;D, Warhammer, Dragonlance and coming soon - Middle Earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://biagamesonline.tripod.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://biagamesonline.tripod.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
