			<description>The traditional Card Game played with the 16 card deck by 4 players. The game is very popular in some Polish regions especially in Kaszuby in Pomerania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is called sometimes the Kaszubian Bridge. Game is played in the sequence (e.g. 16) of rounds. Each round starts from the bidding than, depends on the type of agreed contract, sequence of tricks is played. Round can be played in schema 2 vs 2 or 1 vs 3 depend on the agreed contract. Similarly different card hierarchies are possible.&lt;br/&gt; Interesting twist is that the personalities of players in 2 vs 2 teams are revealed during the play (the owners of 2 black Queens and in some cases one of Jacks plays together).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
