							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clear Round</name>
									
			<description>This is a solitaire card game which takes its inspiration from the classic game of Patience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to ride a clear round with your horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards have two types, Stride cards and Jump cards. First you have to try to make your horse take the required strides to the fence, this might be 8 for example. Then you turn over cards three at a time, like in Patience, and you can add the third exposed card to the table. If you do, the second card will become exposed and that can be used. Once you have a total of eight (in our example) from 2 or more cards, you switch to the Jump cards which are dealt with in a similar way. Eventually you ride over the 10 Jumps required to finish the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are blocked in your attempts to jump (a combination of 1, 2 and 3 required in that order) then you can choose a card that is not required. This will result in four faults or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra rules include racing against the clock and playing with more players who each take turns to get their horse around the course whilst the other riders watch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
