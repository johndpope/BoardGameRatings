							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DayTrippers GameMasters Guide</name>
									
			<description>An infinite variety of bizarre experiences await your exploration, from Dream Worlds and Alternate Earths to distant planets in our universe and others. The Daytrippers Gamemasters Guide is a toolkit for creating surreal adventures that take place in these weird worlds and alternate dimensions. Each adventure is designed to last a single session and return the PCs back to earth. Using this toolkit, the GM takes the players into new and wildly divergent realities every session, blurring the line between subjective and objective reality, and cranking up the weirdness to eleven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time is shortly after the year 2100, the location is the first world. Massive megacorporations dominate the economic landscape and incredible advances in technology make the most miraculous things possible, from genetic modification to medical nanotechnology and microfusion power generators. But the most earth-shaking development of the 21st century is one we're only beginning to see the ramifications of. As the 22nd century dawns, the inner and outer worlds of SlipSpace are opening up to human exploration, thanks to the development of the amazing vehicles known as SlipShips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bold explorers who pilot these vehicles are called DayTrippers, and they face a multiverse of physical and psychological dangers to bring back priceless knowledge and powerful artifacts from far-flung dimensions and times. The setting is inspired by the surrealistic fiction of Moebius, Michael Moorcock, Rudy Rucker, Stanley Weinbaum, Jack Vance and other masters of weirdness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Tod Foley (designer of Cyberspace, Ghosts in the Machine, and Watch the World Die) the Daytrippers Gamemasters Guide blends modern and traditional gamemastering techniques with the random input of oracular systems and the spontaneously-generative approach of surrealist art. The result is a fast interpretive system with its own skittery mechanics, spitting out psychoactive science fiction narratives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from Back Cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
