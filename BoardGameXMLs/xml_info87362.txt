			<description>Subtitle: A Storytelling Game of Civilization, Suffering, and Triumph&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a Beast in the heart of Man. A savage instinct baser than any animal's, which leads to self-destruction. Mankind's children cry out in their bondage. Will you heed their cry and liberate them, or increase their burden until they break?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectre of the Beast is a roleplaying game about the march of Civilization, and the bloody grist that fuels its mill. Players will tell the stories of Champions: pivotal men and women of different cultures throughout Epochs of history, each poised on the crux of historical change and whose driving Ambitions decide the fate of their people. Always the ways of war and massacre loom as tempting options to attain their desires, but you will forge a Paradise for humanity or wipe it from the face of the Earth? Play is about finding out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
