			<description>From the Manufacturer's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This token set is designed to allow player&amp;rsquo;s to easily, and quickly, track their character&amp;rsquo;s status effects. If your character is frightened, paralyzed or unconscious, your allies will be able to see at a glance that you are in need of help. Because all of our full-color tokens are made of durable perspex they are wet-erasable, so you can write additional information straight onto them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat tile provides a place for player&amp;rsquo;s to keep a running total of constantly changing statistics like character health and resources, all without dirtying your character sheet with eraser marks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D&amp;amp;D Character Token Set Contains:&lt;br/&gt;1x Combat Tile&lt;br/&gt;20x Tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
