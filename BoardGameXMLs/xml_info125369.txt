			<description>Did you know that during the first moon landing the astronauts spent 21 hours on the surface of the moon? Or that the Berlin Wall was 87 Miles long? BrainBox World History contains 56 beautifully-illustrated cards highlighting some of the greatest and most significant historical events. The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner. This simple concept can be played by all ages and in large groups as well as a 1 person game. Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material and designed in the UK, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
