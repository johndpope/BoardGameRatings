							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Echo Conflict</name>
									
			<description>When the mirror moons presented themselves to the galaxy, they promised infinite resources. We were wrong. They were only echoes of our homeworlds. Each one the alternate outcome of a choice made eons ago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With every empire given a key to the universe in which they were the ruler, the galaxy fell to pieces.  We inherited a system colonized by our former selves. In the ruins we found the weaknesses to those that oppose us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The empire that controls the power of the echoes will reign supreme over us all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echo Conflict is a science fiction card game based on 4X strategy games. Players vie for control over planets and bases using 1 of 4 types of command cards. Defend your empire and develop unique technology to gain an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round a planet is revealed. The starting player will begin the Echo by playing a command card in one of the 4X suits: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, or eXterminate. In turn order, each of the following players may play a card. Only cards matching the source suit will be eligible to win. Any player that did not win the Echo will gain a token in their played suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After amassing Echoes equal to the planet's requirement, the planet is conquered and populated. Planets grant influence points and special abilities. By collecting various planet types and 4X tokens, players can unlock technologies to aid them in their conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 4 eons, the player with the most influence will claim victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
