			<description>Each player has to move his 16 meeples from his starting positions around the game board and over his launching pad (the five spaces of his own color) to the blue &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; space at the center of the game board. Movement is done one space along the black lines or by jumping over other meeples, regardles if they're own or opponent ones. Each meeple reaching it's own launching pad, immediately goes to the &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; space and is taken out of the game. The first player to get all his meeples on the &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
