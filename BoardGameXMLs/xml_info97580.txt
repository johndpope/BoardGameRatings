Word Ace gives players a letter and number (A, 9) and they have to be the first to find a word that meets certain criteria, such as &amp;quot;a word that starts with 'A' and has 9 letters&amp;quot; (Armadillo!). Multiple variations keep the game fresh, while teaching vocabulary skills at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Word Ace electronic console, &lt;br/&gt;     4 wipe-off boards, &lt;br/&gt;     4 dry erase markers&lt;br/&gt;     Requires 3AAA batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game finished second during Season 1 of American Inventor, said competition was held in 2006 and Hasbro announced during the Season Finale that they would &amp;quot;work to make it a reality&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
