			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy 3D children's game in which the packaging is part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;The cow Togo Lino walks around and tries to find as many flowers as he can for his girlfriend, the sheep Florina.&lt;br/&gt;Some flowers are easy to get, for others he needs the help of his friend the mole, Monty, because only he can dig a hole to the forbidden garden (the box)and get more flowers.&lt;br/&gt;But beware, others might want to steal your flowers, so it is good to sometimes get the help of the little watchdog Carlito!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
