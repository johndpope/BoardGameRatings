			<description>A very strategic tile laying and area control game that is highly interactive.  The rules are easy to learn, winning requires cunning and clever play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What treasures lay within the undiscovered Tomb of Akhenaton?  Its location is rumored to be contained in a great mosaic created by those that worshiped the legendary pharaoh.  Pieces of this mysterious and valuable mosaic have been hidden for ages in Egypt's greatest city. Can you lead your team of archeologists to make the discovery of a lifetime?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place city tiles to form the map of old Cairo and secure mosaic pieces known to be found in its three great mosques.  As the city is developed, the players will reveal hidden followers, temples and leaders in the &amp;quot;Cult of Akhenaton.&amp;quot;  These hidden features are scored both during in-game play and the final &amp;quot;end game&amp;quot; round.  Only with a carefully planned strategy and well execute tactics will the player be able to amass the largest collection of mosaic pieces and reveal its hidden secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
