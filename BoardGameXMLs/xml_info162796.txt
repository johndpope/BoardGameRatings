			<description>This is an expansion for the game 'Hammered' where you play as a group of dwarves on a pub-crawl. This expansion adds a magical theme to the core game with a new character, new tavern and wizard themed event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays the same however the addition of this expansion throws in some new rules. The new character has a perk, the new tavern has a house rule and there are a couple of cards that allow other players to acquire the perk as well. The tavern's house rule makes gold lost or spent inside the tavern turn into other commodities and the perk allows players to spend gold in order to make other players forfeit! There is also an additional rule that only comes into play if the card is drawn which makes the winner of the game perform a challenge before they can be crowned victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
