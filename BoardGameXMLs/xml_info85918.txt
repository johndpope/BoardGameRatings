							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scions of the Holy Triad</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eschewing the idea of a fractured pantheon in which each deity stands on its own, the Scions of the Holy Triad, a group of warrior-priests venerating equally the gods of War, Fortune and Protection, seek to return to a golden age when the gods were worshipped in unison and their strengths combined for the betterment of the mortal realm. Though a young group in the land, the Scions have made an impact, drawing to their ranks a community of like-minded individuals bent on uniting the worship of the gods, as well as the enmity of those opposed to their goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scions of the Holy Triad details a drop-in organization for your d20 Fantasy game, complete with history, tenets, organizational structures, ways of joining, and ready-to-use NPCs. It also includes a new prestige class&amp;mdash;the Triad Scion&amp;mdash;a new feat, a new exotic weapon, three new domains and four new spells, including two spell variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
