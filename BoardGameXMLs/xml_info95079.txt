			<description>Two dice games, coming with a double sided felt mat as game board, 8 dice and 7 pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In boxing, the players roll their punching dice simultaneously; the player with the higher punch value after three rolls wins the round. After 15 rounds the game ends and the player with most rounds won wins the game. When you roll extremely lucky with your punching dice, a KO result is also possible, thus ending the game earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Basketball you try to maneuver your pawn into a possible scoring space on the playing mat by rolling the dice, and from there you may score by rolling higher than the number on the space. The dice also cover defense rolls, fouls and rebounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
