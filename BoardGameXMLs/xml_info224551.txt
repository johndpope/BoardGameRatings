			<description>Travel back to the 1920's to the year of Prohibition. The Golden Age of Moonshine. Secure your still site. Gather your supplies and produce 3 runs of  'Shine and you win. But beware, other competitors will be raiding your supplies or sabotaging your still site, government Revenuers will be stalking the woods looking to destroy your operation. Bribe them, dodge them, just stay ahead of them, because moonshine season is short and the longer you wait the weather is going to get worse. No one ever said being a Moonshiner was easy, but becoming a legend never was!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect a set of one of each Supply Cards (Corn, Water, Activators), to exchange for a Makin' Shine Run Card. Along the way, avoid Revenuer Cards and resolve any Event Cards that appear.
