			<description>CORX is a 2-4 player strategy board game for players of all ages. The game pieces include a wood game board, 2 dice (for the dice version), and 24 cork games pieces (hence, the name CORX). The instructions detail the dice version of CORX, which adds the element of chance, and the no-dice version (which involves moving your game pieces a pre-determined number of spaces each turn) that will appeal more to the serious chess, checkers, or go players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to march your games pieces across the game board, capturing other players' corx, avoiding capture of your own, and trying to capture another player's &amp;quot;Base&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game pieces can be moved in any direction. Players can protect their own game pieces by forming &amp;quot;Blocks&amp;quot;, and the player who occupies &amp;quot;Center Space&amp;quot; has special privileges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a base is captured, and players then add up their points. The player with the highest score wins (which is often not the player who has ended the game by capturing a Base).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Match&amp;quot; play involves playing 3 games, with the person who has the most match points winning the Match. Match points are awarded for each game won, and for having the most total game points. It is highly recommended that CORX be played in matches, as that adds another strategic dimension to the game. Because the winner of a match is determined by who has the most &amp;quot;match points&amp;quot; (instead of whoever wins 2 out of 3 games), players need to assess the &amp;quot;big picture&amp;quot; before making the decision to end a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corx with dice works best with 3-4 players. Corx without dice works best with 2-3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
