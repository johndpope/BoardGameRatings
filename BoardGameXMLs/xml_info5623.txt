			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step right up folks, and roll the dice! Roll'em fast and roll'em right.  ZAP!'  It's a glittering casino right in your own home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get dice tokens to start the game, and the object is to get just one into the center of the board by rolling the correct sequences.  Sounds easy? It's not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The danger of the game is when your opponent gets hot and blows you right off the board.  But remember, the wheel of fortune spins both ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll snake eyes on the come-out and you're an automatic winner!  Any other double dice roll, a 1-1, 2-2, etc., elimiates the competition.  As you move closer to the middle of the board, it's more difficult to advance.  You might get a little frustrated, you might get very frustrated.  But hang in there, kiss those dice, and let 'em roll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you zap or get zapped, ZAP' is a lively night for all takers!  2 to 6 can play, only one can win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
