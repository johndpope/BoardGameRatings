							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Private Railroad Car, 1900-1935</name>
									
			<description>From Loren Wiseman's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before private aircraft, the private railroad car was the ultimate emblem of status, prestige, and power. They enabled business magnates, movie stars, and the wealthy and well-connected to avoid rubbing elbows with the hoi polloi while traveling. The first example is based on a car built for a railroad president 1916. It remained in service (with occasional repairs and improvements) with the original owner until 1935. This floorplan is suitable for pulp adventures, Call of Cthulhu scenarios, and any other RPG or miniatures game set in the first third of the 20th Century. It might be used by a wealthy patron, a millionaire businessman, a politician, a celebrity, or a well-connected mad scientist. Both floorplans are presented at 1/60th scale, or 1/5&amp;quot; = 1 foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this book describes a Mobile Headquarters car, suitable for use by a well-equipped band of adventurers or soldiers of fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
