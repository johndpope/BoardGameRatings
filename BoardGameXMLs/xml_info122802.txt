							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trivial Pursuit: Hitradio Ã–3</name>
									
			<description>This is a promotional edition of the classic trivia game Trivial Pursuit, published by an Austrian radio station to celebrate its thirtieth birthday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 250 trivia cards with 6 questions each from the following categories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue: Radio, TV und Kinohits (Radio, TV and movie hits)&lt;br/&gt;Pink: &amp;Ouml;3erlei (specific questions about the radio station)&lt;br/&gt;Yellow: Popgeschichte &amp;amp; Hitparade (Pop history &amp;amp; hit parade)&lt;br/&gt;Brown: Prominente &amp;amp; Austro-Stars (Celebrities &amp;amp; Austrian stars)&lt;br/&gt;Green: Sport (Sports)&lt;br/&gt;Orange: Zeitgeschehen &amp;amp; Politik (Events of the day &amp;amp; politics)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player gets a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes (standard Trivial Pursuit issue). There is no game board. A special six-sided die showing the six colors mentioned above is rolled by the player on turn. The color tells from which category the question comes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player on turn can answer the question, he gets another turn and, if he does not has it already, the corresponding colored pie piece which he puts in his playing piece. If he answers wrong, it's the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect all colors wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it can be played stand-alone, the set is fully compatible with every other Trivial Pursuit game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
