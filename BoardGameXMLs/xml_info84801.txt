			<description>C.O.R.E. is a first-person shooter video game that was released in Europe on March 27, 2009 and in North America on August 11, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story begins in the year 2028, when a massive meteor impacts California's Mojave Desert. Over the next two decades, an underground research facility is built to examine the extraterrestrial origins and the bizarre effects that the meteor is having on the natural environment and the people who come in contact with it. The game takes place twenty years after the meteor's arrival on earth, 2048, when all communications are lost with the C.O.R.E. facility. After completion of the game an epilogue is viewed that shows the main character heading straight to a moon. On it lies a giant hexagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes local multiplayer through the use of either a single game cartridge or multiple cartridges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;C.O.R.E.
