			<description>Each player has a snake which is made of colorful pearls. The game has no board, instead, a starting line and a finish line are determined at the players' discretion. The snakes are laid out at the starting line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls two color dice in his/her turn, then moves one end of his/her snake forward until the two colors are adjacent to each other. The first snake to reach the finish line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is luck-driven, but there is minimal decision making for the kids, as they have to understand which end they should move forward in order to go faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
