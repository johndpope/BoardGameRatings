							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: Second Succession War</name>
									
			<description>By 2821, the &amp;quot;Great Succession War&amp;quot; has ground to a halt, the participants seeking desperate respite and to forge a new peace and hope for mankind. Yet not everyone shares this ideal and soon secret machinations undermine the peace efforts and propel the Inner Sphere into a new round of violence. Soon brother will be set against brother and madness will reign once more: The Second Succession War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second Succession War covers the aftermath of the titanic First Succession War and the Great Houses efforts to survive before the machinations of Conrad Toyama propel them into a new round of blood-letting. Detailing the efforts to build a peace while preparing for a new war, this volume showcases the causes and consequences of the Second Succession War, as well as the politics and stresses between and within the Great Houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
