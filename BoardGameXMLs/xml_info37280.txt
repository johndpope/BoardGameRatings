							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Get Stuck</name>
									
			<description>Get Stuck is a cross between a card game and a board game.  Lay out 48 cards in a 7x7 grid with a gap in the center. One player plays black and one plays red.  Each player moves their own color card into the gap and turns it face down. Then the next player does the same.  The first player to &amp;quot;get stuck&amp;quot; and not be able to move a card loses the round and takes a point penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get Stuck can be played with 2 players or with 4 using the partnership rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
