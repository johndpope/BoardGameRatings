			<description>BEETLE RUN is Soleau Software's exciting arcade hit based on it's popular award winning DOS game 'Ant Run'. This windows version is a race against the clock as you rotate paths for the beetle to run across. Quick thinking and fast reflexes are required to keep the beetle scurrying across the leaf board. Gain extra points for bonus grids and other items as you try for the Top Ten High Scores. Beetle Run has sound card support, beautiful SVGA animation and is filled with educational beetle facts. It's Soleau Software's most addictive game yet! Fun for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
