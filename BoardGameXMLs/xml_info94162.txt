			<description>Introduction from cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automania (Manic Mechanic)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O.K. Wally try and get it right this time! All you have to do is get these car parts from the store, take them to the assemble area and put 'em together, Simple, INNIT? If you had bought decent shelving units things wouldn't keep falling off would they Wally, and if the gangplanks seem to have a mind of their own 'appen it's 'cause you're a Wally, Wally. If you put things back in their right places you wouldn't have to jump over them to get what you want. With your flat hat, beer belly and oversize boots you really are a Wally, Wally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You as Wally Week have ten cars to build, each consisting of 6 parts. You will begin in the store area with tyres bouncing around and a tidy robot to harrass you. You must go to the stock room, identify the parts required, and go up the ladders to each level to collect them (moving over the part will collect it). The gangplanks are none too safe and you must jump the gaps to reach the relevant parts.  There are various items strewn on the floors which again you have to jump over. These appear in different places on each screeb, so the game is a constant challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will then return to the assembly area to place the parts in their correct position on the car, but to deposit the upper parts of the car (e.g. windscreen, roof etc.) you will have to jump in the correct position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will start with 3 lives and gain an extra life for each car you complete. Hoewever, you also have a time limit on each car part and will lose a life if you exceed this limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right Wally, away you go!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
