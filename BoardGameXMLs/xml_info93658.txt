			<description>This game is currently seeking publishers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblin Factory is a cooperative tile-laying puzzle game for 1-6 players that can be played in less than ten minutes.  Players take on the role of industrious goblins.  A Challenge card drawn from the Challenge card deck determines what sort of machine the players must build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing two tiles from a community pile and adding one card to the machine.  The other tile is discarded.  This represents parts coming down a conveyor belt faster than can be grabbed and bolted/welded/hammered onto the machine.  Parts are added by matching color-coded shapes on the edges of the tiles.  The players must work together in this fast-paced game to beat the clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most challenges are only three minutes long.  A single game can take less than five minutes to set up, shuffle, and play!  There are also rules and challenges for competitive play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
