			<description>From the Inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base of the Cosmic Guerillas, Black Star, a huge industrial complex lodged on an asteroid. Tracing down the complex had taken some time, you had to spend time recovering from your last mission in hospital while you grew a new arm an leg this had given you time to trace the Black Star Base and had also given time to have your Svlegian Raider rebuilt with some modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now you are hanging in space over the enormous complex of metal structures priming yourself for your run down the metal valley to bomb the main energy supply of the Black Star Base. Your hands glide knowledgably over the controls and your eyes scan over the instrument display. It is time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You drop your Svlegian Raider down toward the Base, leaving your stomach about five kilometers behind, then you are suddenly surrounded by the walls of the base, walls bristling with technology. you fire on the energy ducts which fly past at incredible speed, explosions mushroom around you and the rear scanner is showing following craft, your increase speed and fire at the ducts, dodging from side to side of the narrow corridor down which you are flying, the metal walls outside your craft disappear in a blur of speed and you are angling out of the metal valley, arcing up and over to bring yourself into position ready for the next run on the Black Star...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Star was written by M. Sudworth and released by Quicksilva for the Sinclair ZX81.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action is reminiscent of the climactic scene from Star Wars: A New Hope - the Death Star Trench Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player pilots a ship into the screen, which depicts a 3D trench. The player can speed up or slow down the ship. Flying faster will take you over more of the targets before the time-limit expires, offering you a chance for a higher score, but of course makes them harder to hit with your limited supply of bombs. In addition, going faster depletes your fuel more quickly, so you may run out of fuel before the timer runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
