			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A board game based on an anime that is not to be named too obviously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players run back and forth on a crumbling bridge, between the flying ship and the island in the sky. Each turn, the player rolls dice and decides which to use for movement and which to use for destroying the bridge. The removed bridge tiles can become items and whatever the players find on the island will decide what points they will get for what items. The players can also bump into each other and steal items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
