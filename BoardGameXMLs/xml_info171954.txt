			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we sit down across the table from a group of players &amp;ndash; whether they are lifelong friends or merely gaming buddies, we are taking on a role. Across the table from us sit a group of people who have appointed us as caretakers of their trust, their imaginations, and indeed a good many of their evenings for the coming weeks &amp;ndash; perhaps months or even years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By taking on this role, you take on the responsibility to tell a great and engaging story, to keep the momentum in a world, to make it all link together in a way that is believable, fun, and rewarding, earn the trust of your players, and finally, how to build and keep your integrity as a Storyteller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 47 Tips and Tricks listed below are intended to help you do just that. In the following sections, we will address five primary methods to become a great RPG Storyteller:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     How to tell a story.&lt;br/&gt;     How to keep your game engaging.&lt;br/&gt;     How to tie it all together.&lt;br/&gt;     How to earn and keep the trust of your players.&lt;br/&gt;     How to establish and keep narrative integrity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, our aim is to provide players and game masters alike with tools and ideas to help inspire their next game session. We hope you enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
