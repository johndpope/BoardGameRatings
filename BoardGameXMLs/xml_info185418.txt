			<description>After our hero Blast conquered 10 bosses from his previous encounter, another wave of epic bosses came down to earth to cause chaos and destruction. This time these bosses doubled their numbers and are way bigger and badder! Totally unique bosses with different abilities that will force Blast to use a different upgrade system.&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade suits and collect different items and help Blast become the baddest looking hero there is.&lt;br/&gt;Be sure to ask a friend to help you defeat these bosses as we also have included an option to enable 2nd player to join you on defeating bosses.&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for three game modes to conquer, Normal, Hard and Insane!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
