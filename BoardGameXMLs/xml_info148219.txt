							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower of Babble</name>
									
			<description>Tower of Babble is a language education game. On a turn a player draws a card which has words in French and Spanish on one side and attempts to guess what they mean in English. (There are pictures which may help.) If a player guesses correctly they are paid chips by the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards can also be placed on the players' individual mats, matching symbols on the cards to symbols on the mats. The object of this is to complete meaningful sentences in French or Spanish in rows of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are provided for solitaire play and several variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
