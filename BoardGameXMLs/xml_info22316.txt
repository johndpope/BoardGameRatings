			<description>This game is for ages 4 to 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a card that shows a three-by-three arrangement of nine common objects that have left/right symmetry - flower, butterfly, bridge, pants, etc.  However, the cards show only the left half of the objects.  The three card columns have one, two, or three dots at their top; the rows are marked with square, circle, triangle.  There are 36 tiles that show the right half of the objects on the cards.  These are placed face up (easy) or face down (hard) in the play area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two dice, one with 1/2/3 dots and the other with square/triangle/circle on the faces, are rolled.  The players must find the tiles that match the objects on their card corresponding to the intersection shown on the dice. Once found they put them on the card to complete the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Older children might enjoy having the tiles face down to add some memory challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
