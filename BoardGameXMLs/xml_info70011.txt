			<description>Super Crusaders Is a superhero role playing game. &lt;br/&gt;Characters are created using classes (which determine thier stats) and powers purchased with Power Ups. &lt;br/&gt;Action resolution uses 6 sided dice. the number of dice rolled is always equal to the Stat being used (1,2,or 3) a roll or 1-4 is a failure, a roll of 5-10 is a success and a roll of 11+ is a critical success.&lt;br/&gt;The Game is not built around a particular setting. Instead encouraging GMs to create thier own settings and providing many guidlines to help him do so. The City of Technopolis is provided as an example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Edition of Super Crusaders is complete in one book and replaces an earlier edition that was in 3 books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: I am Lee Walser, The Last Crusader, Creator of Super Crusaders RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
