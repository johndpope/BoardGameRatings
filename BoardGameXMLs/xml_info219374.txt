			<description>Chickens and foxes are at play in Chicken out!, with players taking turns revealing cards from their decks, adding (or subtracting) values to a generally escalating sum, and hoping not to exceed 21 because then the active player has to take all the revealed cards. Players can choose to chicken out and not risk failure, but sometimes you'll need to take a chance to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four kinds of foxes lie in wait among the cards, and they can mix up the revealed sum, counting as the last number played, escalating the sum to 20, or resetting the sum to zero to start the tension rising all over again. Play out all your cards to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
