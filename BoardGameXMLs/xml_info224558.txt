			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regicide is a board game for 2 players that are looking for strategically challenging game play. It combines elements of deck building, resource management, and combat. The setting is medieval low-fantasy and is designed to have strong elements of realistic battle. All cards and effects are there to represent realistic situations that could arise, not simply to further game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take control of a leader selected from one of the main warring houses. From this selection they are then able to choose from a selection of other cards which will help them overcome their opponent including: troop cards, combat cards, region cards, and kingdom cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in reality, with the exception of very rare prominent units, the majority of troops available to both sides are similarly trained and equipped; it is their use within wider tactical decisions that determines their effectiveness on the battlefield. This leaves victory down to the guile of the player (and maybe a slice of luck) rather than the deck alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
