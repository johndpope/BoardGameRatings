			<description>Players serve themselves letter tiles from a bowl with a spoon. The object of this phase is to get as many tiles as possible but players risk being accused of not being genteel and forfeiting tiles if they have more than 35.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player then tries to make as many words as possible from their letters within three minutes. Points are scored for the number of syllables created. There is then a three-minute partnership round in which pairs of partners make as many words as they can from their shared existing words and their pooled unused tiles. The winners are the partners with the highest combined scores from both rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simpler variants are offered for children and for solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
