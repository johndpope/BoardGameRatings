							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild Cards</name>
									
			<description>Wild Cards are a collection of rules for games that utilize a deck of 52 playing cards. Each card contains the rules for a unique game made up by Nick Pace. I have played these a few times at parties and with family after being challenged to make up some good social games. Think of these as a replacement for the useless joker cards that accompany every box of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artwork is all done by my friend JP, which is based upon a concept sketch I give him. He does a great job with the cartoon graphics since these games are meant for people of ages 8+. Great for family outings, waits at the airport, and parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
