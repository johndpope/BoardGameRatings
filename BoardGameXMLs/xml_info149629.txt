							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City of 10 Rings</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The traveller&amp;rsquo;s spirits rose high as he stood before the gate and rapped a light rap; but hearing no answer he knocked a second knock and a third; yet there came no sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So strengthening his heart he cried aloud, &amp;ldquo;Hail , ye people of the city! I am a stranger and a way farer; have you no honour or hospitality?&amp;rdquo; He repeated his cry a second time and a third; but still there came no reply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tale of the Cursed Prince ~ The 1001 Nights&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of 10 Rings is a great metropolis of dark fantasy and eccentric NPCs. Within the pages are sections devoted to each of the 10 areas (or rings) of the city, that describe 100 pathways, 100 locations and 100 possible events that could occur when exploring - to give a Tale-Weaver inspiration for 1001 adventure-seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of 10 Rings can be used as an idea-generator for whenever PCs encounter a large, mysterious city. It also introduces additional names and NPC's for use within the Nights of the Crusades setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example of an event is the following:&lt;br/&gt;The Ring of Silver: Event 4 - Starving Beggar-Child: A crying child passes by. Her torn feet kick dust onto her ragged robe, and she reeks of filth and pomegranate. If the PCs seek to help her, they will find that she is looking for her golden bird. Locating the bird will take the PCs through a number of locations within the city &amp;ndash; quick and cunning characters have the best chance to catch it. If the PCs can return the child&amp;rsquo;s bird, she will thank them and ask for a gift of charity. If the characters refuse her request, the starving child will snap the bird&amp;rsquo;s neck and eat it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
