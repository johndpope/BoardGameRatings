			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 16 inch by 20 inch, floor plan of a Bio Lab, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I gave it a maximum dose of tranquilizers and it&amp;rsquo;s still attacking the containment walls. I need marines NOW!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Terrified Scientist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bio lab is a small biological containment area with a small tropical biome in the center for monitoring and experimentation on newly found biological life on a mostly tropical world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bio lab is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bio lab is designed for use with our SciFi Floor Tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primal Instincts: In investigating a tropical world, humanity has come across an extremely strong, aggressive, four-armed ape-like race. Marines captured one of them alive from a brutal first encounter and sent them up to the ship by putting it into cold sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists studied the creature in cold sleep in the cryo room, making sedatives and tranquilizers for the creature&amp;rsquo;s biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To test the sedative, they had marines bring the monster to a Bio lab containment facility with a tropical biome simulating the atmosphere on the planet below. The creature was fully awakened and the scientist then injected the tranquilizers into its circulatory system. At first it seemed to have an effect, but soon the creature became very violent and attacked the containment walls, starting to shatter the glass. The scientist stabbed it with even more sedatives, but it did nothing to do the creature in its heightened, adrenaline fueled berserk state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientist calls for marines to subdue but not kill the creature as it shatters the glass and rips the hoses of the containment controls. The player characters need to capture the four-armed ape-like creature a second time in the full height of its rage and try to keep the scientist alive. Making it even more dangerous is that the tropical biome on the planet is hazardous to human life if exposed for a short period of time. As the room fills with gases from the planet below, it gets harder and harder to breathe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
