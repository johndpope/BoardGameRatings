							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1 vs. 100 Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the NBC game show of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 Players - One is a contestant and the other is host. The contestant answers trivia questions. The host draws from the mob deck and records the contestant's winnings and mob players out on a right answer. The contestant must decide to quit or play on, because a wrong answer will cost the contestant everything. They switch roles after one game. (Note: A contestant can play up to 12 questions, even if the contestant eliminates 100 mob members.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player - Same as above, except the following: extra players are the mob, the mob doesn't have to answer the questions, and they split the money from the contestant when the contestant gives a wrong answer. Game ends when everyone plays each role at least once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either way, the person with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains 400 questions, mob deck, and score pad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
