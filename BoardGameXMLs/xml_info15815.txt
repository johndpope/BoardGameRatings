							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FAST Boxing</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAST Boxing is a round by round game in which fighter&amp;rsquo;s will perform uncannily close their real life abilities. In FAST Boxing, fighters are rated for scoring ability, punching power, endurance, defense, ability to absorb punishment, ability to be knocked down or knocked out, and even how their reputation as a fighter affects the judges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAST Boxing features all of the nuances of professional boxing that you see in real life bouts. Quick KO&amp;rsquo;s, TKO&amp;rsquo;s, close decisions, will all occur on your tabletop with real life accuracy with FAST Boxing. As in real life boxing, ANYTHING can happen, but you won&amp;rsquo;t see the flash KO&amp;rsquo;s and huge upsets with regularity in FAST Boxing, like you do with other boxing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
