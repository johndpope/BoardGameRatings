			<description>Robot Empire is a strategy and battle card game set in a large space age universe where Robot armies battle it out for control of the galaxy. Use Super Weapons, Human Agents, Upgrade Components, Base Equipment, and Monster Mercenaries to wage your war. Power Management is crucial in the game as you will need to mine for Power Coins to obtain enough energy to run your empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards have beautiful and colorful imagery right out of 1950s science fiction. Players will easily get emerged into the genre of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players spend their Power Coins (earned by minting or mining or landing on Mining Moon cards)to bring out fighters like Robots or Monster Mercenaries that can attack opponent's. Building a strong Base (Base cards form the back row on tabletop) allows players to shoot Long Range Weapons, Use Force Fields for extra defense, and create Power Coins. Players can customize their draw decks to follow different strategies and playing styles. A player looses Life Points when attacking fighters are not blocked. When a player reaches zero Life Points, they are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
