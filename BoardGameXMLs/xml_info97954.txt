			<description>70 cards, each featuring an ingredient to a 'balanced' meal. Plus there are 28 Wild Cards with four different actions.&lt;br/&gt;Players collect a meal which should be one card from the different coloured ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;For example, you might try to collect a Green 1 (Mixed Vegetables), a Green 2 (Salad), a Green 3 (Corn on the Cob with Butter) and a Green 4 (Stirfry Vegetables). The publisher is a large organization that sells frozen food, so all the 20 different ingredients are things they would like to sell to you, so not every meal collected will be as healthy as the Green example (lots of chips and burgers!).&lt;br/&gt;The Wild Cards are All Change (all players pass their hand to the player on their left), Lose Hand (a player has to discard his hand and start collecting again), Wild (can represent any ingredient card) and Go Shopping (you can draw one card from any player you choose).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
