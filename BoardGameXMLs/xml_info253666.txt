							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Let Them Eat Shapes</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Let Them Eat Shapes&amp;quot; is a print and play, and entirely abstract, version of the game Let Them Eat Shrimp. The game board (which is printed on one sheet of paper) has hexagonal spaces, many of which contain shapes that are either hexagons or may be combined to make hexagons. You begin with 4 shapes in your supply and players take turns &amp;quot;placing&amp;quot; them onto the board (i.e., by filling in matching shapes on the board). If you fill in shapes on the board, you gain that shape and mark it as acquired in your supply. When there are no shapes to get from the board, the game ends and players tally their scores. The player with the most points win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players familiar with Let Them Eat Shrimp will almost immediately understand the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
