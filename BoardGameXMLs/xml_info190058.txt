It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1549; Stage One: Ryan Rhodes; Stage Two: Russell Borogrove; Stage Three: Joshua Fox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules text: &lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been ten million years since the humans left this Earth. They left it polluted, exhausted,&lt;br/&gt;spent. Irradiated ruins, acidic oceans, scarred earth and mountains of waste.&lt;br/&gt;While the humans floated through the ether, held in stasis in their hermetic capsules, the Earth&lt;br/&gt;has endured. She has lived on, transformed, evolved. Those same malignant forces the&lt;br/&gt;humans unleashed have shaped the Earth&amp;rsquo;s development. And in ten million years we have&lt;br/&gt;evolved &amp;ndash; the Sapients, the new masters of this old planet.&lt;br/&gt;We are as diverse as we are intelligent. We are resourceful and adaptive. This Earth is not one&lt;br/&gt;the humans would recognize, but it is our home. And now, we must defend it.&lt;br/&gt;After ten million years, the humans have returned. They have come to make a new home on a&lt;br/&gt;new Earth, to settle and expand and consume and conquer. Can the ragtag,&lt;br/&gt;disunited Sapient&lt;br/&gt;coalition save the earth from humanity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
