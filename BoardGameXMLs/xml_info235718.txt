							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Saburo</name>
									
			<description>Orochi&amp;rsquo;s gift presents differently in all her worthy followers, it might be a reflection of an individual&amp;rsquo;s persona or of Orochi&amp;rsquo;s intentions for them, subtly crafting the recipient into a tool in the service of their god. If Saburo were a tool it would be a scalpel, fashioned of Minimoto steel. This cool and calm servant of the Ito was once a temple bushi, and as all who demonstrate their devotion was chosen to receive the gift. The physical training that is integral to the training of the Orochi temple bushi was only further enhanced after his transformation into a hebimiman. Now the frightening warrior of the Ito emerges from the shadows to dispatch the enemies of the Ito, disappearing just as fast leaving his foes shocked and with no target for retaliation.    &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
