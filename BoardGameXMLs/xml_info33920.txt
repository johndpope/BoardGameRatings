			<description>The primary game represents a struggle for supremacy, in which America and Europe are allied against Asia and Africa.  Cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the deck is turned up.  The continent of this card, and its allied continent, are &amp;quot;crowned&amp;quot; and have higher value. Players play to a trick, following with the same continent, if possible.  High card, taking into account value and whether the card is &amp;quot;crowned,&amp;quot; takes the trick.  When cards are exhausted, points are totaled, and high score wins the round and 1 point.  11 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for 5 different games are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
