							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wicked Wombats</name>
									
			<description>Wicked Wombats follows the easy principles of being the first to get rid of your cards. When it&amp;rsquo;s your turn, you can either throw a card of the same type or of the same color on the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sounds a little bit like UNO to you? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re right: But unlike UNO or any other game we know, every single card you throw to the pile is an &amp;lsquo;Evil Action Card.&amp;rsquo; And that is just where the real fun begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Evil Action Cards&amp;rsquo; are really, really evil: They hit hard and may change the whole game, and even effect yourself. This is fun and frustrating at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can shield the action cards or even mirror them to other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards can even be combined cleverly to be even more wicked. This is where the game gets a tactical flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards require immediate action. Be fast to strike. Otherwise, you&amp;rsquo;ll lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the hand cards, each player gets a set of three sharp weapon cards: sword, bomb and knife. If Wombat Combat is on: Choose consciously and remember: Knife beats Bomb, Bomb beats Pistol, Pistol beats Sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
