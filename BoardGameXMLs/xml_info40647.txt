			<description>From the game insert: &amp;quot;LinguaFun is an exciting learning tool that combines the effectiveness of audio language tapes and flash cards with the fun of many popular card games.  From the very first game you play, you will be speaking a foreign language using this unique and proven method.  Available in Italian, French, Spanish, German, and Ingles.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with cards and a pronunciation CD.  The cards come in three colors, are numbered with digits and the word for that number in the foreign language, and contain a word or phrase with a phonetic guide and English translation.  Rules come for using these cards to play Solitaire, Crazy Colors, Concentration, Gin Rummy, Go Fish, and War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
