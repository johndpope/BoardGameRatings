			<description>Party Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 cards are placed around the room and guests are encouraged to play the game. Each card shows a spectacularly ugly man and, at first glance, seem the same but they are not. In fact, there are 12 matching pairs and so it becomes a game of observation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The host or hostess announces the start of the game and players must rush to complete their list. The first guest to find all 12 pairs correctly, wins. The host or hostess should have a small prize for the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
