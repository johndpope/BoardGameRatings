			<description>Ready to push your luck? Then reach for the Lucky Dice and try your chances. The game lasts five rounds with each player taking a turn in each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start a turn, a player grabs and rolls two or three dice from the bag. From that point on, the player has a choice of stopping and scoring points, or drawing and rolling three more dice. If a player ever has three of the same number or color showing, that player's turn ends and she scores nothing &amp;mdash; unless she also has a die face that shows &amp;quot;Free (number)&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Free (color)&amp;quot;, in which case that number or color can't bust her for the turn. If a player has used all 18 dice in the bag, she must stop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine a score for the round, first remove all of the &amp;quot;Free ____&amp;quot; dice, then sum the digits on the dice that remain. If, however, you've rolled one or both of the lucky dice in the bag, your score might be boosted (or halved). A &amp;quot;1:5&amp;quot; on a lucky die, for example, means that 1s give you five points instead of one. A &amp;quot;1/2&amp;quot; means that your sum is halved, but if you roll both &amp;quot;1/2&amp;quot; symbols, then your score is doubled instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score after five rounds wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
