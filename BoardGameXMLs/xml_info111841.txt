			<description>Top Promoter is a new card game for 3-5 players in which players try to make more money than their opponents. By putting their fighters in the best position for the big payday, players increase their chances of victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his own deck of 15 fighters and five action cards. Each round, players simultaneously play a fighter face-down, then reveal them at the same time. These cards get played into locations that are in the center of the table following certain rules. Once a location has three fights, the fights are resolved through dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each fighter has a number of dice he rolls that can be modified with action cards or by fighting in his home location. The number of dice can range from 1-7 dice, and whoever rolls the single highest die wins! However, some fighters have a signature move that will guarantee victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top Promoter is a light game that inspires trash talking and cheering as the underdog takes down the favorite!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
