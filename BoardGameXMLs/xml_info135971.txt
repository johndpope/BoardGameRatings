			<description>The Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutt&amp;rsquo;s been selected to enter the Labyrinth of Chaos and embark on the greatest adventure of his uneventful life. He's not happy about it. Why should he have to go and get the pizza?&lt;br/&gt;Like most of us he just can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered going himself. He&amp;rsquo;ll have some if you're making it anyway, or indeed, if there&amp;rsquo;s some going spare; he&amp;rsquo;ll even go if someone goes with him, but don&amp;rsquo;t ask him to do it by himself he just can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered and anyway it&amp;rsquo;s just not fair!&lt;br/&gt;The world is against him as well!&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like you&amp;rsquo;ve parked your car in the same space in the office car park for the last five years. You&amp;rsquo;ve had the same car all that time and you&amp;rsquo;re on first name terms with the attendant &amp;lsquo;George&amp;rsquo; who always salutes you with a &amp;lsquo;Morning sir&amp;rsquo; as you pass through the gate 8.48 am sharp day in, day out. Then one day you forget your pass. George won&amp;rsquo;t let you in, claiming you could be anyone and that, of course it&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;morethanmyjobsworth!&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;You get the picture?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
