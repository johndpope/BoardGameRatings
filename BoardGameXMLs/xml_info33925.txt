			<description>A game for the piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an interstellar explorer your mission is to colonize more planets then the other species before you run out of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the tiles from the piecepack set as suns and planets, players take turns attempting to colonize planets. Each turn, players can perform one of the following actions: Draw and place a planet, Colonize a planet, Roll die and move ship, Play a coin and move ship, or Restore power reserves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has no more coins left.
