							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">N30: We Are Winning â€“ The Battle of Seattle</name>
									
			<description>A game of the &amp;quot;Battle of Seattle&amp;quot; in 1999. Two players, 11x17&amp;quot; map, 168 counters. 13 pages of rules &amp;amp; 7 of notes. This is a complete redesign of N30 I and N30 II at a more detailed scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;N30 portrays the morning blockades of November 30th. Two players represent the opposing sides; one represents protesters; the other represents the police, with their incident commanders, Assistant Chief Ed Joiner and Captain Jim Pugel. The protesters aim to show that non-violent direct action can work, show that networked organizations can defeat hierarchical ones, and bring media attention to the issues. The police try to break the blockades and allow the conference to open as planned.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each turn represents 10 minutes. Each protester cluster represents 20-30 protesters, of whom 10-15 may be arrestables; each police hard or soft squad represents 10-15 police; each police mounted squad represents 6 police and each police chemical team represents 4 police (usually with 1 armored car). The police forces include most of the units of the Demonstration Management Team. They also include squads scrambled from the Convention Center venue (and/or other police units in the area).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
