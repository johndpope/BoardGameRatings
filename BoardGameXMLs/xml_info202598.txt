			<description>English translation of product description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playset takes place in the Caribbean of 1672, during the Golden Age of Piracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The military power of imperial Spain in the New World is in decline, while the English, French and Dutch are rising as colonial powers. In the Caribbean, it falls to the governors to confront new threats. The islands change from dream to stew and these countries can only send token military forces, so some governors are forced to enlist the help of buccaneers as mercenaries and corsairs to defend their colonies and markets not only from other nations, but from the multitude of pirate ships that dwell in the region as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of these ships, The Lady Lisbeth, has put into port at Santa Catalina in search of a little fun and supplies before a long voyage out to sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playset is written in Spanish and is not available in English and uses art recycled from Jason Morningstar's Fiasco playset covers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
