							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern: 101 Occult Books</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern: 101 Occult Books provides the Game Master with just what its name implies: 101 different books that can be used in any occult-based campaign or adventure. The books presented here are all real or based on real-world books. That is, each of the following books exists in the real world, although the veracity of their contents depends greatly on one's worldview. In any event, they make excellent additions to any Modern game, giving the GM dozens of books to use in a wide variety of ways. With this product, creating memorable occult adventures became that much easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 17-page PDF is suitable for any Modern campaign that deals in the occult and supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
