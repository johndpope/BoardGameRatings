			<description>A 2-player abstract game, designed by C. W. Cowsley and distributed by Applied Technology in 1989. The game consists of twelve top-hat shaped tokens (10 yellow numbered from 1-10, 1 red and 1 blue), the instructions, and a green cloth bag which doubles up as a double-sided game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays as Red, the other as Blue. The object of the game is to capture the highest total of numbered yellow tokens, without your own token being captured by your opponent. The tokens are designed so that they can be easily pressed together, so that the players' red and blue tokens gradually accumulate a stack of yellow tokens underneath them as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of ten circles, connected by lines in a geometric pattern. There are two variant configurations, one printed on each side of the cloth bag. The game is played in two phases: firstly, each player alternately places one numbered token on a circle until all ten have been placed; secondly players take turns moving their red or blue token along the lines from circle to circle, capturing tokens as they move, until either all ten numbered tokens have been captured - or one player has blundered allowing their own token to be captured! The advantage of going first is mitigated by placing an upper limit on the first token that the starting player may capture - in the basic game, this is fixed at 6; in the advanced game this is decided by auction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
