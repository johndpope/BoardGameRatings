			<description>This game was designed for the 24-Hour Game Design Contest - June 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Thousand Years of Blood is a solitaire game where the player takes on the role of a superhuman in an alternate-universe future. After Hitler's assassination in 1944, a superhuman named Heinrich Kirchner took power over Nazi Germany. Under his reign, the Nazis took over the world. As a virtual immortal, Heinrich began a thousand-year Reich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a Nazi experiment with superhuman abilities of your own. And you plan to end Heinrich's rule and put a stop to his thousand-year plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires a simple PocketMod, a pencil, a d6, and a d8.  The player selects two of seven unique abilities, then uses the dice to randomly generate the maps of the three levels.  Actual gameplay in the first two levels in completely non-random, as the player seeks to move from the Start point of the map to the End point while taking as little damage as possible from the various enemies.  If you end your turn in an enemy's line of sight, you take damage, so watch out!  The third level is less about sneaking and more about combat, so there is more randomization--Heinrich teleports to different points on the map while activating Laser Turrets and blasting you with lightning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
