							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heretik Chess</name>
									
			<description>Heretik is a chess variant in which cards are used to improve abilities and undermine opponents. Unlike other chess card games, Heretik makes chess more elaborate without sacrificing the strategic elements of regular chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heretik begins like regular chess, but players draw a card after each move. These cards may be played, declared, or discarded to move in new ways, move multiple pieces at once, or even push your enemies off the edge of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are sixty unique cards available to download from the website. Playing Heretik requires two copies of each card and a regular chess set. You may also need extra pieces and pawns (or tokens to represent them), and a couple of small rocks that can be placed on the squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
