			<description>Box Information:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh no! The dreaded Trash Alien has captured Spot and littered the universe with garbage! Join our hero Blasternaut on a daring mission to rescue his robot pal. Blast your way through space junk, chase through dark and dangerous caverns, and fend off nasty alien creatures. Spot&amp;rsquo;s fate is in your hands &amp;ndash; good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math Blaster Episode I is an expanded version of New Math Blaster Plus! and the first title in the Math Blaster series to be released on consoles. The game is designed to teach children addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in a fun-filled adventure. There are 12 levels of problem difficulty, and the PC versions include an editor that allows users to create their own questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Episode I brings back the Trash Zapper, Number Recycler, and Math Blaster stages, and adds a new level &amp;ndash; Cave Runner. Players guide Blasternaut through a hazardous cavern that is littered with laser barriers. The barriers have a problem on each side, and Blasternaut must have a number that falls between the two solutions in order to pass (ex. if the sides were 3 + 1 and 4 + 5, Blasternaut would need a number between 4 and 9). Number droplets hang from the ceiling that allow players choose change their held number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Episode I also introduces Galactic Commander, or GC, for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
