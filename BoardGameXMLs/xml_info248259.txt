			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy a slice of the big city!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Slice: Strip Mall Paradise is a system generic product that details a chunk of a modern city. Larger than a neighborhood but not quite a district, this area provides over 80 detailed locations for the Game Master (GM) to work with. True to its name, this product features a commercial zone that is full of strip malls. You will also find some other goodies here, including car lots, fast food drive thrus, a hospital, and a few gas stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the focus is on providing a bite sized urban location for current settings it is possible to use this for apocalypse style settings if the GM wishes. City Slice offers a glimpse of what the location was like before the fall of society,&lt;br/&gt;setting the stage of what the characters may find there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
