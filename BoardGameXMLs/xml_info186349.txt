							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Why Are We Here? These Things Are Already Dead!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things are becoming progressively worse throughout the Lands of Igpay... progressively more evil and corrupt, and progressively harder to rectify and restore. Can you stop this progressive decline? Its only the fate of the world as we known it hanging in the balance. Maybe you can get to it by Friday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Are We Here? These Things Are Already Dead! is a real adventure with a humorous overcoat.  It is written in generic language and is readily adaptable to almost any role playing game system.  The second in a 3-part series, all of the adventures in this campaign may be played either as stand-alone adventures, or as part of an ongoing story line. This adventure is suited to 3 or more adventurers of begininning to low levels of experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
