			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a book of prestige archetypes, prestige classes built into full 20-level archetypes similar to a normal core class. It takes the concept behind a prestige class and makes it more accessible. Prestige archetypes have the special abilities of the prestige class spread out over the full range of 20 levels, and gain the special prestige identity from level one; there is no need to plan ahead to meet prestige prerequisites and wait for several levels before getting to the meat of the prestige class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are nine archetypes for playing noble characters, the bloodline scion (sorcerer), chevalier (cavalier), eldritch noble (wizard), enlightened noble (investigator), hierarch cleric (cleric), monster scion (summoner), noble virtuoso (bard), renaissance man (magus), and scheming noble (rogue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the archetypes in this book are based on the same prestige class, noble scion; an adventurer born with a silver spoon. At the top of the hierarchy of her homeland, she nevertheless decided to put it all to risk as an adventurer&amp;mdash;but she&amp;rsquo;s not giving up her social advantages or creature comforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The noble scion archetypes are meant for players who wish to play rich and endowed from birth, characters with status and monetary advantages, balanced by weaknesses in other areas. The noble comes to best advantage in a campaign involving nobles in conflict, such as a throne war. But the archetypes are made to be balanced with normal characters, and can be used to play a noble among commoners, first among equals in a party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is written for the Porphyra setting, and has notes on what it is like to be a noble from different lands of that campaign world. But most of the rules are generic, it can be used in any game setting if you only take the time to decide upon three skills that are considered especially noble in each region of the game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
