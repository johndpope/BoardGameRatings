			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Untitled is an RPG by Keith Senkowski, published under his imprint Bob Goat Press. It was one of the winners of the September 2005 Ronnies, and the original contest entry is still available for free from 1KM1KT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game is a unique, hand-made, artifact and dripping with theme! It must be seen to be believed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roleplaying game emulates Mystery / Sci-Fi / Thriller / Horror movies in the vein of Dark City, and Memento. Be warned though, you're in for a trip. Some would even say a downward spiral...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a manila envelope, with a letter (1 sheet of paper) directed to you, informing you of what's included in the envelope:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A photocopy of one page of the subject's hand-written journal (1 sheet of paper)&lt;br/&gt;     The subject's arrest record (1 sheet of paper)&lt;br/&gt;     An intercepted audio recording (on CD) of the subject&lt;br/&gt;     The subject's hand-stitched, printed and hand-written journal (21 sheets of paper)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 4-8 players, with all but one playing the role of gamemasters, and only one player playing the next subject about to break the spiral. You need a regular deck of cards to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game tagline: Why do I feel so f*cking alone?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
