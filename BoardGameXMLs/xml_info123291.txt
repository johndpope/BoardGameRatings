							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zig Zag</name>
									
			<description>Zig Zag was written by Ed Hickman, published by dk'tronics in 1984, and released for the ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zig Zag, the player must explore a maze from first-person perspective searching for Scarabaqs. Scarabaqs are creatures that hold sector entry data that the player needs to continue to the next level. Scarabaqs flee from the player, who must exploit their behaviour to chase them into dead ends.  Adversity comes in the form of Hoverbots; their attacks drain the player's energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first-person 3D effect was achieved by using a series of vertical black lines to form the perspective of the walls, and to give the impression of the ceiling and floor. This also allowed relatively smooth movement animation, particularly when the player rotates left or right. However, some reviewers found the stripes to be an eye-strain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Zig Zag (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
