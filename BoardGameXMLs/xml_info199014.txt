			<description>The search for brains has backfired! Employees are dropping like flies and taking their co-workers with them. Beware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Corporate Zombie has no ability, and can be played to the break room with no effect. If a Corporate Zombie is fired, it takes two more employees to the Unemployment Line with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
