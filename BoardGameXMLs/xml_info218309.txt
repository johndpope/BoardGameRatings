							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Re-envisioning Leadership - Born to Follow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Leadership feat, one of the most divisive and potentially OP feats in Pathfinder. At the same time, historically, high-level characters had the ability to attract others to their cause simply because of their level. So this supplement attempts to introduce leadership as an innate skill or ability that every player character has access while setting limits and a mechanic in place to bring out the role-playing aspects of attracting followers and cohorts. This supplement also includes several feats including a version of the actual Leadership feat that works with the mechanic presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
