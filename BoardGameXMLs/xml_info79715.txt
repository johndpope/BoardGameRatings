			<description>This is based on a game played by the Ancient Greeks and Romans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A clock-shaped field with numbers 1 to 12 and 15 coins are the materials to play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get the least penalty points by &amp;quot;rolling&amp;quot; the coins in the air and seperate the coins in two groups: one with a number from 1 to 15 revealed and the other with a face revealed.&lt;br/&gt;Place the coins with numbers on the field by using their own number, sum of two coins or difference of two coins.&lt;br/&gt;If you can't place any coins anymore, throw the coins up again and start over, until you can't place any coins of your throw.&lt;br/&gt;The sum of your coins you couldn't place are your penalty points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
