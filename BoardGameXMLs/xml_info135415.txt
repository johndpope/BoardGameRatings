			<description>From the bottom of the box:&lt;br/&gt;[quote]&lt;br/&gt;DallasOpoly: A Custom Board Game&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the Community Adaptation of the Traditional Parlor Game. Players travel through Dallas buying, selling, and trading such Local Landmarks as Texas Stadium and Southfork Ranch on their way to Riches.&lt;br/&gt;[/quote]&lt;br/&gt;The traditional parlor game they refer to is Monopoly, with a few minor differences. The rules make no mention of auctions or trading. The rules specify that money is to be redistributed through the Southfork Ranch space, which corresponds to Free Parking. Dollar values for properties are ten times as high as in standard Monopoly ($500 to $4000), and the salary collected for each lap of the board is eleven times as high ($2200).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player count is specified as 2 to 4, and four plastic Sorry-style pawns are included, but the game could accommodate more players, perhaps with movers borrowed from the Traditional Parlor Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with Dallas-opoly from Late for the Sky Production Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
