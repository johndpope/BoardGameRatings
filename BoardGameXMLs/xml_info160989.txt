			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Arcknight Games, this multi-page PDF gives you a series of maps that can be mixed and matched to create kind of wooden encampent in the dirt. From a hillside bunker to a large roadside outpost, and even the infamous &amp;quot;Bandit Fortress&amp;quot; itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was a kid I had my first experience GM'ing my own roleplaying game. I didn't know what to do, so I made a basic story about a princess being kidnapped by bandits, and my players had to devise a way to assult their wooden fortress. I remember vividly that one of my players (the rogue of course) decides his character wouldn't take that kind of risk, he'd rather just wait in the nearest tree. The rest of the party groaned and complained, since it'll be even HARDER without him, but up the tree he climbed. He sat in that tree, while the other, less dextrous players tried to get him down by throwing rocks. I remember laughing so hard, as his &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; almost kill him to get him out of the tree, to come help &amp;quot;get killed&amp;quot;. Well, they left him, assaulted the fortress, and hammed it all up and got caught. From about a mile away, the rogue watched the camp from his tree, and after he saw smokefires, he decided things must have turned for the worst. So, being the rogue and reluctant hero he was, he decided to investigate after all. He snuck in, rescued the party, saved the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
