							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Storm to Come</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is usable at any level and is designed to bridge the gap between two adventures through your campaign. It is set on a passenger ship called the Cove Cutter and involves a mystery in which someone aboard is trying to sabotage the voyage. The motive for the sabotage varies and should be adapted to fit your campaign. It could also be used as a standalone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Storm to Come is a combat-lite adventure, focusing more on intrigue and character development than battle. There is one major fight and a potential boss fight at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
