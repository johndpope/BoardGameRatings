							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kabandha&#039;s Request (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 5th Edition Mini-Dungeon for 4 Level 5 Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the distant past, the ancestors of the reclusive kabandha made a bargain with some unknown entity or power to grant their people long lives in exchange for agreeing to serve as wardens of the hidden places of the world, such as the confluences of ley lines and other sites of mysterious power. Kabandhas have kept this pact through the millennia, and today they serve as tactically minded guardians with great longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the PCs pass through a heavily wooded region, far removed from any major community, they come across the badly injured Thurgrimm Eyelord slumped under a tree. Weakly requesting their &lt;br/&gt;help, the softly spoken kabandhas explains that his clan were ambushed, and their ancient home is being desecrated by the foul cyclops Gordok Wyrmbreaker and his retinue of ogres. If the PCs can drive off the invaders whilst their forces are depleted, and return Thurgrimm to his sacred home, they are well-rewarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
