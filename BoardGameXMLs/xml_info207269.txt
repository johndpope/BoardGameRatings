			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter Dirty Bowbe&amp;rsquo;s Roadhouse and you&amp;rsquo;re likely to find more than you bargained for, whether in coin or blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volbroth Bearhair has come looking for his men. Camped along the shores of Lake Ugashtan they had begun the construction of a trading post, but they are gone. When he went to check on them all that remained was a smoking hole in the ground and rumors of a tower now vanished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus people have been disappearing all over the Highlands and no one knows why. War between the dwarves and ogre magi has spilled into the plains, the creatures of Ulgakur have been restless, but nothing explains the vanishing tower, burnt ground and missing people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return to the Haunted Highlands and unravel the wild rumors of abduction, slavery and the general madness that always seems to begin at Dirty Bowbe&amp;rsquo;s Roadhouse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
