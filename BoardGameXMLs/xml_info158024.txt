			<description>from AARG in Brief:&lt;br/&gt;AARG is a setting independent role-playing game system designed to be easy to learn. AARG uses only a single mechanic, a 3d6 based check, for all resolution. Character creation is achieved through a points-based ability purchasing system. Rather than an experience point system, skill usage is rewarded with points on successes to further advance skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Pre-Flight Edition &lt;br/&gt;This edition contains all of the system rules and mechanics needed to play. However the &amp;ldquo;extras&amp;rdquo;, such as examples of play, skill and spell indexes, and play tips are removed. Additionally, far less time was spent formatting this version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
