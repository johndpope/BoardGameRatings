							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GoBots Game</name>
									
			<description>(From the back of the box)&lt;br/&gt;Turbo, Leader-1, Cy-Kill, and Crasher travel through GoBotron space in a race to win control of the GoBotron Command Center.  Using GoBot strategy, players vie for position as they flip playing pieces from robot to vehicle, in pursuit of the mobile target.  The first player to travel the maze-like course and reach and control Command Center, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GoBots game is a relatively simple spin &amp;amp; move game where players race around the board trying to reach the Command Center first.   Players can transform their characters from robot to vehicle mode by laying them flat, which allows them to travel more quickly around the perimeter of the board using the larger spaces.   Movement on the spinner ranges from 1-5, while the &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; space causes the Command Center to move instead of the player's character.   This can be used to move it closer to their location and/or further from opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to be the first to reach the Command Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
