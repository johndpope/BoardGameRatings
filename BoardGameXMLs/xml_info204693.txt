			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weary to the bone, your eyes look over to the communication screen. &amp;quot;The distress signal is new,&amp;quot; the officer tells you. Thinking deeply, you ask, &amp;quot;What are the details again?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patiently, he repeats. &amp;quot;Less than an hour ago, remote sensors under the control of Void Station 90 reported a distress signal in the area of Lemm. What makes it odd is that it's a distress signal only. It has no details about the actual event.&amp;quot; The officer continues. &amp;quot;What is your response? We really need to know.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired, weary, and reluctantly, you agree. Sometimes there's just no one else qualified to pull these people out of their predicaments. &amp;quot;OK,&amp;quot; you say. You gather your clothes, pull on your boots, and put a call in to your team. Another routine rescue on the periphery...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes full-color, print-and-play components (map and tokens).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
