			<description>The board, at first glance, looks like a Monopoly-type track but it isn't. This is a fairly traditional 'get to the end of the track' game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents Pinocchio and receive 15 gold. You must start at the Carpenter's Shop and aim to arrive at the Cottage of the Talking Cricket. Movement is dictated by a spinner. If the spinner instructs you to take a card, you must obey the instructions on the card. If you are currently standing on a Safety Station you can ignore the card. The first to reach the cottage gains 5 gold and the winner is then the player with the most gold after all loans have been repaid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
