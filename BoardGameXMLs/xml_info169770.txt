			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hearthlands is a real-time strategy game in which you take a role of a king in your own medieval/fantasy realm. You can not control your subjects directly. Instead you focus on city-building, resource management, diplomacy, heroes, magic and other things a typical king deals with on a daily basis. The world of the game, maps, characters and opponents are procedurally generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very flexible: you can create a powerful empire and rule your vassals with an iron grip, or establish a humble fishermen's village. Or build an impressive temple complex. Or found a small, bur well-defended outpost. Or be a host of a wizard's manor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All characters, from a hauler to a hero have their own minds and behavior patterns. If you like games like The Settlers of Pharaoh you know how pleasant and interesting it is to watch people scurry about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Addition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is being developed by Sergey &amp;quot;Sergio&amp;quot; Pershakov and Alexey &amp;quot;Simon&amp;quot; Lyukshin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
