			<description>This huge French cycling game consists of a massive 108*73cm. vinyl mapboard, 6 teams of 3 cyclists each and 1 yellow and 1 white cyclist. Also included: 1 die and 66 cards. The game is bilingual in French and... Esperanto (!). Each team consists of a sprinter, a climber and a rouleur (time rider who is strong on flat terrain). At the start of the game every player (sporting director) also receives 4 tactical cards that can be played at any moment. There also is a point system for the individual overall classification, the mountains and a point system for the teams so a player can go for different objectives. He can try to win the teams championship, mountains or go for the individual overall win with one of his cyclists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
