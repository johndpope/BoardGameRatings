			<description>Rank is a fast-paced shedding card game, which means you try to get rid of all your cards before the other players and obtain the highest rank. In Rank, players utilize numbered cards, special cards, and strategy to out think their opponents and play all their cards first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important thing to remember is to not get stuck with only low cards towards the end, or you&amp;rsquo;re going to lose!  The first player to get rid of all their cards becomes the King.  Each time a player becomes/stays the King, they receive 2 Royal tokens.  If you end the hand as the Queen, you receive 1 Royal token.  Get 5 Royal tokens and you are the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
