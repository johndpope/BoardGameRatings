			<description>Mario Kard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario Kard is a free PnP version of the popular Mario Kart videogame saga. So, this is a racing game composed of four kind of cards: &lt;br/&gt;1. Road Cards destinated to make modular circuits.&lt;br/&gt;2. Object Cards representing special items that drivers can use for themselves or against the others, these are the well known shells, mushrooms, stars,...&lt;br/&gt;3. Character Cards for each driver with his atributes: speed cards, first card, brake, attack and defense.&lt;br/&gt;4. Speed Cards; each driver has a set of four speed cards to determinate the movements and aceleration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drivers must move using Speed Cards. If you want play Child Mode you can use a D6. &lt;br/&gt;D6 is needed for attack and defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Preparing the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First you have to build a circuit and decide the total amount of laps to win the race. There must be at least one finish line and one special Road Card  where objects appear. Then each player chooses a driver (or randomly) and takes his Speed Cards. In the Driver Card is determined what is the first Speed Card to use (that is the acceleration rate somehow).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The Race&lt;br/&gt;Player generally moves using a Speed Card that limits the maximun positions he can move on. He'll choose to move more or less, but allways within that limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Start:&lt;br/&gt;Put Drivers on/beside finish line. Then each driver takes a random Speed Card and moves in turn. The first will be the&lt;br/&gt;younger player and then continue clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the road:&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, every player must choose secretly one Speed Card; then Speed Cards are shown and drivers move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get objects:&lt;br/&gt;In the circiut there will be a Road Card with the object icon. When drivers pass on this, they get a Object Card from the Object Card deck. Drivers only can have one object card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack/defense:&lt;br/&gt;When drivers are moving they could attack other players using Object Cards. The result is decided using Drivers Attack/Defense values, Object Attack/Defense values and a D6. Something like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bowser attacks Mario with a Red Shell:&lt;br/&gt;  Bowser attack + Red Shell attack + D6 &amp;gt; Mario defense + D6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total attacker value must be greater than total defender value; if equal then nothing happens. Some objects could be used to add more Defense value (shells, bananas,...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the attack is successful the loser goes off the road, loses any Object Card and must wait one turn without moving. Then He must start using Drivers first Speed Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Dangerous Curves:&lt;br/&gt;Some Road Cards have a special values like -1,-2,+1. These cards decrease Driver movement unless the Driver has a brake value bigger than 0. &lt;br/&gt;So if a player must go through a -2 curve and has a +1 brake value the movement decreases is only -1. Anyway if the driver finish a movement in a curve this decrease is not applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
