			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just you and your bike - take it on a thrilling ride down an unspoiled mountain landscape. Make your way through thick forests, narrow trails and wild rivers. Race, jump, slide and try not to crash - all the way from the peak to the valley!FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Custom Bike Physics&lt;br/&gt;We developed a custom bike physics system to achieve very tight and fun controls while still incorporating the feeling of driving a downhill bike through rough terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seamless Tracks&lt;br/&gt;Ride all the way down from the top of the mountain to the valley in one seamless ride with no loading times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find Your Way&lt;br/&gt;Play it safe and follow the trail or take the risk and go cross-country to find the fastest way down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See The World&lt;br/&gt;Different mountains await you on your adventure. Ride along quiet mountain lakes, majestic forests or steep canyons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find secret locations&lt;br/&gt;Explore the mountains to find secret locations and unlock new skins and gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Untouched Nature&lt;br/&gt;Experience a beautiful nature untouched by men. No audience, no barrier tapes &amp;ndash; just you and your bike (and some bears but it&amp;rsquo;s better to stay away from them)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
