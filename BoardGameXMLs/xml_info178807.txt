			<description>From website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fillies and gentlecolts, Equestrians of all ages: Welcome to the Season Four Edition of Roleplaying is Magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re one of the many returning players who have been with us since the beginning of this project, we&amp;rsquo;d like to begin by saying thank you. Your love and support over the last several years has been essential in turning this from a humble collection of notes and ideas into one of the Brony community&amp;rsquo;s most popular and longest-running game projects. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done any of this without you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you&amp;rsquo;re new to Roleplaying is Magic, we&amp;rsquo;d like to begin by saying welcome! Sit back and relax; we think you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy reading this book and playing this game as much as we&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed creating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may be wondering, &amp;quot;Just what is Roleplaying is Magic, anyway?&amp;quot; In a nutshell, Roleplaying is Magic (or &amp;quot;RiM&amp;quot; for short) is a fan-created tabletop roleplaying game and storytelling system based on the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic cartoon series created by Lauren Faust and owned by Hasbro Inc. With it, up to six players and one Game Master (or &amp;quot;GM&amp;quot;) can have adventures in the magical land of Equestria, creating their own stories together and exploring the magic of friendship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RiM is suitable for a wide variety of gamers, striving for mechanical simplicity to appeal to beginners and immersion-oriented roleplayers, as well as enough depth and complexity to satisfy veteran gamers. It emphasizes positive themes of cooperation, courage, integrity, and self-expression, to provide a meaningful experience in line with the themes and aesthetics of the original cartoon series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RiM is not just for grown-up gamers, or hardcore tabletop players; we&amp;rsquo;ve done our best to create a roleplaying game that parents, children, and siblings can all enjoy, with old friends or making new ones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guiding phrase of Roleplaying is Magic is, &amp;quot;Canon focused, fanon friendly.&amp;quot; This means that while we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to stay as true to the original cartoon series as possible, we&amp;rsquo;ve also left plenty of wiggle room for game groups to make their experiences unique; to make their Equestria truly their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new edition of RiM has been produced after each season of the original cartoon series, to incorporate revised information presented by the series, as well as improve the design of the game in an effort to make it the best it can be. With this final 'official' version, the Season Four Edition (or &amp;quot;S4E&amp;quot; for short), RiM has never been better. Now even more streamlined and customizable than ever before, S4E blends previous attempts at simplification with robust gameplay mechanics and a focus on positive ethics and morality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
