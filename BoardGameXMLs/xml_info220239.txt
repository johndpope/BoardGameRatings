			<description>Matches is the hottest new card game!&lt;br/&gt;When you play with fire, you're going to get burned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matches is a card game for 3-4 players. Players will take turns &amp;quot;Matching&amp;quot; the number that was first played each round. Everyone has 2 ways to score points: Either outlasting everyone and taking the fire tokens from the Match card, OR by burning out early and scoring the pairs that they alone have played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is very easy to pick up, and there are 12 additional cards called Burn cards to change the game to a more strategic and manipulative experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
