Players scores for completed houses.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;109 cards&lt;br/&gt;The deck is composed of 7 house element cards with 58 variations, 21 thematic design cards, and 30 attribute/obstacle cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
