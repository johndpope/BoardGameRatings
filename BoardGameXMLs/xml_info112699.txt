			<description>A game published in junction with the student carnival &amp;quot;Lundakarnevalen 2010&amp;quot;. The game is a word-game, where players try to descibe words without mentioning specifics (very similar to Alias).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn to try to describe the words on the card, each one with a specific theme, without mentioning the specific word or part of the word. The other players, teammates or opponents depending on the variant, try to guess as many as possible in a set period of time; and players score accordingly. First one to a set target of points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What sets the game apart from Alias is the distinct tongue-in-cheek &amp;quot;lundahumor&amp;quot;, i.e. humour from the student city of Lund. The themes and words on the different cards are often odd, screwball or intergroup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the original rules, several variants is included in the base-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
