			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game for 3 Players. 3 Teams of Cartoon Characters compete in Sporting Events. Based on the Hanna-Barbara cartoon of the same name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three teams are the Scooby-Doobeys, Yogi Yahooeys, and Really Rottens. Each team has a unique Team Deck of cards. All of the teams share a common Antics Deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hand of cards equals one Laff-a-Lympics episode. Each Episode has four sports events. Team and Antics cards are used to bid on an event. Taking first place in an event earns 25 points, second place earns 15 points, and third place earns 10 points. The team with the most points in four events wins the Episode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
