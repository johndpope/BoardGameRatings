			<description>&amp;quot;Card game between rival Wizards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player randomly selects a wizard character to play. Each wizard has a unique special ability. The card deck contains magical ingredients, spells, abilities, knowledge, and magical items that the wizards may possess or create.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players keep track of three types of points during the game. Lore Points, gained through research, are used for Bidding to acquire cards. Heka Points are used to play Spell Cards. Fate Points are used to determine the winner at the end of the game. Having certain cards in play will generate Fate and Heka Points each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The first player to accumulate 25+ Fate points is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
