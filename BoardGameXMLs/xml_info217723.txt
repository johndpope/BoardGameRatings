							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carry On: Gear Collecting Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carry On is a gear collecting card game for the end of the world. Players compete to stash food and weapons, and seek aid from other survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a &amp;quot;stash&amp;quot; of four cards. Each turn you can play a card from your stash. Different cards have different Actions. After an Action resolves, replace the card played with the top card from the Draw Pile. However, most Actions allow you to Replenish your stash in several strategic ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different cards/items have different Actions, or rather different items cause different things within the game to happen. Tools like the Compass and Shovel allow players to search the Draw Pile and Discard Pile for a card to replenish their Stash. Weapons, like the Tactical Knife and Hand Gun let you intimidate opponents into giving you cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to Items, there are also other Survivors within the deck that can you help you on your quest for survival gear. The Minimalist allows you to discard additional cards. The Pacifist gets rid of your opponents Weapons. The Anarchist let's you straight up steal from your opponent. And The Generalist allows you to swap out cards with an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, be the first player to collect all three pieces of radioactive protective gear - Hazmat Boots, a Hazmat Hood, and a Hazmat Suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
