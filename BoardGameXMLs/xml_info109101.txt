							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Subtle as a Drow</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an elf you don't like sends you a letter, you check it for enchantments. When a drow you don't like sends you a letter, you don't bother. Chances are you'll never find the poison until it's already too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Subtle as a Drow&amp;quot; is a module for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game for characters levels 6-8. Filled with political intrigue and undetected guile, it leads the party down into the nest of duplicitous drow. The plot thickens as a long dead drow lich who has been punished for his hubris comes close to awakening due to a political coup d'&amp;eacute;tat. He is murdered weekly to keep his body to keep from reforming by a clandestine order of assassins and impersonators. The drow who seek to keep this wicked tyrant asleep figure that the enemy of their enemy is their friend and offer the opportunity to rid the world of a wicked evil to the most adept of adventurers- your party! Are the drow just using you as a pawn in this little scheme or is there a bigger picture to be seen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
