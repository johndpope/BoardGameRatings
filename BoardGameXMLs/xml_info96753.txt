			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a setting module for use with NUGGET, a trimmed-down version of the LODE system, available for download from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.silverbranch.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.silverbranch.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;. It's a sort of modern-day fantasy supernatural thingy. This module may evolve over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Werewolves? Pah! Sometimes you don't know whether to be angry that the humans have forgotten the rest of you, or glad that it gives you the breathing room to get on with your job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a member of a strange breed, the Children of the Moon, the Beastwalkers; part human, part animal, part spirit, yet different from all. Your kind has always lived among humans - helping, harming, guiding, tricking, watching. Once you were better known. Now, in &amp;quot;civilised&amp;quot; places, both sides are happier if your existence is unsuspected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;The Nugget rules are available as a free download from the publisher's site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
