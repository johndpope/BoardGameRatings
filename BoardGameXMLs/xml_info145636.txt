			<description>This is a simple game where an active player would have a hanging note around his/her back of the head  with the name of some famous person listed. The other players then would try to get that active player to properly guess who they were by giving the active player clues about their identity. Successfully figuring out who you were let you win the game. Giving a clue that helped someone identify themselves also scored points and was instrumental in winning the game. You might be Churchill or Roosevelt or Hitler or Chamberlain or anyone else who was famous back then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
