							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Laying Waste: The Guide to Critical Combat</name>
									
			<description>Everything You Know About Critical Hits is Wrong&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 600 critical hit and fumble effects, Laying Waste presents a slick system to maximize the enjoyment of critical hits and fumbles in the Pathfinder RPG or any OGL d20 systems. This system replaces the standard critical hit and fumble rules, adding realism and balance to combat, while still being simple and elegant enough to use with ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players and GM characters are actually rewarded for *all* of their threat rolls and for their level of skill with weapons! Critical hits will add a very fun element to the game now, rather than simply making combat go faster by doing huge amounts of damage. It is even possible to receive lasting wounds from particularly terrible fights, the sort of thing to show off over tavern ales and campsite fires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis of this product is fun however, and not sheer destruction. While the possibility exists for horrific maiming and wicked injuries, clerics also have ways to treat such injuries and it will take a very honed and practiced sword hand to deal the most grievous of blows. Within the 166 pages are over 100 feats, 16 new martial archetypes and a plethora of optional combat rules to add to your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now get your crit together and enjoy LAYING WASTE upon your enemies now and for years to come! This book is a must-have for every gaming table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the talented minds of Brian Berg, Clinton Boomer, Brian Boonstra, Creighton Broadhurst, Rick Cox, Thilo &amp;ldquo;Endzeitgeist&amp;rdquo; Graf, Hal Greenberg, Adam Meyers, Jason Nelson, James Olchak, Tom Phillips, John Reyst, Rachel Ventura, Jim &amp;ldquo;Drawmij&amp;rdquo; Ward, and Mike Welham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Source: From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
