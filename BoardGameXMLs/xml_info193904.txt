			<description>Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it&amp;rsquo;s super fat guys free-styling!!!&lt;br/&gt;Sumo Revise is a local-multiplayer brawler designed to harken back to the zaniness and replayability of couch-crowding games like Super Smash Bros. and GoldenEye 007, with a splash of silliness of games like QWOP and Surgeon Simulator 2013.&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;INSANE, UNPREDICTABLE GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;Struggle to force your friends out of the ring in lightning-fast, ever-changing rounds. Grab power-ups to learn the secret abilities of the sumo masters. Don hats and costumes on the fly to confuse your opponents (and yourself)!&lt;br/&gt;EXOTIC LOCATIONS AND EXTENSIVE CUSTOMIZATION&lt;br/&gt;Battle in seven different arenas in the far reaches of Sumo Land. Sharpen your skills with 12 different modes and gameplay modifiers, including Free-For-All, Capture the Flag, and Bacon. Create and share your own levels and modes for never-ending insanity!&lt;br/&gt;THE PLACE IS CRAWLING WITH SUMOS!&lt;br/&gt;Play with up to 8 players simultaneously, or supplement with AI opponents if you&amp;rsquo;re feeling lonely.&lt;br/&gt;REALISTIC SUMO PHYSICS?&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, since they&amp;rsquo;re so portly the sumos don&amp;rsquo;t exactly maneuver well&amp;hellip;Move wisely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
