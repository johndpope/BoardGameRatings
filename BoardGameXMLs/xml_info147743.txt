							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NHL 14</name>
									
			<description>NHL 14 is an ice hockey video game developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports. It is the 23rd installment of the NHL series and was released on September 10, 2013 in North America, and September 13, 2013 in Europe as well as Australia and New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NHL 14 has overhauls to two game engines, based on other sports titles developed by EA Canada. The collision physics are now powered by the same core technology behind the FIFA Player Impact Engine. For more realistic fights, the game employs the new Enforcer Engine based on the Fight Night series. In addition, the True Performance Skating engine got some more improvements, and the game has a new deking system. The game's Be a Pro career mode now has off-the-ice interactions to dictate the player's overall legacy. NHL 14 will also feature a modernized version of NHL '94, called NHL '94 Anniversary mode, featuring current rosters and updated graphics to commemorate the game's 20th anniversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NHL 14&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
