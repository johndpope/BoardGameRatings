			<description>Bad Apple Wars is a visual novel developed by Aksys Games and Idea Factory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a sudden car accident on her first day of school, the protagonist finds herself in the afterlife, standing before a strange school for lost souls. It is said that here, at NEVAEH Academy, any student who behaves and follows the rules will be able to graduate and start their life anew. After a man wearing a rabbit head informs her of her untimely demise, the confounded protagonist attends the school's opening ceremony. And then, suddenly&amp;mdash;a loud blast tears through the auditorium. At that moment, a war breaks out between the Bad Apples, a group of delinquent students opposing the academy, and the Prefects, sworn enforcers of the school rules. In the midst of the chaos, the protagonist comes across a red-haired young man. Without a shred of hesitation in his voice, he reaches his hand out and asks her: &amp;quot;Do you want to live?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is compatible with the PlayStation TV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Aksys/Bad Apple Wars official website&lt;br/&gt;Aksysgames.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
