			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two sisters moved to the big city in pursuit of their dreams in the highly competitive worlds of song and stage. It's not like the movies, though, and getting your big break doesn't come easy. Hard on their luck, they began to resort to crime. Their misfortune seemed to completely take over when they were subjected to experimental drugs against their wills. Although the others who took the drugs died, the sisters were, instead, endowed with the superhuman thermal control. Now COLDSNAP and HEATWAVE can take their crimes to new heights, and gain all the luxuries and wealth they dreamed of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
