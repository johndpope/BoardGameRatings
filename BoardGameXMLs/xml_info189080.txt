			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All agents are sufficiently capable when it comes to fighting unarmed. They cause enough damage to potentially take down a thug with a punch or two. But some agents should excel in hand-to-hand combat, and it doesn't have to just be the Eliminator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an Advanced Training option book for players and Admins to use in their games. It represents an option for agents to enroll in an advanced hand-to-hand training program offered by the agency. Enrolling increases the amount of experience points needed to go up in level, but provides the agent access to a series of martial arts techniques he otherwise wouldn't have been entitled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will enter various Stances, each of which provide bonuses of one type or another. They'll engage in take-downs, disarm opponents, strike nerves to cause paralysis of limbs or knock out foes with one strike. They'll use melee opponents as human shields against gunmen, and engage in whirlwhind strikes that hurt multiple foes. And the truly skilled and highly trained agents will be able to perform such acts of violence that fragmentation grenades would stare in surprise. If they had eyes. Whatever. You get the idea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for the White Lies roleplaying game. It expands player options for that game, but it is not limited to use in that game system. It is a universally usable accessory for any old school game, such as White Star or Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry, where enhanced hand-to-hand combat is a viable archetype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
