			<description>In the dark depths of a drifting space wreck, a small team of specialists investigates unusual scanner readings of life on board.  The team acts relaxed; banter hides their anxiety.  Motion scanners show nothing; torches illuminate the dank corridor casting long shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly the point man's scanner shows movement ahead, increasing in speed.  His reflexes are conditioned by experience, so he shoulders the carbine.  The torch illuminates a horrific shape.  Recognising danger the point man fires the carbine in a rapid series of bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alien screeches of pain and the creature falls to the ground.  You have just made first contact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More motion scanners come to life, movement all around you starts closing in through the maze of ship's corridors.  This is more than five men can handle.  It is time to withdraw back to the assault shuttle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is The Gauntlet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gauntlet is a print 'n play board game for 1-6 players.
