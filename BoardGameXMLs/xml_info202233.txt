			<description>Stashed - A Solitaire Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story So Far...&lt;br/&gt;You step inside your collection room to admire your lovingly collected treasures when you notice that instead of them being neatly organised into their trays they are scattered all over the place. Your precious items are in a mess and you need to get them sorted, luckily you have a system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a deck of item cards that must be organised into designated spaces. If you can complete them all you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also have some special actions that may be used to help you achieve your goal. Stashed is designed to be played by a single player, and can be played in around 15 mins. Co-operative variant rules are also included so you can play with a friend (or three)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
