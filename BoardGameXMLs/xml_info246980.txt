							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King of Liriam</name>
									
			<description>King of Liriam is a game for 2-4 players and is a tactical and strategic cutthroat area control game in which players take the role of medieval house lords that want to conquer the undiscovered realm called Liriam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players spend gold to buy orders from the so called deployment panel, a board that features two columns filled with units, command, and settlements that players can buy and place on the map of Liriam. The higher an order is on the deployment panel the higher the cost players must pay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once players decide what to buy they must deploy the order on the map and this is where the tactical and strategical layers are born in King of Liriam. Each units features a combination of 2 traits, the way it enters the map and the ability it performs once arrived. For instance units can conquer new territories, patrol existing ones, or siege nearby enemy settlements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to own more territories than the enemy by the time the map fills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
