			<description>Cunning and cold-blooded to be the best secret agent! &lt;br/&gt;During a meeting that took place in a big city with the most powerful world leaders, a suitcase containing invaluable state secrets has been stolen. The best secret agents were summoned to the task of retrieving the information contained in this bag and the winner will receive one million dollar reward, besides knowing the oldest secrets of the mankind. Uncover your opponents and abuse the nerve to not be discovered and enter into history as the best secret agent of all time&amp;quot;(Translated from the game box) &lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a secret agent, but there may be ghosts agents (additional pawns). On his turn, the player moves any agents, distributing the total movement points obtained among the agents he wants to move. When one or more pawns stop at the building where the suitcase is, all players score: the pawn which is the suitcase&amp;rsquo;s building receives 5 points and the other pawns receive points corresponding to the buildings where they are at this moment. At the beginning of the game, each player only knows its own identity. Thus, the game has two objectives: to win more points by moving the pawns (the game ends when someone reaches 42 points) and earn additional points, by discovering the identity of other agents (this is done, once someone reaches 32 points, placing numbered chips into the slots of the forecasts bases).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
