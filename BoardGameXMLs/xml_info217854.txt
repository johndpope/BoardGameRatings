			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE VENOMS of Medea which laid a king low,&lt;br/&gt;The phial which ruined Tristan and Isolde,&lt;br/&gt;Grimhild&amp;rsquo;s brew of Sigurd&amp;rsquo;s oblivion;&lt;br/&gt;The fell draught of the envious Circe,&lt;br/&gt;Which twisted Scylla&lt;br/&gt;Into a horror of tentacle and claw ...&lt;br/&gt;~The BOOK OF POTIONS is the ultimate guide to potions in your Fantasy Role-Playing Games (FRPGs). This indispensible work includes rules to create over 2,000 unique alchemist NPCs on a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice. You will also find tables for over 500 different ingredients &amp;mdash; from eye of newt to wing of bat, and dragon&amp;rsquo;s blood &amp;mdash; which allow you create a near-infinite variety of magical potion recipes. Do you need an adventure hook, a reason for your game&amp;rsquo;s heroes to wander off into the wilderness? Look no further! Best of all, the Book of Potions includes a colossal array of 5,000 (!) pre-designed potions which can be instantly placed in your treasure troves. Details include not only potion type, dosage, color and transparency, but also scent, flavor, container, stopper and distinguishing characteristics. But that&amp;rsquo;s not all ... all 5,000 potions include pre-calculated gold piece values (GPVs), and even recommended character levels for game balance. Everything you need for an entire campaign&amp;rsquo;s worth of alchemy, ingredient quests, and magical potions is found here in this single tome.&lt;br/&gt;~TREASURE TROVE I: THE BOOK OF POTIONS is brought to you by Kent David Kelly of Wonderland Imprints, a role-player and Game Master with over 30 years of play experience. Best of all, if there are any other materials you would like to see relating to dungeon design, feel free to contact the author. Many more CASTLE OLDSKULL supplements are being prepared specifically to support the players, initiates and Game Masters of the Old School Revival (OSR). This Guide is your gateway to the realms of sword and sorcery. Join us for the adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
