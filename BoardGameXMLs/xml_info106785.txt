			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 5 mazes, made from simple wall arrangements. The player controls a 'blob' and must escape from each maze after having rescued 5 other blobs. Those have real person names like 'Nigel' but other than that, they're as abstract as the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get out, the player has some limited use in blasting his way through, though most of the time concise puzzle solving thinking is needed to make his escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hard part are the numbered gates which open by toggles which have to be passed over in certain sequence. There are some baddies present, but those do not represent the real challenge in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
