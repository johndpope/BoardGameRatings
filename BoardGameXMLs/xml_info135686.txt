			<description>Weetjes Kwartet (Trivia Quartett) is a Quartett game with a minor twist: In addition to seven regular sets of four cards, the game contains two sets of five cards. Like regular sets, a player completes these sets when he has collected four of the cards. The fifth card counts as a minus point for the player that remains stuck with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Futhermore, each card in a Trivia Quartett set lists a number of facts on the topic of the card. This enables the players to play a trivia variant, if they wish: whenever a player is asked to hand over a card that he has in his hand, he is allowed to ask a question for which the answer can be found on the card. The other player has to answer the question correctly in order to receive the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
