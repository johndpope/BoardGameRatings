			<description>&amp;ldquo;Players immerse themselves in a mass psychosis directed by the cards and their own subconscious desires.&amp;rdquo;  Players are dealt seven cards, each displaying one word. &amp;ldquo;The player with the most psychological baggage goes first.&amp;rdquo; The players take turns describing a dream, incorporating a word from one of their cards. The game ends when two players pass their turns.
