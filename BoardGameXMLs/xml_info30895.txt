			<description>The &amp;quot;Fun-Full&amp;quot; Thrift Game is designed to teach good saving principles. It consists of fifteen pairs of cards and one odd card. The cards display text that promotes the value of saving money.&lt;br/&gt;The cards are all dealt to the players. Play consists of drawing a card from the player on the right to match cards in the acting players hands. The player with the odd card left at the end of the game is the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
