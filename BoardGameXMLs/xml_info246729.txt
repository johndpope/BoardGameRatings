			<description>450 Things to Do in Your Life is a voting game where players guess which activities their opponents would like to try and vote accordingly. It is a perfect game to get to know each other better and get the party started!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 450 Things to Do in Your Life you will find 75 double-sided playing cards, each side contains three different activities. The lead player opens the card, and the player to the left side of him or her calls a random number of the activity. The lead player reads the task out loud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, each of the players assesses their readiness to perform a particular task with a set of special voting cards that go from 0 - &amp;quot;I wouldn't do it - not in a million years&amp;quot; to 3 - &amp;quot;Wow, I'd love to try it!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the players have voted they try to guess an approximate amount of points on the voting cards - a player who will be closer to the correct answer gets one winning point. So in order to win the game it is important to know and feel the other players: what they think of practical jokes, what will be considered funny, and what will be rejected as a stupid idea. The first player to reach 12 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game the players will not only have fun but also learn a lot about each other, and, perhaps, they even learn something new about themselves. Finally you can actually think about all the fun and crazy things to do in your life, like: &amp;quot;Am I ready to shave my head? Or scuba dive, or kiss a frog?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out how well you know each other in this quirky party game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
