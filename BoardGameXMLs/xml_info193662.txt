			<description>Laughing Kookaburra tests your memory with two games in one box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Eggspressions&amp;quot;, players divide the cards equally among themselves. One player turns over an Eggspression card, then points to the face on the game board that matches this image. The next player covers this card with a card of their own, then points to the first face, then the second face. Players continue this way until someone can't remember the sequence and is penalized by placing all of the cards at the bottom of their stack. Whoever runs out of cards first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Laugh Out Loud&amp;quot;, players use the same cards, but flip them to the other side, with each card showing something silly like &amp;quot;Hee&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hoohoo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Woah&amp;quot;, and so on. Gameplay works the same as above, but now players must repeat the chain of sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In both games, sometimes a card presents the active player with a challenge, and the player must first complete this challenge prior to doing the memory test &amp;mdash; and splitting your focus this way is tough!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
