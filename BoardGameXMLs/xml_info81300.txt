			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;First Dividend comprises a pack of Cards numbered to correspond to the numbers shown against the matches or races on a pools coupon, together with three dice: one white dice marked 1,2,X, (represents a home win or first favourite, an away win or second favourite, a draw or an outsider respectively), and two standard dice (red and blue) for Greyhound racing selection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All together using these cards and dice you have any options:&lt;br/&gt;1) Treble Chance&lt;br/&gt;2) Four Draws and Twelve Homes&lt;br/&gt;3) Eight Results&lt;br/&gt;4) Easier Six&lt;br/&gt;5) Treble Chance and Home Racing&lt;br/&gt;6) Lucky 7 - Jokey Points Pool&lt;br/&gt;7) Racing Bingo&lt;br/&gt;8) 8 Winning Jokeys&lt;br/&gt;9) Win or Place Only bets&lt;br/&gt;10) Forecast Bets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game comes with coupons you use to play this weird game. You first use the dice and cards to create winning chances for teams/horses/dogs or other gambling areas. The names for the teams and such are all fictional and every game the favourites are different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then using the cards you try to predict winning chances to each contestant, but you can only use each card once, so you need to select carefully between the right range of winning chance. You can predict first 3 places (at races and championships) or winning team on individual matches. You can only predict only one certain place, if afraid to lose points (money).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After everyone have placed their bets (written down), according to rules for certain part (10 up above) leading player uses dices and cards to make the final results. Favourites getting better chances and so on. The 2 Joker cards in the pack act as a Act Of God in this betting game. They can remove a winner of bring a loser to front. Rules for Jokers and how to use them come with each part separately. Each part has different conditions for winning, but main idea is to collect most money at the end of each coupon (races, matches etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PS! Rules say that these cards for predicting the races can also used for real life races as well and refers to the product with the same name used for only gambling purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
