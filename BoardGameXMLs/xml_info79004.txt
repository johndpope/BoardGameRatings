			<description>&amp;quot;Paganitzu (Aztec for &amp;quot;Temple of the Gods.&amp;quot;) is a tile-based, CGA/EGA computer game created by Keith Schuler  and published by Apogee Software in October, 1991. It is the sequel to Chagunitzu. The game is a 2D puzzle game comparable to Chip's Challenge. It requires the player to solve various puzzles to complete the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paganitzu was published in three parts. Part 1: &amp;quot;Romancing the Rose&amp;quot;, Part 2: &amp;quot;The Silver Dagger&amp;quot; and Part 3: &amp;quot;Jewel of the Yucatan&amp;quot;. Part 1 was made available as shareware and is still available to be downloaded from many DOS game sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The protagonist and player character of Paganitzu is Alabama &amp;quot;Al&amp;quot; Smith, an explorer comparable to Indiana Jones, working his way through an ancient Aztec pyramid. The story is split into three sections, corresponding to the three parts the game was published in.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Paganitzu , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
