							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Welcome to Wall Street</name>
									
			<description>We're proud to bring &amp;quot;Welcome to Wall Street&amp;quot; to the public for the first time. We have worked for years making this the most exciting game of investing ever! A player buys stock and commodities through and tries to build up his/her portfolio while trying to bankrupt other investors. An investor can also force opponents to sell them their shares through &amp;quot;Hostile Takeovers&amp;quot;. Investors have opportunities to purchase IPOs, force others to share their profits when they get Mutual Funds, and investors will also face having their transportation repossessed and get stuck driving a &amp;quot;beater&amp;quot; if bad investments are made. When an investor goes bankrupt, the investor with the most cash assets is declared the &amp;quot;King&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Queen&amp;quot; of the bulls. There's some back stabbing and luck involved. It's a &amp;quot;Dog eat Dog&amp;quot; world out there. This is one place you can lose it all and still walk away laughing. &amp;quot;Welcome to Wall Street&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
