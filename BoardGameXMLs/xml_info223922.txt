			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;Rat&amp;rdquo; refers to one of three types of individuals: those who live off the grid but remain in urban society, those who lack a working IBT profile, and hardened criminals who have somehow managed to evade capture by the police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rats face prejudice, discrimination, and legal barriers as parts of their daily lives. As a result, they have often formed their own communities, with their own social groups and codes of conduct. Many of these communities of &amp;ldquo;street rats&amp;rdquo; are found in massive urban sprawls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IBT (Identification and Biometric Tagging) profile system governs almost all aspects of daily lives. It has replaced most government identification systems for all but high-clearance positions, and also is used by advertisers and corporations. There are flaws in the system; it occasionally conflates two individuals, and loopholes in the system make it discard data that matches certain parameters. Those savvy in fooling the system exist in a blank space, trapped between the rapidly approaching twenty-second century and the past. Community and personal relationships are made less common by the near-infinite availability of personal data, and even those who lack an IBT entry find themselves subject to constant surveillance and snooping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rats reject this system; they not only avoid selling out, but many choose to disobey the rules that society as a whole has tried to set for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
