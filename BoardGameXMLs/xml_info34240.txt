							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delegate Dash</name>
									
			<description>Delegate Dash, a game for 2-4 players, uses all the parts of a standard piecepack. Players are candidates of the Piecepack Party, seeking its nomination for President of the Republic. They campaign state-by-state over five rounds of votes, trying to win at least 305 out of 608 delegates. Sometimes the game-ending convention brings a surprise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senator North (blue), Governor East (red), Representative South (green), and General West (black) compete against each other in 5 campaign rounds to gain delegates, which will be sent to the Piecepack Party Convention (fyi -- all of these candidates compete, regardless of the number of players.) Whichever candidate has 305 delegates by the end of the convention wins -- which may even be a non-player candidate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.piecepack.org/rules/DelegateDash.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.piecepack.org/rules/DelegateDash.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
