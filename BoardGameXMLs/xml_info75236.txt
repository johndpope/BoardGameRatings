			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures: Babs' Big Break was the first Tiny Toon Adventures-related game released on the Nintendo Game Boy. It was released in 1992 and was developed and published by Konami.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the player takes control of Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, or Hamton J. Pig as they attempt to prevent Montana Max from thwarting Babs Bunny's dreams of becoming a big star. There are four main stages, of which at the end of each, a special helper (Dizzy Devil, Furrball, Fifi Le Fume, or Shirley the Loon) will lead a helping hand. Along the way are others that are trying to stop the main heroes from helping Babs, such as Elmyra Duff, Arnold the Pit Bull, and Roderick Rat, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Each of the three player characters has different weapons. Buster's carrots fly in an arc, Plucky throws pineapples that can bounce off the background, and Hamton throws watermelons that roll along the ground. The player can also collect various power-ups. Small hearts restore one heart. Large hearts will increase the player's life meter by one heart for the remainder of the level. Gems can be collected and spent playing mini-games for more power-ups or extra lives. However, the player loses half of their gems when losing a life. If the player has collected 500 or more gems upon reaching the fight with Montana Max, he will offer to sell the theater to the player. However, this will only result in an alternate dialouge sequence, and the player will need to fight Montana Max. After the ending sequence, the game will restart. However, in all subsequent playthroughs, the player will start each level with only one heart, and thus most avoid taking any hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regional Variations&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese version of the game differs slightly in that it offers a password feature and unlimited continues (whereas the US version only allows the player to continue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
