			<description>At the time that this cycling game was released the Milk Race was the only professional multiple-day cycling race in the United Kingdom. It was published by British company Jason Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls one cyclist on the board. The movement is determined by spinning a wheel in the middle of the board and by dice. There are also tactical cards that can be played. The board also has sprint and time trial sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
