			<description>From the Game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rich on rare minerals and sophisticated communication systems, the planet Colian had it all, until ... it happened. Out in orbit an Imperial mothership was devising the most awesome product in weapon technology - Terrorpod fighting machines. Your mission is to discover the secrets of Terrorpod manufacture. With a defence strategy vehicle, a small trading drover and an incomplete map of the area, you keep a low profile, until suddenly the mothership detects you and they decide to destroy every colony on Colian together with their production secrets. Terrorpods is an interesting game requiring fast reactions to avoid missile fire and quick thinkin to plan ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
