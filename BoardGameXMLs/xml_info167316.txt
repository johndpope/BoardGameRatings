			<description>From the designer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Service is a freeform live action role-playing scenario about United States citizens called up for military service during a brutal war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes on the role of a citizen who has been torn out of their everyday life and brought to the Orientation Center for deployment to basic training. Everything they own has been removed from them as they are about to embark on the transformational experience of becoming a soldier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is game about saying goodbye to the life you&amp;rsquo;ve known, about patriotism versus the reality of war, and issues of personal versus societal responsibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
