							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ASL GAP</name>
									
			<description>From Morale Desperation - The ASL Website of Mark Pitcavage:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Always a step or two behind the times when it came to computer games, Avalon Hill released a crude game assistance program (GAP) for ASL in 1988.  This program, designed for the Apple II, presumed that people would play ASL next to a bulky 1980s desktop computer and would repeatedly stop play to use the computer to add up modifiers and in other ways &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; the players.  It was subsequently released as a DOS program for IBM compatibles.  In this format, it can still occasionally be found on eBay (probably mostly in pirated versions).  Supposedly, it was also released for the Commodore 64.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original Components include envelope style package, 5.25&amp;quot; floppy disk, &amp;amp; instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
