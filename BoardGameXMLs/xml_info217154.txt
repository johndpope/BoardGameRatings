							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jitra Jitters: The Battle for Nangka, December 12, 1941</name>
									
			<description>The situation for the Allies in Malaya was getting worse almost with every hour in the opening days of the war with Japan. Japanese landings at the Kra Isthmus in the north went virtually unopposed and their ground troops advanced steadily southward. On December 10th the Allied battleships Repulse and Prince of Wales were sunk with great loss of life by Japanese torpedo bombers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first line of resistance for the Allies was at Jitra in the north of Malaya. Holding on here meant the major airbase at Alor Star would allow Allied fighters and bombers to restage and possibly launch attacks on the Japanese bases, thereby keeping the enemy at bay and away from Singapore. One of the main positions of the Allied defensive line was at the village of Nangka, just a couple of miles to the north of the town of Jitra. The first big battle in Malaya was about to be fought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Jitra Jitters is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One 11 by 17 inch map with game record-keeping tracks and terrain identification.&lt;br/&gt;     60 un-mounted double sided units.&lt;br/&gt;     One set of 8 page rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infantry and Heavy Weapons units are battalions, all other units are companies. A hex is a third of a mile across. Each turn represents one hour of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
