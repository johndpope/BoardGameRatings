			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;This game requires an even number of players. One person will initially act as the dealer, and runs the process of the game whilst also playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using standard playing cards, each player is assigned a reciprocal mate, and potentially one or more secret lovers. The players then mingle and chat with each other, trying to ascertain who is their lover(s) (if anyone) through private conversations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players indicate intimacy through using particular subtle physical signals (for example touching their shoulder or giving a longing gaze). At the end of the game, will you remain with your mate, or will you be rejected if they have noticed you flirting with someone else?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
