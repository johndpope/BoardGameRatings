			<description>Demolition Derby was written by Bob Chapman and published in Chimaera (Issue 14 - Mar 1976).  The game was designed for postal play (play-by-mail) and supports eight players and one game master.  Subsequent issues of the periodical included play reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a single car designated by color (White, Yellow, Orange, Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Black).  The demolition derby is part demolition and part traditional race.  The play board depicts an oval track divided into five racing lanes (A-E) and twenty-size racing zones (1-26), allowing for 130 distinct track locations.  One zone is traversed each turn for each 10 M.P.H. of speed.  Each turn (top and bottom) runs six racing zones with variable, denoted bank (which limits safe speed); each straightaway (left and right) runs for seven racing zones.  Cars may be in the same zone as long as they are not in adjacent lanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each car has a determined number of &amp;quot;wear&amp;quot; points (damage) and a speed in 10 M.P.H. increments.  Each turn consists of players issuing written orders for their car (intended acceleration, positive or negative; intended lane change; and attempts to baulk, shunt, or spin an opponent).  The game referee then executes the turns' orders using an &amp;quot;order of precedence&amp;quot; for the cars which rotates each turn, following a pre-randomized pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a further randomization, a deck of forty &amp;quot;tactics&amp;quot; cards was dealt at the start of each race, each player holding five cards.  These could be played on any turn.  Cards bearing +1, +2, +3, and +4 allowed additional acceleration (in 10 M.P.H. increments) on the turn they are played; the &amp;quot;Superb Driving&amp;quot; card allowed a turn to be safely navigated at any speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was intended to be played with one postal turn per week.  A typical, complete race took approximately two years (abt. 100 turns) - though deliberately combative driving could significantly shorten this by player elimination.  Cars that did not receive orders were assumed to follow their lane at a constant speed (with appropriate results).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
