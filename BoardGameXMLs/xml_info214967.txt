			<description>Safe Zone  is an exciting new WWII themed board game for 2 players.  Guide your tank across the treacherous minefield set up for you by your opponent.  Your goal is to reach the safe zone, while gathering points along the way; but be careful! There is more than points buried in you path!  One wrong move, and you'll hit a mine, forcing you back to the beginning. &lt;br/&gt;      Safe Zone combines chance with strategy to create a thrilling competitive game experience. Avoid your enemy's mines while hopefully watching them fall prey to your own.  Safe Zone is a 2-player game but was designed to fit 2 additional boards, providing you with that 4 player excitement.  4 can play,  but only one will make it to the Safe Zone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
