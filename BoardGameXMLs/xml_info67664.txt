							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms &amp; Encounters: The Hall of Bedlam</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the passage of untold centuries, the chamber beyond has lost little of its grandeur and awe. Tucked neatly in the chamber&amp;rsquo;s perimeter alcoves are six black marble statues of great warriors armed with swords and shields. Gold and silver necklaces hang from the necks of each statue, and an illuminated torch is tightly wedged between an outstretched arm and torso. A tile mosaic of a man wearing a crown dominates the center of the white, marble floor, although it appears that there was an unsuccessful attempt to alter the subject&amp;rsquo;s appearance to that of a pale-skinned dwarf-human hybrid with gray hair. Three stone slabs, apparently fashioned into the likeness of crude, fur covered beds fill the semicircular area at the far end of the chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large, rectangular shaped room is nearly spotless, thanks to the tireless efforts of four emaciated human males armed with brooms, mops and feather dusters. A small, stocky dwarflike creature with pale blue-white skin, bulbous white eyes, coarse white hair and a long droopy mustache directs their activities with animated gestures and nodding disapproval. He is armed with a repeating light crossbow and a wand, which he wields as if conducting an orchestra. Accompanying him are two similar creatures armed and attired in a similar fashion. Upon meeting your gaze, a maniacal look comes upon them. The trio briefly mutters inanely amongst themselves before directing their attention towards you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover The Hall of Bedlam!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive The Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 16, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
