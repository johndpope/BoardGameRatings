							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Defiance</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unsung Heroes of Ansalon...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one knows their names. There are no Sturm Brightblades or Tanis Half-Elvens among them. Yet for as long as Good has struggled against Evil, they have fought alongside the heroes famed of song and story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are the rogues, spies, diplomats, and scouts of Ansalon, the heroes whose coming goes unheralded and whose passing goes unnoticed. Although the generations will never rally around their legends, these secret freedom fighters remain vital to the struggle. All too often, heroes whose names we know would have failed without the efforts of men and women whose names are lost to all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Defiance offers background on these heroes and guidelines for playing them in the DRAGONLANCE: FIFTH AGE setting. The handbook in this box, titled &amp;quot;Cloak and Dagger,&amp;quot; includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for playing bards, guild thieves, kinder handlers, rebel elves, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Guidelines for creating adventures full of intrigue and mystery, as well as an introduction to some of the kingpins of &amp;quot;underground&amp;quot; Ansalon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Optional rules for playing gully dwarf heroes and for creating the mysterious personalities and hidden agendas that rogue heroes thrive upon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Geographic and historical details on Northern Ergoth, the birthplace of such roguish traditions as bard colleges and thief guilds. Now emerging as the hub of civilization in the Age of Mortals, this unique island is also beautifully presented on a full-color illustrated poster map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This boxed set also features &amp;quot;Storm Over Krynn,&amp;quot; a quest to uncover the truth behind the origin of the terrifying dragonspawn and learn the secrets of the Blue Dragon's latest scheme. Groups can play the adventure as Part Two of the &amp;quot;Dragons of a New Age&amp;quot; cycle or as a stand-alone scenario. This adventure links with events in the second FIFTH AGE novel, &amp;quot;The Day of the Tempest,&amp;quot; by Jean Rabe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Defiance uses the SAGA dramatic adventure rules introduced in the DRAGONLANCE: FIFTH AGE boxed set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
