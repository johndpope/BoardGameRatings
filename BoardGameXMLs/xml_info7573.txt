			<description>Mamoonia is a 2 to 3 hour&amp;ndash;length adventure fantasy game for 1&amp;ndash;6 players, where every player plays the role of one of the King Joseph&amp;rsquo;s sons. They should try to put together the amulet powers again, seeking and discovering which ones, among the 12 fragments, are the 4 real ones. In order to reach such a goal, players must make their own characters progress by increasing their physical strength and mental powers, and by gaining enough experience points to be admitted in the different Orders. The High Priests will help them to face such a difficult task: their heroes start as Apprentices, then they grow into Mystic Warriors, Knights Wizards, Sorcerer Sword-Masters and conclude their evolution becoming capable and powerful Masters of War and Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
