			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phantom 52 is a Roleplaying game where 3-6 characters play the parts of paranormal investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is moderated by a GM (ghost manager if it makes you giggle) who unfolds the story for the players and acts as referee. The most important rule: what the GM says, GOES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting for the adventure may take place in an old mansion, a graveyard, a castle or outer space. Who cares as long as it&amp;rsquo;s fun and spooky? The game may take only an hour for a quick dip into the abyss, or may need to be broken up into sessions (or episodes) for a longer story to unfold. The purpose of the game is to develop and engage in a rich story with friends. Never let yourselves be bogged down by the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
