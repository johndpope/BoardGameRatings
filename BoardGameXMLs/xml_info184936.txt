			<description>Black Eagles Over Belgium: Blucher vs. Napoleon, 1815 is a hex-and-counter wargame covering the Belgium led battles taking place near Waterloo. The game includes three scenarios, the Battle of Ligny, the Battle of Wavre, and the Battle of Plancenoit. A combined campaign is also included with additional rules for movement between the maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Eagles Over Belgium uses a unique chit-pull mechanic that randomly determines turn length. Each turn, players will draw activation chits that allow a certain number of actions until each player has pulled an &amp;quot;End of Turn&amp;quot; chit and a third &amp;quot;End of Turn&amp;quot; chit is pulled. Players must optimize their actions because they never know when a turn is going to end. Some turns will be as short as 2 movement and combat phases and others could last 8 or 9 phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
