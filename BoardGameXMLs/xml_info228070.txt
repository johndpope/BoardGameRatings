							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">House of Flowers</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a warm place sits a mansion made entirely of many-hued flowers, their vines forming the unnatural architecture of mankind. The house grew around two entities, the Heart of Eternity, and the Heart of Chaos. The Heart of Chaos mutated all life around it, changing it beyond recognition, and the Heart of Eternity gave the new life the order necessary to survive. The Hearts arrived long before mankind existed, and they have been locked in a perpetual struggle ever since. A proxy war is fought between the two, using flowers mutated into ambulatory forms as pawns. The battles are fought entirely inside the house, because while immensely powerful, the influence of the Hearts cannot extend outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structure around which the house grew, the Chapel of the Void, is the reason the Hearts cannot leave.  Only dreams they create are dreamt beyond the house. Locals in the area know well enough to avoid the house, as all who have entered were either killed or scarred horrendously, but they all receive the dreams. Those who sleep in the area often dream of entering the house, fighting through the rooms, kidnapping one of the Hearts, and sacrificing it on the altar inside the Chapel of the Void. They dream this will bring them great wealth and power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dreams lie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
