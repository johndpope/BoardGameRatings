							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Creepy Things and Events to Encounter Outdoors II</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collection of creepy occurrences, events and encounters that could be found by players in the outdoors. Some of these encounters are best suited for the countryside, whilst others work best in urban areas. Many are suitable for both. The majority are suitable for any time period or setting, but some will require technology of the level of at least the 19th or 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some encounters may not be immediately obvious as being disturbing; players may have to pay attention or think about what happened, whilst others are far more immediately noticeable. The different encounters may or may not have an actual game effect, and they may simply be misinterpretations. Such is up to the GameMaster. The encounters tend more to supernatural and cosmic horror than gory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various encounters can be determined randomly from the list by rolling a d100, but it may be better to choose suitable ones manually. The list is laid out in a table, with there being a name of what type of encounter it is followed by details on the actual encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one and a bit the front matter and instructions and the remainder is the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example result is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People - This will only happen in an area in which there is a reasonable expectation of finding other people, such as in a town. The streets that the player(s) are on are oddly deserted. All the doors are closed, and all the windows are dark, although any street lamps are working if it is night, and there are no pedestrians or moving vehicles to be seen. There are sounds of regular urban life coming from around corners, or down streets that are just ahead, but when the corner is turned, or the street is reached, the new area is just as deserted and dark as the previous one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
