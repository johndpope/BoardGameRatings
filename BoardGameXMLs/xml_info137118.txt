							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unique Magic Armors and Shields</name>
									
			<description>from How to Use This Document:&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of Unique Magic Armors and Shields is to give Dungeon Masters a way to add some spice to the magic armors found in their games without the need to create lots of overpowered special abilities. Every armor or shield listed in this document has a name, description, and powers (mostly from the normal treasure tables). By using this document, you never have a simple suit of &amp;ldquo;chainmail +1.&amp;rdquo; Instead, you'll be able to provide your players with a unique named armor, with more character, even though the game stats for the weapon may simply be chainmail +1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stats involved are derived from the Mentzer Basic, Expert and Companion sets and the AD&amp;amp;D DMG, and should be compatible with all Classic editions from Gygax/Arneson ('74) through Allston ('91), as well as AD&amp;amp;D and retro-clone systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;Unique Magic Armors and Shields offers categorised listings of new, unique magical armor for D&amp;amp;D (Basic/AD&amp;amp;D) and its retroclones.  The items have a description and an explanation of their properties and effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
