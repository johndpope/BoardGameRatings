							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rogues&#039; Gallery (AD&amp;D 2e)</name>
									
			<description>From the first page...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this publication is to provide the DM with a number of pregenerated nonplayer characters who can be inserted into any AD&amp;amp;D game campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They say that it's hard to find good help these days, but no DUNGEON MASTER will ever have a problem as long as he can draw upon the Rogues' Gallery. Look within and you'll find all manner of non player-character warriors, wizards, priests, and rogues with all their class variations, fully developed and ready to drop into any AD&amp;amp;D campaign. Each of the characters is detailed in the standard, convenient Monstrous Compendium format - including an illustration - with a biography including his or her favorite combat tactics, regular hang- outsm likely cohorts, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NPCs have lives too; give them more than just a number when they next meet and challenge your adventuring party! Visit the Rogues' Gallery and hire some good help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
