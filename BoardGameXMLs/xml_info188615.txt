							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of New Orleans</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Goblin Press is dedicated to bringing the fans new voices and helping a whole new crop of authors develop their voice. Legends of New Orleans is a PDF collection of six non-mythos scenarios based on the historic folklore of the area by talented, but new (or newish) authors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cauchemar&amp;rdquo; by Tyler Hudak&amp;mdash;This rare treat is a one on one scenario, designed for a single player and keeper. A lone investigator is drawn down the rabbit hole while looking for a missing friend. Lost time, shifting realities, ethereal horror, and madness abound in this uniquely New Orleans ghost story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Serva Me&amp;rdquo; by John A. Almack&amp;mdash;Wherein the investigators uncover the haunting past surrounding a young lady's antique chest. Their research into area colonial history leads them from the Garden District to the French Quarter, as they seek to unravel a tragic and ghostly mystery in one of the most haunted cities on earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Deliver Me from Evil&amp;rdquo; by Jon Hook&amp;mdash;Wherein the investigators help an old friend retrieve his prodigal sister from the debauchery of New Orleans. However, she has gotten involved with something far worse things than smoking, gin, or fellas. Her new friends aren&amp;rsquo;t keen on letting her leave, nor are they technically alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Second Voodoo War&amp;rdquo; by Nick Nacario&amp;mdash;Wherein the investigators stumble upon a simmering blood feud between rival clans. A hidden instigator is stirring the pot and tensions are sure to boil over. Investigators soon find themselves caught in the middle of a full blown war fought with curses, spells, and the risen enslaved dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Curse of Devil Baby&amp;rdquo; by Simon Yee&amp;mdash;The story of the cursed Bowes family and their hideous demonic child is a well-known tale in New Orleans. The Devil Baby of Bourbon Street died long ago&amp;hellip; or did it? Investigators are hired by the Bowes family to recover something stolen from them: the remains of a child, taken from a tomb marked only with an X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never Cry Wolf&amp;rdquo; by Mark Shireman&amp;mdash;Rougarou: a human cursed to change into a murderous beast. The word alone sends chills up the spines of the denizens of the bayou. Investigators respond to a series savage attacks on notable citizens. Fear and suspicion quickly spreads as sensational headlines and a respected priest lay the blame for the attacks on a rougarou summoned by &amp;ldquo;The Witch of Bayou Gentilly&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
