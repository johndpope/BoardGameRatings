							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">10 Jungle Creatures from the Adventure Council</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome good Dungeon Master &amp;ndash;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put on your best exploration gear and come with me into the jungle to face the perils that await! And these are no ordinary perils &amp;ndash; from lightning casting crocodiles to teleporting dinosaurs ... these creatures put a new twist on these jungle beasts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are heading to Chult, daring The Tomb of Annihilation or ropming through a homebrew jungle these creatures will help flesh out the encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst these creatures have fantastical powers they have been designed and written after significant research into the creatures themselves. This included getting some advice on animal behaviour from both crocodile and gorilla experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even the Cyclops was researched by going back to the original myths and what you have here is an intelligent, magic weapon and armour forging cyclops who is sadly a little too fond of his drink and almost perpetually hungry. Stay around him too long and he will insist you go fetch him dinner - and cue the Stygian Goat multi-stage skill challenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Which in our honest opinion is much more interesting than the dumb, lumbering brutish cyclops featured in the Monster Manual!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what you get, across 13 pages and 7000 words is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 Creatures with creative fluff descriptions and seven full stat blocks. You also get a four part multi-stage skill challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zig and Zag, Dire Crocodiles - deadlier when encountered as a pair! AVAILABLE FOR FREE THROUGH THE DOWNLOADABLE PREVIEW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stygian Bats:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brood Master - calls the shots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swarm of Stygian Bats - can sweep you off your feet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stygian Wasps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunter Wasps &amp;ndash; two different attack types&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gatherer Wasps &amp;ndash; two different attack types&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jungle Apes - written so you can have your players encounter a whole troop of apes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silverback - the boss!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ape - the troops&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young Ape - the youngsters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyclops &amp;ndash; Thandor (NPC) - depending on his mood (it varies) he can enhance your magic armour and weapons - infact he might insist (hopefully he won't be so drunk he botches it!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stygian Goat Skill Challenge &amp;ndash; a four stage multi part skill challenge - Thandor might insist you go fetch him dinner - (challenge can be used independently of Thandor)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tyrannosaurus Rex &amp;ndash; Culus, The Great Terror - a teleporting, one eyed murderous T-Rex - does it get cooler than that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
