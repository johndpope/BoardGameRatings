			<description>Simple children's card game, based on characters from Grimms' fairytales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are dealt out evenly. The first player asks any other playerr for a card that is the pair of one of his cards. If a pair is found, the enquirer is encouraged to read the rhyming text on both cards. This will make the game more interesting, especially for the younger players. He or she then places the pair in front of them. Play proceeds clockwise. When all the cards are used up, the player with the most pairs, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
