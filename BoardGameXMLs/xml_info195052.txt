			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He&amp;rsquo;ll throw the heroes a curve ball&amp;hellip; Changeup!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 11 Rogue, Changeup is an athlete whose enhancements are definitely not approved by any professional sports league. Changeup is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changeup&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;ldquo;Blue&amp;quot; to identify the technology he employs in his criminal activities. Outfitted with cybernetics and hi-tech weapons that suit his chosen theme of baseball, he is ready to challenge any hero who fancies themselves a skilled athlete. Changeup&amp;rsquo;s ego won&amp;rsquo;t let him lose to anyone, even someone with super-powers, and he&amp;rsquo;ll hold a grudge against anyone who dares to show him up. Heroes who despise the misuse of technology will want to put a stop to Changeup&amp;rsquo;s crimes, and will also be very interested in tracking down the mysterious source of his strange technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
