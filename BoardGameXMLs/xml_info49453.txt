							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Van Richten&#039;s Guide to the Created</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. -- Mary Shelley, Frankenstein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed with satchel and saw, the creator slips into the night.  He seeks the freshly dug grave and the unguarded morgue, selecting each body part with care.  In the twilight before dawn, he tailors a perfect form, seeing no fault in the livid flesh or the crude black stitching.  Creating a new life is his sole obsession -- yet the thing he creates brings only misery and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The golems of Ravenloft boast powers unseen in other realms, for they are shaped by the demiplane's mysterious forces.  Join Dr. Van Richten as he exposes the evil that is the Created.  Learn his theories on construction and animation, and discover his hard-won notes on the golem's phenomenal strength.  Heed well his sage advice, for whether their parts are human or otherwise, the Created are cunning and relentless foes, rising again and again from apparent death.  Only with the knowledge herein can a hunter utterly destroy such a monster, until nothing but ashes and nightmares remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
