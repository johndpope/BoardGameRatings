			<description>A recreation of Australian Rules Football using a Tiddlywink mechanic. Players assume the role of the 18th player and move the football to images of the 17 other players on the board. The player retains possession as long as the football is &amp;quot;kicked&amp;quot; to an image of their player who is deemed to have caught or &amp;quot;marked&amp;quot; the ball. If the football falls on the picture of an opposing player or in an open field, the opponent takes control of the ball. Wooden goalposts at each end signify the goalposts and a player can either secure a goal (6 points) or behind (1 point), depending on the accuracy of their aim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The football has a red and blue side, and if the ball goes off the board (&amp;quot;out of bounds&amp;quot;), it is flipped and whatever colour lands face-up gains possession. When a football equally sits on a red and blue player, the colour that is face-up determines which player has possession. Flipping is also used to determine who kicks the ball first at the commencement of the game or after a goal is scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner can be determined by the first to reach a pre-determined number of points, or using an elapsed amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game first came out during the late 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
