			<description>Galloping Bowling is a rather rare Bakelite collectible dice game most likely manufactured in the early 1940s by Galloping Games, Inc.. The game consists of five catalin dice with faces depicting pins with numbers representing the number of knocked down pins or a special marking such as spare (/), strike (X) or split (O).  As in standard &amp;quot;lane bowling&amp;quot;, the dice game is played by rolling dice twice for each frame and uses a similar scoring sheet to regulation bowling. Another game by the same publisher already included on Board Game Geek is the more available &amp;quot;Galloping Golf&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
