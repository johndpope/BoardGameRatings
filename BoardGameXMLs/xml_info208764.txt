			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Roleplaying Game From Under the Floorboards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Folk have been lurking on the margins of human society since before the dawn of history, but we humans don't tend to notice them. They're really good at hiding from us. They're also good at arguing, picking fights, sulking, and splitting up into cliques. But they're tough, clever (on their good days), and armed with an array of startling magical powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Folk is a game of wainscot urban fantasy, built round the popular FATE rules engine. Take your pick of seven different cliques, from aggressive goblins to oh-so-superior brownies and technophile gremlins (or the cliqueless, because some people just have to be different), and an array of skills and magical powers, personalise your character with aspects and stunts, and get out there and get underfoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and watch out for cats, rats, hawks, mousetraps, and your neighbours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
