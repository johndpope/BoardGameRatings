			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will play through four days of school. The first three will be right before some impactful event the opening night of the next Harry Potter movie, or the Student Council mandated My Little Pony Day, or the school trip to the lake. We&amp;rsquo;ll each have to decide something which character to dress up as, which pony to wear on your shirt, or what activity to dress for. The cool kids will all make the same choice. The cool kids are the ones who make the same choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth school day will be right before the big party. Here, you'll decide whose party to go to. The cool kids all go to the coolest party. The coolest party is the one the cool kids go to. The pecking order at the time of the parties will determine the winner of the game, as well as the second place, third place and so on. This is a game in which you play for position. After all, most people know they'll never be the queen, so they vie to be her favorite drone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes three files&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Index (1-page PDF with links and short description)&lt;br/&gt;- Cool Kids (5-page google doc - game rules)&lt;br/&gt;- Reference Sheets (6-page PDF - supplemental rules and materials)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
