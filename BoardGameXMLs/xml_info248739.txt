			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Zeeks Expanded! By Smoke_And_Mirrors (AKA David Viars)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you're looking for the straight skinny on Zeeks, Psions, Psychics, those weird people who can use their mind to do freaky things, well congratulations you've run across this guide! If you're a baby Zeek, you'll find all kinds of info in here left out of the mainstream publications. Lots of useful stuff to help you survive, you're welcome by the way. If you're some close minded would be zeek hunter trying to hunt us down because of some mandate from your nailed God, or because you fear us, good for you too! If I ever cross you, I promise I'll only make you think you're a prepubescent girl for a month. For the rest of you reading this, pay attention, maybe you'll learn something and come away with a different perspective on your mind bending brethren.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
