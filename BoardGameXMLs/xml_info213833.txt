							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Marid</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queens of the Ocean!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be no doubt that the marids are a powerful and fearsome race. The most individually powerful of genie kind, they are undisputed masters of the Elemental Plane of Water, forcing all beneath the waves to bow to their capricious whims. Their underwater kingdoms are said to be beautiful beyond comparison, rivaled only by the grace and beauty of the marids themselves. Free spirits one and all, they chafe at the thought of being enslaved by mortal wizards, though no matter how many times they avenge such injustices, the mortals never seem to learn. It is rumored among these mages that there are some marids who rival&amp;mdash;or even exceed&amp;mdash;the greatest marid nobles in power, and these are the mythic marids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents game statistics for a mythic marid, which has several unique abilities never seen elsewhere. A mythic marid can bestow her favor on another creature, only to take it away later and force them to suffer from withdrawal. Her mercurial nature makes her incredibly difficult to ensnare. Perhaps a mythic marid&amp;rsquo;s most notorious power is her ability to strip the ability to breathe water from others, dooming them to a watery grave. Finally, in addition to the mythic marid itself, the book contains rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by characters of any class in order to summon a mythic marid, as well as two such rituals: the cerulean current step, and the chorus of the highest tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
