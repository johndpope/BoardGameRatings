			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ve got in your hands here is a simple but powerful little role playing game. It plays out from start to finish in perhaps four or five hours. During that time you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself deep in a struggle between the things your characters desperately need to turn their lives around and the people they are willing to sacrifice to get there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these stories our protagonists are at a crucial juncture in their lives. They&amp;rsquo;re just now preparing to turn their lives around for the better. Problem is, there&amp;rsquo;s a deadly infection going around, turning everyone they know and love into monsters. Will your character fix their life? What kind of monster will they become while they&amp;rsquo;re trying to make that fix?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My first inspiration for this design was zombie movies. But, as the game grew and transformed, I realized that it&amp;rsquo;s a great system for playing out all sorts of monster movies. From The Lost Boys to The Thing, any movie where the people eventually become one of the monsters can inspire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
