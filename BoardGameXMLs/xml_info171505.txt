							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golanda: The Kingdom of Hope</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom of Hope is a benevolent theocracy under the administration of Renowned Healer Henry Alan of Tarn's Cross. The Renowned Healer is not married, but he entertains a consort named Clarice the Nimble and accorded great honor. By law, the Renowned Healer must be a cleric of Samariachau, though temples and shrines to other gods abound. The country is split into twelve administrative regions each headed by a Benevolent Healer. By tradition, the Benevolent Healer of the Lumina Temple inherits the mantle of Renowned Healer when a new one is required and occupies the office for life. The Renowned Healer customarily appoints a council of twelve to help govern. These are usually men or women recommended by each of the Benevolent Healers. The country was ruled autocratically in a couple of instances, with no council, but such is not the case with the current administration. The Renowned Healer also has a secretary and various functionaries, as he deems appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
