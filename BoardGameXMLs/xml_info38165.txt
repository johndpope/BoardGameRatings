Each player controls a group of Kids with Water guns.&amp;rdquo; The winner is the first player to soak ten opposing kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck includes twenty-three different types of water guns, each rated for Volume (amount of water expended per attack) and Capacity (amount of water held). There are also cards for each type of Kid, rated for Hits (amount of water required to soak) and any special advantages. There are also Modifier and Event Cards which can offer assistance in attack or defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the arsenal of water guns, the players may also be able to obtain Water Balloon tokens during the game.
