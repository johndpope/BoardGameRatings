							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Equinox 2015: Riflemen of Saipan</name>
									
			<description>This Gold Club Golden Journal attempts to dial back the incredible firepower of the Marine platoons included in Saipan. This product corrected the values on the Marine counters for the early version of the Panzer Grenadier: Saipan game. This journal includes the lower DF Marines at 8-3 rather than 10-3 direct fire. The newer version of Saipan have the correct Marine counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the Journal, however, are several Japanese tanks that were produced (Type 1 and Type 3) or were coming into production (Type 4) by the end of the war. In normal Golden Journal fashion, we have to have a scenario to play where we use these toys and one alternative history scenario is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
