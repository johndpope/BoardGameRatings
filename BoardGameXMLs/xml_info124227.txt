			<description>A harvest-themed racing game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: One board with a spinner, 16 harvest cards, 4 pawns, 2 dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game: Being the first player to collect one's harvest (4 different harvest cards) and get it to the barn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it is played: Each player takes a farmer pawn, puts it on the corresponding farm space and places the corresponding harvest cards (potato bag, corn, cabbage and wheat) on the corresponding field. Players then take turns moving the spinner, throwing the die/dice (except during a thunderstorm) and moving their pawn.&lt;br/&gt;The spinner shows the weather: Sun helps the farmer with the harvest - use both dice and move the corresponding number of spaces. Wind also helps the farmer to move faster - throw one die, move, turn the spinner again. Rain slows the farmer down - use only one die. Thunderstorms mean its too dangerous - the player loses one turn.&lt;br/&gt;Pawns are moved from the farm to the field, where one harvest card is taken up and then brought back to the farm. On the players next turn, he moves his farmer to a different field etc.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player's farmer has taken all his harvest cards to his farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
