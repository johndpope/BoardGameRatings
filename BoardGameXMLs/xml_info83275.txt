							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silent Hunter Commander&#039;s Edition</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command a WWII US submarine in the Pacific - and sink as much enemy tonnage as possible! Choose from a variety of American submarines - and let the hunt begin! Play historical missions, hypothetical encounters or a career based campaign game. Authentic WWII film footage, cinematics and narration provide a historically accurate feel for submarine combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Special Edition is Loaded with Extras!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its 9 Patrol Zones and 15 historical scenarios, Silent Hunter is the ultimate submarine combat simulator. Now imagine the award winning sub sim PLUS a powerful add-on scenario editor. Forty-five extra historical scenarios. Six new Patrol Zones (some of which are available here for the first time). And an exclusive article on submarine warfare by William &amp;quot;Bud&amp;quot; Gruner, who commanded the USS Skate in WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine no longer. Silent Hunter Commander's Edition includes all of this - in one box!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulation Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Authentic WWII American sub classes include Gato, Balao, Tambour and Salmon.&lt;br/&gt;     Features detailed re-creations of over 40 merchant and capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy.&lt;br/&gt;     Highly accurate coastline models for 15 patrol zones - from the Solomons to the Sea of Japan. Coastal cities, ports and harbors have been reconstructed from period maps.&lt;br/&gt;     Weapons have been accurately modeled, and the Torpedo Data Computer (TDC) is the most accurate representation to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
