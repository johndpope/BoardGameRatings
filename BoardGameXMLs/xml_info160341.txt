							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Squinkies Boys Battle Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a game with custom rubber dice made for small rubber figures called Squinkies. Each player starts the game with a number of Squinkies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a six square grid with symbols in each of the grids and a 'Pit' where spare fighters are kept (a downloadable PDF).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a die. The die roll determines whether you remove Squinkies from play, regenerate previously defeated Squinkies, lose a turn or reroll a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player that has Squinkies remaining wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
