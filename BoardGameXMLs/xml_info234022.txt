			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colours of Magic: Black Fifth Edition Update&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Spectrum Shift: Chromatic Arcana Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You might hear of Black Magic, and think of witches, or destructive powers, or the forces of darkness. Historically, we have a tendancy to quantify black as evil. But imagine a universe where every colour has power, and each can be used by good or evil for their own aims and goals. What then would Black signify? For Black is a colour unlike any other: when you remove the light, it is what is left. Black is the absence of colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one such universe, Black is the power of things outside the spectrum. Beings from other planes of existance and things from other realities, and the power to move between levels of dimensions are all aspects of this colour. Those who seek to understand the outside might learn to summon and bind those powers, or instead learn to move themselves to places beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Class options, one for each of Cleric (Binder), Sorcerer (Unshackled) and Wizard (Summoner)&lt;br/&gt;    a reclassification of one eleventh of the spells of the players handbook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
