			<description>The goal is to get to 10th level - you begin at 6th. Each player has one card for every level they are, and maintains that hand size throughout the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round the players are striving to collect sets of weapons, through fast paced Borderlands like trading. When a set is collected, it can be played on a section of game board that represents part of a giant. For instance, 3 of a kind can be played on the giant's lower legs, scoring that for the player to play it. Players who score a lot - or score the head, the last part of the giant that can be scored, go up a level for next hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some other cards also, a tombstone that is bad to have, monster attacks you play on other players, shields that protect you from these attacks, and loot that increases your starting hand size on the next hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
