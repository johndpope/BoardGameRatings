							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rec-League Quidditch</name>
									
			<description>Rec-League Quidditch is an exciting quidditch-themed tile-placement game with some elements of skill-building and risk analysis for two players.  During the game, each player will control three characters on a team.  These characters will compete for control of the quidditch pitch, using the quaffle, bludger, and snitch to score points, as well as continually improving their strength, speed, and skill to win the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round is played by placing the character tiles in a line on the pitch, in between tiles representing the three quidditch balls.  The location on the line,as well as the particular ball that each character is adjacent to will determine the possible action they can take for the round.  Once all characters have been placed, they are activated by either using adjacent ball tiles to score points, or using them to build up their strength, speed, or skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, one character on each team will be the designated seeker, and will be hunting down the snitch.  Catching the snitch will take not only skill, but a little luck as well, so players would be wise to make sure they time their attempts to catch the snitch when it would only be to their advantage, and not their opponent's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catching the snitch awards a team 50 points, and the game is over after the round ends in which either the snitch is caught, or one team has scored at least 150 points total.  The winner is the team with the most points at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
