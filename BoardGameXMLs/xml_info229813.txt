			<description>A One-Round Adventure for 13th Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crimson Codex Faction Adventure 12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Age of Giants, experiments both mundane and magical were carried out in the name of power and progress. Perhaps none of the experiments were more controversial than the one performed by a frost giant named Yzilax Ikkerstol, who believed that time was not a constant, but something that could be controlled and even used as a tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yzilax carried out his experiments on a frozen glacial island in the middle of the Iceflow Sea. His experiments involved arcane magic, divine magic, psionic magic, shadow magic, and incarnum, as well as tapping planar power. Yzilax&amp;rsquo;s experiments were only partially complete when the quori invasion plummeted all of Xen&amp;rsquo;drik into war. Fellow giants urged Yzilax to suspend his work and help repel the invasion from Dal Quor, but the war only strengthened Yzilax&amp;rsquo;s belief that his work would lead to the creation of a weapon more powerful than any seen before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hoping to repel threats from the quori, as well as the giants he forsook, Yzilax employed guardians and time-bending traps to protect his work. The experiments and discoveries of Yzilax continued apace until the unleashing of the magic by the giants that ended the war, closed the gate to Dal Quor, and eventually plunged the giant civilizations on Xen&amp;rsquo;drik into chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The draconic Prophecy reveals that the survival of the Codex on Xen&amp;rsquo;drik is very unlikely, and the continued existence of any of its members anywhere is growing more unlikely by the day. But information from the daelkyr Virulence, and help from the blue dragon Stormrider, point to some hope of reducing the scope of the loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happened to Yzilax and his experiments has been lost to time. But the remains of his work, and perhaps more startling finding, remained locked in a frozen prison on that glacial island near Everice. But some know something about the Tower of Time that sits in silence atop the glacier. And soon the Crimson Codex will as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
