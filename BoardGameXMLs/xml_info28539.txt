			<description>ShaNuCo, according to the game's rulebook, stands for Shapes, Numbers and Colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a card game with 76 very large playing cards (Approx. 3&amp;quot; x 4&amp;quot;).  Of these, 64 are marked with all combinations of  the numbers 1-4, each color of blue, red, purple and green, and either a circle, star, square or triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the cards are either Wild, Super Wild, Pass or Show cards, in some combination of the three characteristics that the main cards represent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's box is approximately 4.5&amp;quot; x 6&amp;quot; x 1&amp;quot;.  Instructions are in English, French and Spanish, and fit on both sides of a 4&amp;quot; x 6&amp;quot; sheet of paper (per language).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 Players. &lt;br/&gt;The box claims 4-104 as appropriate ages for the game, but the rules are possibly too sophisticated for a child under 6 or 8 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to gain the most points after 5 rounds of play. Each player starts with 100 points, and each round a player may both gain or lose points, depending on game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copyright 1996.&lt;br/&gt;Published by International Playthings, Inc. (Parsippany, NJ, USA), it appears to be their product number P55001.  Also credited on the box are Creative Concepts, Inc. and Excel Development Group, Inc. &amp;quot;Made in Canada&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
