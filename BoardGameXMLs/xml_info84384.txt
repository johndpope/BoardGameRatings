							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">George Foreman&#039;s KO Boxing</name>
									
			<description>George Foreman's KO Boxing is a boxing game produced by Acclaim. The games was released in 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and other 16-bit gaming consoles such as the Super Nintendo that features retired multiple heavyweight champion and inventor of the Foreman grill, George Foreman. The game was also later available on the 8-bit Sega Master System, and virtually identical Sega Game Gear version, due to the similarity of the hardware architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 16-bit versions, the player takes a generic boxer and must go on to defeat other generic boxers in the game in order to take on George Foreman in a 12-round boxing match featuring toe-to-toe action. Instant replays of every knockout provide a realistic pay-per-view look to the action that is going on in the screen. The game uses various camera angles for added realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 8-bit versions, the player character is George Foreman himself, and &amp;quot;powers up&amp;quot; before each match against increasingly difficult fighters. Unlike the 16-bit versions, the game is only side view action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;George Foreman's KO Boxing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
