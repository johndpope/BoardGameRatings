			<description>Players are dealt 12, 10 or 8 cards depending on the number of players. The cards are three types - Land cards, Goods cards and Choice cards (which act as jokers).&lt;br/&gt;The game plays a little like Rummy as players have to collect sets which are laid in front of them. You can add to your sets and you can add to opponents' sets.&lt;br/&gt;The sets within the card types consist of a Question and related answers so a little trivia knowledge helps you not to overlook cards you need.&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the one who plays all their cards first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
