			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;A semi-cooperative bluffing board game. Players each take the role of an adventure party member and help out defeating monsters. Once the game ends, each player puts forward the treasures that he has earned, however everyone is allowed to stash away anything he suspects the other players didn't notice him getting. Players can then accuse each other for not being honest, and anyone caught in the act has to pay a penalty. The player with the most treasures at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back&lt;br/&gt;Players cooperate to form a party and defeat the monster in the Lost Forest. When all is done, the gems that players have earned are all divided. But that's not wholly true. You are allowed to hide away the gems you believe your party members don't remember you getting. If you get away with it, you can keep it for yourself. And the player who have earned the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
