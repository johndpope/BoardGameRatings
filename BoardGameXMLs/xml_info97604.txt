							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TOTENTANZ aka DANCE MACABRE</name>
									
			<description>Just one more dance!&lt;br/&gt;Every year the kindoms most powerful necromancers battle for rulership. So they send their undead minions around the deadly parcours of the central graveyard. &lt;br/&gt;The necromancer, who has sorted all his minions in the right order in his crypt, wins the crown of suprmacy and is ruler of the guild of necromancers for one year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember SORRY! from 1934? We pimped the board, switched the setting to competiting necromancers and set the playing pieces to 6 each (in order of power from 1 to 6: Slime, Skeleton, Zombie, Ghoul, Vampire, Lich). A bunch of magic spell and effect cards - and &amp;quot;Totentanz&amp;quot; (Dance Macabre) was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the undead have a power rank and they can't beat each others like in SORRY!, because you can only hit another undead with the same or lower power rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The different power ranks of the undead are giving its necromancer different points for placing (in the right order) in the crypt. For example: the slime, which is the weakest creature (Power:1) has a value of 6 points when placed on its appropriate place in the crypt, while the lich (Power: 6) gives you only 1 point!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the clash of bones! Just hop on the &amp;quot;Chariot of Death&amp;quot; and run over your fellow undeads, use your Zombie to attack another necromancers skeleton with the &amp;quot;Flail of Stone&amp;quot; or let your lich cast &amp;quot;Vivisection&amp;quot; across the board to hinder your opponents vampire from entering the crypt. Always a favourite: &amp;quot;Break in the weather - Sunshine&amp;quot; cast on a vampire (got your vacuum cleaner ready?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
