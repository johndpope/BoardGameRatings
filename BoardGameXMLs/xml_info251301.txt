			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is close to two hundred and fifty million years after a global disaster and the final war of man, all that once was is now gone. The super-continent of Pangaea Ultima is covered with dangerous and poisonous jungles infested with prehistoric monsters and beast. To this new world the last surviving underground shelters have finally opened their thick blast doors and orbiting stations have landed to become what is known as city hubs. Places where the knowledge of all the ages of the world is stored; they also provide an endless supplies of energy which is used to power everything from lights and anti-gravity vehicles to laser and factories. The ancient machines can transform energy into anything their owners want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
