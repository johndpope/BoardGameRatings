			<description>Dazzle, a.k.a. 4 Seasons, is a two-player card game that plays in 15 to 20 minutes. Each player fights over four categories &amp;mdash; pure, dawn, spiral, and faith &amp;mdash; that correspond to four colors; there are 12 cards with the value 1-3 in each category, and the cards are dealt so that each player has a mix of the same value cards in their deck, with some cards being secretly removed from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they present two cards from their hand face up. The opponent takes one of those cards and places it on their side of the board, adding to their power in that category; the other card is added to the score for that category at the end of the game. Players alternate turns until all of the cards have been distributed, then players see who has the most strength in each category. The winner of a category wins all the points in that category, and whoever collects the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
