			<description>from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a way to solve a problem for a well-known win condition and an excuse to create another game on a colorful board I enjoy (the first was Swaparound). The game is called Spry, which is a contraction of the phrase &amp;quot;Spread Y&amp;quot;. The problem is that if you play the game Y on a hexhex board, the center of the board is much more important than the periphery, especially on a small board. Spry is a way to fix that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's for two players, played with Black and White stones, on a colorful board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
