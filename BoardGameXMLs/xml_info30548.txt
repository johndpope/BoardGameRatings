			<description>The game consists of a base with eight large plastic tower sections which are built up into a leaning tower.  Each tower segment has 16 columns molded on the side and these are aligned before the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simplest game consists of rolling two dice to find the tower segment to be rotated and how many columns it is to be rotated, either clockwise or counter-clockwise.  The player who causes the tower to collapse loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the more advanced version, players may choose which tower segment to rotate and by how much - between 1 and 3 columns - and the player scores 1 point for each column rotation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the final version of the game, players chose a tower element for the player on the left to use and all players are involved in constructing the tower before rotation begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: The English language rules don't state that you cannot reverse the last move made.  This is compulsory to make the game playable.  For the simplest game, if the same tower segment is chosen, then it must be rotated in the same direction as the last move.  Alternately, you can use a House Rule that states that the towers can only be rotated clockwise.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
