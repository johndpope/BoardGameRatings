			<description>Be the player to win the battle against Shiwan Khan. To go into battle, you must have a Margo Lane card, a Reinhardt Lane card, and the Phurba in your possession.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving The Shadow pawn and following the instructions on the space.&lt;br/&gt;Collecting cards is very important throughout the game. When you collect a card, keep it secret it your hand. Some cards are needed for the final battle, some you play on your turn or another player's turn. No player may have more than four cards at a time.&lt;br/&gt;If you have the necessary cards and the Phurba and it is your turn, you can battle Shiwan Khan by rolling the Phurba dice five times. If you get doubles in that time, you win. Otherwise, you surrender the Phurba and continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
