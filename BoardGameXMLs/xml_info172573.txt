			<description>ChitChat is a card game for two players that simulates the exchange of small talk between two acquaintances at a social function. Each player has a pet topic and the first player to make a couple of points on their pet topic wins the game. Alternatively if one player lets the conversation lag, then their opponent has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a deck of cards formed from two regular decks.&lt;br/&gt;The suits are considered to match the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;    Hearts    - sport&lt;br/&gt;    Diamonds  - economy&lt;br/&gt;    Spades    - politics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are laid out in a track as played, showing the flow of conversation. The game tracks who is currently winning the argument by having the layout stepped towards the currently dominant player. Strategy revolves around the tension between holding cards back to block versus capitalizing on an advantage. You can win by scoring a few points, or by running your opponent's hand down so that they are unable to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
