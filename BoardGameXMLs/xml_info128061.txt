			<description>The game consists of large flower tiles in which animals are also shown, and matching flower cards. Besides a memory game, other simple rule sets are also supplied. One is like musical chair: The number of flowers in each color is one less than there are players. The players run around the flowers, and when one player calls out a color, the players have to put their hands on the flowers in that color - the player who is last is out. Continue until only one player remains. &lt;br/&gt;In another game, a card is flipped over and all players turn up flowers - a player who finds the matching one can keep it and flip over a new card. The first player who gets three flowers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components of the game are large and suitable for the outdoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
