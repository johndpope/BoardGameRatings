							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">G-Core: Cosmic</name>
									
			<description>New Character Generation, Powers, and NPCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this product you will find new powers and Hero Types based around cosmic style heroes. You might notice that some of these Hero Types also have the same Origin names as in G-Core. I did this because the Physical Stat and Mental Stat Pools come from Hero Types. If you were playing a Demi-God with a Physical Stat Pool of 50, that would be crazy. But that's not to say you can't play straight from the G-Core book. You still need it for other point information. Not to mention, if you are playing the great grandchild of a Demi-God then the straight G-Core creation is just what you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
