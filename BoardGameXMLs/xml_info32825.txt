			<description>25/28mm modern skirmish system.  Rules cover infantry and vehicles.  Players are intended to use about a squad each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game relies on a card based activation system - each character is assigned a card and activates when it is drawn.  Elite characters get a second card but receive fewer actions when it comes up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Task rolls are done with a single six-sided die and generally scale by distance.  Better trained characters receive a larger bonus to their tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage is an opposed roll (damage versus strength) and can inflict death or one of several wound states.  Wounds reduce movement and penalize a character on skill tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The morale rules are tucked away in the back of the rules, but boil down to checking morale for certain casualty-based triggers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook does not provide a points or scenario system, though there is a system for generating squads.  Wargames Journal has published at least one scenario for the game as a free PDF download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
