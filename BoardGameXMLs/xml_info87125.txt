							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spells of Glory</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jeshatan have mastered many kinds of spells, one of which are Spells of Glory. Glory is one of the twelve great schools of their Arcane Collection. There are many that believe that the rumors of the Kn&amp;rsquo;at&amp;rsquo;an are true and that there was once another elemental plane that they destroyed. Many believe that this plane was the Plane of Glory which still lingers in pockets throughout the multiverse. Indeed, many believe that this is why world after world insists that the past was always better than the present&amp;hellip;because it really was. The last vestiges of the plane are largely found in the minds of men in their hopes and dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
