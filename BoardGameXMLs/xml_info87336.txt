			<description>Heroes, Villains, and Vigilantes is the title of a superhero-themed board game where two players use the forces of good and evil to vie for control of the city. The game currently features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 characters cards (5 heroes, 5 villains, 5 vigilantes, and support characters - Police Lieutenant, Police Squad, Mobster, Gangsters, and Street Punks)&lt;br/&gt;12 location cards&lt;br/&gt;markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is achieved by controlling a majority of the locations in play. Each player takes control of either the Heroes or the Villains. There are also five independent vigilantes that can be persuaded to join either team over time. The Mob is an extra resource for the Villains that can be driven out of the picture by the Heroes, and the cops swing with City Hall. If City Hall falls under the sway of evil, corruption runs rampant, and the police will actively help the Villains. Clean up City Hall, and the police become the force for Good they're supposed to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fate of The City is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                        &lt;br/&gt;                    &lt;br/&gt;                &lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HVV is now available as a free PNP edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
