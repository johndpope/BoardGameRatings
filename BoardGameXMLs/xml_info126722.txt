							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantail Handball</name>
									
			<description>Fantail Handball is another board game of the Line Fantail dedicated to sports. It is a didactic and very entertaining board game where two teams develop Handball in a board game by using (2) smart charts each. Because it has a single disc on the board which is used as a ball, the Fantail Handball is a game very agile. In the smart carts are designed rules and tactics of Handball. Through the launch of a role given to 8 faces in smart charts are being obtained different game variations, which can lead to the movement of the ball among players in attack, cause the exclusion of a player, cause a foul, result in passive play or score a goal.&lt;br/&gt;The symbols printed on the smart charts are in direct relation to the symbols printed on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
