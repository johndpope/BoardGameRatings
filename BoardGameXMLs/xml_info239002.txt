							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trouble Under Arn Forest</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble in Arn Forest is designed for a party of 4-6 PCs of 4th-6th level of non-evil alignment, a good balance of character classes is advised. It takes place in Icespear valley and Arn Forest, in the Silver Marches region of the Western Heartlands in Faer&amp;ucirc;n, using the Forgotten Realms setting. The module can be run using any small settlement where dwarven hold and a forlorn forest is in the vicinity. All encounters can be easily modified to suit larger or smaller parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second installment of three in the Aranea Queen campaign, where the first one was Trouble in Ironboot Mine. The third and final chapter is Trouble in Doomspire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strange and alien object is in the PC&amp;rsquo;s possession and they need to figure out what it is and where it came from. Their investigation leads them to ancient ruins of an underground aranea city. Their discoveries might lead them down a dangerous and terrible path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
