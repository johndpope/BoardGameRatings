							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Whately Manor</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[The Curse of Whately Manor] details a single-evening live adventure for 12 players. The game is in the spirit of the 60's Hammer horror movies, and mixes sleazy Lovecraftian references with a lot of silliness. The setting for the movie is sometime in the 60's, in an old English mansion at an occult auction. Alex Whately, the owner of the mansion, died two weeks ago. He was apparently a victim of the famous &amp;quot;Vampire murderer.&amp;quot; Whately was found in the mansion drained almost entirely of blood by the morning maid. The mansion and all of its property are now owned by the Whately family in New England, who authorized the firm of March and Liddell to auction off all of the properties. The most unusual of the series of auctions which March and Liddell are running is a small auction of Whately's occult collection. This auction features a copy of Olius Wormius translation of the Necronomicon. Many dangerous groups interested in the book, as well as several figures involved in the Vampire murders have shown up at the auction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
