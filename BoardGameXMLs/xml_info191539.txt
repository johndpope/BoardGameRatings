			<description>Marienk&amp;auml;fer, flieg: The players start on the orange spaces on the outher ring. The first player to reach the center space wins the game. Movement is determined by a die. Direction of movement from each space follows the direction of the antlers of the pictured lady bug. If the antlers point to another ring, the player changes rings and moves in the direction of the first space on that ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has another game on the backside: Kindergl&amp;uuml;cksspiel. To win this game the players have to move from one of the outher starting spaces to the center space. Movement is determined by two dice of which the player may chose one to make his move. The players move their meeples one space in the direction that matches their chosen die. &lt;br/&gt;If a meeple gets on a space that is already occupied by another meeple, the later one must start anew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
