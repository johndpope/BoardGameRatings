			<description>The story of this sequel of the series takes place 20 years after the last Goketsuji tournament. It also has a darker and more serious tone than its predecessors, similar to that of Garou: Mark of the Wolves, but still maintains a little of the same humor that is particular to the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players can choose from eleven characters, all of them, save Otane/Oume, being new. The graphic style of Groove on Fight is very different from its predecessors, as the sprites are smaller, but are more fluid and have an animated look to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Sega Saturn port of the game, many animation frames were cut; the port included some features like being able to play as Damian, Bristol Weller and Bristol-D once the player beats the game with certain characters, the possibility of four players to play at the same time by way of the Saturn's multi-tap and an &amp;quot;Omake Mode&amp;quot; where the players can view artwork of the characters for the game. The Saturn version also features an arranged version of the soundtrack that has some new music themes that were not present in the original, like the theme &amp;quot;Mystic&amp;quot; and the vocal version of the title song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is in a 2-on-2 format with the ability to tag in and out at any time between players. Every time the player tag successfully between characters, the character who is on the sidelines slowly begins to get his or her energy back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At difference from the previous games, Groove on Fight has a six buttons system. The two new buttons are for &amp;quot;Dodge&amp;quot; and for the &amp;quot;Powerful Blow&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;Dodge&amp;quot; allows the characters to evade attacks and then counterattack the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Power Instinct&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
