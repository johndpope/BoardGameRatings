							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Force on Force: Cold War Gone Hot â€“ World War III 1986</name>
									
			<description>From Osprey website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Ronald Reagan, 1984. With these words, spoken as a sound check to a radio broadcast, President Reagan came dangerously close to igniting the long-simmering Cold War. Although Soviet forces were placed on alert following reports of this comment, the full-scale conflict between the West and the Soviet Bloc did not break out. Cold War Gone Hot, the latest companion volume for Force on Force, looks at the 44-year history of the Cold War and asks: &amp;ldquo;what if?&amp;rdquo; With the orders of battle, vehicle stats and missions included in this volume, Force on Force players can simulate the advance of Soviet tanks across Western Europe, a thrust into Alaska, or any number of other plausible scenarios where history took a slightly different path.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
