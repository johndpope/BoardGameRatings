			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets Man Was Not Meant to Know&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomes of Ancient Knowledge introduces an entirely new flavor of magic for the 5th Edition of the world's most famous roleplaying game, especially a horror-themed game like the official 5th Edition Curse of the Vampire adventure saga or any campaign exploring the mist-shrouded Loft of Ravens. This product details a simplified sanity system that enables your players to experience the slow crumbling of their grip on reality but without making their characters unplayable. It also expands the basic concepts of existing magic and how to reshape common spells into mind-bending abominations that anyone foolish enough to attempt can unleash upon an unsuspecting world. Besides these broader themes, Tomes of Ancient Knowledge brings you a trio of eldritch books of magic, each delving into a different theme, from the deranged poetry of pain in the Palestone Analects to the cosmic secrets of space and time in the Xanthuun Tablets and the crystalline record of a blood-soaked serpent cult in the Sarkulis Shards. With 16 brand-new spells and a bounty of unique magical mysteries, there is knowledge here, and power, but the deeper you delve the greater the cost, but is any price too great to claim the power of the ancients? Grab this 16-page PDF today, if you dare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
