							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic of the Mire: Lizardfolk Spells</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover the Magic of the Swamplands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many different approaches to magic, and different groups are able to master it in different ways, creating strange and exotic spells that others would never dream of. The lizardfolk of the swamps are no different in this regard, and their strange magic, which is a mix of primitive naturalistic mysticism, and dark unspeakable ritual, provides a number of potent spells for those who have a chance to learn them. While such secrets are rarely shared with outsiders, and the lizardfolk who use them almost never write them down, a number of these lost spells of the swamp have been collected in this tome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains 11 new spells for the druid, sorcerer/wizard, and witch spell lists, all of which are thematically linked to lizardfolk and their swampy homes. The black rain spell allows you to bring misery and misfortune to a large stretch of land by cursing it with foul, black rain, while the mud serpent spell conjures a snake made of living earth to rise up and attack your foes. Use poison plants to create a tangled mass of thorny, poisonous vines, which entraps your foes and injects them with a deadly toxin. Or, call upon sweltering heat to empower cold-blooded creatures, while rendering the warm-bloods uncomfortable and weakened. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking for unique and exciting spells for your swamp-dwelling or reptilian NPCs, or just want to expand your wizard&amp;rsquo;s ever-growing spellbook, the magic of the mire is not to be overlooked!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
