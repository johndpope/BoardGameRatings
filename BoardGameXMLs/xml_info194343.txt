							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Northlands Saga Complete (Swords &amp; Wizardry)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliver us, O Lord, from the fury of the Northmen . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wyrd is fate, and fate is inexorable beneath the leaden winter skies of the Northlands. Where raging storms, some sent by malevolent spirits of the Ginnungagap, howl from the Far North and bury steadings and towns alike under several feet of snow while unnamed things of tooth and shadow hunt those who dare to emerge and brave the cold. Where the blood of fighting men and women sings in harmony with the death cries of the spear-din and the clash of wood and steel when the shield walls meet. Where enchantments older than the race of Men linger in barrow fields and primeval forests waiting to ensnare the unwary or the foolish. This is the realm of the Norns where they measure and cut the threads of a man&amp;rsquo;s wyrd. This is the Northlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Howl From The North&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Northlands Saga Complete picks up where the Northlands Saga series of adventures released in 2010 and 2011 left off. Created by fan favorite author Kenneth Spencer, these four adventures first introduced Frog God Games fans to the barbaric Northlands, the stalwart folk who dwell there, and the perils, from savage beast and demon alike, that they face. Now The Northlands Saga Complete updates and expands those original adventures with new material and completes the saga with six more new adventures that follow directly after, so GMs can resume campaigns that were left off after the last adventure was released in 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, an eleventh new adventure was added as a prequel to the original four to complete an entire adventure path to take PCs from level 1 to 20. You can play any or all of the eleven adventures as standalone sessions, or you can use them as a single continuous campaign to explore the Northlands and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of the Lost Lands campaign world, The Northlands Saga Complete incudes a full-color poster map as well as a complete campaign guide detailing the cultures, history, races, nations, languages, geography, and new monsters, magic, and equipment unique to those lands. There is also a chapter dedicated to new optional rules that you can use in your game to capture the authentic spirit of the Northlands with rules for things like a character&amp;rsquo;s wyrd, death speeches, becoming a jarl, the examples of early representative politics in the Things and Althing, and trial by combat in the holmgang. In addition there are a multitude of new archetypes, feats, player-character races, and character traits. When you delve into The Northlands Saga Complete, you step into the Northlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your wyrd by the throat. With The Northlands Saga Complete you can break a shield wall on trampled fields or pull a sweep upon gray icy seas to find new shores to explore or raid. Live the adventure; complete the saga!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
