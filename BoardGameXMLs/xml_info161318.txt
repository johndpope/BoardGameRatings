			<description>A two player game played on 3 standard chess boards arranged vertically one above the other. The &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; squares are transparent to help see what pieces are where.  Each player starts with 16 pieces on each board in almost the same setup as standard chess.&lt;br/&gt; There is only one king and he starts in the normal position on the centre board. Kings, Queens and Bishops move as normal but extended into 3 dimensions. Knights move as normal and stay on the board they started on. Pawns and rooks move as normal but can also move levels. There are five new pieces, Prince (which replaces king on top and bottom boards), Princess, Abbey, Cannon and Galley, each having there own special movement rules.&lt;br/&gt;  The object of the game is to take the king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
