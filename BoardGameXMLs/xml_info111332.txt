			<description>From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome to the 6th Edition Conversion Document for Karamathin: Kingdom of Tursh world setting. The original book was written for the 5th Edition Revised set of Hero System rules and due to time constraints and many obligations, development couldn't be halted while the 6th Edition rules were being developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that the 6th Edition set has been released we felt it was only right that we release this free document so that those of you who are converting over won't have to worry about doing this job yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
