			<description>A collection of four winter sports-themed games, named for the classic Norwegian skiing venue outside Oslo. The ski jumping game involves rolling special dice to determine jump length and style points. The cross-country skiing game as well as the slalom and downhill skiing games, which are very similar to each other, are roll-and-move games. Ski jumping and and cross-country skiing can be played in succession as Nordic combined. The alpine skiing games allow for some customization of the course on a grid using plastic flags, but the resulting track is still one-dimensional, and none of the games involve any decision-making during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of the rules includes the number sequences &amp;quot;111/9/105&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;144&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;0742/1/73&amp;quot;, which may or may not indicate the time of publication and/or a product number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
