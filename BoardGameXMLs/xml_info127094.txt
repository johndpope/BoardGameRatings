							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cricket World Cup</name>
									
			<description>Statistical cricket game. Teams are broadly rated, with dice rolls and charts deciding the outcome of matches. The designer thinks that each game will take around 10 minutes after you have learned the mechanisms of play. Thus, an entire tournament can easily be played in one evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
