							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Official Super Scout Squad Handbook</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1970s - the birth of micro-computing and the early years of genetic research, the rise of nuclear power and satellite transmission. Add a sprinkling of the usual suspects: fluoridation, radio waves, the soundtrack of punk rock, and the combined static electricity of too much nylon clothing. Then the catalyst - a huge meteor strike that lit up the night sky like it was midday, except much, much more neon green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly a whole generation had super-powers. Well, most of the powers were more &amp;quot;stupid&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;super&amp;quot; - immunity to wood, the ability to shatter glass just by looking at it, being able to mind-read badgers, or moving at super-speed but only while crawling. And these powers came at a price: a lethal vulnerability to kittens, crippling vertigo if more than 6&amp;quot; from the ground, or being suddenly unable to pronounce the letter &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it soon became apparent that those affected did now have a pre-disposition to powers and abilities beyond the normal human, and with judicious use of the right digital, genetic and drug enhancements they could be given true super-powers. Faced with thousands of potentially lethal teenagers, the authorities looked for ways to simultaneously enhance and control their abilities; for a way to channel their potential power to be a force for good and law rather than evil and chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus was born the Super Scout Squad or SSS as it is more commonly known. This youth organisation provided a way to marshal the forces of the 'empowered' generation. In return for co-operation, good deeds and civic duty, the SSS offered greatly increased powers. The hope was two-fold: firstly that the youth movement would provide a positive incentive and moral code for the super-powered youth, and secondly that the SSS would provide an army capable of standing up to the swelling ranks of super-villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For not everyone responded to their newfound powers in a positive way. I'm sure you can imagine how many of the hormone-racked teenagers reacted. Some sank into anarchy or depravity, while others saw their powers as a signal that the old establishment should be swept away and the new generation of Homo Superior should rule over their parents and former masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Scout Squad is a tongue-in-cheek, rules-lite roleplaying game of teenage superheroes. Before you begin you'll need to find two decks of playing cards &amp;ndash; one for the GM and one for the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
