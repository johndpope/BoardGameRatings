							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infected: The Twin Vaccine</name>
									
			<description>A new breed of virus has spread throughout the City of Oxford forcing the area to be quarantined and on high alert. The first reported case of the virus was found in 6 year old twin sisters Tiffany &amp;amp; Theresa Morrisey. Tiffany never survived the infection but Theresa made a full recovery and is now believed to be the key to finding a cure. In the chaos of a city-wide evacuation, Theresa goes missing. You must travel back to the abandoned city of Oxford to find her before the virus spreads globally. Be wary however ... you're not the only one back in town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;220+ Scenes to navigate&lt;br/&gt;    HD Widescreen mode: see more action!&lt;br/&gt;    Customizable difficulty: set challenges how you like them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
