			<description>Pro Sport Hockey - known in Japan as USA Ice Hockey in FC (ユーエスエーアイスホッケー イン エフシー?) - is a 1993 multi-platform ice hockey video game that was released for the NES and Super NES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;Each team uses the authentic NHL rosters from the 1992-93 NHL season; including all 24 then-current NHL teams and 288 professional hockey players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the offensive and defensive plays are done as realistic as possible. Instead of dividing teams into conferences and divisions, they are divided into six equal groups - just like in international ice hockey. There are no geographic differences between the teams on each group. This means that a Western Conference team could be in the same group as an Eastern Conference team or vice versa. The game uses teams that are now obsolete in the NHL, like the Minnesota North Stars, the Quebec Nordiques and the Hartford Whalers, for example. Wayne Gretzky even made an appearance in the game along with his legendary peers Doug Gilmour, Patrick Roy, and Mario Lemieux. Although the Winnipeg Jets are used in the game, they are not considered to be the current form of the team (which used to be the Atlanta Thrashers). Instead, they serve as the predecessors to the Phoenix Coyotes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pro Sport Hockey&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
