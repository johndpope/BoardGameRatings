							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Less Than Useful Books to Find on a Steampunk Bookshelf</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;his is a supplement that is intended to flesh out the bookshelves in a steampunk setting. When players find books, some of them may be valuable or useful, but these will not be the only books present in many cases, so what about those that aren't useful or valuable?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 different, low utility and not exactly valuable books that can be used to answer players questions about what books they find. Of course, if the book is described, it may cause players to think it is valuable. Each book has its title, author and a brief overview of the contents provided. There is a selection of both fiction and non-fiction books, on subjects such as steam power, clockwork, analytical engines, airships and exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Scent Your Steam by Mary Thincher - Non-fiction, how to use different additives to boilers to make the steam produced have different scents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one page the front matter and introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
