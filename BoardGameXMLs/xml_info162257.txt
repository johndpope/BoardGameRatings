							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alchemistâ€™s Shop</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, 16 x 10 inch battlemap of an Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s Shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come in, come in. What kind of potion are you seeking today? My new Teslamuter can create any potion your heart desires.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DramaScape dares you to try the potions in our Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s Shop! Will it help, do nothing, or harm the character? Only the Game Master knows!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s Shop is an internal view map of a small shop or small laboratory for alchemical research. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s Shop is intended for use in modern games. Boilers and a machine are displayed in the map therefore electricity is a minimum requirement. The style of the shop would fit a steampunk or teslapunk game easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Teslamuter: An alchemist became quite popular in town by selling potions he created with his Teslamuter. The potions he has created with electricity give a jolt to the people that imbibe them and make them full of energy. But when the potion runs out, the imbiber becomes lethargic until he can get another dose. This made people into addicts of the alchemist&amp;rsquo;s potions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then people started dropping dead of heart attacks. Worse a rash of grave robbing incidents followed targeting the victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters can get involved in several ways. One way is that one of the characters or their allies becomes addicted to the potions. They should have a highly positive effect such as increased speed, better initiative, more actions, etc. but the negative effect should be something like fatigue, or debilitating penalties reverse of the positive effect once the potion runs out. When the imbiber has a heart attack and either dies or is left holding on for dear life, the group goes to the alchemist for either revenge or a cure to the addiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or the player characters can get involved by being investigators into the mysterious glut of heart attack deaths and graveyard robbery perhaps even catching the alchemist in the act of robbing a grave. In this scenario, the alchemist is a bit better prepared and has a surprise for the them; zombies with a replacement heart that pumps his Teslamuter solution to keep the body going. Those who were addicted in life have a greater affinity for the substance in death forcing him to target their bodies specifically rather than just any old corpse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
