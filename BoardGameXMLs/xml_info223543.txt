			<description>Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;R&amp;eacute;galez is an art game with motifs of heart shaped leaves. Grow trees and score by cutting branches. Luck and intuition and intelligence will decide victory and defeat. It is an art to play R&amp;eacute;galez!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players place tiles showing various patterns in six colours, such as hearts or clovers, good or bad fruit. Players make connections and grow the plants, and then score points by cutting off branches. But avoid taking bad fruit, which will lose you points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent is to be artistic and make patterns while scoring points. Try not to interfere with your opponents with dead leaves or flowers. Deciding where to branch out, and which branches to cut needs intuition, intellect and some luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solo and even if you don't know the rules, you can still connect beautiful tiles and play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come on, R&amp;eacute;galez together!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
