			<description>Dreams of Witchtown is a fantasy action role-playing game for Xbox Live Indie Games developed by Dip Slit.  Dreams of Witchtown is a 2D side scrolling action RPG. Players control the elderly witch Aurora, as she embarks on a quest to save her world from the sinister forces trying to destroy it. Players can defeat enemies to increase their level, and save progress. The game is a prequel to Nightmare in Witchtown, which is another initial project thought up by the developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was submitted for peer playtest and then peer review in December 2009. Although playtest is not required it is recommended to help catch hardware and software problems within the game, as well as to receive feedback from other Microsoft Creators Club members. The game officially released to the Xbox Live Marketplace on January 13, 2010 along with a trial-game, allowing players to try the game. The game has been released for 80 points which is approximately $1 on the Xbox Live Marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay in Dream of Witchtown has action, adventure and RPG elements. The combat is real-time and fast paced. Aurora gains additional spells and abilities as the player progresses through the game defeating bosses. When an enemy is defeated they will drop experience bubbles which can be collected to level up. Leveling up gives Aurora additional health and magic. Progress can be saved at many different save locations throughout the game. There are also shops throughout the game where a player can replenish their health and magic potions which are almost essential during the boss fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like most platform games, Dreams of Witchtown is also littered with coins and health items. The coins you collect either floating around on each stage or in barrels can be used in a shop to buy items like health and magic potions. Health items, shown as apples, are used to help regain health and are really useful if you run out of health potions. The game also has multiple save locations that are extremely helpful so that you'll never have to start over if you die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important aspect of Dreams of Witchtown is leveling up. The game can be classed as a &amp;quot;grinder&amp;quot; which will have the player repeatedly attacking enemies and collecting items for the all important reason of levelling up to take on tougher enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dreams of Witchtown&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
