							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paradox: The time travel card game</name>
									
			<description>You are one of the offspring of Doc, simultaneously conceived on one rare night of passion with Mrs Doc.  Your father, a genius and slightly extrovert scientist, has spent his career in the pursuit of time travel.  Finally Doc has made a breakthrough and invented the first generation of time travel devices.  But Doc is becoming an old man, and needs to hand over his legacy before it is, ironically, lost in time.  For decades you and your siblings have been learning the secrets of time travel.  But Doc is fully aware of the catastrophic potential of time travel and can therefore entrust his discoveries to only one of you.  To select who will be his successor, Doc subjects you to the ultimate test, to return to the past in order to change history so that only one of you is born, sentencing you siblings to be the children that time forgot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paradox uses cards to plot the progress of time and describe the events happening in each day. Player markers are used to track the location of players through the various timelines that may arise throughout the game.  Players can change the events occurring in a day, create new timelines, or destroy timelines all together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A selection of time travel devices can be found allowing players to go back to the past, fast forward to the future, or move between timelines all together.  Astute players can use combinations of time travel devices and the correct event cards to go for the surprise win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
