							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Loaded Questions: Political Party</name>
									
			<description>In this latest edition of the Loaded Questions line of games, it&amp;rsquo;s not a matter of how much you know about politics, but how well you know your fellow players. However serious or silly your answers, they are never right or wrong. Players write down answers to quasi-political questions and the judge for that round must try to match the answers to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample Questions: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who would make a terrible First Lady?&amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the US legalized cloning, who would you clone first?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What would you not expect to find in the Oval Office?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
