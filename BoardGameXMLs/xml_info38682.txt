			<description>High Finance is one of six pencil and paper games described in the Sid Sackson book,  Calculate! .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players advance through a series of game spaces and record the impact on their Net Worth according to the type of space they land on.  If the space simply designates one of four industries (Oil, Steel, Auto, and Food), then the player has gained control of one additional company in that industry and this tracked in a designated area of the scoresheet.  Upon landing on a &amp;quot;Profit&amp;quot; space, the player&amp;rsquo;s Net Worth is multiplied by a percentage amount that rises for controlling multiple companies in a specified industry.  Similarly the impact of landing on &amp;quot;Loss&amp;quot; space for an industry will be scaled according to the player&amp;rsquo;s holdings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mathematical operation is performed on the calculator for each player&amp;rsquo;s turn.  Examining the resulting display determines whether the player moves 0 to 3 spaces, although the player sometimes may have more than one choice to select from.  Game ends when all players have exited the sequence of spaces, highest Net Worth wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
