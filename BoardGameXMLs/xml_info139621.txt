			<description>All out video game war with a board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of the 3 video game theaters or earn 16 bits to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Press Start is a 3-6 player game with a co-op expansion to make it a 4-10 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 theaters of video gaming. Each player rolls for the chance to pick where they start. Highest point total on the dice chooses first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player lays their game cartridge and a piece of wire in the theater and on the tile where they want to build. Each player lays down 2 cartridges and 2 lengths of wire to start the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commodities that are associated with the tiles that players touch are gathered. To gain control of a theater or area a player must build up to having 2 working consoles or cabinets. Players upgrade by trading commodities and action cards or by buying a pause cards. Players can by parts or earn them by battling others and taking their items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player must gain control of 3 theaters or gain 16 bits to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each players turn they roll the dice, dice differ depending on what theater they are in. A player can only play in one theater per turn. They may have occupancy in as many theaters as they want, but they must choose which theater to use on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can make as many moves as they like on each turn until they run out of commodities, action, parts or pause cards.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
