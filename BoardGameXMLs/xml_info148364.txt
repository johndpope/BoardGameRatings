			<description>In Keep the Crown, players take turns putting pieces on the board, trying to earn points and claim the crown that's awarded to the point leader at any given moment. They use their five drawn playing pieces to create sets of similar coins or gems on the board, with more difficult combinations earning more points. Special pieces such as the Wizard and the Thief each have their own unique powers to assist in making sets. The board slowly fills up, and when it's full, the player with the crown wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's simple set-collection mechanism appeals to players of all ages, whereas its tile placement and hand management strategies will appeal to more serious gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
