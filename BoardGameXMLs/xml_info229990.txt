			<description>We wanted to create a game that kids could play but had hidden depth that would keep adults engaged.  The result was an an easy-to-learn but surprisingly strategic card game that is a cross between Uno, War, and with some Texas Holdem sprinkled in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing and playing cards to win battles (and cards).  Some special action cards allow players to steal cards, change their character, void other player's cards and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During battle everyone plays one more &amp;quot;reinforcement&amp;quot; card just for themselves except for Holograms who play two. Monsters count claws, Robots count lasers, and holograms count monster, claws, or lasers (whichever has fewer in the middle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add up your totals and the highest number wins. The battle winner takes all the cards in the middle and their reinforcement card and sets them aside. This is their point pile and counts toward winning the game. The battle losers keep their reinforcement card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep playing until someone runs out of cards and whomever has the most cards wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
