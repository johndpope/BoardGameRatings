							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rulers of the Sky</name>
									
			<description>Publishers Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sky ships, flying castles, cloud cities, and airborne monsters: all this and more awaits you in the Aerial Adventure Guides. These stand-alone sourcebooks contain new character options, races, monsters, feats, items, and adventure ideas, plus aerial combat rules and sky ship design guidelines. Best of all, the aerial adventure guides can be integrated into any fantasy campaign - after all, no matter what world sits at ground level, anything can float above.&lt;br/&gt;The series is divided into three volumes. The first covers rules, the second cover settings, and the third covers monsters and items. Each of the three volumes can be used independently, or they can be combined and used together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume One, Rulers of the Sky, covers the basics of aerial adventures. These include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic overview of the sky realms.&lt;br/&gt;Three new races that dwell in the clouds: sky elves, the evil arachial, and the barbaric avians.&lt;br/&gt;Two new prestige classes that are at home in the sky (Air Knight and Sky Elf Battle Captain), as well as guidelines for how the core classes operate in the air.&lt;br/&gt;New feats specific to aerial adventures and the creatures that dwell there.&lt;br/&gt;Expanded rules for aerial combat.&lt;br/&gt;Rules for building and operating sky ships, the flying vessels that are the primary means of aerial transport for wingless creatures.&lt;br/&gt;Eight new monsters specific to the cloud realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
