							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Tomb of Argorathor</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Tomb of Argorathor - a 3.5 OGL fantasy adventure for 8th to 10th Level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argorathor stood surveying the scene of carnage around him. He snorted loudly and deeply, sucking in the smell of death, the whiff of bloody victory. Today, many had died and the people of the South had all but fallen. The name of Argorathor burned brightly indeed, sending fear and terror through the hearts of his enemies, for his infamy was unparalleled and the tales of his terrible deeds were such that his legend would now never diminish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tall tales have long told of the ancient Argorathor and his fantastic and deadly maze. A legend of his time - a minotaur of supreme power and charisma who led those that followed him against the Freecities of the South and who drove his enemies before him - it is said that his labyrinth is filled with gold and riches beyond imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dare face the challenge of The Lost Tomb of Argorathor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a 3.5 OGL fantasy adventure for 8th to 10th level characters &lt;br/&gt;- illustrated by Gillian Pearce&lt;br/&gt;- cartography by Keith Robinson&lt;br/&gt;- 34 pages, including 11 illustrations, 1 fantastic maze packed with memorable encounters, and the unforgetable Fountain of Mixed Fortunes!&lt;br/&gt;- fully bookmarked PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
