			<description>World Masters Golf is a golf simulation video game for the Super NES released exclusively in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The video game features four gouraud shaded courses in order to produce continuous shading of surfaces represented by polygon meshes. Modes of gameplay are: tournament, match play, and practice. There are created golfers and the option for the player to create his own. The game allows golf handicapping. Up to eight players can play. There is a Mode 7 view camera that follows the ball after it is hit.
