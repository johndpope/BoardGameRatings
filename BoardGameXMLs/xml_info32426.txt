							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bunker&#039;s Hill 1775</name>
									
			<description>A simple wargame using counters or miniatures (not supplied) to simulate the battle of Bunker's Hill. Movement and combat are straightforward, with infantry having a short effective firing range, hitting on a roll of 6 on an ordinary die. In melee a simple comparison of combat value is made, with the weaker unit retreating. Artillery units have a long range but limited mobility as you would expect. The American forces have stronger firepower but are weaker in melee, thus the British need to press their attack strongly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game appeared in Practical Wargamer vol 11 no 1 and is described as a framework which could be elaborated upon as required. A plain map (no hexes) and counters (to cut out) are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
