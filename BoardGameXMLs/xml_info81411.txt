			<description>Born in Dorset, Violette Summer grew up in a happy family and had a great and active childhood. Initially, she started her working life in a beauty salon before the outbreak of war inspired her to move to London  and join the weapon industry. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take too long for her to be noticed by the Secret Services; she was after all beautiful, athletic and had great attention to detail. It was only a formality that she was recruited into MI6 during Britain&amp;rsquo;s darkest hours. Violette had lost an aunt during one of the first Luftwaffe bombing attacks and to further compound her heartache she later lost her RAF  husband in battle. However, Summer was strong willed and used these painful experiences to inspire her to succeed as a spy for the SIS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer managed to carry out several missions successfully before being gravely wounded by a German sniper on a mission to kill Kamm, a German military intelligence officer. Comatose in a hospital in France, Violette relives key moments in a series of flashbacks. Hence the bulk of gameplay will take place during these flashbacks. The missions include blowing up a fuel depot on the Maginot Line, assassination of a colonel in a cathedral in Paris, stealing documents and marking a sub pen for bombers in Hamburg during Operation Gomorrah, and finding three secret agents in Warsaw. In the Warsaw sewers, she finds one agent seriously wounded (and silences him) and another dead by cyanide poisoning, but the third agent was captured; moving through the Warsaw Ghetto, where the residents were either rounded up or executed, Violette makes her way through to Pawiak Gestapo prison to give the last agent cyanide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through her memories, scenes from the hospital can be seen with two men arguing whether to keep Violette alive, give her up to the SS, or kill her to save her the torture if captured by the Nazis. Her location betrayed, Violette wakes from her coma to find Nazi soldiers storming the hospital. Escaping the hospital, Violette finds the villagers being murdered or rounded up by the Dirlewanger Brigade, a brutal SS unit of convicts, and taken to the church. Locking the villagers in, the soldiers set fire to the church. Violette is unsuccessful at trying to free the villagers, and due to emotional and physical exhaustion, collapses. The leader of the German unit is shown to be Kamm, whose face was burned by Violette's assassination attempt. In the end credits, Violette is shown in her hospital gown standing on a cliff overlooking a German plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Velvet Assassin&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
