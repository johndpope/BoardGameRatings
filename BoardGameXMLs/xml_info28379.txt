			<description>This is a ship-to-ship combat game that was published as an expansion to the AD&amp;amp;D campaign setting Spelljammer.  The game is set in outer space, but the ships and rules are much like you'd expect in a traditional naval combat game like Wooden Ships &amp;amp; Iron Men.   The added dimension is that ships generally come with mages that can fire off many spells.  Rules are included for ramming, boarding, over 25 types of missile and small arms weapons, and lots of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include rules for ship-to-ship combat, two large hex maps, and over 30 cardboard punch-out ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
