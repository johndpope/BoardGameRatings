			<description>From the instruction sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;BOGYMAN&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A spine tingling board game of strategy and risk for 2-5 players&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;About the Game - The Bogy man has risen from the grave, stalking the town of Homewood by night, and hiding in the shadows of the old abandoned mansion by day. The only way to send the Bogyman back to the grave is to enter the old mansion, find the nine missing pieces to the magic medallion, and assemble it. Four brave town's people have accepted the challenge even though others before them have tried and never returned. Their chances for survival are very small, but that's their problem.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include:&lt;br/&gt;Instruction sheet &lt;br/&gt;Game board&lt;br/&gt;28 cards&lt;br/&gt;Five standard pawns&lt;br/&gt;One six-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
