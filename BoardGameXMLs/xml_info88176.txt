			<description>Contact is a solitaire game, where the player manages and deploys small naval task groups to accomplish random missions that will make up a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two major parts in this game:&lt;br/&gt;- The mission planning/resource management&lt;br/&gt;- The mission execution itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First the player determines what forces he will use depending on ships available and mission limitations.&lt;br/&gt;Then, the player allocates weapons (anti ship and anti sub resources) to the platforms he chose.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the mission itself takes place, where the player deploys the task force in formation (by using a board that mimics a Radar display), and tries to accomplish the mission objectives, that include amongst others:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Sub hunting&lt;br/&gt;- Convoy Escort&lt;br/&gt;- Sea Superiority&lt;br/&gt;- Convoy raid&lt;br/&gt;- Blockade&lt;br/&gt;- Strategic Strikes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each mission will have a variable number of turns to be completed and specific objectives, but the Tactical Cards may change all that! Sometimes Intel fails miserably!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 24 Mission Cards - They will define the mission, the objectives, Victory Points, Standing Orders, Rules of Engagement&lt;br/&gt;- 27 Tactical Cards - Will contain random events that will occur throughout the mission.&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Game Board / Radar Display - Where the action takes place!&lt;br/&gt;- 45 Ship Cards - Contain all the relevant information for each unit.&lt;br/&gt;- 45 Ship Counters - To represent the ship card in the board.&lt;br/&gt;- More than 100 counters representing the weapons used by the friendly forces and OPFOR.&lt;br/&gt;- 64 Opposing Force unit counters, that can be either deployed by mission card or drawn randomly by Tactical cards. These include ships, subs and air raids.&lt;br/&gt;- 36 contact counters - Using NTDS symbols, these will represent the location of the enemy forces (or uknown/neutral ones!), until they are positively identified.&lt;br/&gt;- A few system counters&lt;br/&gt;- 1D10 and 1D6 dice will be needed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a starting point, this game will have one campaign included (Cold War 1985), but others can be easily added later, either by just using the existing components/era settings or by creating new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WEBSITE (under construction): &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.pbshots.biz/contact&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.pbshots.biz/contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
