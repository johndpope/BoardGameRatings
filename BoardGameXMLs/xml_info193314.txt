			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game involves creating a shared narrative by combining story elements provided by all players.  Somewhat atypically, however, this involves various contests and stages that are resolved with dice, tokens, and cards.  The cards are created during the early stages of play (usually from common index cards) and then used in play during the final stages of the game.  The game is thus complex and structured.  Although no game master is used, a &amp;quot;host&amp;quot; role is identified that is something like a game master in minor respects (primarily, in providing setup and some minor in-game functions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most unusual aspect of the game, however, is that all players control a single, shared, character this is developed by all during the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the game has no apparent relationship with the infamous and eponymous historic event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
