							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Osterre: The East Lands</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The east lands better known as Osterre, was a land full of lush forests and grassy plains.  Now parts of it have become a wasteland while other parts have remained the same.  Most of the world as we know it evolved over longer periods of time, the change to Osterre only took months.  How can this be possible you ask?  Well the finger of blame can be pointed directly at the humans.  Osterre is where the humans first landed on Midian.  It is where the meteor crashed and where the red dawn took place.  The meteor took out a large part of the swamps where the firps live and alot of the forests where the ogres and orcks lived.  That was the day the land of Osterre died and came back to life as something new, something much different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
