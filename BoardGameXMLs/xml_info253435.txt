			<description>So Ded is a fast-paced game of survival for 5-24* players (2-4 player rules available), ages 12+, with a 30 minutes playtime&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world has ended by gene slicing bees with humans!! Or maybe it's zombies or something else! On top of that, everyone left alive is out to get you&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With random maps, weapons, armor, supplies and other unique gear, you will collect as much loot as you can while fighting anyone that gets in your way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique Deck Building: You start with a few knives, leather vests, supplies and ability to Hide.  You gain more powerful equipment by visiting locations but you can also get loot from any opponent's deck when you defeat them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game is simple:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone selects (or chooses randomly) a character to play. There is the Truck Driver, Clown, Hoarder, Surgeon, Cat Lover, etc.. each character has their own unique abilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is broken down into 3 PHASES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) MOVE&lt;br/&gt;Move your character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you alone at a location? GREAT! You get to loot anything at your location without issue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) BATTLE/LOOT&lt;br/&gt;Oh, your not alone? Well get ready to fight because everyone else here is going to try to destroy you and take your stuff! You must fight (or hide... or drive away in a jeep, but you need find that first...)&lt;br/&gt; To battle, all players here secretly play 2 cards from their hand (usually 1 weapon and 1 armor)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2a) COMBAT&lt;br/&gt;When everyone is ready, reveal all cards. The player with the lowest total is defeated and, unless they have a First Aid Kit or Bandages, they are out of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest total gets the victory, loots the location PLUS loots the defeated player's deck of cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loot can be anything from Pistols, Rifles, Supplies, Jeeps, Camouflage Suits, Bullet Proof Vests, etc... all to help make your character a lot stronger.  Its good to win a fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) APOCALYPSE/REFRESH&lt;br/&gt;- The apocalypse spreads! The board gets smaller as the  gets larger (gene splicing mutants, zombies, etc..) &lt;br/&gt;- Level Up!: Anyone still alive and with enough supplies can turn them in to level up their character&lt;br/&gt;- Prepare: Add new loot to each location that is left.&lt;br/&gt;- Draw: discard your entire hand and draw 5 new cards. If you don't have enough cards left, shuffle your discard pile into your deck and continue to draw&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BE WARNED: People will be eliminated at a fast pace! Only one will survive. So if you pull out a victory in this game, you should be praised in all of it's glory as it will be rare indeed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
