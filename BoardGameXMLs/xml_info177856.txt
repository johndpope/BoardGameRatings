							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dinosaur Math</name>
									
			<description>Dinosaur Math consists of 1 double-sided game board, 4 dinosaur counters, 2 number dice and 1 operations die. Each side of the game board is a different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dino Tracks: Each player chooses a dinosaur marker and places it on the same colour start space. The youngest player goes first. Both number dice are rolled and the player adds the numbers together and moves that number of spaces on the board. The first player to move their dinosaur to the home space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dino Stomp: Each player chooses a dinosaur marker and places it on the same colour start space, and rolls the two number dice. The highest number goes first. Players roll all 3 dice and use the numbers and operation shown to determine what number of spaces to move. Some spaces have instructions on them. The first player to reach the finish space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
