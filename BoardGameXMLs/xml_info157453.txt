			<description>Storyteller Cards are a playing card deck, designed to inspire creativity in gamers, role-players, writers, artists, teachers, parents and children. They were designed by Jason Tagmire and illustrated by Campbell Whyte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card features an illustration with 4 unique elements. There is a character, holding an item, completing an action, in a location. Each of these elements can be used to create something new, get you out of a mid-project slump, or just to have some creative fun with family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards also feature additional icons in the corners to help you dig a little deeper into storytelling, creating, and gaming. The icons represent a rank, suit, mood, season, letter, and color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Storyteller Manual includes rules for 16 different ways to play. From strategic coloring to push-your-luck storytelling, there are game variations for everyone. Many variants are story based gaining points for each card played, best poker hands and matching card elements, but others include strategic coloring (where players must complete illustration quadrants to earn points), and endless possibilities (where the players create and change the rules in a race to 30 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
