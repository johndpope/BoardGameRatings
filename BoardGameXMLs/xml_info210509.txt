			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powers Beyond: an intensely superhuman struggle against the forces of evil that you become a part of! This is a super-powered roleplaying game for the cinematic comicbook fan. With only 3 stats to worry about, you can have your character up and fighting in no time! The 10 different Origins from which your heroes derive are diverse in their outlooks and special abilities. Get trained in nearly two dozen skills and be infused with numerous superpowers. There are an infinite number of devices and vehicles you can equip your heroes with, some alien, some dimensional, some magical. The combat system is dynamic and true to comic book form, allowing for multiple actions in a turn with a variety of special maneuvers. There are 8 power categories, over 100 base powers and more than 500 variations on those powers. No two heroes, villains, henchmen or sidekicks will ever be the same! So whether you plan on combating evil as a genetically engineered power-being or wreaking havoc as a berserk cyborg, you're in for a fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
