							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Song of Fodin</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover the Legacy of Ather Fodin! When a freak storm leaves the PCs stranded on the isle of Mjorin, their first priority becomes surviving long enough to get off the frozen wasteland. But Mjorin is also home to a mysterious legacy, the Regalia of Fodin, a set of artifacts which once belonged to that legendary figure. Will the PCs recover the artifacts in order to bring peace to the community of orcs who still revere Fodin as a prophet, or will they hand them over to treasure-hunters in exchange for passage home? Perhaps they'll keep the relics themselves. Before they can, though, they'll have to get their hands on them: no easy task, as the relics are protected by a series of trials designed to test the PCs' wit and cunning as well as their strength of arms and purity of spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
