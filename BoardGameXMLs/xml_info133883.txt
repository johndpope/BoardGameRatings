							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arth Parthian</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is Arth. The year is 242 B.C. The Parni, a nomad tribe from the Central-Asian steppe, have been battling the Seluecians for three years to claim Parthia. Parthia covers mostly Iran and parts of northern Iraq. Now a great Parni leader, Tiridates, has arisen and intends to destroy the Seluecians once and for all. However, before he can send his army to Babylonia he must first secure an alliance with the leaders of the now decaying Achaemenid Empire. His former party of diplomats was slaughtered by Seluecian patrols and now Tiridates intends to send a new party including diplomats and guards. This group must cross Persia into Turkey where they will find the Achaemenid king, ArsesII. It is said that the way is frought with danger. From Seluecian patrols to mythical beasts. This party has become known as Menzil Haris (Home Guard). Will you be able to help secure Parni superiority?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
