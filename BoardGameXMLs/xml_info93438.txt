							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MLB 07: The Show</name>
									
			<description>MLB 07: The Show, produced by SCE San Diego Studio, is a baseball video game for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 and PSP. It is the only first-party MLB-licensed video game for the 2007 season, and the only baseball game available for the PlayStation systems aside from Major League Baseball 2K7. For this reason, it is likely to draw attention to the brand and franchise, while the top selling baseball video game developers of previous seasons, notably EA Sports, are forced to devise creative alternatives. The PlayStation 2 and the PSP versions of this game were released on February 27, 2007 while the PlayStation 3 version was released on May 15, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New York Mets 2007 All-Star third baseman David Wright is featured on the cover. The three-man team of announcers once again include Rex Hudler, Matt Vasgersian and Dave Campbell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;MLB 07: The Show&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
