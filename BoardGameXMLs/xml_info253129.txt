			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you've agreed to run a game today and you have not had time to even think about an adventure. Don't freak out. We have you covered. This document is all that you need. Run this adventure. It will be over in one session. Then you can get back to your own evil machinations next session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standing somewhat isolated on the High Plains is a small town that was founded by a group of Irish immigrants. Over time, people from other ethnic groups have settled in Kilflor. This troubles some of the original founders, who want to keep the town a haven for the Irish coming to America. Today only a minority of the citizens care about their original ancestry. As a result, the Irish purists have grown alarmed and desperate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make matters worse, Kilflor now lives under a curse. No children have been successfully born to the residents for well over five years. Pregnancies terminate or babies are stillborn. Those with superstitious leanings blame the curse on a dead school marm. The teacher was driven to suicide when her class died during a Cholera epidemic.  Given that she was of English ancestry, many believe the harassment that the school marm received from the Irish purists drove her to take her own life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this adventure is set in the Boot Hell campaign setting, it can easily be used in any sort of Western steampunk or horror roleplaying game. It uses 5th Edition SRD rules as a default.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
