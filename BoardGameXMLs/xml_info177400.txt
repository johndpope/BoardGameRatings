							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wildkin Beastmaster</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wildkin Beastmaster is a class playbook for Dungeon World that specializes in leading a pack of animal companions. You'll create and start with a couple of packmates, but the rest you'll have to find. Hey, see that three ton dire bear eating the bard? A new packmate, perhaps! You'll just need to convince it to join...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your packmates look to you, how do you lead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packmates come in every shape and size, so choose wisely. A ferocious Bite will prove lethal to your enemies, but Instinct is what will keep your packmates alive. And don't underestimate a beast with Guile, their tricks will surprise you every time. A good packleader knows what each of their packmates Love above all else, as well as any Quirk they might have. Perhaps think carefully before taking Leuk, the impulsive lynx who loves chicken, into that farming village up ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
