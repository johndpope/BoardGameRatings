			<description>Who will manage to create the most successful zoo? To do so, you need to know how to choose and feed your animals by collecting points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to either take two &amp;quot;food&amp;quot; cards or take one &amp;quot;animal&amp;quot; card. However, to take one &amp;quot;animal&amp;quot; card you need to have the necessary number of &amp;quot;food&amp;quot; cards corresponding to that animal's diet. You then discard those cards during your turn. If you win an &amp;quot;animal&amp;quot; card, you place it in your zoo, in front of you. Once you have finished your turn, replace the card you took with another one from the &amp;quot;animal&amp;quot; draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win by being the player with the most stars on your cards at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can win bonuses for having a range of different animals in their zoo, or having themed zoos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
