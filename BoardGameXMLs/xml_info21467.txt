							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happy Landing</name>
									
			<description>Each player is given four wooden chips (or airplanes) of a color and one wooden shooter (or propeller).  'Airplanes' are placed onto the 'propeller' and are catapulted onto the gameboard by tapping the far side of the 'propeller'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a box insert depicting various features surrounding a landing strip, each labeled with either positive or negative points.  In the center of the board is a cup, which is the highest scoring feature and true target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excerpted from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the principle of an airplane trying to land safely without &amp;quot;cracking up.&amp;quot; This is called a Happy Landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
