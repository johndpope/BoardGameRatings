			<description>Jump Sturdy is a game originally designed by MindSports. The game is played on an 8&amp;times;8 board with corners removed. Each player starts with twelve pieces positioned in the center six columns of their two home rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the game, pieces can form stacks of two pieces. The player who owns the top piece in the stack owns that stack. Single pieces can move one space sideways or forward. They capture one space forward diagonally. Stacks of two pieces move and capture with the four forward moves of a chess knight. Only the top piece in the stack executes the movement or capture; the bottom piece does not move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can complete a movement onto either an empty space or a single friendly piece. A capture can be executed onto any enemy piece or stack. In both cases, capture occurs by replacement; the enemy piece is removed and the friendly piece is put in its place. In the case of a stack, only the top piece is replaced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who reaches the opponent&amp;rsquo;s home row first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
