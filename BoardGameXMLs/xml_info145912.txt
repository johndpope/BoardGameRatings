			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first Adventure Arc series in Terah for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game takes adventurers through time to see first hand some of the historic events that have shaped the world around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of years ago, the now forgotten dwarven emperor, Krag I, set in motion events that would have a profound effect on Terah. The ripples caused by his reign are still felt today through the rift that divides the two continents and the great artifact, Tovak Brukke. The Pebble in the Pond Adventure Arc takes a band of adventurers and sets on them a path that will take them not only thousands of miles, but also thousands of years into the past, trying to unwind the series of events that started in motion the division of a continent and yet might lead to the destruction of a world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Within Wheels,&amp;rdquo; Rossi Publishing Games's first adventure arc module by Justin P. Sluder, takes a party of four to six first level adventurers to a small town that they believe has a little problem they can easily solve. But the cause of this small problem is much more than they anticipated. Thinking they were heading to some chaotic caves, they&amp;rsquo;re surprised to find what could be the most powerful artifact in Terah and the insane immortal that&amp;rsquo;s made himself its caretaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Terah you can be just about anything you can imagine: who will you be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
