			<description>from Trailer:&lt;br/&gt;Some bonds can't be broken. Forged in mud, under enemy fire, the heart pounding, home just a memory, sharing misery and the frenzy of combat - bonds forged by spilt blood, and stronger than blood. You were a unit of soldiers in Afghanistan then a unit of mercenaries in Central America. You fought men, and the dark creatures that control them. After a decade, with money in the bank, the unit disbanded - each of you trying to go home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe once you've seen behind the curtain, you can never go home. It's only been a few weeks when the Lt sends you a message, simply &amp;quot;Help&amp;quot;. On greyhounds and amtrak, you're rolling into town to do whatever it takes to defeat whoever, or whatever, has him up against the wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is one of investigation, discovery and drama, and would best suit players looking for a hard hitting, plot driven, game session (i.e. more SVU/Criminal Intent than Action/Adventure). Please note that this plot includes some adult themes, although the depth to which these are explored will be left up to the players to decide during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Part 1: Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is entirely self-contained, although a copy of Night's Black Agents is needed to play. The game is a demonstration game taking one session of between 3 and 4 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
