			<description>One player is selected to &amp;quot;sit out&amp;quot; and direct the other players in their search.  This player hides a spring-loaded bone under one of the item squares on the board. Each of these squares has a small 'keyhole'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active players search for the bone using their dog pieces.  Clues are given by the person who hid the bone throughout the game.  When a player thinks they know which item the bone is hidden beneath they can opt to use the key and open the compartment.  If they have guessed  correctly the bone springs out and that person wins the game; if they are incorrect they must take no further part in that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
