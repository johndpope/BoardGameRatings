							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">France Quiz</name>
									
			<description>In France Quiz you have 400 cards with 2400 questions from six categories : Miscellaneous, History, Sport, Culture, Nature and Geography. Most questions concern Latvia. Collect a token from each category to win. The players roll a die to move and then they must answer a question from the category they land on. If they answer correctly they get a token and when they've gathered tokens in every colour, they can head to the capital (center). First they need to get to a corner of the board where they answer a question of their own choosing. Then there are two coloured spaces from the corner to the center. When the players get to the center they answer a question of the other player(s) choosing. A correct answer in the center means victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
