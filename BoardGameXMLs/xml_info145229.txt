							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Agrik: Red Shadows of Herpa</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of the Red Shadows of Herpa is a religious fighting order devoted to Agrik, the dark god of war and violence. Righteous war and devotion to Agrik's demonic servants, the V'hir, are the hallmarks of the order, which traces its lineage to the bodyguards of the astrologer-priests of the Corani imperial court. Today they are politically powerful through the sponsorship of the clerics of the Order of Herpa the Mace and rich from the mineral wealth of their lands at Menekai. To most peasants, they personify all that is to be feared in Agrikans: easy rage and domination of the weak. To certain factions of Rethem's nobility, they represent the virtues of an Agrikan knight: fearlessness, dogged pursuit of victory, loyalty to those who earn it, and a firm belief that might is granted to those who deserve and use it. Although called to holy war against the Kubora of Peran, they also seek to avenge a recent betrayal that stains their honor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article describes the order's history, current situation, and major chapter houses, as well as the fighting tactics and skills they use and the ritual branding they practice. It also includes information on developing PCs through the ranks of the order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
