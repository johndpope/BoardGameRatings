							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Statue Garden of Shiel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life extension? Keepsake Boxes? You figure it out. Bigger on the inside than the outside, keepsake boxes can hold lots and lots. Sort of like a human mind that holds so much inside a tiny space. Maybe use a keepsake box to preserve knowledge? Maybe to preserve life? Hmm&amp;hellip; The civilization of Shiel, ancient now and gone - who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to unlock its secrets? If only the Library of Shiel could be found. If only, if only&amp;hellip; Investigate the Statue Garden here in #69 for some clues to all that. Feel the power of Madrillian, angel entity and nemesis of evil. And take Helga with you. Yes, just a child, so hold her hand. She will open many doors for you. And remember - a six is a nine turned upside down, so it&amp;rsquo;s a puzzle. It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderment. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
