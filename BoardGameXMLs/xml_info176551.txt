			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Every Item Touched by Victory!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can call her Phane Wonderra... she represents an ancient race that pursues the practice of Victory, and if you've got the cash, she'll give you access to the vault of their star fortress.  They've compiled quite a stock of items with one thing in common; they've all proved their value in battle by being on the winner's side.  Every item has been literally touched by Victory!  Each installment of Victory's Vaults includes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A fine selection of weapons of the Era&lt;br/&gt;    A unique item of armor&lt;br/&gt;    A vehicle the suit the needs of hero and/or villain&lt;br/&gt;    A &amp;quot;white elephant,&amp;quot; such as a new animal, a playable Package, some new Special Abilities, or a place to explore and perhaps purchase!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes some notes on how Phae Wonderra pitches these fine items, and the potential benefits (or consequences!) of haggling.  Want more stuff? You can't do much better than to look in Victory's Vault!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
