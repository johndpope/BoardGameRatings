			<description>Faced with overwhelming global issues the governments of the world are appealing to the general public for out-of-the-box solutions that can save us all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have super-high intelligence and an absurdly creative mind? No? It doesn't matter, it's still up to you to save the world. In this fun and fast-paced game players try to come up with out-of-the-box solutions to global issues and convince the government investors to invest in their ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And who knows, you might even come up with a really good idea that actually solves a problem. It's worth shot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
