			<description>A colour recognition and memory game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components: 25 cardboard tiles, 4 wooden pawns, 1 colour die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into two parts. In the first part, players create the path towards the bee hive by throwing the die and adding a tile with a flower in the matching colour. Once all the tiles have been added, the second part of the game starts. Players now try to get their wooden bee pawn back to the bee hive. The die now dictates which flower is to be visited next. The active player has to memorise the colour sequence up to that particular flower and has to name it with closed eyes. They get to move their pawn up to the last correctly remembered flower. The player whose bee reaches the hive first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
