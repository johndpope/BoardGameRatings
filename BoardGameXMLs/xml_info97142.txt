They have come to wage war not only against the British but the whole of the Earth. Will the great Ironclad airship &amp;lsquo;Thunderchild&amp;rsquo; prove a match for the Martian war machines? Can the powerful magic of the Guild protect humanity from the deadly science of an alien race? What part will your characters play in the coming battle? Will they stand against the onslaught or cower against the might of another world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War of the Worlds is the first in the &amp;lsquo;Victoriana Shattered&amp;rsquo; line. This series details new alternate worlds for Victoriana, or campaigns of such import that they will change the world of Victoriana forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book lies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Full detail on the Martian invaders, their powers, abilities and their devastating technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A campaign in four parts that allows your characters to stand against the assault and perhaps even save the Earth itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Several adventure seeds to help the Gamemaster expand the campaign and focus on different aspects of the conflict. It also includes several different options for ending the campaign, some that even Wells would not have foreseen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Detail on the Earth in the aftermath of the war, a new setting for a broken Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
