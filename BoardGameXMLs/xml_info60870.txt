			<description>&amp;quot;Sch&amp;auml;tze des Dunklen Turmes&amp;quot; is a roll and move fantasy adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls dice and moves his character through the maze-like corridors of the dark tower. After the movement, the player has either reached a special field of the board or gets to draw a random encounter card. This may be an item to pick up or an enemy that must be overcome. At the special fields, keys may be collected or allied spirits recruited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved with a special die, which is rolled alternately by the player and by the enemy. Depending on the roll of this die, the rolling party may regain health, inflict damage or invoke special powers. These powers allow to deal more damage, regain health, collect treasure after victory etc. Each player and each enemy has three such powers, and the die roll determines which is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players collect rewards like gems and tokens that increase their fighting power. They may also increase their power by recruiting an allied spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to collect four keys and open the treasure vault. To collect a key, a coin must be tossed when a key field of the board is reached. The coin is made of cardboard and shows either YES or NO. If the NO side comes up, the action fails and no key is found. The same mechanic is used to check if the treasure vault can be opened once it is reached with four keys - if this fails, four new keys must be collected to retry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To hinder the success of the other players, mines can be used. These represent small traps of different type. If a player walks across such a mine - represented by a small cardboard chit - the mine may e.g. destroy equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are in English, German and Russian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
