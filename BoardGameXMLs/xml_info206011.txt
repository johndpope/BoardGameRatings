			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term worldbuilding gets thrown around a lot by both writers and roleplayers. It&amp;rsquo;s most frequently used in reference to the construction of a fantasy realm or an entire fictional universe. There are maps, and histories, and complex back stories, and all sorts of engaging little details. While these worlds are allegedly being created as the grand stage for a work of fiction, which includes novels, films, television shows, and games, worldbuilding is often an end unto itself. It&amp;rsquo;s an intellectual exercise, a creative outlet, and just a whole lot of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a book about worldbuilding. This is a book about telling stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What I mean to say is, this book isn&amp;rsquo;t about worldbuilding for its own sake. You&amp;rsquo;re not going to learn how to create an encyclopedia for an alternate universe. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to show you have to write the ultimate travel guide for an imaginary place. It&amp;rsquo;s not a book full of checklists and random tables. This is about assembling the critical details that you will need in order to tell a story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
