			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Glory - or a fate worse than death - in the World of Greyhawk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dreadful jails below the appalling City of Skulls, Iuz's nightmare capital, contain many wretched and desperate captives. Among them is Earl Holmer, Knight Commander of the Shield Lands. A brave spy in Dorakaa has shown the way to find and free Holmer - is your party up to the job of freeing him? King Belvor IV of Furyondy believes so. In the way stand fearsome priests and mages of the Lord of Pain; ogres, giants, fiends, and worse hinder the struggle to defeat traps and guardians of Iuz. Plucking Holmer from his grasp will bring great renown, knighthood, and treasure - for those who survive. None has ever escaped Iuz's jails. Who will you be the first to use stealth or storm to breach them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of Skulls presents adventure with a mighty challenge, full of dangers writ large and also unseen (until they strike). This adventure is suitable for 6-8 characters of levels 9-12, and includes pregenerated characters suitable for the quest, player handouts, a unique Notoriety system enabling the DM to draw forth Iuz's most fearsome guardians, a multi-level dungeon-jail, and much more besides. Now is the time for true heroes - is your party skillful enough to survive and return in triumph?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
