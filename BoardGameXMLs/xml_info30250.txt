			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you know the World? Learning about the world is fun with Brain Quest World Game. Have fun and test your smarts answering questions about the people, geography and history of the world. Players race around the world answering questions about different cities, countries and continents. Children can reference the map (game board) for clues to answer many of their questions. With questions designed by grade level, children from 3rd grade - 7th grade can all play this game together on a level playing field. When they answer a question correctly, they'll earn a token for that continent. The first player to collect a token for each of the seven continents wins the game. Comes with 660 Questions, Map Game Board, Continent Tokens, 4 Pawns, Spinner Card and Game Instructions. For 2 or more players, Ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
