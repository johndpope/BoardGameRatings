			<description>Deal out the cards which each player stacks in a face down pile in front of them. Everyone reveals the top card. The highest card played wins the 'trick' and places the cards won on the bottom of their pile face-down. Play continues like this. If you run out of cards, you are out of the game. The last player still with cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card game for children totally devoid of skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
