							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pick -a- Penguin</name>
									
			<description>Each player chooses to be one of four colored penguins at the South Pole: Yellow, Green, Red or Blue. There are four penguins of each color. All sixteen penguins start out in the center of a rotating iceberg, all mixed up. The penguins are trying to get back to their home igloo. On a player's turn, he rolls the large picture/number die, which will indicate how many penguins may be picked from the iceberg. The player then keeps all of his or her color penguins and returns the other penguins to the iceberg. The player may also roll the die to indicate that the iceberg should be rotated, thus mixing up the memorized order. The first player to bring all of his penguins back home is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
