			<description>In The Big Picture Game, players separate into groups and try to communicate to their partners through drawings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The groups take turns to play, each sending a representative to take a puzzle and draw it on the provided board.  Each drawer is supposed to convey three words and a phrase through sketches; the only textual clue to everyone is a word that conveys the central theme of the sketched items.  Points are awarded to the drawer's group for their correct answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a number of rounds have been played, the scores are tallied and the group with the highest score is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
