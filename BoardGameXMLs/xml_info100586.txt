			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the Guild Wars fantasy world of Tyria, 250 years after the players defeated the Great Destroyer in the &amp;quot;Eye of the North&amp;quot; expansion. Five elder dragons sleeping beneath the continent have awoken, causing widespread destruction to Tyria and corrupting its inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guild Wars 2 brings the storytelling of RPGs into the MMO realm, and has a story filled with choices that allow you to play through the game many times and see different story lines and twists every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Quests&amp;quot; as you know them are gone, and instead there are &amp;quot;events&amp;quot;. These events happens in real-time in the game, and you can join up as they happen. Depending on the outcome, the world will change accordingly, and a new event will be triggered from that.&lt;br/&gt;Any person you meet in Tyria is a potential ally, as you no longer need to join a group with someone to play with them. You will also receive the same rewards, when you play several people together, as you would, if you were playing all alone. So... -  no one can steal kills, or loot from you anymore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
