			<description>This version featured teams that originated from cities that had NFL teams at the time (such as Seattle and Phoenix) but not the colors or the nicknames. Graphics were toned down as they were for many arcade games ported to the system. The human players could only select 5 basic plays: Long Pass, Short Pass, QB Sneak, Backs (a hand-off) or Punt/Field Goal (Field Goals could only be attempted if the line of scrimmage was within the 15 yard line). Field Goals would always go through the uprights unless blocked by the opposing team. Despite the NFL not adopting this rule until the 1994 season, A player could attempt a 2-point conversion if so desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Touch Down Fever,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
