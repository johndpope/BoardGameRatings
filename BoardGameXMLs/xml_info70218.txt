			<description>Zoo Cards - &amp;quot;A tail for a head&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a deck of 48 cards, each representing a quarter of an animal - head, front legs, back legs, or tail; the cards form 12 complete animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are included for two games: Zoo Quartet, a version of [item:21389]; and A Head for a Tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Head for a Tail is similar to Zoo Quartet, except that each player in turn offers to exchange one of his cards for one held by another player; the animal is not named, but the body parts offered and requested are, and the offer is made in general, not to any specific opponent. For example, &amp;quot;A tail for front legs!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Back legs for a head!&amp;quot; or the titular &amp;quot;A tail for a head!&amp;quot; The exchange is made with the first player to accept the offer. Play then passes to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players assemble a full set (one animal), called a &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; in this game, they lay it in front of them. The winner is the first person to assemble a given number of tricks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Three players: 4 tricks&lt;br/&gt;     Four players: 3 tricks&lt;br/&gt;     Five players: 3 tricks (utilizing 3 spare cards in a kitty)&lt;br/&gt;     Six players: 2 tricks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
