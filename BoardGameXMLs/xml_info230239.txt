							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marvel Civil War Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A miniatures and card game style war game played on an 8 x 8 board representing a fight between Superhero teams of the Marvel Universe. One team plays Team IRON (Iron Man, Iron Patriot, Black Widow, Spiderman, Vision and Black Panther); the other Team CAP (Captain America, Bucky, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and Ant Man). Heroes start on the player&amp;rsquo;s back row of the board. Team IRON goes first&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A regular 52 card playing deck is used as an action deck.  Each Hero has his own action table which describes 10 numbered actions that Hero can take &amp;ndash; these correspond to the 1 (ace) &amp;ndash; 10 cards in the deck.  Action are of 4 types: Attack, Defence, Movement or Special.  A King card can be used to have a friendly Hero attack an adjacent enemy Hero. A Queen card can be used to move a friendly Hero 1 or 2 spaces. Black Jack cards can be used for Witty Repartee: A Friendly Hero and an enemy Hero within 2 spaces of each other may neither move nor attack the rest of this turn. Red Jack cards can be used to Taunt:  A Friendly Hero causes an enemy Hero within 2 spaces to want to attack him or her. That Hero can attack no other Heroes the rest of this or next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, each player fills their hand to 6 cards. Players then take turns playing 1 card at a time to cause their heroes to: Move, Attack, and Defend. Attack values indicate the range of the attack emanating from that Hero. Movement values indicate how far the Hero will move. A Defence Action will negate an attack just made by an enemy Hero against this hero. Played cards are discarded. &lt;br/&gt;If a player has no cards left, or nothing he wants to do, he may pass. A player who passes may play no other cards this turn except Defence cards. When both players have passed the turn ends. &lt;br/&gt;Heroes may not end their turns in the same space as another hero however, they may move or attack through (past) other Heroes.  &lt;br/&gt; Each hero has 5 Hit Points (HP). Every time a hero gets attacked and does not defend, it loses 1 HP. If a Hero is reduced to zero HP that Hero is knocked out and removed from play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of turn 12 if both Cap and Bucky are still in play, team CAP wins, otherwise team IRON Wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
