			<description>The game starts with the protagonist entering the bustling town of Luo Yang, looking for the giant statue of the hero who defeated the &amp;quot;Ten Strongest Men&amp;quot; a hundred years ago. The protagonist meets with Guyue Xuan, who quickly befriends him. However, the hero soon becomes a victim in a power struggle of the Xiaoyao Valley, where Guyue Xuan studies martial arts. Later on, the hero gets accepted to be a student of the Xiaoyao Valley, and study various skills to explore the vast land of China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wulin Qunxia Zhuan is a sequel to the Chinese made role-playing game Jinyong Qunxia Zhuan. Set in Ming Dynasty of feudal China, the game features a blend of traditional RPG with strategy and simulation elements.
