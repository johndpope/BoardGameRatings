			<description>The Big Crash: New Rules is a fan-created expansion for Stockpile. This expansion replaces the original rules with new rules. It will change the game by adding more strategy and tactics but keeping it's short play time and feeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fan expansion uses all of the components of the base game and it's also possible to use the Stockpile: Continuing Corruption expansion. Only print the new rules and you are ready for a fresh new game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player is an owner of a big investment company. Starting with a low startup capital they try to spend their money as efficiently as possible. Invest more into your company to get market advantages, or save your money to invest in more/better shares. The big amount of shares their investment companies buy and sell causes fluctuations in the stock market. And be aware! When players start to dump their shares it could cause The Big Crash! Which player will handle the market the best and will earn the most money?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's now possible to buy any stock you want (up to 3 per round) and sell any stock you want, so you will have more control. The bidding system is still present, but this time you will bid for turn order. Also the market shifts on the amount of stocks sold or brought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
