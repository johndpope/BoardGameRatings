							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marco&#039;s Polos</name>
									
			<description>It's a race to pack all of Marco's Polos!  Place the three trunk cards in the center of the playing area and divide the deck of polo shirts evenly.  Someone yells &amp;quot;go!&amp;quot; and the race begins.  To place a card in one of the trunks, the polo must have a similar color stripe to the one currently on the top of the trunk.  If a blue and white polo is on the top, any polo with a blue or white stripe can be placed on that stack.  The deck contains cards to lock trunks and unlock trunks, keeping players on their toes.  First player to get rid of all of their polos wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
