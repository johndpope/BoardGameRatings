			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a campaign module which includes all the resources needed to run your very own nuclear wasteland sandbox adventures. Part One consists of three major settlements in the Wild Waste region, and one major event location, all fully detailed and mapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what's a sandbox without adventure? A variety of random tables have also been included to make sure the mission board stays full, and there's always rewards to be had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several locations are fully mapped, and the notable characters are described in detail. A breakdown of amenities available has been included for each location, as well as an appropriate bounty or encounter table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed as a 14-page PDF, three JPG map files, and two PNG map files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
