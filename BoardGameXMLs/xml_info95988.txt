			<description>From The Front Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for adventure? Don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start? Here&amp;rsquo;s an easy method. Flip through the booklet and pick a location at random. This is where the adventure begins, in the middle of the action. Look over the description of the location and its occupants, and consider the nature of the adventurers. Perhaps the NPCs seek to employ the adventurers &amp;mdash; they need a treasure recovered, or an enemy silenced. Maybe the adventurers seek goods or information at the establishment. If you are still stumped, pick another establishment at random, and develop a connection between the two and the adventurers. Perhaps the Grocer (#48) has a cart of odd goods to deliver to the Bazaar (#20), and wants to hire guards&amp;hellip; why? What is he really delivering that needs such protection? Or maybe the adventurers start out at the Town Jail (#55) &amp;mdash; are they prisoners, visitors, guards, or perhaps they are bounty hunters? You decide. If the adventurers start in the Slave Market, they could be slaves being auctioned off, or passers&amp;ndash;by who see a friend or ally being sold. The possibilities are endless; just pick a location and go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Town of Tell Qa is designed to be used with the upcoming Valley of the Dead Queens Sandbox Module Series, as well as the forthcoming Environs of Tell Qa Wilderness Series. The whole can be combined into a massive campaign that provides countless hours of adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;This booklet differs from the Imperial Town of Tell Qa PDF in that it does not have the 20 encounters included in the PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
