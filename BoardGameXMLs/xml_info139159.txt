							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Meerkat Slammers</name>
									
			<description>In the madcap and chaotic card game Meerkat Slammers, the meerkat tribe has lost its leader and descended into anarchy as each competing faction is determined to prove it's the best! Not all meerkats fight fair, though, and players can employ a number of dirty tricks in order to get one up on his rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player is dealt 15 cards in five piles, one card in the first pile, two in the second, and so on. Turn the top card of each pile face up, then place the rest of the deck face down in the middle of the playing area. Someone flips over the topmost card of the deck to create the discard pile, then the chaos begins. Every meerkat clan card features a fighting score. You may place any of your face-up cards on the discard pile so long as its fighting score is one below or one above the number of the topmost card on the discard pile. Once you play a card, you can turn over the topmost card of the pile from which it came. In addition, you can always have five individual piles, so if one pile empties, move any face-up card from an existing pile to create a new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Event cards can be played at any time. Slam them down next to the discard pile and shout the name of the card. Play stops so that the event instructions can be carried out, after which a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to get rid of all your cards. This alone, however, is not enough to claim victory as many potential clan leaders have come undone at the last moment. As soon as a player is rid of his last card, any player may slam his palm down on the discard pile to claim the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
