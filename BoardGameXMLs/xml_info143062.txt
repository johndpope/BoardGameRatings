			<description>From the far reaches of our galaxy, an alien race has come to Planet Earth with the intent to wipe out the entire human race. As cities crumble and fall to the onslaught, a few civilizations bravely gather resources to send the remnants of humanity out into space in a last ditch attempt to keep the species alive. Your people have gathered into two great cities awaiting word on how you will ship them to another world, their new home. It is time to Abandon Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing the first of the Bagged Game Originals (&amp;quot;BGO&amp;quot;) series, Abandon Earth by designer Tom Decker is a multiplayer game in which you aim to get your people to a new world that they can call home. Manage your actions wisely by searching for survivors, researching new technology, training and sending off marines to fight back, and launching rockets containing the last remaining survivors of Planet Earth. Score more Victory Points before everyone else and declare yourself (and your people) victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you are limited to one action per remaining city that you control. You will be able to choose between developing your infrastructure, researching technology, spending resources, or counter-attacking the aliens. Developing your infrastructure will allow you to search for refugees, train marines, or work on building a new, powerful underground city. Researching technology may allow you to send your colony ships further into space to better planets. After choosing your actions, you will be able to launch one of your ships, should you choose, into space and to a new world. Finally, your turn  ends with an alien attack. As the neutral cities fall around you, your cities become increasingly attractive targets for the aliens. &lt;br/&gt; Will you be able to escape earth before your last cities fall? Can you deliver your remaining citizens safely and peacefully to a new world? Get ready to blast off and Abandon Earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 2 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
