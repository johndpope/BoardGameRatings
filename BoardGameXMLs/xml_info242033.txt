			<description>Lost To Time is a co-operative game in which players must collect 4 keys to unlock the door leading to unimaginable treasure. It is played in 10 real-time minutes with the possibility of gaining additional time (yes you read that right) as you play by rolling a set of dice and taking actions simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free app will allow players not only to keep track of the remaining time but it will also sync time between all the players when additional time is gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have to be quick and smart about making strategic decisions all while trying to avoid traps and falling blocks. Run fast, help each other and don't die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
