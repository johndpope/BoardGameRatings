			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jasper! is, according to it's manual &amp;quot;a cartoon adventure&amp;quot;. The games consists of 22 screens which the mouse Jasper has to traverse. Each screen offers its own difficulties and items found in one can be used to solve problems later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JASPER was very worried - the world had gone too far this time.

Penitent at having doubted his Old Mum, he decided to go home and sleep this one off. He fumbled in his pocket for the front door key... and found a hole instead. Stay calm... he counted to ten, and got stuck at four. His tummy rumbled - he must find food soon. Everything was against him. He wanted his Old mum!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A killer-bunny hopped amiably towards him as, armed only with a total lack of resolve, he set off in search of his key, his home, and safety...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
