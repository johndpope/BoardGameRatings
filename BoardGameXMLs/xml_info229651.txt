							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hearts Blazing: Melodramatic Sci-Fi Adventure</name>
									
			<description>Hearts Blazing is a casual storygame for 3 to 5 players who have a love of episodic fiction and about 1 to 2 hours. After generating a fiction setting together, players take on the roles of dynamic but recognizable spec-fic archetypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing episode frameworks from a plotline deck, players collaboratively create an episodic epic of conflict and romance. By bidding clich&amp;eacute;s on each episode they capture keywords associated with their hidden motivations and compete to see who has final say on the fate of their story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is no winner, per se, the character who secured the most of their keywords reveals the post session denouement of their character last, getting final say on plot outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
