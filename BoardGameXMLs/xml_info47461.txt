			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast Times at Hero High&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crime League is on a rampage downtown, but the prom is tonight and, worse yet, you've got a make-up test tomorrow! But then nobody said life was easy at Hero High!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teenaged superheroes don't have it easy... just ask them. After all, being a normal teenager is hard enough: school, work, parents, friends, dating, and more without complicating matters by adding super-powers and a secret identity to the mix!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero High is a look at the genre of teen heroes (and villains!) for the Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds Superhero RPG. In it, you'll find all you need to run a teen heroes series of your own, with all the trials and tribulations it entails. There's everything from an overview of the genre to breakdowns of its components and how to use them all in your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are even insights from the experts: Hero High includes interviews with some of the creators who know the teen hero genre, from Allen Heinberg (Young Avengers) to Brian K. Vaughan (Runaways) and Stan &amp;quot;The Man&amp;quot; Lee himself! Find out what drew them to teen hero stories and which are their favorites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero High also includes expanded material for the Claremont Academy in the Freedom City campaign setting: visit the private school where a whole new generation of heroes trains. Meet the mysterious new students, the AlterniTeens, and the other members of the Academy's student body. Do you have what it takes to go to the head of the class? Find out in Hero High!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
