			<description>I see, I see little eye ... and wears glasses ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search as fast as you can as many objects and people to the description on the wheel, mark what you find with the stickers of your color. Hurry because the sandglass!&lt;br/&gt; Six fun and beautifully illustrated looking plates, twenty four assignments, a wheel and an unpredictable sandglass: these are the elements of this super cute look and search game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets stickers and a scoreboard in the chosen color. Then you can choose which side of the wheel you play, simple or slightly tougher side! Choose a board game together, turn the sandglass and ready ... START!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most stickers is the winner of the round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
