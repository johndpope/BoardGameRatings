							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slipp&#039;ry Spoons Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Spin the top, get 3-in-a-row. Grab the spoons to win the show!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ten-sided top determines the action on each turn. The faces on the top have the numbers 1-9 and there is also a wild face, represented by crossed spoons. Each player has their own unique 3x3 'bingo' grid with the numbers 1-9 on the game board which must be completed in a tic-tac-toe manner. Above this grid is the word 'SPOON'. A number of spoons are placed on the game board, equal to one less than the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The top is spun. Players cover the particular number spun with a small cardboard disc. If an appropriate number is spun that will complete a line of any player's grid, all players must grab for the spoons. The player missing out covers one of the letters on 'SPOON'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bingo grids are cleared, the spoons are replaced and another round commences. When a player completely covers 'SPOON' they are eliminated. The last remaining player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
