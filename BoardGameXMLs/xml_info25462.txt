			<description>A derivative of Whist with two significant differences: (1) the game is a two-player game and does not involve partnerships and (2) because, unlike Whist, only half the deck is dealt, the game begins with additional series of non-scoring tricks in which each trick determines how the top two cards of the draw deck are dealt to the players, the winner of each trick getting the top card (which is always revealed before the trick is played) and the losing player getting the second (hidden) card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a quick to learn, easy to arrange, and fast-playing introduction to trick-taking games and serves as a good first step to learning to play Whist or Bridge for players unfamiliar with trick-taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
