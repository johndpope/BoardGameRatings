			<description>Electronic Data Controls (EDC) Corporation released a series of electronic board games under their &amp;quot;Computer Games&amp;quot; line in the late sixties and early seventies. The series primarily consisted of two-player sports games. The games all used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a typically featured a matrix of various game results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EDC game simulated a horse race. Each button press reveals the horse or horses that move, and how many lengths. The players wager on the outcome of the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
