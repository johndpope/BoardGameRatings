			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn&amp;hellip;.hard to put away!&lt;br/&gt;Just one round and you&amp;rsquo;ll be hooked!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Staggers is a low-intensity social dice game involving two or more players. The object of the game is to score the most points possible during each turn. Players score points when a die or dice combination matches one or more numbers on the field of play. Players use glass markers to cover those numbers as they compete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game in a Nutshell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player rolls three dice onto the field of play, called the leather , then uses glass markers ( paddy flats , or flatties ) to cover numbers that match an individual die or dice combination (see Basic Roll). A turn ends when a player is topped &amp;mdash;unable to use all three dice to cover one, two, or three numbers on the leather . On the final roll of a turn, a player is allowed to cover as many numbers as possible, even if all of the dice cannot be played. At the end of each turn, points are added up and recorded by the scorekeeper. The dice are then passed to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must always roll three dice. If a roll results in stacked or cocked dice, including those cocked against a flattie , all three must be rolled again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most accumulated points wins the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Roll &lt;br/&gt;Dice can be added together or played as naturals. For example, a 2 , 4 , 5 roll offers five options:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover the 2 , 4 , and 5 .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover the 6 [2 + 4] and the 5 .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover the 9 [4 + 5] and the 2 .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover the 7 [2 + 5] and the 4 .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover the 11 [2 + 4 + 5].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is just an overview&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also learn how to score the game. The 6 basic dice rolls. The Lexicon of Staggers, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
