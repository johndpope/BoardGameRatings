							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fluxxx: The RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One foolish player volunteers to be the Fluxxxmaster.  All other players are Fluxxxers.  The Fluxxxmaster thinks up stuff for the Fluxxxers to do.  The players make the Fluxxxmaster&amp;rsquo;s life meaningless by having the Fluxxxers do other stuff.  Sometimes the Fluxxxmaster gets to have fun when all the Fluxxxers die at the same time, but usually the other players get to have the fun.  However it shakes out, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t have to be the Fluxxxmaster for long.  Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to play a roleplaying game because nobody ever knew what they were doing when they first started out.  Just make sure you have a twenty-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
