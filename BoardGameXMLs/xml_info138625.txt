							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armstrongâ€™s Gold</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lunar landing sites are historical monuments and of course protected. But that doesn't mean they have not been affected by time. The Apollo 14 landing site got hit by a crash-landing cargo transport a decade before the Fall, and the Apollo 17 site was recently vandalized by unknown perpetrators (the Ring of Steel, a radical breakaway faction of the Steel Liberators, have claimed responsibility).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apollo 11 near Nectar has so far remained untouched. Helium mining has been banned from the vicinity, and a protective diamond dome erected around the site with the lander, equipment and the famous footprints. Pilgrims (there are a few each year, despite the easier access through XP and VR) get to watch the site from a ramp around the dome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, just before the dome was built there was a theft. A gold olive branch left as a goodwill message was stolen, likely by a small floater bot. Since then this missing piece of Lunar history has grown in story, and is now known as Armstrong's Gold. The gold is worthless and perfect imitations can (and have - there is one inside the dome right now) be manufactured, but the symbolic meaning is powerful. It is worth a great deal to many people: many Lunarians would pay a fortune to get it or have it restored to its right place, collectors of historical memorabilia equally want it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only problem is finding it. Whoever got it is not talking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;no publication year given in the credits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
