			<description>The Salt Birds of Akarah has elements of both a pickup-and-deliver game and a combat game. Players control a number of birds, each trying to pick up salt crystals, and bring them back to their home base. Along the way, you can freeze and opponent's birds with arctic crystals, zap them with laser beams, and contend with them in an &amp;quot;exciting fruit challenge.&amp;quot; The latter uses a guessing game mechanic, where the object is to successfully discard disks that are marked with bad habits, such as &amp;quot;greedy,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;obnoxious,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;reckless,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;untrustworthy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Salt Birds of Akarah has been awarded US Patent number 4927155.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inventive game may be played by from two to four players, each one of which has a home base game piece and a plurality of salt birds. At the beginning of the game, the home bases and a plurality of other game pieces are placed on the game board in a prescribed manner including a plurality of salt tablets. Each player has a plurality of bird game pieces for movement on the board. Each player has a plurality of discs describing various bad habits. The object of the game for each player is to obtain a predetermined number of salt tablets by moving their bird game pieces and landing on the spaces having salt tablets, then returning the obtained salt tablets to their home bases while getting rid of their bad habit discs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
