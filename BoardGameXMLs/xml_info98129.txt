			<description>Tired of the everyday hustle and bustle of everyday life and work, you decide to try to earn your fortune with a yacht you have inherited from an uncle you never knew.  You fly down to the yacht&amp;rsquo;s location, but as it turns out the &amp;ldquo;yacht&amp;rdquo; is a small junker that is questionably seaworthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you make a living with this boat?  What can you do?  Fish?  Become a rum runner?  While contemplating your future at a local restaurant, the local news station runs a story depicting a man and his crew popping a bottle of Champagne as they celebrate finding a wreck full of Spanish treasure.  &amp;ldquo;Why not me?&amp;rdquo; you ask yourself....  Why not you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed only with your boat and 50 Trade Credits (TCs), you decide to set out tomorrow to find treasure and fame in the waters between the U.S. and the Bahamas.  You will have to learn to dive, sail, and methods for search and recovery.  Will you try to advance conservatively, or try to advance quickly by luck?  Will you try to depend on cheaper equipment, or spend the fruits of your labors on the latest in high-tech equipment?  It will not be easy, and the competition with other wanna-be treasure hunters will be fierce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to become the most renowned treasure hunter the Bahamas has ever known.  Up to 6 players take on the role of one of 16 international treasure hunters, each with different individual strengths.  Players may choose to visit the ports of Miami, Port Lucaya, or Alice Town to purchase and sell dive equipment, boating equipment, search and recovery supplies, and other merchandise; players may choose to explore unexplored areas of the sea by turning over sea tiles with random depths, or dive in explored areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player begins as an unexperienced diver, limited to shallow depths, limited by poor air consuption, and lack of equipment.  Beginning divers will be glad to recover minor treasures such as lobster, and shells during their freedives.  The more dives that are completed the more experience is gained.  The diver is allowed to make dives leading to greater depths, and with a larger possibility to obtain greater treasure.  The greater the treasure the diver recovers, the more Trade Credits a diver will earn at market.  The combination of experience and Trade Credits will allow the diver to eventually recover treasures that are worth too much money to sell on market, but can be donated to the Miami Nautical Museum in exchange for Victory Points.  The first player to win 10 victory points becomes the most renowned treasure hunter the Bahamas has ever known, and is the victor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DIVE! is a board game made by a diver, but which can be played by divers and non-divers alike.  No dive experience is needed, however, those familiar with diving will recognize diving concepts.  Divers will also recognize some of the concepts in this game are not exactly realistic.  That is because making real concepts unrealistic, makes the game fun!  That being said, playing DIVE! should not be seen as a substitution for scuba training, and the concepts in the game should not be used in actual diving.  If you are interested in diving, please contact your local PADI dive center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
