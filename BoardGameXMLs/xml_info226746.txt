							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Village of Hommlet: A Fiasco Playset</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble has come to the Village of Hommlet, and with trouble comes adventurers. For years, the biggest problem this sleepy outpost of Verbobonc faced was the occasional harsh words exchanged between the druidic farmers and the St. Cuthbert-worshipping townsfolk. But the old Cult of Elemental Evil is stirring again in the abandoned moathouse, and once word got out, the village has been inundated with wild-eyed mercenaries from gods-know-where. Between old farmer feuds, dark cultic mysteries, and all the problems of an unprepared boomtown, it's guaranteed to be a fiasco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
