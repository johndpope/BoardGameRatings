							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flashback</name>
									
			<description>Flashback is a trivia game centered around television programs.  The format is very straight forward - the active player or team is told which show the question is about.  A level of difficulty is then selected by the answering team.  The harder the question, the more spaces that will be advanced on a correct answer or backwards on an incorrect answer.  First player to the finish line (twenty spaces away) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programs include:&lt;br/&gt;A Different World, Facts of Life, Growing Pains, Happy Days, Simpsons, Seinfeld, and many other Sitcoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
