			<description>One out of 30 pictures from art history is hidden under 12 wooden tiles and revealed part by part. After any &amp;quot;revelation&amp;quot; the players have to answer one of 14 questions from a questionnaire and talk about the part that can be seen plus answering the question. Each answer that sounds correct to the other players, gets a point (chip).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since any player is allowed to answer each question only once, it gets harder in the successing game to reply properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the picture is completely revealed, the answers are re-checked in the rulebook, and each correct answer gets more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More a game for funny talk and make it believable, than for real art education. But the details you can explore in the process of revealing the pictures and discuss the answers, are illuminative fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
