			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the decades, comic books have been an ever evolving tapestry through which to tell stories. Internal rules have changed between titles, and entirely separate genres even within the field of super-heroes have developed. Dawn of Legends, being a comic book rules add-on and setting for Savage Worlds, is no different. It&amp;rsquo;s ever expanding and developing, both from those of us in-house, and those players and GMs that are kind enough to send us feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn of Legends: Rules Expansion One is not errata for Dawn of Legends (the Downloads section at the Daring website contains that), but is a set of new rules to expand upon and further develop campaigns into true comic book stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you&amp;rsquo;ll find a variety of new Edges, new Hindrances, new Super-Team Hindrances, and new Super-Team Edges. You&amp;rsquo;ll also find basic guidelines for adjusting Power Limits and Power Points to better capture the feel of various comic book genres- ranging from the Street Level campaign to the default Super-Heroic campaign of Dawn of Legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn of Legends: Rules Expansion One is not all exhaustive, and future Rules Expansions will be released as Dawn of Legends continues to expand its options for comic book role-playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
