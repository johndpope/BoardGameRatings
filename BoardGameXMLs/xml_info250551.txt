			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Year of Celebrations is a continuing monthly log written by the traveling bard Digby O'Flannagan. In this log Digby describes the various holidays, celebrations and fairs that he has seen in his travels. Up first in this log is the first month of the year - January. Often one of the coldest and snowiest months of the year, several celebrations and holidays have developed around the inhospitable nature of this month. So, as Digby would say, &amp;quot;Keep a merry soul&amp;quot; and enjoy this first log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small product contains a month summary, alternate historical and fantasy names for the month and for fully fleshed-out holidays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
