							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teleprompter: Cyphers of the Spiritual Hinterlands</name>
									
			<description>1. Players agree to play to a number of points.  &lt;br/&gt;2. The players take turns being the Teleprompter.&lt;br/&gt;2. The Teleprompter first chooses a number of receivers equal to half the number of players rounded down and describes a situation that the first player has caused through supernatural means.  The situation is actually an enciphered message to the receiving players.  The Teleprompter chooses a number of guesses: 1-3, inclusive, for the round.     &lt;br/&gt;3. A non-receiver is allowed to guess what the message means.  Then, a receiver is allowed to guess.  Then, a non-receiver is allowed to guess.  The two groups alternate trying to figure out the message until either:&lt;br/&gt;    a. someone figures out the message or&lt;br/&gt;    b. everyone (save the originator of the message) has the opportunity to guess the predetermined number of times determined in step 2.&lt;br/&gt;4. If 3a occurs and a receiver is the correct guesser, the Teleprompter and the receiver who guesses correctly each get a point.  If a non-receiver is the correct guesser, then the non-receiver gets two points.  If no-one guesses correctly, then the Teleprompter loses a point.  It is not possible to have negative points.&lt;br/&gt;5. The first player to the predetermined number of points wins.  There can be ties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
