			<description>Pac-Man World Rally, (known in Europe as Pac-Man Rally) is a kart racing game in the Pac-Man franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 15 race tracks and a battle mode similar to other kart racing games. In addition, there are four battle arenas for multiplayer action. You will also be able to collect power-ups to attack opponents or gain an edge in the race, as well as Pac-Man's signature fruit pickups, which in Pac-Man World Rally unlock secret shortcuts. There are 16 characters for the player to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pac-Man World Rally contains gameplay that is standard to cart racing games. It also contains a 4-player multiplayer mode where you can access characters from both the Pac-Man world and many other Bandai Namco games. Pac-boxes are available on the track and allow the player the gift of one item. Pac-dots are also available on the racetrack. Each Pac-dot collected helps the player's meter go up. Once it is full, the player can press the specified button and turn into Pac-Man, and all the other players turn into blue(vulnerable) ghosts. If the Pac-Man eats any of the blue ghosts, the blue ghosts will stop for a while and get a major disadvantage on the track. This event only lasts eight seconds. A fruit activation button is on the racetrack. When the player runs over the button, fruit is scattered around the racetrack. When you run over the fruit, it allows the shortcut that corresponds with the fruit to become open for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pac-Man World Rally&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
