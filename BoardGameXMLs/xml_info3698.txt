			<description>Clontarf, is a grand tactical simulation of The Battle of Clontarf that took place on 23 April 1014 at Clontarf, near Dublin, on the east coast of Ireland. It pitted the forces of Brian Boru, high king of Ireland, against a Norse-Irish alliance comprising the forces of Sigtrygg Silkbeard, king of Dublin, M&amp;aacute;el M&amp;oacute;rda mac Murchada, king of Leinster, and a Viking contingent led by Sigurd of Orkney and Brodir of Mann. It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed. Although Brian's forces were victorious, Brian himself was killed, as were his son Murchad and his grandson Toirdelbach. Leinster king M&amp;aacute;el M&amp;oacute;rda and Viking leaders Sigurd and Brodir were also slain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game from Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #162 (along with Saipan) depicting a long forgotten but interesting subject. Game of the clash between the invading viking and the Irish forces under Brian Boro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is known on this battle and the designer has admittedly researched as best he could. However, the game is of original design and is quite bloody in its combat table, well in keeping with the era.  Nicely produced map and counters,depicting the area of the battle, with counters in the traditional green for you know who and blue for the vikings and their allies. The game is based on kill or be killed, with little room for maneuver... and would suit most medieval wargamers to a tee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Turn: 30 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Map: 130 yards per hex&lt;br/&gt;Unit: Individual Leaders and 300-500 men per combat counter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Contents:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; (Clontarf uses only half of the map as the other half is for Saipan)&lt;br/&gt;One countersheet (200 1/2&amp;quot; dual-side printed counters, 100 for Saipan and 100 for Clontarf)&lt;br/&gt;One 10 page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
