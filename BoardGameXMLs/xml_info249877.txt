			<description>Welcome to the world of Phreaker Life. A deck building, card trading game taking you back to the 1970 to 1990 phreaking and hacking era; with some twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck you acquired is mostly incomplete. You can attempt to complete your deck by trading cards with other Phreakers. They may be kind and donate to your cause willfully. You both may consent to a fair trade. Ideally, you will both desire to battle in The Stream for the card(s) you need. Winner takes the spoils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why does a complete deck matter? Look at the back of the deck. Do you see it? The art...it's incomplete. Complete the art, find the puzzles and capture the flags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspiration&lt;br/&gt;The game Phreaker was inspired to provide the CypherCon 3.0 attendees a fun set of puzzles, with the option to have something they can continue using and collecting long after CypherCon 3.0 has ended. A byproduct of the game's inspiration is to use all proceeds from the sale of decks at the Midwest Gaming Classic and other conferences to support the Hak4Kidz NFP charity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many hours, people, and scrapped ideas went into creating what we hope dials you up into the exciting world of phreaking and hacking that was the two decades from 1970 to 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to get your phreak on. Not your hobby...your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
