							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What Bird Am I?</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to identify the bird species in as few clues as possible in order to win the most points for that card.  With a point scale of one to five, a player can earn the most points by identifying the bird in just one clue.  If it takes a player five clues before identifying the bird, then one point is awarded.  A beautiful photo of the bird is on one side of the card for all to see, after the bird has been identified, or if all the clues have been given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
