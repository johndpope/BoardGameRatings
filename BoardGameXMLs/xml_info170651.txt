							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">47 Ancient Scrolls, Maps, and Handouts to Spice up Your Game Night</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the faint candle-light flickers about the walls of the underground chamber, your eyes are drawn to an old piece of parchment lying on a table in the corner of the room. A century of dust and debris covers the parchment, but you can just make out the outlines of &amp;ndash; something &amp;ndash; drawn or written upon it. What do your characters do? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps more importantly, what do you, as the DM/GM do? You can either tell your players what&amp;rsquo;s on the parchment, or you can show them. With 47 Ancient Scrolls, Maps, and Handouts, we&amp;rsquo;ve done most of the work for you. Within these pages, you will find a literal treasure-trove of RPG handouts containing many parchment templates - some are blank, while others are bear wax seals, are torn and weathered, water or blood-stained, or decorated with unique borders or runic symbols. Additionally, this product contains several maps you can use in your games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
