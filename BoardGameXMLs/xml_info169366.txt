			<description>The sun rose on the morning of 18th June, 1815.  Napoleon Bonaparte breakfasted with his generals at Rossomme on the Brussels's road. The conversation returned to the weather; It had poured rain throughout the night and Drouot, the commander of the Emperor's artillery was worried about the effect on his guns. Napoleon acquiesced to a delay in starting the attack. This was the first of many fateful decisions to be made on that day...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waterloo 200 is a new concept game covering the epic Waterloo Battle fought in Belgium in June 1815.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed on wooden blocks, over a colorful 86x64 cm mapboard, 400g thick.&lt;br/&gt;The over 200 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &amp;quot;A buratto&amp;quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Background&lt;br/&gt;On June 18 1815, Napoleon's Arm&amp;eacute;e du Nord and a coalition led by Wellington, clashed over the plains of Waterloo in Belgium for a decisive battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waterloo is a game for two or three players, one controls the French Army and the other one/two control the Seventh Coalition.&lt;br/&gt;Although based on history, players in command of the two sides can modify the evolution of the battle and of the history in the Europe of XIX centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules Introduction&lt;br/&gt;The rules are easy - 6 pages - players can start playing the game without too many rules to remember and the game is 5 turn long (90-120 minutes)&lt;br/&gt;Then the 10 Optional Rules provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as special Cavalry abilities (Charge, Scouting, Impetus), Artillery Bombardment, Retreat, Combined Attack, Morale...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale&lt;br/&gt;A cm is approximately 70 meters.&lt;br/&gt;A turn is 2 'hours' long.&lt;br/&gt;A full strength counter represents a Leader or a Brigade (30-50 guns, 1000 Cavalrymen, or 3,000 infantrymen) depending on the unit's type, training, morale and leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fog of War&lt;br/&gt;The game must be played with the Fog of War on (wooden blocks are placed on the map in such a way the opponent player can not see them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Language: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian&lt;br/&gt;Genre: Tactic&lt;br/&gt;Turns: Turn-Based&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: Entry Level to Basic, depending on which rules are used&lt;br/&gt;Period: Napoleonic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbadge: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
