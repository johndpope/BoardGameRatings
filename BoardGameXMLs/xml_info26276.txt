			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this exciting board game, you must brave the dangers of the jungle in a race through the lands of the Book of Mormon.  Your expedition has set out to find the temple in the land of bountiful, and you never know what dangers or discoveries await you in the mysterious jungles ahead.  Wild animals, murmuring natives, wicked kings, and secret combinations could be hiding along the path.  Or if you're lucky, you could run into some heroes from the Book of Mormon who will help you on your way.  A perfect game for family and friends, Jungle Journey uses familiar Book of Mormon people and events to teach and entertain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
