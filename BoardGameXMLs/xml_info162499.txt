							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Nabasu and Shadow Demons</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life Eaters and Body Snatchers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any demon can kill you, but some can do so much more, and anyone who knows much about demons will tell you that there are some fates worse than death. The fearsome, gargoyle-like nabasu is well known for its tendency to devour mortals&amp;rsquo; life essences and transform them into ghoulish servitors, while the dreaded shadow demon can take control of a victim&amp;rsquo;s body more directly by possessing them. But that is only half the story, if the demons in question are mythic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents game statistics for the mythic nabasu, mythic shadow demon, and mythic ghoul, each of which has several unique abilities never seen elsewhere. Laugh as the mythic nabasu turns entire mobs of frightened townsfolk into mythic ghouls in a single round, and sicks them on your unwitting party, or cackle with glee as a mythic shadow demon steals your party&amp;rsquo;s shadows, animates them into monsters, and turns them against them. Even the mythic ghoul can gain uses of mythic power by consuming corpses, and can channel that mythic power to gain damage reduction and resistance to positive energy. In addition to these three monsters, the book also contains rules for performing specific rituals that can be enacted by players of any class in order to summon a mythic nabasu or mythic shadow demon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
