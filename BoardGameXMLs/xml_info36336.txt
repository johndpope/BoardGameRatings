							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Second American Civil War</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The beginning of the second decade of the 21st Century is a time of great turmoil for the United States. Political Factions tear the otherwise stable American political system into two deeply divided camps.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The President (Eagle Faction) under the Homeland Defense Amendment has moved to the Cheyenne Mountain complex in Colorado just outside of Denver, in order to counter what he called the growing internal threats to the American way of Life. He is isolationist and seeks to remain beyond a second term. He is supported by the Air Force.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Congress (Flag Faction) wants to control what they see as the unchecked power of a Demagogue determined to seize total control. They are supporting greater State autonomy but are international in their economic interest. They are supported by the Navy. Eventually, the thunderclouds of civil war once again threaten to appear over the skies over America.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an area movement map of the continental United States. There are 22 areas and 19 cities marked on the mapsheet. &amp;quot;The First player to gain control of THIRTEEN cities (two of which must be Denver and D.C.) and FIFTEEN areas is declared the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Political Alignment Index (PAI) is used to determine which side has control of these spaces on the mapsheet. The side with an advantage on the PAI has an easier time establishing political control over areas and cities, while the other side has an easier time gaining military support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
