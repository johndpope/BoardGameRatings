							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">101 Patrons</name>
									
			<description>From the rear cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is suitable for use with all forms of Traveller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patrons&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;always have a task that needs doing, often dangerous, sometimes illegal, occasionally heroic. But does the patron have an ulterior motive? Do the rewards match the risks? That's for the adventurers to decide.&lt;br/&gt;Lady Luck&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;can sometimes throw even the best-prepared adventurers into a hazardous situation where fast thinking and decisive action is needed to save the day.&lt;br/&gt;101 Patrons&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;has a huge variety of exciting Patrons and Situations, each with multiple possible outcomes (to keep your players guessing), an index for fast plot selection, an adventure-generation system based around 36 Dramatic Situations, plus Starport Chatter and World Seeds to add flavor to any game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written as a replacement for 101 Plots, and substantially bigger and better (in our opinion) we've ended up selling both books as they're both still very popular. 101 Patrons moves on from the style of 101 Plots, and adds a section developed by Andy Slack on the 36 basic plots (dramatic situations) you can have, along with some more detailed and expanded plot-lines ('elaborations'). There are also two sections detailing Starport Chatter and the enigmatically named 'World Seeds'. Of course, there is a whole selection of 76 Patrons style plots as well! The book has a gorgeous cover by Jesse DeGraff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
