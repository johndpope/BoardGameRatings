							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventurer Sheets: Nonhuman</name>
									
			<description>Official Two-Color RunQuest Forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;This package contains adventurer sheets for nine nonhuman species: broos, centaurs, ducks, dwarfs, elves, halflings, ogres, orcs, and trolls. The base skill precentiles for each of these sheets are tailored to the appropriate species. New skills have been added where needed. Each sheet also includes a sketch of a typical memeber of that species that players can complete to illustrate their nonhuman adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, there is a multiple-hit location sheet. This form lacks any species sketch, but instead provides many lines for hit locations and number tallies to record each location's hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
