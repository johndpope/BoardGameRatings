			<description>Two editions have been released of this game, a &amp;quot;Special Edition&amp;quot; by Mattel and a &amp;quot;Collector's Edition&amp;quot; by Fundex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both editions are packaged in a collector's tin and each card has a photo of a character or ship from the original Star Trek television show (photos are unique to card values).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     When you are down to one card, instead of shouting &amp;quot;UNO&amp;quot; you must instead exclaim &amp;quot;Space, the final UNO frontier!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     Each edition also includes four exclusive cards that alter gameplay from that of traditional UNO.&lt;br/&gt;         The Mattel edition features four Star Fleet Command cards (descriptions from instruction sheet):&lt;br/&gt;             Live Long and Prosper (Wild and New Hand) Card - This card can be played on any card.  After playing this card, you must discard your old hand and draw an entirely new hand.  You then call any color to continue play, including the one presently being played if desired.  NOTE: You can only draw the same number of cards held in your hand after playing this card.&lt;br/&gt;             Mind Meld Card - This card can be played on any card.  After playing this card, you command the next player to show his/her hand to you.&lt;br/&gt;             Beam Me Up, Scotty (Wild and Stop) Card - Play this card immediately to stop a Command card that is directed to you.  You then call any color and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;             Double Tribble Card - This card can be played on any card.  After playing this card, you may call any color to continue play, including the color presently being played if desired.  The next player must double the number of cards in his/her hand by drawing additional cards and forfeit his/her turn.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;         The Fundex edition includes four &amp;quot;Beam Up WILD&amp;quot; cards that can negate the effects of any DRAW 2 or DRAW 4 WILD cards played against a player. That player can then call a new color, and play resumes as if they had played a regular WILD. (It can also be used as a regular WILD if desired.) &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
