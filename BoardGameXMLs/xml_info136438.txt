			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vesna Thaw is a game about two things: giant radiation-powered Robots, and trying to build a new world out of the ashes of the old. It takes place in post-nuclear, post-Soviet Russia. The vestiges of Russian civilization survive in underground bunkers built a decade ago in preparation for the possibility of atomic war....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many communities take whatever mechanical and electrical knowledge and materials they can scrape together and construct oversized mechanical vehicles with which to navigate the hazards of the surface. These constructs, called simply Robots by the people, are the only way to bridge the gaps between communities. The Pilots that have volunteered to take them out into the wild are both honored, and regarded as fools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each player will play the role of one of these Pilots. You will try to solve the problems your community faces, reach out to alien communities, and brave the dangers of the surface in your Robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
