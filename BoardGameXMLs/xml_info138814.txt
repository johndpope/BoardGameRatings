			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we only contemplate on what we are, we will never see what we may become. Philosophy is the beginning of action, not the whole of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Valir Severin, The Philosophies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy began as a series of articles in Kobold Quarterly Magazine reinventing the &amp;ldquo;standard races&amp;rdquo; in fantasy roleplaying. Now, those same articles have been expanded and revised (five times their original size!) and fit with the PATHFINDER Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first in the series&amp;ndash;The Reign of Men&amp;ndash;tackles the most generic, most boring, most overlooked race in fantasy literature: humans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No longer the &amp;ldquo;generic race,&amp;rdquo; humans are the center of learning, culture and democracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans are bound not by a common faith, but by a common philosophy: that all men may become more than they are. They do this through rigorous training, insight and learning. The Reign of Men builds schools and universities to bring wisdom and enlightenment to all men and women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While other races seek knowledge and power from external entities, humanity looks for power from within. Will, self-determination and dignity are the virtues of men and these virtues provide them with powers the other races can only describe as &amp;ldquo;magical.&amp;rdquo; But men would claim these abilities are the exact opposite of magic; instead, the abilities taught to children in human schools and universities only tap into latent power within the human spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy: The Reign of Men includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    FULL COLOR AND FULLY ILLUSTRATED!&lt;br/&gt;    New Human Racial Traits&lt;br/&gt;    New Feats including Teamwork Feats, Knowledge Feats and Rally Feats&lt;br/&gt;    New Cleric Archetype: The Philosopher&lt;br/&gt;    New Paladin Archetype: The Palatine&lt;br/&gt;    Philosophy and Humanity Domains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
