							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neo Morphosis</name>
									
			<description>Neo-Morphosis is a co-operative/competitive game for one to four players. Trapped in space, the players take the part of the crew of a doomed vessel trying to understand and recover from a sudden and severe emergency. The crew must stabilize their environment while facing great threats to their lives and surroundings as they learn the details of the events that have taken place.&lt;br/&gt;Using the ship-wide damage control system the crew can see and repair the escalating disasters as the ship begins to break apart. They can also send their robotic drone into dangerous situations to help manage the crisis. &lt;br/&gt;The crew will discover an alien infestation and they must fashion weapons from unlikely objects around their former workplace to fight for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alien infestation is controlled by the game&amp;rsquo;s artificial intelligence. Driven by a base instinct to survive, the aliens take different actions each turn as described by a deck of cards dictating their current, unpredictable, behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to co-op mode, where all the players work together to quell the emergency, if there are 3 or more players, you can play in agent mode, where one player acts with their own secret agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the crew stabilize the ship before the Aliens destroy both the ship and them before making their escape?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
