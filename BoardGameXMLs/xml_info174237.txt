							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For Hive and Colony: The Great Insect War</name>
									
			<description>It was a simple arrangement: The Bee Queen shall rule the skies above the earth, and the Ant Queen shall have sole rule of the land.  However, the Bee Queen, sick of controlling a domain consisting of mostly air, has declared war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bees launch the offensive, gathering allies from other varieties of flying insects.  The Ants scramble their defenses, drawing on the loyalty of their ground-dwelling friends.  But admist the conflict lay the beetles: divided, it is unsure which side(s) they will support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Hive and Colony is a microgame of strategic, physical card manipulation.  Players will take on either the United Colonies  or the Hive Powers.  They will deploy their oddly shaped cards to the table, then take turns moving them as indicated.  Each insect moves in a slightly different fashion.  Flip, rotate, translate, and even divebomb the enemy in a mad rush to capture their queen!  To the victor: the whole of the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Hive and Colony is a two player game which plays in about 10 to 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: The images associated with this game are prototype images. All art is used for example only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
