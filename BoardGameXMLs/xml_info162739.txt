							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gauntlet: Operation Pedestal, August 11-13, 1942</name>
									
			<description>Gauntlet is a two player game on the epic naval and air battles for the largest Malta relief convoy of World War II (although solitaire play is easy to do). In August the Malta garrison was on the ropes, with critical supplies nearly exhausted. Allied forces were in full retreat towards Egypt following their defeat in the Gazala Campaign. The Axis forces realized the Pedestal Convoy could very well be the battle for &amp;quot;all the marbles&amp;quot; and mobilized tremendous air, submarine and surface fleet assets to contest its passage. The Allied convoy was savaged but enough ships made it through, including the tanker Ohio whose ordeal was a true epic of wartime heroism, to enable Malta to hold out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you do better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
