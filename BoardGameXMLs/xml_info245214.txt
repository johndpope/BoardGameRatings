							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saboteur: La Grande Aventure</name>
									
			<description>In Saboteur: La Grande Aventure, two expeditions of dwarves must fight their way through a dense forest. Unlike in the Saboteur card game, the dwarves are represented by pieces that move on a game board and they must reach a mine to officially discover it. When players lay down traps, they don't play them on an opponent, but instead place them on the board where they will affect everyone. And as you might expect in Saboteur, one dwarf on a team might turn out to be a double agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will be able to collect the treasures and reassemble with the other members of their expedition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
