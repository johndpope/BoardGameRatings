							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baggage Train</name>
									
			<description>The fate of four empires rests in the hands, and the reins, of the men and women in charge of the Baggage Trains.  They race their fleet of wagons against their rivals, striving to reach the battlefield and resupply their armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw cards which help them to scout the field ahead or sabotage their rivals, and then calculate their advancement towards the battlefield.  Random events affect the players progress, and relics may be gained which will invoke the favour of the gods granting bonus victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, as a Baggage Train is always on the move, resources are scarce.  You can only use what you can carry with you, and the more you carry, the slower your progress will inevitably be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner  Points are earned for the cargo carried in your baggage train, as well as for having the most scouts or the most saboteurs.  The first player to reach the battlefield is awarded a generous victory point bonus, but this alone will not win you the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the baggage train, where getting there is half the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
