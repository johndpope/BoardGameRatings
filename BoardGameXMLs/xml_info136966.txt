			<description>Aero Dancing i, the third game in the AeroWings series, was only released in Japan. The &amp;quot;i&amp;quot; stands for Internet, as it was the first title of the series with an online mode. It was also the first in the series to offer air-to-ground combat missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AeroWings (Aero Dancing in Japan) is considered by its fans to be the first true attempt at combat flight simulation on consoles. Contrary to the arcade-oriented &amp;quot;Ace Combat&amp;quot; series, AeroWings provides fairly accurate flight physics, 3D cockpit views, refueling and real weapons loads. Taking off from and landing at airbases and carriers is also simulated. A replay video system is able to record your entire flight and allows you to create your own movie with more than 30 different cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;AeroWings (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
