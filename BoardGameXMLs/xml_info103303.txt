			<description>From the Game Manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bravo Romeo Delta is a real-time, menu-driven, global scale simulation of strategic nuclear war as seen from the command/control perspective. In this simulation, the player assumes the role of either the Chief Target Planner at the Strategic Air Command (US) or the Commander of the Strategic Rocket Forces. The Computer will play the role of the US or Soviet President and evaluate your progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a major Soviet naval exercise, 50% of the ballistic missile subs are deployed to sea and a limited nuclear strike is launched on American targets. All other Soviet and American forces are on day-to-day alert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soviet Player - Respond to possible American counter-strike with restraint, but maintain now favourable balance of power while the Kremlin negotiates a cease-fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American Player - Launch a limited second strike against targets that are selected to demonstrate the resolve of your political leadership while avoiding escalation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory (?) Conditions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At various points in the conflict, your political leader will analyze the course of the war from a remote location with a separate communication link. Based on the picture that your leader is given, your success in applying the nation's strategy to accomplish your assigned task will be judged. The political leader will take into account such factors as casualties inflicted and taken, target kills versus losses, and the effectiveness of the communication network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
