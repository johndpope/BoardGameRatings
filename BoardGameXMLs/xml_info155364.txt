							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Range Ruler</name>
									
			<description>Free PDF game aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have the rules - now get the ruler! The GURPS Range Ruler reads off range modifiers as you measure distances in tactical combat. Included excerpts from the Size and Speed/Range Table mean that the only table you need is the one you're gaming on. Each sheet sports two geomorphic hex-grid rulers, but you're welcome to print as many as you want. Equip your friends, tape together a giant ruler, fold them into graduated stands for flying critters . . . or just use them as hex paper. The GURPS Range Ruler gives you more than the whole nine yards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
