			<description>The rich - alas forgetful - pharaoh has taken his treasures from around the world and hidden them in his pyramids to prevent thieves from stealing them. Travel back to ancient Egypt and help him remember where he has hidden his treasures in this memory puzzle game. Compete to find as many treasure cards as possible by sliding pyramids to reach the right cards. But watch out for sandstorms, scorpions, and rival treasure hunters who get in you way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
