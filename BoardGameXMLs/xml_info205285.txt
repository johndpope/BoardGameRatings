							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghastly Affair Player&#039;s Manual</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghastly Affair is the Gothic Game of Romantic Horror, where players take the roles of the Bandits, Libertines, True Innocents, and other characters of classic Gothic fiction. Immerse yourself in the historic Ghastly Age of Marie-Antoinette and the Marquis de Sade, of Napoleon and Lord Byron. Experience a haunted and decadent world, where beauty and abomination are twisted together, and terror and love are close kin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghastly Affair supports the full rage of classic Gothic stories, from romantic dramas of redemption, to shocking tales of dark indulgence. Your character might fight the monsters that haunt the night, or rob graves for profit. Defy convention to follow your heart, or master the Dark Arts of sorcery. Be a beacon of virtue amid perverse aristocrats, or gleefully embrace depravity. The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghastly Affair has been revised, reorganized, and reformatted for easier on-screen viewing and use. Its now been reissued as two books: the &amp;ldquo;Ghastly Affair Player&amp;rsquo;s Manual&amp;rdquo;, and the &amp;ldquo;Ghastly Affair Presenter&amp;rsquo;s Manual&amp;rdquo; (coming very soon). Typos, misspellings, and inaccuracies in the original release have been corrected for the revised edition. Its still the same game of full-blooded Gothic action for mature players, where you can be virtuous or villainous, and the denizens of High Society are crueler than the most vicious werewolf. Now its just prettier and easier to use!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
