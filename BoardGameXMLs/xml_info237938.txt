			<description>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;A fun, fast paced &amp;amp; easy to learn game. Take the role of a bear waking from hibernation, slim &amp;amp; hungry. It's time to prepare for next year's big sleep. Alas, other bears in your ecosystem have become extremely competitive. Race to gather food while fending off foes along the way. To do this you will forage, frenzy, and even steal to stockpile your hoard. Better get going, winter will come fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal:&lt;br/&gt;Hibernation is a bear themed Deck building card game. Your Deck contains your means of finding FOOD. It starts out forlorn and bare, but you strive to make it a perfect library of FOOD collecting assets.&lt;br/&gt;Then, eat your FOOD in proper portions to gain layers of fat. The first one to achieve the 5 required layers of fat via Hibernation tokens can rest easy - victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn Progress:&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players may choose 1 of 4 OPTIONS:&lt;br/&gt;(REST, PURCHASE A CARD, DRAW A CARD or EAT)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REST:&lt;br/&gt;Add 5 to your ENERGY total.&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;Add 3 to your ENERGY total, and every player must shuffle their Discard Pile into their Deck at the end of the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURCHASE A CARD:&lt;br/&gt;Spend a portion of your ENERGY to add a FORAGE card to your Deck. Then, shuffle your Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DRAW A CARD:&lt;br/&gt;Draw a card from the top of your Deck and play it. Some cards will allow you to add FOOD to your Hoard, while others have special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAT:&lt;br/&gt;Return FOOD cards from your Hoard to the bottom of their respective piles and collect a Hibernation token. This can only be done when you have a combination of FOOD cards whose value equals 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: &lt;br/&gt;68 - Cards &lt;br/&gt;1 - Fold-Out Rule Sheet &lt;br/&gt;All contained in a compact, easy to travel with, tuck box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
