							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uttin Character Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scavengers of the Stars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diminutive, rat-like and clad in filthy robes, the Uttin are regarded as the dregs of the universe. Yet, these clever scavengers are clever and resourceful. Traveling the stars in their massive Spaceslinker starships and wielding a plethora of unique weaponry, their unorthodox mastery of galactic technology is an aid to any party of interstellar adventurers - once you get past the smell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uttin introduces a new alien class to White Star: White Box Science Fiction Roleplaying. In addition to a full five-level class, these pages also provide detailed information on their unique arsenal - including the Uttin Ion Pistol and the chaotic Uttin Star Sword. Couple this will full statistics for their flying junk-pile starships, known as Spaceslinkers, and several unorthodox modifications which can be used on any starship (if you're feeling brave), Uttin brings a fully realized alien species to your White Star campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
