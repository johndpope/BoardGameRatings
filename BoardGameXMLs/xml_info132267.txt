							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">F1 2012</name>
									
			<description>F1 2012 features all twelve teams and twenty-four drivers competing in the 2012 season (except for mid-season changes), as well as the twenty circuits and Grands Prix &amp;mdash; including the brand new Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas &amp;mdash; included in the championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features a brand-new &amp;quot;Young Driver Test&amp;quot; mode, a tutorial mode designed to introduce new players to the handling characteristics of Formula One cars as a prologue to the career mode. As a demonstration, Codemasters approached several drivers &amp;mdash; including Mercedes test driver Sam Bird and GP2 Series driver Stefano Coletti &amp;mdash; at the real-life Young Driver Tests (for drivers who have never started a Grand Prix) in Abu Dhabi in November 2011, and asked them to drive the Yas Marina Circuit in F1 2012 instead of using the team simulators they would traditionally use to learn the circuit. All of the drivers who played the game reported that the game was realistic enough for them to learn the circuit to the point where they were confident enough to set competitive lap times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also presents a new main menu, with Codemasters saying it is now easier to navigate around the video game. The sound system has been modified, and players can now hear other cars around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as the new young driver test mode, F1 2012 features a new &amp;quot;Champions Mode&amp;quot;, in which the six World Champions competing in the 2012 season &amp;mdash; Kimi R&amp;auml;ikk&amp;ouml;nen, Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button, Sebastian Vettel, Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher &amp;mdash; will be styled after traditional end-of-level video gaming bosses, with the player challenged to beat them while racing in conditions that are known to suit the particular world champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F1 2012 (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
