			<description>Players take the roles of competing time travellers, moving back through time and exerting influence on people and events to achieve dominance in the present. Changes made to the past propagate downstream the timeline, so victory can be pursued in the present through direct conflict or by manipulating history. Game is over when one player exerts influence over the entire present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of five rows of pentagons that represent the same sites at five different points in time.  Players take three actions per round, which can include moving one space, move a minion one space, initiate an attack by minions on other players' minions, moving a minion from base to a device card (represents researching and devoting resources to developing the device) producing a minion in the current space, drawing a card, or playing a card. Alternatively, a traveler may spend all three actions to travel forward or backward in time to the same site in that era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards include various attack and defense and minion production bonuses, devices to research and produce including bombs that destroy chunks of SpaceTime, with most of the damage propagating down the timeline, Isolator belts that allow you to convert minions into new travelers (giving you more pieces and actions to work with),  and various instant travel and event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
