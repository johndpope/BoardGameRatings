							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly: Roald Dahl Edition</name>
									
			<description>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rear of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to this Roald Dahl edition of MONOPOLY!  Meet your favourite characters from Roald Dahl&amp;rsquo;s much-loved stories as you travel through Giant Country, and inside the giant peach.&lt;br/&gt;Play as one of six brand new character tokens &amp;ndash; a pile of Matilda&amp;rsquo;s books, James&amp;rsquo;s giant peach, one of Mr. Fox&amp;rsquo;s chickens, a bubbling pan of George&amp;rsquo;s marvellous medicine, a mouse from the Witches and one of Willy Wonka&amp;rsquo;s sweets.&lt;br/&gt;Will you join Centipede and Miss Spider, from James and the giant peach or end up with Mr &amp;amp; Mrs Twit? Will you secure Crunchem Hall, home of the terrible Miss Turnbull, or pay Mr Wormwood for unnecessary car repairs?&lt;br/&gt;Grab your Golden Ticket and get ready for this celebration of Roald Dahl&amp;rsquo;s phizz-whizzing imagination!&lt;br/&gt; PROPERTIES&lt;br/&gt;BROWN&lt;br/&gt;Mrs Twit / Mr Twit&lt;br/&gt;LIGHT BLUE&lt;br/&gt;Badger / Mrs Fox / Mr Fox&lt;br/&gt;PINK&lt;br/&gt;The Grand High Witch / Grandmother / Boy&lt;br/&gt;ORANGE&lt;br/&gt;Miss Spider / Centipede / James Henry Trotter &lt;br/&gt;RED&lt;br/&gt;Mr Killy Kranky / Grandma / George Kranky &lt;br/&gt;YELLOW&lt;br/&gt;Matilda / Miss Honey / Miss Trunchbull&lt;br/&gt;GREEN&lt;br/&gt;Oompla-Loompa / Mr Will Wonka / Charlie Bucket&lt;br/&gt;DARK BLUE&lt;br/&gt;The BFG / Sophie&lt;br/&gt;STATIONS&lt;br/&gt;Crunchem Hall / Inside the Peach / Giant Country / Inside Wonka's Factory&lt;br/&gt;UTILITIES&lt;br/&gt;Electric Company / Water Works&lt;br/&gt;TAXES&lt;br/&gt;The Witches RSPCC / Wormwood Motors&lt;br/&gt;COMMUNITY CHEST / CHANCE&lt;br/&gt;Golden Ticket / Wonka Bar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
