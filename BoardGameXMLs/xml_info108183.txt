			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of This and Brains, Too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wishtaker, we introduced you to a new face in the world of Hot Chicks; born of a disastrous meeting between forces of Villain-Net and the Slimeys from Yiffy, Yaoi, and Yahooey!, the Wishtaker was something beyond the pale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, in the Wishtaker Companion, we provide you with the full size images of all of the graphics in the Wishtaker book, along with over a dozen new images of the Wishtaker and her horrific operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accompanying the full-size graphics are pages of notes on the Wishtaker, what her place in the Universe actually is, and exactly what her presence means for your Hot Chicks campaign. Be warned - she may be too hot (and/or too dangerous!) to handle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is the origin of the Wishtaker's twisted minions, the Pain Sisters, and their game statistics... because one evil sexy robot deserves another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
