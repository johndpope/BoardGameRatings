							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ember: Light and Dark â€“ Spectral Pack</name>
									
			<description>LIGHT AND DARK is a pair of expansions that supercharge your game with twenty new cards across two exciting packs - each packed with game-changing mechanics. There's a lot to deal with in Light and Dark!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spectral Pack introduces ten creature cards that curse and hinder your enemies with dark magic. Conjure these creatures and steal the Victory Points for yourself, while the cards curse your enemies with powers that range from stripping the cards in their hand to making their creatures weaker. Beware, for what you reap so may you sew, for the owner can choose to Conjure the creature in their turn and send it right back at you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectral cards are creatures of shadow and gloom. They are cursed and bring only darkness to whoever controls them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spectral cards are the powers of evil, of darkness and malevolence. These ten cards will give you the power to strip your opponents of their abilities, to force players to discard valuable cards, and to reduce the VP of their own creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then you have Sinistra, the Elemental Dragon God of Shadow. Her trio of powers are alone formidable, but when combined, she can affect all opponents with her powers every turn. Now that's nasty! Sinistra is definitely a game changer...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;6 Creature cards&lt;br/&gt;1 Artifact card&lt;br/&gt;1 Three-part Dragon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
