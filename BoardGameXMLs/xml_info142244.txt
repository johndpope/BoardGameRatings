							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of the Transatlantic Flight</name>
									
			<description>Highlighted by fantastic 1920's artwork, this is an air race between 2 to 4 players.  Some players start on North America, some in Europe.  Travelling in planes, players try to avoid perils along the way to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in the least amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board contains various travel points along the route, showing your planned journey.  On your turn you spin and move your plane the number shown on the spinner.  If this would take you past a landing station you must remain where you are until you spin an exact number.  You are considered on schedule as long as you don't land on any delay spots, and you may even deduct time if you land on a &amp;quot;time spot&amp;quot;.  If you land on an &amp;quot;off course&amp;quot; spot, then you must take an alternate (longer) route to your journey.  You may land on a forced landing spot or run out of gasoline depending on which spot you land on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game you must total up the hours lost or gained to determine the fastest player and they are declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example of this game, given many years ago, was selected as an example of the evolution of America and is housed in the Americana collection of the Boston Childrens Museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
