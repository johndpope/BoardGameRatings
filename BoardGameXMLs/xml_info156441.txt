							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hero Brigade: Hero Harder</name>
									
			<description>The standalone expansion to Hero Brigade, the fast-paced heroic card game for 1-2 players that features elements of deck-building and positional card-battling. Take on the role of the Heroes or the Villains and prepare to throw down! Hero Brigade 2 introduces new Heroes and Villains and new rules for 3 and 4-player tag team battles in combination with the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character card can be played in three different ways (deployed to your Party's Front Row, deployed to your Support Row, or used for a one-time game effect). Hero Brigade also offers unique twists on conventional deck-building mechanisms. Drawing extra cards and eliminating your starting cards can hurt you in the long term as you permanently lose cards from your deck each time you reshuffle and each time one of your characters is defeated. Running out of cards loses you the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
