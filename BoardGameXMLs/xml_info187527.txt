							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Buildings</name>
									
			<description>The Buildings uses the gameplay found in Sky Scrapers, but creates new goals for new playing areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each game, you start with pieces of the two players on the game board. Each turn, a player moves one of their own stacks a number of spaces equal to the height of the stack, stacking it onto of another stack. A stack is owned by the player whose piece is on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the original Sky Scrapers game, included in this set, whoever has the most stacks that contain at least four pieces wins the game. A different game board crowns the player who has created the tallest stack. A third game board gives the win to whoever controls more of the six inner spaces on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
