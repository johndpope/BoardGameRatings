			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What will you do to survive?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fires of the outbreak are behind you. The skies are grey, the winds cold, and the ruined cities eerily empty, and already being covered in greenery. Humanity was struck down by the virus, the Infected, and the wars the followed - but it survived. Now, the vast cities of yesteryear are home to numerous rough-and-tough towns, settlements and even small cities. Some are walled, some not. Some paranoid, or mad, others open and inviting of trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ruined roads are now subject to traffic, as traders, couriers, soldiers and countless wanderers move from settlement to settlement, to bring valuable supplies, information and defense - or perhaps make their fortune in the dark underbelly of the settlements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life is perilous in these days of fallen glory. Out there are bandits, burners, crazies and cannibals - and many much closer than you think. And then there are the Infected themselves, never quite wiped out, surviving on the fringes of civilization, where they hunt in their dreaded packs, with all the cunning of vicious wolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game of survival, suspense and horror. It is the story of humanity rising from the ashes, and what role your characters will play in it. Will you try to rescue humanity from its darkest days, or light a match and watch it burn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A premium quality Tabletop Zombie RPG in the tradition of 28 Days Later, Resident Evil, I Am Legend, World War Z and The Last of Us, Infected! tells your own stories of survival, horror and suspense in the grim days following the zombie apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a sample book of 63 pages, containing gorgeous original artwork, an introduction to the setting, quick-start rules, pre-generated characters and an adventure to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is everything you need to not only get to know the world of Infected!, but also to play the game. The Kickstarter is coming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first setting in the Immersion RPG stable, a universal game system that is classless, levelless and limitless. Check it out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
