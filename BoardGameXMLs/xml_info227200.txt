							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uncle Figgy&#039;s Guide to Good GameMastering, or... How to Manipulate Friends and Influence People</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I love roleplaying. For me, RPGs go way beyond the &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; part of their name. They're not just roleplaying &amp;quot;games&amp;quot;, but a way of hobbyist life as serious as any fly-fisherman, sports fan/player or model railroad enthusiast. The problem is that very few people feel that way. Some say they do, but it's apparent through their actions that they don't; someone who truly loves something will always look for ways to be better at it. Most of the GMs I've played with, however, think they're &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; and if you don't like it, leave. So I do, because a roleplaying game exists for the benefit of both the GM and the player. And because of my love for roleplaying, I'm offering this online manual, free and without cost, to whosoever wishes to read it and possibly benefit from the experience contained herein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
