			<description>A changing landscapes game for the piecepack. Attack other players and make it harder for them to move, or slowly destroy the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players create a game board from the piecepack tiles. They pay coins to move their pawn, and tiles around to attack other players. Attacks can steal coins from other players, or chop off sections of the board, making the game board smaller. If your pawn is on a board section that is removed, or you cannot move your pawn during your turn, then you are killed and removed from play. Last player remaining on the board wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.piecepack.org/rules/Decay.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.piecepack.org/rules/Decay.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
