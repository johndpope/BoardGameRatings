							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">When Europe Raped Africa</name>
									
			<description>At the start of the 19th century, the exploration and exploitation of the African continent began in earnest. During this deplorable period in world history, the major European powers &amp;mdash; Britain, Holland and France &amp;mdash; would mercilessly explore, colonize and fight over its many resources for a hundred years. Naturally, native populations would come to resent and rebel against their foreign exploiters and seek independence, and so it is in this swift-playing game for two, where you emulate a European nation and compete for a continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get a hand of cards in four types: Explore, Colonize, Exploit and Conflict. Some cards are restricted to a region, others to a single area. Exploration leads to colonization, which leads to exploitation, and sometimes to a conflict between the rival powers. Hand management and timely card play is important in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If more colonists arrive in an area than it will accept, a native uprising will occur. The roll of a die and simple charts settle uprisings (and conflicts) quickly. Choosing the right time to initiate negative action against your opponent can be crucial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
