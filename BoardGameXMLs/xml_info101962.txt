							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neighborhood Drugstore</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It had seemed simple enough. All that Jacob wanted to do was to grab some aspirin, a candy bar and maybe a Coke. However, as he saw the young teen looking around nervously, he knew that simple wouldn't be the adjective used to describe his trip to Blanco Drugs. As if prodded by some unheard alarm clock, the teen reach underneath his dirty, gray trench coat and quickly produced a sawed-off pump action shotgun. &amp;quot;Give me all the money,&amp;quot; the dark-haired man shouted nervously as he pointed the gun at the frightened girl at the register. Slowly and confidently, Jacob walked down the candy aisle toward the register with a smile of annoyance on his face. &amp;quot;What are you smilin&amp;rsquo; about, old man,&amp;quot; the teen said as he whirled around and pointed the shotgun at Jacob. &amp;quot;Boy, you picked the wrong drugstore to rob.&amp;quot; Jacob said as he produced a pair of ASP&amp;rsquo;s with blinding speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go from here? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments and 12 to Midnight offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5&amp;times;11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24&amp;times;36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An average neighborhood drugstore&lt;br/&gt;The floorplan for this building includes some exterior details, specifically a drivethru lane. The building itself includes a sales floor with shelving, checkout area, pharmacy, stockroom, bathrooms, and employee break room. This building could make a great location for a hostage standoff, a normal-looking cover for a drug ring, a random robbery, or any number exciting scenarios limited only by your imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps in this title can also be found in Modern Floorplans Volume 3: In the Neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
