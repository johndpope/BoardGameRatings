							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sailor Moon: Quest of the Guardian Card Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Sailor Scouts, along with the Guardians, have banded together to battle the forces of the Negaverse! Be the first Sailor Scout to send the most &amp;quot;Enemies&amp;quot; back to the Negaverse and win the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A children's card game where the objective is to collect &amp;quot;Negaverse&amp;quot; cards by players turning the top card of their deck over and saying  the name of the character on the card out loud if there are any matching cards revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of cards: Negaverse and Sailor Scout Cards. The cards are separated into decks of their type; the Sailor Scout cards which include the Sailor Scout character cards, Luna cards and Artemis cards are shuffled and distributed to every player evenly. The Negaverse Cards (back of cards are labeled &amp;quot;Negaverse&amp;quot;) are kept face down in a separate pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players would then countdown to reveal the top card of their deck. When a player correctly names the matching cards that are revealed, the player obtains a Negaverse card from the pile. If special &amp;quot;Luna&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Artemis&amp;quot; cards are revealed it enables the player to make card trades with another player. Play continues until all Negaverse cards are claimed and the player with the greatest number of Negaverse cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
