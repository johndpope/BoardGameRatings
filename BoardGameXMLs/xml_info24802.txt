			<description>The Frontline General 'Land, Air, &amp;amp; Sea Tabletop Simulation' is an Operational and Tactical Level WWII Consim.  The system covers Land, Air, and Sea wargaming mostly at the Operational level with a tactical 'feel'.  The board wargame may be used to 'drive' more detailed tabletop miniatures battles for decisive engagements.  Miniatures combat expands on the level of detail and is entirely optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frontline General: Italian Campaign expands on the published introductory game, Frontline General: Italian Campaign Introduction, by adding a large size map of Southern Italy (See the Image Gallery), more Units, an additional country (the United Kingdom), and five historical scenarios covering action from Salerno to the Gustav Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will be available as a standalone game or as an upgrade to the Frontline General: Italian Campaign Introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introductory version linked above is the first release in the series and is currently available as a production version and a free Print &amp;amp; Play version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collins Epic Wargames provides rules support via website forums and e-mail and also publishes a Newsletter called Frontline General News with in-depth articles, examples, and previews of upcoming products.  All back issues of FG News are available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
