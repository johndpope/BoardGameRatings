			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grimoire Enamoris suddenly and inexplicably feels like your best friend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manipulate creatures to your own devious ends with this grimoire's 84 enchantment spells. &amp;quot;That troll thinks he's your mother because I'm the greatest. Now stop whining and let him fight your battles!&amp;quot; If this sounds familiar, then you probably have this grimoire. If not, then you must be an enchanter in need of this grimoire. You're in luck, friend, because for a limited time only, we're offering you the ability to stagger your opponents with arcane riddles, coerce your regent into doing exactly what he just told you not to do and poison everyone that watches you drink poison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, we're taking back the poison. It's too much. OK fine, we'll throw it back in, but...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was that 18 seconds? Did we just haggle for 18 seconds? Hah! Now you have to pay 3% more for this grimoire! Why? You'll just have to read it and find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These spells encourage creative play and have been thoroughly playtested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
