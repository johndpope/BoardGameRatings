							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wallace &amp; Gromit Cracking Contraptions</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get set for some brilliant teamwork as Wallace and Gromit embark on their latest career move!  In this cracking game, teams of players compete to create items from modelling dough, whilst the others try to guess what's being made.  As this grand adventure continues, players can steal items as they move around the board and try to avoid Preston as he seeks to steal points.  The team who model and guess the most items will triumph as champion creators!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams take turns to roll-and-move their dough-modelled playing piece round the board, either modelling inventions out of dough or stealing inventions from another team.  Inventions are graded as hard (red / 3 points), medium (yellow / 2 points) or easy (green / 1 point).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a modelling turn, the modeller makes as many as he can from that colour in one minute.  Each correctly-guessed invention moves the teams scoring piece along the scoring track by the appropriate number of spaces - first to 30 wins - and the team keep the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a stealing turn, the team take a card from another team and advance that many spaces, while the other team goes back that many spaces, for a total swing of 2, 4 or 6 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each turn, the team also roll-and-move the Preston piece either way round the board.  If it lands on another team, or another team land on it, that teams discards a card and loses the appropriate amount of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variation listed in the rules is that dough cannot be reused during a turn, limiting the size and number of models that can be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game board&lt;br/&gt;200 item cards&lt;br/&gt;3 pots of modelling dough&lt;br/&gt;3 modelling mats&lt;br/&gt;Preston playing piece&lt;br/&gt;3 playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;Sand timer&lt;br/&gt;Dice&lt;br/&gt;Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
