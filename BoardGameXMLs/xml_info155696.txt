			<description>This is a set of rules intended to link existing board and miniature games into one massive, yet playable war. The rules are also designed with detailed battle resolution for engagements that are not covered by outside game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire play has been factored into the design in such a way that human players can come and go during play. Their places are taken by NPC characters. Decisions are done by die rolls. Combat is resolved without dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A system of Command &amp;amp; Control points is used to reflect board and miniature play in the big game. Players or NPCs win and lose points as they succeed or fail in battle. Their point values stay with them for future engagements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a FREE set of rules for download. Just take from the files section below. Enjoy, adapt to fit your game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
