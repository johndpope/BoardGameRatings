Sports, Horseracing, Board game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game based on the famous Sweepstakes race run in Ireland. The object of the game is to,of course, win the Sweepstakes Race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 1 die, 4 colored horses with wooden stands, 25 colored markers and 1000 dollars [NOTE: Unknown how many colored cardboard markers and how much money present indicates a complete game. My copy came with a sheet of 27 (9x3) brown markers in addition to 25 already cut-out markers - were 2 sheets of each color provided? Additionally the rules state that each player starts with $1,900 (not $1,000) broken out into 16 $100 bills, 4 $50 bills and 20 $5 bills, meaning there should be at least 64 $100 bills, 16 $50 bills and 80 $5 bills in a complete set, maybe more]. Players move around the board contributing money into the Sweepstakes purse. buying horses, and buying sweepstakes tickets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player lands on a square already owned by another player, the player makes a side bet of 5.00 by paying the fee to the owner of the horse. If that horse eventually wins the owner must pay off the bettor at odds shown below the name and price of his horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player must be on the yellow circuit of the board in order to win. If a roll puts his marker past the &amp;quot;winning post&amp;quot; square on his first time around he must go around the circuit once more. As he hears the 'Winning Post&amp;quot; position a 2nd time he must stop if a roll were to take him past the square and then on another turn re-roll and try again to hit the Winning Post square by exact roll. If he does he takes all the money in the Sweeps Fund, pays off all bets on his horse and then wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
