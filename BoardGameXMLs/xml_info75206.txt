			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures was the first Tiny Toon Adventures-related video game to be released. Developed and published by Konami, it was published in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A platform title, the player plays as Buster Bunny in the effort to rescue Babs Bunny from her kidnapper, Montana Max. Players get the help of Dizzy Devil, Furrball, and Plucky Duck to get through a total of six levels, which is done at the beginning of each level. Each character has special traits that help Buster get through the level. Plucky can briefly fly, Dizzy can spin through walls and is invincible whilst in his spin mode, and Furrball can climb trees and other vertical surfaces, slowly sliding down them rather than plunging down. Various other characters from the cartoon make their appearance as bad guys, like Roderick Rat, Elmyra Duff, Gene Splicer et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the gameplay, conceptually, for the game's storyline, the player may have had to originally find his allies before finding the keys to unlock the doors in Monty's Mansion. Initially Hampton J. Pig as a passive ally in the first level: Acme Planes, Plucky, for the second level: Acme Swamp, Dizzy for the third level: Acme Forrest, and Gogo Dodo as a passive ally in the fifth level: Wackyland. At the sixth and last level: Monty's mansion, there would be no more recruitable allys for the last showdown with Monty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duck Vader also makes a cameo appearance as a secret boss if the number of carrots collected in any level is a multiple of eleven. If the player can defeat him without losing one life in the process, they will gain three lives (assuming the lives don't exceed the life limit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
