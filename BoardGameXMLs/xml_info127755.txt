			<description>Ever want your playing cards to be used for something more than a poker hand? Ever want to turn those hearts into healing items and those clubs into cash? We&amp;rsquo;ll, now you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pixel Patch: The Real Life RPG is a 2-6 player card game that turn a standard deck of 52 cards into a a fun 8-bit RPG-influenced battle system. Players will try to work their way past their opponent&amp;rsquo;s defense through the cards they draft and grow more powerful through the games they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round, you will choose cards to decide whether to attack, defend, heal or gain influence for special abilities. You and your opponent will then decide whether to perform your action in an aggressive or defensive fashion and then draw a varying number of cards to determine your success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entire game can be played with just a deck of cards and a pad of paper if necessary, but player aids and guide books are also provided in the downloadable PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player&amp;rsquo;s health reaches 0. At this point, experience points are handed out, which allow you to level up, boosting your original stats from your entrance exam and making your card drafts more powerful. All these stats are recorded on the printable booklets that come with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a great head to head challenge as you work to figure out what your opponent will do next and of course is immensely repayable as you work to unlock and master 11 unique classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also boost their stats by purchasing RPG Patches from our website (listed in the links section); each one of these patches gives a different permanent stat boost to your character, without breaking the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
