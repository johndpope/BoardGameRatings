			<description>Seeking your fortune, you have bought a mining spaceship, but you have a limited time to pay off the loan. You must fly from planet to planet, obtaining minerals on one before selling for a profit on the next. The blue planet is richer in ore, but you will receive a lower price for the blue than for the relatively rare red minerals. You may purchase upgrades to your spaceship but it will cost you time and money. Can you pay off your loan before the bailiffs turn up?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solo card game. There is a deck for each of four planets. The player must choose one of four actions - mine, fly, sell, upgrade - then draw a card from the relevant planet deck. Mining and selling will vary in their level of success or failure, depending on the card drawn. Upgrade cards are available which give special abilities. The aim is to earn 160 Credits before running out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for the 2012 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
