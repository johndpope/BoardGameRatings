							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Adrianople (378 AD)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;The Roman Empire was feeling increasing pressure from the German tribes on its border. The German tribes were themselves suffering at the hands of the Huns. The Romans agreed to allow the Visigoths to move through Roman territory to escape the marauding Huns. Relations soon soured, however, and the Visigoths began raiding the villages in their path.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Valens, the Eastern Emperor, led his army to fight the Visigoths and sent a request for help to the Western Emperor. When Valens reached Adrianople he decided to attack alone rather than waiting for the Western Army. It was a fatal mistake.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Units portrayed in the game include Infantry, Cavalry, Skirmishers, and Roman Generals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
