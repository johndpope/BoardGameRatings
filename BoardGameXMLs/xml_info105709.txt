			<description>From the Game Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bodycount is rising... but will you be blown away?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You stand accused of a crime you did not commit and have only forty-eight hours to clear your name.  There's a price on your head and the clock is ticking... can you handle the pressure of another Time Crisis?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Frantic duck 'n' shoot action is as intense as ever&lt;br/&gt;     Innovative multi-hiding system adds a new dimension to gameplay&lt;br/&gt;     Improved enemy AI and logic patterns pose a brand new challenge&lt;br/&gt;    Blast your way through level after level of high powered arcade action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Crisis: Project Titan was developed by Flying Tiger Entertainment, a third-party company in the United States, and was published by Namco as a PlayStation-only title (unlike other Time Crisis games that were released for the arcade first). The game took two years to develop. According to IGN, Namco opted to create a new game instead of porting over Time Crisis II since the specifications of the arcade version and the PlayStation were so different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Time Crisis: Project Titan&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
