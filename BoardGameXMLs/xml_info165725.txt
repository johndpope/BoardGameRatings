			<description>Card game for children.&lt;br/&gt;6 cards are dealt to each player.&lt;br/&gt;The first player draws a card, and discards another one face up on the discard pile. The next player can draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card from their hand. And so on until a player has the 5 cards of a kind (5 cards of different background colour but with the same &amp;quot;beast&amp;quot;) and shouts &amp;quot;Bestium!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 suits (6 different &amp;quot;beasts&amp;quot;). For each &amp;quot;beast&amp;quot; there are 5 different coloured cards, numbered 1-5, per duplicate (so 10 cards with the same beast, 2 for each of the 5 colours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a &amp;quot;Memory&amp;quot;-like variant of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
