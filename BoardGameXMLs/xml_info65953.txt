			<description>French game that translated in English means 'The Game of the Shepherd'. Each player starts with a set of tokens and a set of colored balls with a value varying from one to three. There are also numbered charts that range from two to eight. Each turn the players choose one of their balls and allocate them in to one of the slots in the charts. Each round a player wins he receives 1 token from the other players. The moment a player runs out of token the game is over; he who has the most tokens then wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
