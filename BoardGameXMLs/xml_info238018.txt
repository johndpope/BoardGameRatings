			<description>WALLS is a unique boardgame created by ScyDes and takes place in a medieval fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;Physics, building and shooting skills as well as strategy, are the core elements of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 4 guild towers, providing him with certain support components. If you lose a tower, you lose the supports.&lt;br/&gt;Everyone gets 30 wall stones to start with.&lt;br/&gt;Build your wall using stones and supports to protect your towers. But hurry up, the clock is ticking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoot your dice at the opponents towers and take them down using the feature loaded catapult!&lt;br/&gt;Obtain coins and spend them on tower upgrades and strategy cards to gain access to your towers super shots or to play foul tricks on your enemy using the strategy cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be wise in spending your actionpoints, each decision can be your last.&lt;br/&gt;Grind those walls and rebuild your own, for as long as you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
