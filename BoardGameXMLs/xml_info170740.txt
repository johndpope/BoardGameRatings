			<description>Kaiju Conquest is a strategy wargame depicting the battle for Earth in 2116 AD, with the First InterSpecies War between the humans of the United Nations Reaction Force (UNRF), and the reptilian Sazzarran Empire. The initial invasion began in the Pacific Ocean and its bordering coastlines, which is also portrayed on the game board. There are 16 major coastal city zones which were involved in the war of the Pacific Campaign, and are beautifully illustrated by the artist, Becca T-R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 20 mecha characters in eight variant designs, as well as 20 kaiju characters of eight different species, including the Warlord, who is the Supreme Commander of the Sazarran invasion force. Fighting along with and supporting the mecha are Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine and Transport units. The Sazzarran have their own version of Army, Air, Sea, Reaper and Drone units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six phases during each game turn. In the World Event Phasee, the UNRF player rolls to gain or lose resources such as military units or mecha through Resource Cards. The Sazzarran player rolls to determine how many portals appear at the beginning of each game turn; from one to three portals. In the Resource Phase, the players receive their military forces, mecha, kaiju and bases to deploy on the game board. In the Movement Phase, the Sazzarran player deploys first, and the UNRF player moves to counter attack against the Sazzarran forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Battle Phase, the players will battle for control of city, land, and coastal zones and destroy the most forces to gain the most victory points. In the Re-Deployment Phase, the players are given opportunity to move their units to friendly zones to reinforce weaker zones and move mecha and kaiju back to a friendly base to heal. In the Control Phase, the players calculate the Victory Points (VPs) each has received. The first to reach or exceed 120 VPs, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are alternate victory conditions to play. There are bio-bombs and nukes, as well as the opportunity to destroy the city zones through collateral damage during battle and/or by the use of the nuclear devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you could deploy a lot of mecha and kaiju on each side as you use them as frontline assault units to support the regular military units. There is strategy and some luck with dice rolling during battle. So, prepare for battle in an effort to prevent a Kaiju Conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
