			<description>Escape the Alps is a solitaire 9-card game with 18 components.  It uses grid movement, dice rolling, and resource management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;You are a captured WWII Airborne Ranger imprisoned by the German SS in a castle in the alps. You've been put through hell and still you've only given your name, rank and serial number. As they take a break from interrogating you, you manage to break open the window to the room and climb out onto the ledge. You immediately notice the 500ft drop to the rocks below and feel the cool chill air of the Bavarian Alps. You work your way to the face of the mountain and look up to see sheer rock hundreds of feet straight up with occasional patches of snow covering section of the mountain. You have two choices; climb to freedom with no turning back or get recaptured and await certain death from the SS. Your choice is clear, climb the mountain and escape the Alps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to climb up multiple rock faced cards using dice to manage your movement direction.  On each rock face card are hazards, benefits, rest points and location markers.  You must climb through natural rock conditions as well as snow conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain dice arrangement can gain you another movement die or allow you to modify existing direction die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game is different due to 12 individual rock face configuration and marker locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;Successfully manage your climbing piece up the face of a mountain to the top without falling. You must manage your climbing route and try to pass through specific zones while trying to avoid losing as little fatigue as possible.&lt;br/&gt;LOSING CONDITION:&lt;br/&gt;Become too fatigued or lose your grip and fall off the rock face; losing the game immedieatly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
