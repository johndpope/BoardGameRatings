			<description>From box description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This could be the end for Jack Sparrow and his pirate crew as they make the journey to World's End and prepare for the battle of their lives. Featuring your favourite characters, including Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann and Captain Barbossa, you'll sail the seven seas as you collect the pieces of your puzzle. Be the first to complete your character's scene and you'll be the triumphant winner, sending your opponents down to Davy Jones' Locker!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic roll and move round 3 multi-space rings in an endeavour to collect all 9 parts of a puzzle and complete the picture of your character. The spaces are simple instructions to collect, roll again, move on etc. Collect 3 pieces of your puzzle per track and then move to the next track when landing on the appropriate space.
