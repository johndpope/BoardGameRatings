							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ASCII Pad FT</name>
									
			<description>A third-party controller produced by ASCII for use with the Sega Dreamcast.  It looks very similar to a Sega Saturn controller but with a slot for VMUs.  It is missing the analogue stick because it was designed specifically for fighting game, with the FT in the title standing for Fighting Type.  It was released to coincide with the release of Capcom Vs. SNK Millennium Fight 2000, which was a Dreamcast exclusive at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
