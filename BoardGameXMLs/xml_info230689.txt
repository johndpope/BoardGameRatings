			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ten years I have been polishing this sword;&lt;br/&gt;Its frosty edge has never been put to the test.&lt;br/&gt;Now I am holding it and showing it to you, sir:&lt;br/&gt;Is there anyone suffering from injustice?&lt;br/&gt;~ The Swordsman by Jia Dao.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who travel across the land to right the wrongs done to the common people are the wondering force known as youxia. Youxia hail from all backgrounds of social class that birth those that value freedom to roam the land helping those in need. Sometimes called Flowering Knights or knights-errant they look to blend martial arts with weapon mastery as they crusade for noble clauses. This isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that they swing first and discuss later, youxia are wise enough to know when to hold back and when to take action. Much like monks they search for an inner focus to channel their ki and perform spectacular displays of physical and mental prowess. They are a balance of yang and yin in an effort of self sacrifice for a greater good, however some do so while seeking fame and glory. Wandering swordsman and women looking to make the world a better place through action instead of passive behavior, is the youxia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The youxia is a hybrid class of Fighter (Samurai) / Unchained Monk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    8 Pages of youxia goodness.&lt;br/&gt;    A new skill: Meditation; alternate rules for Ki Focus, 5 new Feats&lt;br/&gt;    7 Pages of Style feats that build upon Crane Style, Scorpion, and Tiger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We take known combat style feats and combine them with combat style feats from other publishers. Merging combat style feats expands upon the 3 feat system. Doing so allows for more &amp;ldquo;flavor&amp;rdquo;, longer progression in a school style, and offers something to look forward to when advancing in levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
