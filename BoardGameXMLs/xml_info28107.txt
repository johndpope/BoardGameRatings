			<description>In 'Counter Agents' you control 12 agents with which you must infiltrate your opponent's base. Basically, you must get one of your pieces on to your opponent's baseline. When moving, it is important to keep 'in contact' with a piece on your own baseline. Contact is maintained by being in a direct, unobstructed line with the piece or via lines of contact with your other pieces. If you 'lose contact' your agent can be bribed by your opponent if he can make a similar line of contact between the piece and a piece in his own base. A bribed piece cannot be moved by the enemy but can be used in his own lines of contact. If you regain contact with a bribed agent you can re-take control of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game bears some similarities to Rob Abbott's 'Epaminondas' (in the layout and victory conditions) and to Sid Sackson's 'Network' (in the way lines of contact are maintained).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
