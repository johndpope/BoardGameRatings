			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who Dares Wins is a top/down shooter where you operate a lone soldier shooting dozens of enemies. As soon as the player starts moving upwards, the screen scrolls along, but it won&amp;acute;t scroll down with the player, so it&amp;acute;s always forward &amp;amp; advance, not a bad motto for this kind of commando-like game.&lt;br/&gt;Rifle ammo is unlimited. However, the player starts with 5 handgrenades and can get extra, laying around in small chests, along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme &lt;br/&gt;The theme isn&amp;acute;t that obvious. The player uses a rifle and handgrenades and so do his enemies. He encounters mostly infantery, but also some trucks, motorcyclists and an occassional propellor plane and zodiac (inflatable rubber boat with an engine attached). Together with the jungle environment this is probably Korea or some other unnamed Southeast country shortly after WW-2, but it could also be a WW-2 theme, fighting the Japanese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal &lt;br/&gt;The goal is a lot clearer, run forward and kill as much along the way as possible. Once the player can't go further, he'll be swarmed with a last outburst of enemies, after which he gets a 'stage cleared' message and proceeds to the next level. After 8 levels he's congratulated for clearing everything. However, back-up troops weren't able to hold the newly won terrain and as a result, the player has to start over at level 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus points are earned for shooting vehicles and for freeing comrades, which are occassionally transported away by an enemy soldier, or while tied to a tree, at the verge of being executed. Shooting the enemy soldier is all that's needed to free the fellow soldier, who runs marrily off the screen. But that does take some practice, timing and knowledge of the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a nice repeating soundtrack, that'll hum in many player's minds hours after playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
