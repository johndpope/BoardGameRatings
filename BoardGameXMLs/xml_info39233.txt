			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting signal for the big horse race is audible and the horses start to run. After a while you notice an exciting neck and neck race on the racetrack. The lead changes all the time. Place your cards in a clever way so that your horse wins in the end. An exciting horse race for 2-4 players where the horses are moved by number cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two different ways to play the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player plays a card on his turn and moves his horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Each player plays a hidden card and all the cards are revealed at the same time. The lowest cards and the highest cards are discarded, and the other players move their horses. Two special cards (gallop and walk) can change this procedure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After ten rounds (each player has ten cards), the player with the most lap token wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
