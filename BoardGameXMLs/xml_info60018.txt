			<description>A tactical level Napoleonic Wargame that uses Risk pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The risk pieces (Infantry, Artillery, and Cavalry) represent 1 Battalion (Squadron, Battery) which have differing capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the units in a single space (even if of different types) are collectively called a Regiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is divided into irregular shaped spaces. Each space has a Terrain Type (hill, water, forest etc.) and possibly 1 or more Terrain Features (road, fence, ridge, wall etc) which impact on movement and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play progresses through a combination of attack and movement with results being determined through dice rolls.  Players manouvre in order to controil the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
