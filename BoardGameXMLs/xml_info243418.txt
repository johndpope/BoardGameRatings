							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doomsday Castle</name>
									
			<description>Cassette Inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOOMSDAY CASTLE is an arcade style game with the feel of a real adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infinitely evil Scarthax has scoured the Universe to bring together the six ancient stones of lifeforce. United in Doomsday Castle they are being used to wield an irresistible power over the cosmos, emanating waves of corruption through every galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To save the Universe, you must find and collect the six stones and use their force against Scarthax to destroy Doomsday Castle, hopefully escaping yourself before the final cataclysmic explosion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to battle your way through a labyrinth of 75 complexity interconnected halls and passages meeting on the way a whole host of adversaries serving Scarthax., the Garthrogs, the Orphacs, the weirdly disguised Kamikaze Urks, the phenomenally nasty Googly Birds plus many others, all beautifully animated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The task is not easy (saving the Universe never is!) and it will take you many games to unfold the structures of Doomsday Castle and discover the locations of the ancient stones. The addictive arcade style action will keep you coming back to play but the overall challenge should still keep you occupied for months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
