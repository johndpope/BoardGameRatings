			<description>In Grease Monkey Garage, you play as shift managers in a busy auto repair shop. Take shifts managing the shop&amp;rsquo;s mechanics and limited resources all while trying to gain a better reputation than the other managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improve your reputation by fixing customer vehicles and storing spare parts in your stash for easy access. The shop&amp;rsquo;s resources are limited, though: If a manager needs something that is no longer available in the shop, they can trade for it right from someone else&amp;rsquo;s stash while they are not on shift. After all, if you gain the best reputation you will become the next Employee of the Month!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Manage shared workers on a modular shop board&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Fix client vehicles to earn reputation points&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Hire specialists only you can control&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Manage the shop's limited resources&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Block the other managers by moving workers away from resources they may need&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
