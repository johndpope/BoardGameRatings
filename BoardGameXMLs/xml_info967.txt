			<description>The Police Commissioner is on the hunt for escaped criminals. Players build a deck of cards showing the escape route taken by the criminals. The cards are double sided, and when the deck is completed, it's turned over and players must predict the next move in the escape. Get it wrong and move your hunch marker down. Find a suitcase left by the criminals, and gain a commendation. First to get 4 medals wins.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
