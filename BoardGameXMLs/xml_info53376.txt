			<description>Hear me! As you know, before our kingdoms, blessed by the gods with the gifts of Seven Virtues, were born, the world was ruled by the Unnamed. It was him, who spread disaster and there was no-one who did not bear wickedness in his heart. Only the First Hero, shielded by an armor, which defended him from the influence of sin, has challenged the Unnamed, defeated him and banished into the Void, which he close using magical seals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the safeguards crumble, and the power of the Unnamed makes its way to our world. Again, people act against each other, their hearts bearing the seeds of wickedness. The Virtues that were our strength are transforming into parodies of themselves. If the heroes will not complete the armor of the First, clothe with it the most worthy of them, and achieve victory over the Unnamed, all shall be lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 is a fantasy board game, in which you will become a hero worthy of legends, gathering his own party of adventurers to win over an ancient evil. You will take part in dangerous quests, working with other heroes to recover the miraculous Armor of Virtues and proving that you are the most worthy of wearing it. You shall accomplish great deeds, as long as you guard yourself from the temptation of excess, which brings with it sin and disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 offers a unique mechanism of play, joining the aspect of cooperation with an element of rivalry. For the kingdom to survive, you will have to join your forces with other players. Be wary though, as there can be only one victor. You will have to beware of excessive ambition though, as it can unnoticeably cause your strength to falter. 7 opens the gates to a heroic, but dangerous adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
