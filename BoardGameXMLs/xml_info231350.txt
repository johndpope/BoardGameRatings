							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Girl Quest</name>
									
			<description>A board game for 2 -4+ players based on the TV show Lost Girl.  Players move their pawns around a circular track collecting the tokens needed to solve a central mystery and its complications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a circular track with 12 spaces around which players move in a clockwise direction.  The spaces on the board allow players to gain tokens, or draw cards from the various decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six token types each representing one of six traits: Guile, Lore, Search, Heart, Fight, Magic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 common decks of cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery Deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;       Each card represents a mystery that must be solved or resolved. To solve a mystery a player must collect 3 of each token type, plus extra tokens required by individual mysteries and complications.  An individual mystery card lists any extra tokens required in addition to the 3 of each type. When a mystery is solved, the solving player keeps the card and a new card is drawn from the mystery deck to be the new mystery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complication Deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;       When a player lands on the complication space on the board, they draw a complication card. This card is placed face up next to the board.  This card lists extra tokens that need to be gained to solve the current mystery. This additional burden applies to all players.  When the current mystery is solved, these cards are discarded. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assistance Deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;       When a player lands on the assistance space, they draw an assistance card. This card gives that player one or more extra tokens. The assistance card is then discarded. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the top mystery card is placed face up in the middle of the movement track. Players then take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Roll 1 die and move that many spaces clockwise along the track. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Most spaces when you land on them give you 1 or more Tokens. &lt;br/&gt;         If you land on a Deck space, draw a card from the indicated deck. &lt;br/&gt;         If you land on an opponent&amp;rsquo;s Pawn, steal 1 Token of your choice from him.  Skip all other actions you would take at that space. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     End Phase&lt;br/&gt;         If you have enough of the right tokens to solve the Mystery and all of its complications, declare your intent.  Keep the Mystery card and discard all complications. All players discard all of their Tokens. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to solve 3 mysteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
