			<description>Players are eager to create the best amusement park ever! You and your competition are all building parks in the same county but only one can be the most successful. Each player has a specific park type to build on (waterpark, thrill ride park, wildlife park, or family park).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With your park type, you can select certain features for your park. Entertainment, Ride, Ambiance, and Food &amp;amp; Beverage features are all options. Take features for your park, sabotage the other parks, and acquire the most victory points.  Both the quantity and quality of the features you put in your park contribute to your overall score. This is a colorful game for people of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
