							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fronton Miami: 1973</name>
									
			<description>In this 2P sport &amp;amp; logistical simulation board game, players go head-to-head managing a hustling Jai Alai Fronton battling to satisfy the peculiar demands of jet set guests &amp;amp; claim the coveted BLUE CHIP LEADS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use the staff &amp;amp; resources of the casino to manipulate a series of critical micro-economic instruments dynamically linked to the amount of control players are able to exert in the conduct &amp;amp; outcome of a detailed simulation of the sport of Jai Alai. The relative intensity of the shared economy in the game expands control, utilities &amp;amp; opportunity while exposing players to increasingly severe penalties for mismanagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAIN GAME MECHANISMS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commodity Speculation:  &lt;br/&gt;FM73 features a multi-variable commodity marketplace dynamically correlated to the sport of Jai Alai in which the players accumulate &amp;amp; exchange both labor value &amp;amp; resource value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Rolling: &lt;br/&gt;3 dice are featured in the game. The unique CESTA dice, a modified backgammon doubling cube, brings the game of Jai Alai to life. The 2 standard d6 are used to represent value indexes, and may be rolled rarely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paper &amp;amp; Pencil:&lt;br/&gt;Players use a score sheet to track hidden information which can convert the score sheet into a valuable physical resource as well as giving players an edge in planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulation:&lt;br/&gt;Statistical ranges &amp;amp; tendencies for Pro Jai Alai in the 1970-1975 period have been used to create a simple tactical version of the sport which allows players to make a series of decisions in order to resolve dice rolls rather than using dice rolls to resolve a fixed set of decisions. The influence of gambling on the sport, in the unique environment of a Casino Fronton, is taken into account&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worker Placement (Action Drafting):&lt;br/&gt;On the strategic level, players collect needed actions in each phase of a round by controlling the position of Jai Alai players (pelotari), the Jai Alai ball (pelota) &amp;amp; player tokens on the fronton board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand Management:&lt;br/&gt;Players collect and manage cards and tiles representing the casino guests, staff (including Jai Alai players) &amp;amp; cash resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
