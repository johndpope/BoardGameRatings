			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for Gears &amp; Gaslights&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year 1297 during the First War of Scottish Independence, at a place called Stirling Bridge (conveniently located near the town of Stirling), a decisive victory was won for the Scotts, with over 100 English cavalry, and 5000 English infantry slaughtered, and an unknown number of Scotts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of note, the Scotts lost a valuable leader, Andrew de Moray, and the English lost a hated (by everyone apparently) leader, Hugh de Cressingham. It is these two souls that this adventure revolves around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What Now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caretaker for the current Cambuskenneth Abbey, of which only the bell tower remains, one Dubh Innis has sent out the word that his Abbey, and the nearby site of the Battle of Stirling Bridge has become haunted, and needs assistance in the eradication of spirits. He will pay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucky for our heroes, they are the first to arrive on scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
