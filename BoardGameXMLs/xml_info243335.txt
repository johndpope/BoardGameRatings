			<description>Will you be the first to complete your game card and make it backstage?  One Direction: The Game is a themed game for 2-4 players in which you answer questions, take challenges or complete actions in order to collect tokens.  Each token represents an item of One Direction memorabilia.  The object of the game is to be the first player to fill your game card with autographs, collectables and concert items.  Only the winner receives the backstage VIP pass necessary to complete their game card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to pick up cards that bring them closer to collecting tokens.  Do You Know? cards require the player to answer a question about One Direction to receive a token.  Action Cards for example may cause the player to miss a turn or trade tokens with another player.  Will You Dare? cards are family-friendly challenges such as &amp;quot;Do the chicken dance for 20 seconds&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Sing happy birthday in a way that would get Harry's attention&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
