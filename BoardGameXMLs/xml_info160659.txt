			<description>This card game simulates a dungeon crawl if the entire party was made up of thieves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a thief and plays a Chamber card which gives some information about the next room the party is about to enter. This card is played face down and the current player describes its contents, generally by lying. Each player then plays a card face down to express how they intend to deal with the upcoming room, and then everything is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players accumulate treasures which equate to victory points and also give each player some special powers depending on the treasure captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
