							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holiday Photos</name>
									
			<description>The animals on holiday have lost their favorite possessions: can you find them all by looking at their photos?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses an animal tile and places face up in front of them. Then all animal and object tiles are placed face down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the players play simultaneously. Each player turns over an object tile searching for one which shows an object his animal is wearing. If correct, the player joins the object tile he found with the animal tile who is wearing the object. If incorrect, the player turns the object tile back face down. In either case, the player goes on searching for other tiles to be joined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player joins a tile, he can now search for both the tile showing the second object the animal is wearing and an animal who is wearing the object which he has just found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to join 8 tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
