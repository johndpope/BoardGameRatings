			<description>&amp;quot;Mystic Master -- an adventure for the mind&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented as a game, Mystic Master is pretty unusual for its time. Coming in on the fringe of the D&amp;amp;D explosion in the early 1980s. It's games like this that made some people take the magic use in D&amp;amp;D way too seriously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the tube:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mystic Master is a unique and enjoyable adventure designed by a research psychologist to test, challenge and help develop the fantastic powers of the mind. Join forces with Merlin in mastering mystical mental powers of ESP. It's fun and easy to play. The game comes complete with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A long-lasting, attractive, vinyl game board, 18 specially designed mystic image cards and easy-to-follow multiple game instructions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No designer is actually credited in the rules or anywhere else. It also comes with two gold plastic tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is literally governed by guessing (erm, divining) what card(s) is being held up, is closest to the top of the deck, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
