			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Author Terence Wise is a master of his subject and introduces the newcomer to the many facets of this fascinating hobby that is making an increasing impact amongst thinking people. In simple fashion the reader learns how to re-fight classic battles of history - often with very un-historic results! - how to manoeuvre elephants against chariots as well as tanks against opposing armour. Marking of such games, construction of various components in the game are also included. Above all, the author communicates his immense enthusiasm for the art of Battle Gaming.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
