			<description>Peppermill's Energy Conservation Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Cover:&lt;br/&gt;Q. Is there really an energy crisis?&lt;br/&gt;A. Yes, we are using up our favorite non-renewable fossil fuels at a furious pace, but we can learn how to conserve and use solar energy for most of our energy needs.  That's what this game is all about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Instructions:&lt;br/&gt;Energy Crisis is a fast moving, game of chance, strategy, and educational fun.  It will challenge adults and fascinate children.  It's a game the whole family will enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;This is a role and move game where players are trying to insulate their house, convert to solar energy and conserve your energy units.  Use your energy units to pay your bills.  There are various spaces on the board where you buy solar collectors and insulation, collect energy, and pay bills.  Play continues until one player acquires 10 solar collectors or until all other players run out of energy units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
