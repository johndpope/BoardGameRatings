			<description>Frank Thomas' Big Hurt Baseball is a multiplatform baseball simulation game that is licensed by Major League Baseball. This video game is notable for being released near the end of the Super NES' timeline; providing the most realistic action for a baseball game that was released on that particular console system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This video game features realistic pitching, realistic batting, and features a likeness of Frank Thomas himself. Pitching and batting can be done either in a high, medium, or low direction (in addition to slow, medium, or fast pitching) for greater realism. Various scenarios offer different challenges that take place in either the 20th century (although not too far in the past for the engine to realistically display baseball) or the 21st century (but using the same player numbers as the games set in the present day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain scenarios were not allowed to go into extra innings and ending a game in a time was the equivalent to losing the entire scenario. An example of a game scenario would involve playing as the then-current Montreal Expos team in the World Series that was never meant to be due to the 1994&amp;ndash;95 Major League Baseball strike that resulted in an abbreviated 1995 season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
