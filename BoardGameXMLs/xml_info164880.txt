			<description>Nation rises against nation... They&amp;rsquo;re just not always up front about it.&lt;br/&gt;You represent a nation&amp;rsquo;s interests and ambitions in the next Cold War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spying, sanctions and nuclear weapons.&lt;br/&gt;These are your tools. Use them as you push for war, or try to prevent it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a quick card game where the goal is to secretly stockpile the most nukes and/or money cards before war is declared. Players compete using strategy and of course the luck of the draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn and endlessly replayable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing a card, then playing 1 card face down and/or 1 card face up.  Only Money or Nuke cards are played face down, since they are secret. Opponents can play a variety of face up cards, like Spy, Sanctions or Economic Failure, to see the secret cards and possibly remove them.&lt;br/&gt;There are also War and Peace cards.  They are played in a shared space called the War Line.  The game is over when there are 7 War cards in the War Line, or when the deck runs out of cards.  Score is based on the values on the Money and Nuke cards, as well as a few bonus modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
