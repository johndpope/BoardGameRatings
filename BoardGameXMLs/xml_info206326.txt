							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek: Attack Wing â€“ I.K.S. Toh&#039;Kaht Expansion Pack</name>
									
			<description>The I.K.S. Toh&amp;rsquo;Kaht is a powerhouse for 28 SP featuring a 5 primary weapon value, 1 agility, 5 hull and 3 shields. The Action Bar contains Evade, Target Lock, Cloak and Sensor Echo Actions. The ability to cloak and sensor echo is what makes the Vor&amp;rsquo;cha class ship so dangerous. The generic version of the ship loses a shield and a Weapon Upgrade slot for 2 less SP. The I.K.S. Toh&amp;rsquo;Kaht has a special ability that allows you to take an action to place a Scan Token and an Auxiliary Token beside your ship. Since the I.K.S. Toh&amp;rsquo;Kaht normally lacks the Scan Action, being able to perform a Scan Action sets this ship apart from other Vor&amp;rsquo;cha class ships. Kaybok is a level 3 Captain that allows you to re-roll a number of your attack dice equal to the number of Tech and Weapon Upgrades deployed to the defending ship. Kaybok will make sure your attacks find their mark, especially against ships with lots of Tech and Weapon Upgrades. The Elite Talent Upgrade in this blind booster is Covert Mission. As an action, you may disable all of your remaining Shields and target a ship at Range 1-2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Discard this card to steal 1 Weapon Upgrade on that ship with a cost of 5 or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
