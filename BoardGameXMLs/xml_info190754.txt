							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shockwave</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the city survive her attempts to save it?... Shockwave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 10 Rival, Shockwave is a powerhouse who often winds up causing as much collateral damage as the villains she's trying to stop! Shockwave is an iconic figure in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shockwave is a young would-be superhero whose powers make her a formiddable foe, indeed. She's brash and ready to smash, and all-too-willing to tear up the streets in order to hit the bad guys as hard as she can. A perfect Rival for heroes who try to minimize such damage, she can be a real pain to reign in, or an ally if they need a heavy hitter and are willing to pay the insurance bills. With a few tweaks, she might even make a beautiful disaster of a romantic interest for one of your heroes! Built under the same guidelines for a Power Level 10 Player Character, she can also be used as a handy &amp;quot;Guest Star&amp;quot; for a player visiting your game who doesn't have a character ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
