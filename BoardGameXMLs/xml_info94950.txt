			<description>Published in spielbox 1990 #5.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to be the last player able to move his pawn, because their opponent&amp;rsquo;s pawns are either blocked or were taken. In the first round, each player places his pawn on a free field on the game board and plans his movement for the next round using one of his four movement cards, kept secret from the other players. From the second round on, a player moves his pawn following the scheme of the movement card chosen and let a neutral piece on the field where his pawn was. If a pawn ends its movement on a field occupied by the pawn of other player, this last is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
