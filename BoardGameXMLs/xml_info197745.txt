			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;New System&amp;quot; version of the game resulted from play-testing of the &amp;quot;Old System&amp;quot; and converting the rules from the light-weight &amp;quot;storytelling&amp;quot; dice-pool system to a &amp;quot;crunchier&amp;quot; system using modified skill rolls compared to target difficulty values.  In the &amp;quot;New System&amp;quot; (also sometimes called the &amp;quot;Superfun&amp;quot; System), combat is played in turns, with distance, movement, and various other options being a standard part of the game.  Characters have multiple &amp;quot;status conditions&amp;quot; as well as simple damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game mechanics have been completely replaced, the setting and tone remain unchanged.  The game's title was shortened, according to the wiki because it was felt to be somewhat misleading because characters generally are involved only in &amp;quot;grabbing your wingman's [breasts] and being ambiguously gay.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
