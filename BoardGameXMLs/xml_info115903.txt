			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An IP-free version of Chapter Seven, &amp;quot;Aspects,&amp;quot; from The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game, Volume 1: Your Story, made freely available on the faterpg.com website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Are Aspects?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central character attributes in FATE are called aspects. Aspects cover a wide range of elements and define what makes your character unique&amp;mdash;basically, they describe the core of your character's identity. (By contrast, skills and stunts could be said to paint a similar picture of what your character can do, rather than who he is.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspects can be:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Relationships (Mama's Boy, Chosen of the Dread Lord)&lt;br/&gt;     Beliefs (The Lord Is My Shepherd, Nothing Is Forever)&lt;br/&gt;     Catchphrases (Can't Keep My Mouth Shut, &amp;quot;It's Not My Fault!&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;     Descriptors (Wiseass Wizard, Rugged as the Road)&lt;br/&gt;     Items (My Vorpal Sword Goes Snicker-Snack, My Lucky Rabbit's Foot)&lt;br/&gt;     Pretty much anything else that paints a vivid picture of the character (Big Man On Campus, Anger Is My Constant Companion)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of game rules, aspects are the main avenue by which you gain or spend fate points for your character. Fate points are a kind of currency that can be spent for bonuses, and they are earned when aspects cause problems and complications for the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
