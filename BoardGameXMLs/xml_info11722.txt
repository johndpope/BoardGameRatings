			<description>Exactly how this game is played is evidently lost to us. On the game board is a stylized map of the United States indicating the boundaries of  each State. The map is in four colors, and each color indicates a time zone:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;red - Pacific Time &lt;br/&gt;green - Mountain Time &lt;br/&gt;grey - Central Time &lt;br/&gt;yellow - Eastern Time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;for the 2 to 4 players. Certain circles across the map are joined by red lines, while others are joined by blue lines - the lines indicating the two dominant national networks, NBC Red and NBC Blue, - and tracks for movement of the player's counters. The disc shaped cardboard counters are in the upper right of the photograph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the bottom left of the photograph is a &amp;quot;spinner card&amp;quot;  used by the players to determine their movement around the board. As a &amp;quot;chance device&amp;quot;, a metal arrow fixed into the center of the card is spun by a player. Where the point of the arrow stops determines the player's move. The outer circle on the card is divided into the four US time zones. Within each zone are the numbers 1, 2, 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game was manufactured by ALDERMAN FAIRCHILD COMPANY of Rochester NY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
