			<description>La ovejas y el Drag&amp;oacute;n (&amp;quot;The sheep and the Dragon&amp;quot;) is a game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a fantasy world, where many sheep escaped the castle, shepherds have the mission to find them and bring them back home. In the adventure they will find objects that help and enemies with which to fight. In turn, the great and almost invincible dragon roams throughout the kingdom seeking to steal sheep and take them to their cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the players is to recover the sheep, bring them back and avoid at all costs the dragon, though, if some brave shepherd manages to defeat the dragon in combat, it will be consecrated the great savior and win the game immediately.&lt;br/&gt;If no defeat the dragon, the pastor with more points (for accumulation of sheep) has wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics are simple, each turn pastors must perform two actions, move and look. To move roll a die (1d4), after completing its movement they can search the area where it is located and there, stealing a card from the appropriate deck as the area will reveal your search. The areas investigated can not be investigated in the future. In his search you will find objects, events, enemies and sheep. Every sheep has a value in coins (VPs), the pastor must take the sheep back to the castle to win the reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus action, if a pastor result is an 1 in movement (as in the Talisman), after completing their actions must &amp;quot;activate&amp;quot; the dragon.&lt;br/&gt;When the exploration markers are finished, or when the dragon is defeated, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
