							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What&#039;s Up, Doc? The Bugs Bunny Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box front: Raid Elmer Fudd's vegetable patch and collect the most carrots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary: At the start of the game, players get a supply of carrots.  On each turn, every player gets a card.  When any two vegetable cards match, everyone grabs for a Bugs Bunny piece, with enough for every player but one (i.e. three Bugs pieces for four players).  Whoever does not get a Bugs piece must give a carrot to the other players.  In addition, there are three Elmer Fudd cards.  If one of these turns up, no one should grab for Bugs.  If they do touch Bugs, they must give up two carrots to each other player.  The same penalty applies for touching Bugs when there are no matching cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player runs out of carrots, the game is over, and the player with the most carrots wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
