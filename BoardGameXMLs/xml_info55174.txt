			<description>&amp;quot;Fun and excitement for players of all ages FROM 4 AND UP!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another game in a giant Animal Cracker box, this one published by Cadaco not Mattel/Fisher Price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Be the first to move your four animals from the circus ring into your four cages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No reading required, just spin and go. [Although one spinner wedge is marked: &amp;quot;Return one animal to ring if you have one&amp;quot; and another says: &amp;quot;Take one animal from any other player's cage and return it to ring.&amp;quot;] The remainder of the spinner board is an inner and outer circle of animal pictures that match all the plastic figures (eight in each ring).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has 16 painted platforms (the round kind that the clowns roll in) forming the ring. Place all 16 animals on these dots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each side of the square board are circus wagons, each with cages for four different animals. Each player chooses their wagon from the gameboard. They will try to fill their wagon with the pictured animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player spins and then may take either animal that they need (from the inner or outer circle) and put it on its matching cage in his/her wagon. If the player has neither animal he/she passes the spinner to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to fill their wagon is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full-color vinyl illustrated playmat 27&amp;quot; x 27&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;16 hand-painted, non-edible molded plastic animal figures&lt;br/&gt;1 animal spinner card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
