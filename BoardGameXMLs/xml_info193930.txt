							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fortress</name>
									
			<description>Fortress is a game in rounds for 2 to 5 players. The concept is to protect royal cards in your hand while trying to capture your opponent&amp;rsquo;s royals. This is done by placing non-royal cards on the left and right of the royal cards --thus building a fortress. In hand cards are used to break down an opponent's defenses, making the player's own defenses weaker in the process.  Protected royals and captured royals are worth points that are tallied after each round.&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played without a table, and only requires a single standard 52-card deck (removing the Jokers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
