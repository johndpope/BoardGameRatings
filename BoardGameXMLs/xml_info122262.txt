			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get right down to business: Pyramid is a quick &amp;amp; dirty roleplaying game, a sort of take-away, fast food, light snack version of the full meals you get in other games. This is speed role-playing and provides a low-prep complete pulp adventure that can be finished in a single session. The basic set up is this: a group of explorers in the late 19th or early 20th century have found an ancient pyramid and opened it to plunder it of its treasure &amp;amp; secrets. As players, you mainly take on the role of the explorers as they make their way to the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s Chamber where the greatest finds are kept, but you also take turns at playing the pyramid. This is a GM-less game, so it&amp;rsquo;s up to the players to determine what happens as they explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, everyone will need a Play Sheet and a pencil; as a group, you will need a very large pool of six-sided dice to draw from throughout the game. It helps if you have at least two different colours of dice; yellow can serve for exploring and Egyptology rolls, white dice can be used for everything else. You&amp;rsquo;ll also need some sort of marker to represent the Curse of the Pharaoh (a hat is a good choice, especially a homemade, silly or ostentatious one), a pool of counters for Hits and Dashes and a copy of the game sheet with the results of various die rolls on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
