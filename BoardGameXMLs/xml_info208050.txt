			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magister Schlect, a founding member of the Cult of the Crimson Plague, with the assistance of the Bailiff of Trotteldorf and other cultists in the village, has summoned a plague bearer to sow the rye fields of Trotteldorf with a fungus that produces an insidious disease known as nergotism. Life in Trotteldorf goes &amp;ldquo;a-rye&amp;rdquo; as the villagers have begun to suffer the disturbing and sometimes fatal effects of nergotism. Furthermore, the Bailiff has provided an infected harvest as Trotteldorf&amp;rsquo;s tribute to the Raven Knights of Morr, to avenge the downfall of his family as one-time rulers of the lands now held by the Knights. If the adventurers don&amp;rsquo;t stop the Bailiff and Schlect, on the night of All Soul&amp;rsquo;s Eve, the plague dead will rise to destroy the village.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Chaos in the Rye is an adventure for 4-6 characters with more than one basic career behind them. It is set in the sleepy village of Trotteldorf in Stirland, but with a little effort could be moved to any suitably rustic border region of the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
