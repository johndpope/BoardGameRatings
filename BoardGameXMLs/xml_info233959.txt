			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harpy has something to tell you. Come closer. She has a story you&amp;rsquo;ve not heard. It&amp;rsquo;s the tale of a man who argued with himself. No. You&amp;rsquo;ve heard this one. No you haven&amp;rsquo;t. Not this telling. Shh. Listen. Be quiet and still and she will tell you the entire story from beginning to end. She was there, after all. She watched him argue until his death, convinced he would be right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And he was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Black Monk, the characters are people living in a desolate, but vibrant world where time seems to have lost meaning. Living for decades, perhaps longer, in isolation from others, the people of Elysia toil in work, only to be visited once a year by the Black Monk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In between these visits, their lives are interrupted by sometimes trivial and other times confusing events. Everything seems to fit together like an elongated jigsaw puzzle, but no one can see the starter pieces stretching across the horizon.&lt;br/&gt;But they don&amp;rsquo;t complain. There is always more work. The village needs workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then one evening, the sun stayed in the sky all day. When there should have been night, the sun remained. And now it feels as though it&amp;rsquo;s been years since the Black Monk came. But perhaps it was yesterday. Nothing is right&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is that blood?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
