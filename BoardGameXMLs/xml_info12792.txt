							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Simulated Inter-hemispheric Naval Combat (SINC)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction: &amp;quot;S I N C is a game of strategy, devoid of any element of chance. It is a game in which two players match their strategic acumen by engaging two opposing fleets of symbolic warships. One fleet represents the Eastern Hemisphere and the other the Western Hemisphere.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the full name suggests, SINC is an obvious product of the Cold War period intended to simulate a fleet battle between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in two editions. One version comes in a standard long box and contains 34 substantive metal ship pieces. A second version comes in an album-style slipcase and serves as a travel edition, with 34 magnetic ship components clearly identifiable via their silhouette, name and classification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ship classifications drive the comparative cruising and firing capabilities of the various warships which they emulate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
