			<description>An officially licensed game based on the popular and fondly-remembered children's late 60s/early 70s BBC TV show &amp;quot;Clangers&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanic is extremely basic; essentially a &amp;quot;Snap&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;Memory&amp;quot; hybrid with the addition of a board but without the same level of competition.  Twenty five circular cardboard dustbin-lid counters are placed face down on the moon; on the reverse of each dustbin-lid is a picture of a specific Clanger or other denizen of the moon.  (Clangers lived on the moon and used dustbin lids as doors - just accept it.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players (there's no upper limit stated) are dealt out the twenty five cards in the deck, taking turns to turn over a dustbin lid and if the revealed character matches a card in their hand, they take the token.  The player with the most tokens/dustbin lids wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unusual inclusion in this game, however, is the &amp;quot;whistle sound chip&amp;quot; device - a battery-powered gadget that when pressed plays an extract of the extremely distinctive whistle-like 'Clanger speech'.  Whenever a player matches a token and card they get to press the Clanger whistle...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
