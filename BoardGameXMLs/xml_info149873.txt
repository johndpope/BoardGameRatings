							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Seven Deadly Skills of Sir Amoral the Misbegotten</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In years long past, Gryffon Keep was a border fortification guarding a somewhat well-used roadway. In that day, the keep was placed in the trust of Sir Harold Amoral, one of the greatest warriors available to the then Lord Duke. Time has changed the land, and brought the keep low, and Sir Amoral has become little more than a figure of fable and children&amp;rsquo;s story. That the ruins in the forest were those of fabled Gryffon Keep have been forgotten by most, and the area is now known to locals as the Forest Ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although history has faded to legend, the ghost of Sir Amoral still haunts the ruined keep. During his lifetime, he sought to hoard his martial knowledge so that it might never be used against him by a mortal foe. Now, after death, he regrets this parsimony, and seeks above all to pass on his skills to those who are worthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catch, of course, is that the ghost believes that only he can determine who is (or is not) worthy &amp;ndash; and, of course, his methods for doing this are deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
