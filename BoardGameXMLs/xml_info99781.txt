			<description>Place fish, coins and the treasure chest in the barrel. Assemble the two halves of each fishing pole. Choose a player to go first. Players take turns fishing. The player who catches the treasure chest wins. You can also play in challenge mode where players fish at the same time. The player that catches the most objects wins! And in Advanced game mode, players fish at the same time. Fish are worth 1 point each, coins are worth 3 points, and the treasure chest is worth 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is non magnetic, the worm tips dangling from the poles each have velcro, and all fish, coins and treasure are made with strips of velcro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
