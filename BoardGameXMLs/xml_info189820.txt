			<description>The active player gets a strip, where he writes down one of the pre-given words or alternately presenting an own word. Then he pushes the strip into the plate and covers it. The other players open one after the other a slider, which hide each a character. Who thinks he knows the word calls it. It is controlled. If guessed correctly, the player gets one point for each slide still closed. If he guessed wrong, the number of enclosed slides his Points are reduced. After an agreed number of rounds the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
