			<description>PICK YOUR PERFECT F.A. PREMIER LEAGUE DREAM TEAM!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoot Out gives you the chance to manage your very own team of F.A. Premier League Stars.  Your decisions as manager will make the difference between winning and losing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--From Rules Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Shoot Out is to select a team of footballers whose values out-score your opponent's.  Players secretly select 3 lines of players (Goalkeeper + Defenders/Midfielders/Strikers), each with a value of 1 to 4.  The total of each line is calculated, with bonuses given to players of the same team sharing the same line, special abilities, or simply playing in their proper position.  Strikers totals are compared to opposing Defenders totals, and Midfielders are compared to one another.  The side that wins 2 out of the 3 point comparisons is the winner.  This game is collectible, with player cards available in booster packs.  Single cards are available for purchase from the game manufacturer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A version of this game, featuring the Dutch Eredivisie (titled All Stars), also exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
