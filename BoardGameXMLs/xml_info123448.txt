							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One Day International</name>
									
			<description>Statistical cricket game with over 120 players rated in areas like batting, bowling and fielding. When this was designed, One Day International matches would last for 50 overs to be bowled by both sides. There is a certain hit and hope element when compared to full Test Matches. In 50 overs you don't have time to build an innings. So a player's One Day rating will be very different to a player's Test Match rating. This designer designed games for both codes of cricket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is straightforward. A player metaphorically bowls a ball which has to be checked with dice against his rating, to see the outcome. Then a batsman rolls dice, against his batting ability, to see if he has hit it. Chances of 'Outs' could be decided by a briiliant delivery, or a mis-timed hit or a fantastic bit of fielding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
