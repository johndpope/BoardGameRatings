							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">THE ROAD TO BERLIN: The Last Act in the East</name>
									
			<description>Work continues on this long-awaited design by Joseph Youst. The current development team is moving to polish this operational simulation of the most intense four months of combat in the history of War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;German Army Groups keep supplies and the Luftwaffe's air power moving to support their subordinate armies holding the threatened bulwark in the East. Soviet Fronts keep supplies and the Red Falcons flooding west with the armies heading toward the target of Stalin's vengeance: BERLIN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE ROAD TO BERLIN: The Last Act in the East contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;three Joseph Youst maps - one 22 x 34 inches, one 22 x 42 inches, one 34 x 44 inches - covering Europe from Courland to Hungary, and from the western border of the Soviet Union to central Germany&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1500+ 1/2 inch die-cut back printed counters showing the military forces that took part - Axis divisions plus separate brigades, regiments, and companies - and Soviet corps and their supporting divisions, brigades and regiment forces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VISTULA '45: Germany's Last Offensive - This introductory scenario combines all of the combat interactions in this system in the struggle for the town of Stargard, where the German Army expended its utmost efforts to hold back the enemy. Historically, this fight caused considerable concern in the Kremlin and allowed thousands of civilians to escape to the west. [Note: VISTULA '45: will also be available separately in Folio format.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included: charts, rules, dice, boxed (box was ordered in 1994!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
