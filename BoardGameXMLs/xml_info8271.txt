							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El juego de los animales</name>
									
			<description>This is a trivia game about animals: players have to cover continents with tokens, and can do that if they  correctly answer questions about animals of that region. Wrong answers bring tokens to a zoo, where they have to be kept until other questions are correctly answered.&lt;br/&gt;The movement on the board can be done in several directions and allows players to choose which action they can take in the turn.&lt;br/&gt;Sarpe is a publisher from Barcelona. The game has been divided into several issues, sold weekly in the Spanish newspaper kiosks together with a collection of information cards about animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
