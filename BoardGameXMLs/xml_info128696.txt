			<description>A mathematical card game. The cards feature somewhere interesting in Sunderland, which is in the northeast of England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a number between 0 and 9, except for the Double cards. Each player gets 6 cards and must look to see if a pair can be formed. A pair is made up of two numbers that, when multiplied together, make a total that is also on one of the two cards. For instance, you play a 5 and an 8 which makes 40. Thus the number 40 must also be on one of the two cards played. If successful, a pair is formed and can be laid face-up in front of the player. The first player to lay three pairs (6 cards) wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a round is one, the other players add up the value of the cards in their hand and that is their score. After 12 rounds, the lowest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special rules for the Double Cards which you need to play because if you are caught with them in your hand when a player goes out, you get a nasty negative score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an expanded game (but more subtle and a better design of the cards) that first appeared as Multitu in the 1960's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
