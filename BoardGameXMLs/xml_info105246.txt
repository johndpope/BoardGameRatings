							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cytron Masters</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the far-flung future, small armies of Cytrons - Cybernetic Electronic Devices - have replaced large-scale warfare by sentient beings as the instrument for settling planetary disputes.  Each army consists of laser-blasting shooter units, kamikaze-like mine cytrons, and guided missiles.  For defense, there are mobile bunker cytrons and anti-missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To command these deadly but mindless machines is a military genius who has earned the revered title of...CYTRON MASTER!  When you insert the enclosed disc, you begin your difficult but exciting apprenticeship to join the ranks of these rare men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At your disposal are energy centers with which to build the different types of cytrons.  You must effectively deploy your units to destroy your opponent's forces, to capture his energy centers and augment your power.  Your ultimate goal is to destroy the enemy's command center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is packed with fast-paced action, animation, and sound effects.  In fact, it is so fast that three speed levels had to be incorporated to give you a chance to learn the game!  Both two-player and solitaire (against-the-computer) scenarios are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Dan Bunten&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
