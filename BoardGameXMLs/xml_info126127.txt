			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;Everything you wanted to know about wine but never dared to ask.&amp;quot; A route through the wine country full of traps and surprises. Through the challenges you will be faced with over a 1000 different questions about wine, easy,  hard and unexpected. The trip will take you through history, France and the rest of the word. It will call upon your ingenuity, logic and general knowledge making it a fun game for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple roll the dice and answer the question at its basis. There are three colors of questions: mauve (a bunch of grapes) concerning general questions about wine, pink (the letter H) covering a historical question and blue (globe) which is a geography related question. Every correct answer gets you a 'Bravo' card of the relevant color, three of which in turn allow you to enter one of the guilds: Guild of Knights and Epicurians, Commanders of Diogenes and Rabelais and lastly the Globe-Trotter wine tasters. Unless you are a member of all three guilds you cannot win the game, apart from the question boxes there are a few others such as: champagne cork - which acts like a snake and ladders box, Jokers - which allow you to be awarded a right answer even if you don't know it and a few others with specific instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is also available in English, German and French apart from the Dutch version. It won a prize in 1992 at the Brussels Eureka meet. Outsiders rate this game as very hard and requiring expert wine knowledge. It is in this sense a totally different game than Connaisseur whose name it resembles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
