			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survive the Night is a 1-6 player boardgame where the group must use crafting, combat, and strategy to survive the onslaught of either werewolves, vampires, or zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story cards are introduced at the beginning of the game which allow for multiple decisions and outcomes that change gameplay and sometimes the end goal. Some story cards provide variation in groups creating teams allowing for one individual to be a traitor or just add plot depending on player's decisions.&lt;br/&gt; There are two main locations presented through separate boards where players can search item cards, pool resources and work together to survive. A timer is set designating when The monsters will arrive. Once that is complete more traditional game rounds commence as each player and monster take turns with various actions available to each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crafting is available in the form of barricades and health packs. Weapons are found through searching with the more High value ones requiring multiple parts to assemble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
