							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Village of Hommlet (DM Reward Program Adventure)</name>
									
			<description>In The Village of Hommlet,the player characters are introduced to the denizens of a farm village at the edge of the wilderness. There, they learn of bandits troubling the locals and head to a nearby ruined moat house to investigate. At the moat house, the adventurers discover that a band of brigands is the least of the village's worries. An evil priest is assembling a small army of monsters to help restore the foul glory of the infamous Temple of Elemental Evil! The Village of Hommlet is designed to take 4th-level characters to 5th level. It includes details on the village itself (an excellent home base for the characters in your campaign), as well as a nearby ruined castle and dungeon. Based on the classic adventure of the same name published nearly 30 years ago, this version updates the material for the 4th Edition Dungeons and Dragons while retaining key characters and plot elements of the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
