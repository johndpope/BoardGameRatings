							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crisis: The New Economy</name>
									
			<description>A 15-card expansion for Crisis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the Crisis and an inefficient, bureaucratic government, Axia is still a place where small pockets of commercial innovation persist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local entrepreneurs are developing new technologies, while others find ways to benefit society and the environment. Many of those can be lucrative new opportunities for the right investor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Crisis: The New Economy these new opportunities are represented by 15 new Company cards. These are shuffled together and 5-8 of them are randomly chosen. Their equivalent replacements are then removed from the game, and Setup proceeds as in the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Companies add more variability and replayability. They offer new avenues to money and VP as well as resources. The expansion also includes a variant for players that want a game with quicker access to the 5th Manager token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
