			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if the world died yesterday? &lt;br/&gt;What if the world died yesterday and was completely reborn? &lt;br/&gt;What if the world died yesterday and was completely reborn and you were the only one who noticed? &lt;br/&gt;And what if you could pull skills and abilities and even powers from the old world and use them in this new world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flux is the first &amp;quot;little game&amp;quot; from The Big Book of Little Games. It is a &amp;quot;meta-rpg&amp;quot; that gives you the tools to Flux between RPG worlds and retain your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy to Science Fiction. &lt;br/&gt;Science Fiction to Pulp Adventure. &lt;br/&gt;Pulp Adventure to Gothic Horror. &lt;br/&gt;Gothic Horror back to Fantasy.&lt;br/&gt; It is all possible with The Flux. &lt;br/&gt;But be warned. The world may notice you cheating the system. And if it does, it will do its best to get rid of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for The Flux. &lt;br/&gt;It's later than you think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
