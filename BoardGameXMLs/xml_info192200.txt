							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy of Thunder</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A legacy of thunder! For centuries, the eldest child in each generation of the Torsen family have been gifted with superhuman strength and command over lightning. The most recent recipients of the birthright, though, are twins! Dedicated to living up to their fallen father's example, Rumble uses her great strength and thunderous punches to take down the bad guys. Her brother, Wildstrike, lets loose on villainy with multiple, barely controlled lightning bolts that fill the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is Thunderstrike, their father, as he was in his prime from 20 years ago. A famous hero backed by the government, he was a physical powerhouse with mastery of the weather. Still remembered today as the hero who gave his life to stop the doomsday weapons of the Steel Snake!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
