							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">F-Zero: Climax</name>
									
			<description>F-Zero: Climax is a futuristic racing video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance handheld. It was released exclusively in Japan on October 21, 2004. Like its handheld predecessor, F-Zero GP Legend, Climax was both published and developed by Nintendo, with assistance from Suzak. Climax is the sixth and last installment in the F-Zero series, and the third to be released for the Game Boy Advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F-Zero Climax plays very similar to its predecessor F-Zero: GP Legend, using much of the same controls with a few tweaks. Minor differences include machine statistic changes, softer physics on collisions with walls and button mappings. Boosting is now performed with one button rather than the shoulder buttons, drifting no longer leans the actual machine, and the spin attack was addded from the 3D F-Zero installments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard boost was modified and can now be used anytime after completing the first lap, like F-Zero GX, and was also given a boostfire option that is assigned to the player every time they complete a lap. Boostfire enables the player to both attack enemy players and accelerate slightly faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains a a built-in track editor, without the need for an expansion or add-on. Custom tracks can be saved to one of thirty slots for future use and they can be exchanged with other players via link cable. If memory becomes full or link cable connection cannot be done, the game can generate a password for the track; when it is input on any cartridge, the password will generate the track instantly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F-Zero: Climax&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
