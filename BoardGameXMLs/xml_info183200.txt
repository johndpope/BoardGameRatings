							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aggressivität Partnerschaft-Spielserie</name>
									
			<description>With this game the player's reaction on aggressive utterance of the other players is rated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 player gives the instruction and makes the Rating (-3 to 3 points for each reaction)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 20 of the 120 cards. On a player's turn, another player chooses 1 of his cards and attacks the active player with the aggressive sentence on the Card. The player has to react in 5 seconds. The more positive he reacts (open for further discussions) the more Points he will get from the moderator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the highest positive sum of points after 20 rounds, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Although a player count of 8 and a card count of 120 doesn't seem to make sense (8 people would need 160 cards), the player range of 4-8 is given in the rules. No rule change for 7-8 players seems to have been provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
