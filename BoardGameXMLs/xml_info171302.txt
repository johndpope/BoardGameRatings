			<description>This is a logic game created by Martin Nedergaard Andersen. Each player becomes a choreographer of one of the Princesses. He gets a dance board which he has to fill with tiles of five different colors. The tiles have different length and shape so each player has to think fast and grab the tiles that he needs before his opponents take them. The first player to fill his board gets 5 points but beware of mistakes! If you used a tile that you were not allowed to or a tile was wrongly placed the player receives penalty points. Additional points are scored for unfilled hexes on opponents boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score 25 points is declared the best choreographer and wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
