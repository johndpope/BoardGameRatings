			<description>It's a Fair Game allows Iowa State Fair fans the chance to visit the Fair at any time of year and re-live the fun of trekking their way across the Fairgrounds. Using custom pewter tokens, players participate in one of twelve different Fair professions. As players make their way around the Fairgrounds, they can increase (or decrease) their worth by buying food or merchandise, winning contests and collecting money from ATMs. Strategy cards add interaction between players as opposing parties are forced to pay expenses or share winnings. The player with the highest value when they retire for the night in the campgrounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced and sold exclusively by the Iowa State Fair Blue Ribbon Foundation, the proceeds contribute to ongoing efforts to renovate and preserve our historic Iowa State Fairgrounds. The game allows Fair lovers to help support renovations while enjoying the Fair year-round with family and friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
