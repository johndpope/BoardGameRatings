							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rod of Lordly Might</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rod of lordly might is one of the most versatile and powerful magical items in any sort common circulation across not just this plane of existence but the entire multiverse. This magical item is loosely based on the powers of the Rod of Kings and the Rod of Might, two powerful magical artifacts that were forged during the wars between the ordered devils and the freedom loving angels. Recently a very vague history was put together based upon a tattered book that is believed to have been a traveling journal of the rod's actual inventor. This battered and beaten old book, written in a trembling hand is incomplete, but contains a beautifully rendered story detailing the battle of the gates during the height of the war between the upper and lower planes. Though it cannot be verified, this source does seem to hold the most believable answers to the question of the creator of the original rod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Creator Of The Rod of Lordly Might&lt;br/&gt;     History Of The Rod of Lordly Might&lt;br/&gt;     New Minor Artifact: Rod of Kings And Rod of Strength&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
