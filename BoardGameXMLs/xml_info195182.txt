			<description>In the game of Fantasy Stables you're trying to make it in the horse business.  Your friends will now be your rivals as you compete to see who will end up on top. The object of the game is to collect the most money in cash, horse value and bonuses. Bonuses are awarded for collecting certain groups of horses. They add another level of strategy to the game. Game play is very easy and intuitive for horse people but no horse knowledge is needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone begins the game with money and horses to start the fun right away. There are several suggested winning scenarios for you to choose from for one hour of play to days of fun. All the turns are cooperative but competitive to keep things lively!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect and show horse cards featuring fabulous pictures of real horses in 8 equestrian sports (Dressage, Driving, Trail, Western Pleasure, Western Performance, Racing, Cross Country and Hunter Jumper).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add horses to your stable at public auctions where everyone can bid. Bid as high as you dare &amp;ndash; you know the range but the horse&amp;rsquo;s actual value is kept a secret until the winning bid has been paid!&lt;br/&gt;Everyone can enter the shows and choosing the right horse will give you an advantage but anyone could steal the win if luck is on their side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are random and yearly horse expenses to watch out for so manage your salary and show winnings well. All the players get a real-life horse job (vet, farrier, trainer etc.) who are paid the expenses to keep those interactive too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horses are unpredictable so you never know what will be around the corner &amp;ndash; wins or losses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
