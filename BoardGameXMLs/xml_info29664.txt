							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New Games Book</name>
									
			<description>This book, released in 1976, includes rules for more than 80 non-traditional games, many of the cooperative ilk.  It is an outgrowth of a yearly New Games festival which took place for awhile in the early 1970s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the book looks quite dated (seeing the cover, font, and artwork brings to mind the word &amp;quot;peacenik&amp;quot;), it is still quite useful for impromptu games with any number of participants.  The book is divided into three segments: games for two, games for a dozen, and games for two dozen (or more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interspersed within the game descriptions are some interesting articles about the &amp;quot;New Games Movement.&amp;quot;  A follow-up book, &amp;quot;More New Games&amp;quot;, was released in 1981 and the current director of New Games released &amp;quot;Best New Games&amp;quot; in 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
