			<description>&amp;quot;FIFA 06, also known as FIFA Soccer 06 and FIFA Football 06, is a video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts based around the game of football. It was released in the United States on 4 October 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Windows, PlayStation Portable, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS. It was later released for mobile phones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was the last FIFA edition to be released exclusively on six generation consoles. The taglines for the game were &amp;quot;You play. They obey.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The total soccer experience.&amp;quot; It also marks the first time the PlayStation has been excluded from the FIFA lineup since FIFA Soccer 95 (released only for Mega Drive).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIFA 06 was the thirteenth game in the FIFA series and the tenth in 3D. It is currently the highest selling game of the FIFA series, ahead of its predecessor FIFA 2005 by over 100,000 copies. In total, FIFA 06 has sold more than 3.6 million copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ronaldinho and Wayne Rooney graced the cover of the game in the European market. Freddy Adu, Ronaldinho, and Omar Bravo were on the North American cover while Ronaldinho and Wayne Rooney were on the Australian, Brazilian, and United Kingdom covers. Lukas Podolski was partnered with Ronaldinho on the German edition of the game. Park Chu-Young was on the only South Korea cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andy Gray and Clive Tyldesley provide commentary for the game's English version.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;FIFA 06,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
