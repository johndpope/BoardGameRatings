			<description>&amp;quot;Line Out&amp;quot; is a replay simulation of Rugby Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams are rated for Attack and Defence plus their ability in set scrums, rucks, loose mauls and line outs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game recreates the 'highlights' [potentially dangerous attacks] of a match based on the attach / defence ratings of the teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When either team's Attack number is rolled a simple procedure establishes how the attack started, which player has possession and where exactly on the field of play the attack is centered as you join the action. From then on dice rolls on one or other of the various Charts plot the outcome of the attack until it either breaks down or points are scored. Most of the actions are taken from the Action Chart which is  common to both teams, but approximately one in six are taken from the Team's own Team Card, helping recreate that team's particular style of play, strengths and weaknesses. Other 'actions' are  dependent on individual Player Ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A marker is moved on the Field of Play to chart the  development of the attack, another marker on the Team Card shows who has possession, and a third is used on the Time Clock to keep track of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Cards use named players and substitutes, with individual Player Ratings to produce accurate results and scorers.  Teams from many seasons and competitions available, allowing for some great &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; matchups, as well as full season replays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
