			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pack your bags; it&amp;rsquo;s time for a road trip! The party will travel to the land of Ardula, a vast desert nation, a land of wonders unique among the world. Sultana Ru&amp;rsquo;yah, ruler of Ardula, wishes to begin negotiations between Brattleburg and Ardula to secure commerce. The players are hired to protect  Ambassador Grimmfang; a Brattleburg hero that&amp;rsquo;s being put out to pasture. Some say he was born on the battlefield by a warrior woman and so he feels at home on the battlefield and if he had his way he&amp;rsquo;d die there. With Griffons, an angry Djinni, and a city that never stays put, his latest adventure may actually be his last! Can the heroes save the princess, save the city, and earn the respects of a cranky old soilder?  Find out in Hard Times in a City of Glass!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Episode 32 - Desert of Deceit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: For the romantics we all are, and with everyone excited about Presidents Day, we take you to the desert. As we slowly run out of water looking for this stupid moving city, the Gagmen are poised to destroy one another in this episode. Enjoy a heavy drama set in the desert, with griffins and &amp;quot;sand-sniffers&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
