			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega-Apocalypse is a 1987 Commodore 64 game written by Simon Nicol and published by Martech, and is the sequel to &amp;quot;Crazy Comets&amp;quot;. It plays very much the same, but it features for 2 players simultaneous play and improved code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Crazy Comets, is is a 2D shooting game, simulating a 3D perspective, with a starry sky in the background where starts appear from the middle of the screen, slowly travelling towards the screens edges, creating an illusion of going into the screen. Enemies (planets) first appear as small dots slowly growing larger, and the goal is to shoot all planets down. Once a planet has come close to the screen, it becomes a real nuisance, since it will withstand a large number of hits and will also home in on the spacecraft the player is controlling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Crazy Comets, Mega Apocalypse allows for players to adjust how their ships are pointing. By holding down the fire button, players can point their ships in any direction, and it will retain that direction even when the button is released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The C64 edition featured music by Rob Hubbard, mostly a remake of the original tune from Crazy Comets. The game was subsequently ported to the Amstrad and the ZX Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Simon Nicol: creator (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Rob Hubbard: music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
