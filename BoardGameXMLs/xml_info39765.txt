			<description>BILLY WHISKERS    Spin and move game from 1925 or 1926. The box says it's a 'fascinating game' It seems to be in the ilk of a Sorry or Parchisi game but so far we have no instructions on the gameplay. Thanks to muzikguy for the limited info about the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;Edit August 2012 - instructions as per rules online:&lt;br/&gt;Each corner or the game board is marked - Bill, Button, Nannie or Stubbie. There is a double-armed spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects two men of the same colour and places them in the corner to his right on the board. The aim is to get both men into the centre of the board first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with lowest sum total on the spinner starts the game.  Each player must spin a 5 on one arm of the spinner or a total of five to move. Double five means he can move both men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A man moves out on a five then forward as many spaces as shown on the other arm of the spinner. Once out the man is moved according to the numbers on one or both arms of the spinner. Certain spaces on the board allow a player to split the total of his spinner count. Exact count on both arms of the spinner is required to bring a man home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on an opponent means he is &amp;quot;butted off&amp;quot; and has to start again, while the &amp;quot;butt-er&amp;quot; man moves forward 20 spaces. Like Ludo, if a player manages to get both men on the same space it is called a Block and no other player can pass. There are penalty spaces on the board (miss a turn, go back). Spinning a double allows a second turn. Three consecutive doubles sends the man closest to the centre of the board home again, and there are a few other rules to apply during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
