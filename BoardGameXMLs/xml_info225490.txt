			<description>In Korocchi!, you try to find the correct card that is determined by two (or three) unique dice, and whoever touches the correct card first score points. Each of the two dice in the basic game has two pieces of information:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Color die: Shows you the outside color and inside color.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Shape die: Shows you the outside shape and the inside shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three different creatures (cat, bat and obake) are depicted on the cards, with these creatures appearing in three colors. Each card depicts one large creature in one color holding a tiny creature in another color. By pairing the two dice, you know precisely which one card to touch from all those face up on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For an additional challenge, you can roll the third die as well. The faces on this die might just show that you play as normal scoring one or two points, or it might show the shapes or colors being reversed &amp;mdash; which means you need to look for the opposite card (sort of) instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
