			<description>Meets &amp;amp; Bounds is intended as a fast-playing game which has players attempting to optimize their score while managing the uncertainty of what opportunities chance will offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 2&amp;ndash;5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: In Meets &amp;amp; Bounds players vie to control as many spaces as possible. Each player will attempt to establish a sector of his own while thwarting his opponent's efforts. Each player will be rewarded for the size of his sector, as well as the number of groups and bounded disks he can contain within his sector. Some players may even form more than one sector. The player with the most victory points will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Board&lt;br/&gt;All cards&lt;br/&gt;5-10 disks per player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 players use 10 disks per player.&lt;br/&gt;For 3 players use 7 disks per player.&lt;br/&gt;For 4 players use 6 disks per player.&lt;br/&gt;For 5 players use 5 disks per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn victory points for holding sectors. A sector is a range of numbered spaces with no disks of an opponent within, and bounded by 2 of the player&amp;rsquo;s disks. Players also score victory points for friendly disks within their sectors. Finally, players score points for groups of 2 or more of their own playing pieces in contiguous spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most victory points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;Sectors: Score 1 point for each numbered space of the range. A range is always the largest possible area bounded by the pieces of a single color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bounded Pieces: Score 1 point for each interior disk within a sector. Bounded pieces never define a range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups of 2: 1 point per piece. The two pieces must be contiguous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups of 3 or more: 2 points per piece. Groups must be contiguous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring Example: White has pieces in 6 night, 7 day, 9 day, 12 day, 13 night. There are no pieces belonging to opponents in any spaces between 6-13. White will score 8 points for their sector. White will score 3 points for Bounded Pieces (7, 9, 12). White will score 2 points for the group of two pieces that are contiguous (12 day &amp;amp; 13 night). Note that 6 night and 7 day are not contiguous, and therefore do not score as a group. White scores a total of 13 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
