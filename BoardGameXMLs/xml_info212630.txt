			<description>This expension includes This pack contains 2 models, 2 character sheets (English on one side, French on the other), two Overlord tiles (non-lingual).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Valeria&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of Valeria will still be adept at close quarter combat, however, she will be a more lightly equipped incarnation, faster and more dexterous, with other uses than just combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Taramis/Salome&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, we have Taramis, the queen of Khauran. She eschews personal combat almost entirely but she brings her personal bodyguards to the table as well as being a great boon to her allies.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;But that's not all! Taramis's evil sister, Salome is also playable with this pack as an Overlord minion. They are in fact twins and it is almost impossible to tell one from another, something that Conan discovers to his peril in the tale A Witch Shall Be Born.&lt;br/&gt;Salome is a sorceress of great power and she is able to draw upon the being known as Thaug (a HUUGE creature) to crush her enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
