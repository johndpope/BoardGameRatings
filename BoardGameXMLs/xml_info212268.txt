			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just because you're not out saving the world doesn't mean your life is boring or easy.  Civilians, even supernatural ones, have their own struggles to deal with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This weekend is the big Steel Knights tournament. You've got to settle on your army list, 3D print the minis and paint them. Maybe some judicious use of telepathy will give you insight on the other teams?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You had to fire someone at the store and all his friends quit the same day.  You have to rebuild the staff and corporate is watching. Wouldn't it be just the wrong time to be called away because your kid showed off at school and people freaked out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An off-hand comment about Lovecraft causes a friend to suddenly become angry.   When you try to remind her that it's silly to get upset over sci-fi nonsense she pulls down her shirt collar to show you her gills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want to play a pure slice-of-life campaign or simply want to add some flavor to the civilians your heroic characters deal with, this book provides useful information. &lt;br/&gt;Included within:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A brief history of The Community and a summary of some of its practices.  &lt;br/&gt;    A discussion on the lives of civilian Gods and Demons. &lt;br/&gt;    Samples of pop culture in the Divine Blood universe ranging from Precious Puppies to cosmetic gene mods. &lt;br/&gt;    Gameplay advice on how to focus on making mundane issues into entertainingly absurd situations and obstacles. &lt;br/&gt;    Several new sample Advantages and four new playable species suggested by backers and players of the game. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
