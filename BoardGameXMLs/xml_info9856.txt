			<description>Object: to be the first team to collect three different colored rings. Teams move around the board on rolls of the die, competing in three sub-games--Clich&amp;eacute; Cafe, Three Perfect Words, and Calling All Players (more on these below). An additional roll is earned each time a team succeeds before time runs out. A team collects a ring by winning a sub-game while on a ring-marked space.&lt;br/&gt;Clich&amp;eacute; Cafe - try to get your teammates to guess the well-known clich&amp;eacute; using only sound effects and pantomime.&lt;br/&gt;Three Perfect Words - Get your teammates to guess the one word answer by giving a single spoken clue of up to three words in length (one clue, one guess).&lt;br/&gt;Calling All Players - All players from all teams list as many answers on a given subject category (i.e. bad habits, things women look for in a man, synonyms for the word vomit) as possible in 45 seconds. When time's up, each team earns a point for each answer all members of that team have in common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
