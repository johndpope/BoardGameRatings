							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">System Vector:  Breakdown of Mass</name>
									
			<description>The Breakdown of Mass is the next installment for System Vector, which is becoming a favorite game of mine in general. &lt;br/&gt;The expansion does not focus much on a large amount of new units or system cards. Instead, it adds more depth to the game it's self by adding more elements to game play and strategy. The expansion includes 6 new high-resource system cards, a Black Hole system, and an Unknown system. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to these, the game also features a new building aspect, where you can build structures such as factories, science institutes, and mobile shipyards. Each of these structures improves different aspects of your empire, making the games focus wider and your empire larger. With these buildings also come the chance to research and develop new technology and advancements in your empire. There will be a military technology tier, and an economical technology tier. These tiers will have 2 options per level of advancement. This will give players 4 Research Management Cards and 48 Research counters (12 for each player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That makes 13 new cards to print out, which at 25 cents a print, comes to $3.25.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 System cards (including the Black Hole and Unknown System)&lt;br/&gt;4 Research Management cards&lt;br/&gt;1 Research Counters sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am really excited to be getting another System Vector game off the ground. I am lucky to be able to pop things like this out within a couple of days, while still being able to test play Armed Legion AND learn/play RftG. fun fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
