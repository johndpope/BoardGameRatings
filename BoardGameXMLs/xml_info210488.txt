			<description>The &amp;quot;Wissensquiz [Cityname]&amp;quot; series contains Trivial Pursuit-style cards with questions and multiple choice answers. The topic of all questions is directly related to the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each player, a card is drawn and the question asked. The player has 30 seconds to choose the correct answer. If the answer is correct, the player keeps the card. The game ends when there are no more cards to draw. Whoever holds the most cards by then wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an alternate game mode, points are scored for each correct answer. The first correct answer scores 1 point and allows the current player to draw another card. If that card is answered correctly, too, 2 points are scored and another card is drawn. That one will yield 3 points for a correct answer, and another card is drawn until the answer is wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
