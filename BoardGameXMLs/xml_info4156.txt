			<description>This is a Monopoly clone.  Instead of properties, players collect &amp;quot;preserves&amp;quot; to save animals.  Instead of houses and hotels, players buy environmental programs like a hunting ban or pollution control.  Chance and Community Chest cards are replaced by a single &amp;quot;action card&amp;quot; deck.  The mechanics of the games are the same, however: roll and move, if you land on someone else's preserve, pay them money.  If they have one or more programs on that preserve, pay them even more.  One difference is how the game ends: it can end either like Monopoly (last player left after everyone else goes bankrupt wins) or a player can collect five of the species for a particular geographical area (color) in which case they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;ENDANGERED SPECIES is a game the entire family will enjoy.  It introduces players to the largest animal that ever lived, the fastest four-legged animal in the world, a huge bird of prey with a ten-foot wingspan, the most powerful ape, the fiercest carnivore in the Americas, and many other fascinating creatures now facing extinction.  Player try to &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; these animals by setting up &amp;ldquo;Preserves&amp;rdquo; to protect their natural habitats, and then establishing programs to protect them from hunting, capture for zoos, chemical pollution, and commercial exploitation.  To win, a player must save five species from one geographic area.  Unexpected gains and setbacks make the game unpredictable, and &amp;ldquo;action cards&amp;rdquo; held by each player permit a wide variety of strategic moves and counter moves.  No two games are ever the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
