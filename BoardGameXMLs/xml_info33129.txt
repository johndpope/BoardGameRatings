			<description>CSz! is a card game based on ComedySportz (the interactive improvised comedy show franchise).  Each player represents a team of ComedySportz performers (Actletes), each one with their own strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into the same rounds performed at ComedySportz shows.  Players try to earn modifier points by having their Actletes make funny offers during improv games.  Offers can be good or bad, and they can be played by either player on a given Actlete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round, players roll to see who the audience votes for, modifying their die rolls with the points they have accumulated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to recreate the experience involved in putting on a ComedySportz show (not necessarily the experience of a show itself).  Actlete cards are based on real performers from various ComedySportz cities around the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Actlete has 5 attributes, and 11 points to divide up among the attributes (they must be between 1 and 3).  Veteran Actletes get an additional point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
