			<description>Every one at some point or another has a little dispute with their partner, but few people feel the need to patch up their differences by duelling it across every room of the house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a professional warrior has it perks but also its drawbacks.  You may be the strongest around but you cannot handle losing even to your beloved one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So beat them down and make them cry for mercy, then you can gloat and enjoy life, whilst they have to clean the house and pamper to your needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burning Passion is a game for two players using a standard deck of cards and two simple character sheets.  Each player has one character sheet and a selection of cards.  Players simultaneously play cards into different rooms of the house trying to win the battle in each of the five rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every victory the player gains in a room they score one point.  The first to ten points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
