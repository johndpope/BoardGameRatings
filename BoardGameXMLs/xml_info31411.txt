			<description>Sanamania (Word Mania) is a game where players draft cards that have four kinds of tasks related to words (association, forming compound nouns, listing words that have certain syllable in them, listing certain things such as tall buildings). When a card is picked each player writes on his/her notesheet as many words as possible (that fit the rules of the task, of course). An hourglass measures how much time they have. When time is up, players reveal their answers and get a point for every answer that is not on any other players sheet. The winner is simply the one with most points in the game end (when the cards on the board run out).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with the new version of A to Z; both are word games from the same publisher, but the mechanics are quite different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very similar to Ord Mani; these may be just different editions of the same game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
