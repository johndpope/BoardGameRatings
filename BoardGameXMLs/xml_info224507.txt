			<description>Each player has nine pawns. Movement is determined by a die and is permitted in all directions. The players begin at the nine starting spaces at their side of the game board. The first player to get his nine pawns to the starting spaces of his opponent wins the game. It is not permitted to jump over opposing pawns. So, the players are able to block each others movement by placing pawns in the path of their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
