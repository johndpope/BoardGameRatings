							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mob Rule</name>
									
			<description>Mob Rule is a card game of strategy and resource management. The object of the game is to take control of the city by means of assassination or economic sabotage. There are many different paths toward achieving this goal, so look carefully at all of your options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to obtain as many assets as you can and wipe out all the other gangs in town. The assets that are available to you are hitmen, dealers, muscle, and businesses. Be ruthless on your way to the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HITMEN are used to take out the other assets in the game, as well as enemy bosses. Their fees can be steep, but this is the mark of an expert assassin. Used wisely, hitmen will quickly take the title of your most useful asset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEALERS are an easy way to make money in this city. Everyone needs something, and these shady assets are there to supply it to them for a nominal fee. Owning dealers will make you money each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MUSCLE are your strong men, used in a variety of situations. They are your personal bodyguards and can be sent out to any assets you deem in need of some protection. They can also hassle businesses into giving up protection fees, making them invaluable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUSINESSES are the most legitimate, and therefore least cost efficient, way of making money. Businesses are in general the most expensive assets in the game, but they are especially helpful because they cannot be targeted by hitmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the resources at your disposal. If you can use them correctly nothing will stand in your way. But always be on your guard; you're not the only one willing to do what it takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get some friends together and become enemies. Or get some enemies together and become friends. This is a party game full of deceit, betrayel, and the most nefarious of schemes. Fight over territory and businesses, buy out your enemy's assets, and dishonor truces at that pivotal turning point to take all the glory in that final stretch. Let nothing stand between you and total rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
