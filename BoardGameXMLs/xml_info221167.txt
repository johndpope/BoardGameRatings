							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Test of Honour: The Samurai Miniatures Game â€“ Mounted Samurai</name>
									
			<description>Following the murder of her husband, the widow Takeda Naoko dons the armour of a samurai and rides out to seek vengeance, all the while clinging desperately to the path of honour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for cavalry in the game are very simple (presented on the recruitment cards in this set), but adding even just one or two to your force changes things dramatically. The extra movement multiplied by 3 actions for your hero means you can get your most powerful model exactly where you need him (or her). And an all cavalry force is very interesting to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The onna bugeisha character (female samurai) comes with skill cards to show her sense of honour, family pride, and a haughty attitude to the low-born, plus a particularly interesting quest where you have to interrogate enemy samurai once they are vanquished to discover a secret. The idea is that she is tracking down her husband&amp;rsquo;s murderer. Could it be the ronin Tadashi?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 unique cards - including The Side of Right and Powerful Charge&lt;br/&gt;    1 metal character model - Onna Bugeisha Takeda Naoko&lt;br/&gt;    5 plastic mounted figures&lt;br/&gt;    5 metal 'neat bare' heads&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
