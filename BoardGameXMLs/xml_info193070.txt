			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mal Fisher, the Captain of the light freighter Bella LeGosi, claims to know the whereabouts of The Lady of Esparto, an ancient lost ship carrying treasure worth millions, and he is looking to hire a salvage crew. He wants to keep everything off the books as he is operating without the required paperwork. He has chosen not to apply for a salvage license for fear that a treasure as great as the Lady of Esparto will attract too much unwanted attention, increasing the likelihood of claim jumpers, pirates, and crooked authorities looking for an easy buck. He is offering a substantial amount of money and a percentage of the treasure for the completion of the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heart of Darkness is an adventure framework. This adventure is written differently than most RPG adventures.  The traditional map has been replaced with locations and connections only. Removing the &amp;ldquo;empty space&amp;rdquo; areas, the countless rooms, and places that may contain nothing of interest to the players or the story, it reduces the amount of paper shuffling and allows the Game Master to see at a glance the information needed for each area, encounter, or point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
