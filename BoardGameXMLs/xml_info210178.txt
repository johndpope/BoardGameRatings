			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out with friends for the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But suddenly, a siren blares out of nowhere.&lt;br/&gt;And deep down, you all realize your lives are in danger.&lt;br/&gt;Somehow, deep in the bottom of your souls, you all realize something is out there to kill you.&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive the night?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last January 2015, Matthew Bannock held a game design contest on Google Plus called, &amp;ldquo;Survive the Night.&amp;rdquo; This was my submission to that challenge, and thankfully despite being the only submission, he still felt it was a game he would like to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of the game includes a number of revisions which I have added to make the experience much more fun (and scary) for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider this a TAGsessions early Halloween present. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keywords: Horror, Self-Mutilation, Violence, Occult, Survival Horror, GMless, Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires:&lt;br/&gt;2-5 players &lt;br/&gt;1 standard deck of playing cards, jokers included&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
