							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moral Dawn</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Moral Dawn is a Roleplaying Game about Angels, or at least people who have angelic powers. Whether they are angels, and whether they believe themselves to be angels, is up to the GM and the players. While the setting is up to the players, too, the central idea is that Angels, are, in fact, normal people who just happens to have supernatural powers. They don't know why they have them, they don't know what they're supposed to do with them. But they know what is good and what is bad. Or do they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
