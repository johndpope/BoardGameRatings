							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unspoken</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane master of horror from beyond sanity&amp;hellip; The Unspoken!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 16 Rogue, The Unspoken is a diminutive being of unspeakable power. The Unspoken is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unspoken&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;ldquo;Black&amp;quot; to indicate his mastery of supernatural, eldritch forces. With an alien mindset and lust for chaos, The Unspoken is eager to torment those who would stand in his way. An epic-scale villain who can pose a threat to even the most potent mystics, he crosses into the material world from places beyond to inflict madness and suffering wherever he goes. Mystics in particular know he poses a threat to the fabric of reality, but any hero worth their cape will be driven to stop his reign of terror. But can they discover the secret of his latest invasion of their world before his plans come to their awful conclusion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
