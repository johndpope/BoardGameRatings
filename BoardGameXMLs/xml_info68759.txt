			<description>&amp;quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 (often shortened to WWE SvR 2007 and known as Exciting Pro Wrestling 8: SmackDown! vs. Raw 2007 in Japan), is a professional wrestling video game released by THQ and developed by YUKE's Future Media Creators. The game is based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It is the eighth installment in the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw series and is the successor to 2005's WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 and was succeeded by WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 in 2007. THQ, Yuke's and WWE officially confirmed the game on March 31, 2006. The game was released in November 2006 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 consoles and was released in December 2006 for the PlayStation Portable system. SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 is the first game in the SmackDown vs. Raw series to be released outside the PlayStation consoles. The PlayStation 3 is the first console from Sony that didn't get a release until the following year with WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 that came out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game introduced a few key new features including an analog control system, interactive hotspots, and fighting within the arena crowd. The game also included several improvements on the previous game's existing match types and modes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWE_SmackDown_vs._Raw_2007,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
