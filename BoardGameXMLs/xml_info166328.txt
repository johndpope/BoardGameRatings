							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Family Bingo</name>
									
			<description>The party game Family Bingo requires dexterity, good memory, perceptiveness, and some basic knowledge. Players compete in eight different categories of activities, and the game includes 165 double-sided cards that tell players what to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very important component of the game are 96 colorful wooden sticks in six colors; the game also includes 96 small number tokens and 16 big tokens. At the beginning of the game, each player receives a nice covering stand and personal bingo board. Players try to score a point by completing the task on the drawn card. The first player to do so covers a field on her bingo board with the number drawn at the beginning of the round. The tasks are very different, e.g., building a construction on time or after memorizing it, answering questions, guessing what another player is trying to visualize, guessing the color or number of sticks, throwing, stacking, and many, many more. Whoever creates a bingo first wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
