			<description>Each summer Queen Idriana travels to the the greatest festival in all the land. The Festival is the best opportunity to show your abilities to organize street performers into a festive force that can ignite the senses and imaginations of any audience throughout the realm. Can you capture the attention of the Queen and become the Busker Baron or Baroness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Busker Lord or Lady you must choose from a collection of royal street performers and outperform the other Busker Lords and Ladies who are simultaneously selecting their own performers. The Queen wants to see who can best manage their troop. After drafting your performers, your goal is to keep the most performers in your hand for the final encore. Your best chance is to convince the Festival's watching crowd and the other royal street performers that your troop is the best. If you have the most performers in your hand at the end of the game, you win Queen Indriana&amp;rsquo;s royal contract and become the Busker Baron or the Busker Baroness for the next summer's Festival!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
