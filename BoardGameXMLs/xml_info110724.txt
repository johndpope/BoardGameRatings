			<description>3-Squared is a dice rolling game where players try to score the lowest number of points. The game ends when one player reaches 150 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;The game begins when the first player rolls the 9 3-Squared Dice.  8 of the dice are colored with blue (3 sides), purple (2 sides) and red (1 side).  The 9th die has 3 blue sides with a 10 on it, 2 purple sides with a 20 and 1 red side with 40 printed on it.  The object is to NOT roll all of the sides with the same color and complete the 3-Square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the dice are rolled all players examine the results.  The Score Die is set in the center of the play area and all other dice that are the same color are set along side it.  If all of the other 8 dice are the same color as the Score Die, the player has completed the 3-Square, the round ends and the player who rolled the dice scores the points showing on the Score Die.  If any of the other 8 dice are not the same color, play passes to the next player.  The second player rolls all of the remaining dice that do not match the color of the Score Die and the other dice that were not set aside.  Play continues in this manner until all of the dice match the color of the Score Die and the player who completed the 3-Square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two little tricks however that can alter the gameplay.  The first is the 10th die...called the Event Die, it has six different sides that can change the results of the dice rolls.  One can end the round immediately, even if the 3-Square has not been completed.  One can allow the player who completed the 3-Square to pass the points to a different player, others double, or even triple the points showing on the Score Die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is also given 3 Pass Tokens which they can use to skip their turn rolling the dice, shifting the turn to the next player.  The 3 Tokens are not renewable so players must be careful when using them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3-Squared Dice (10 Total)&lt;br/&gt;     Pass Tokens (18 Total)   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
