			<description>Stinky Donkey (Burro Apestoso) is a fun cards game for 2 &amp;ndash; 6 players, age 6 and up in English and Spanish. Packaged in a convenient pocket size box that you can take to a party, family gathering, camping, or just have fun with your friends and family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective &lt;br/&gt;Get rid of your cards as fast as possible by removing all pairs from your hand with the help of command cards. Avoid the Stinky Donkey card. Once all pairs have been removed from all the players, the player left with the Stinky Donkey card will be marked as a Stinky Donkey (sticker).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components &lt;br/&gt;49 Stinky Donkey cards, 23 Command cards, 120 Stinky Donkey stickers, 1 Rules document. &lt;br/&gt;Setup &lt;br/&gt;Open your box, start by separating stinky donkey cards (animal drawings with stinky donkey logo on the back) and command cards. Shuffle both decks. Place command cards face down in the middle of the table. Pass out all stinky donkey cards evenly to every player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting The Game &lt;br/&gt;Each player must make pairs, remove them from their hand, and set them aside. The player on the right of the dealer goes first by picking a command card from the top of the command card stack and follows the command. &lt;br/&gt;The Second Turn And Beyond &lt;br/&gt;Going counterclockwise, each player must pick a command card and follow its command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning And Losing The Game &lt;br/&gt;Once a player gets rid of all the cards on his/her hand, him/her is now safe from being a stinky donkey. And once all the players get rid of their cards, the player left with the Stinky Donkey card will be marked as a Stinky Donkey with a Stinky Donkey sticker &amp;ldquo;HEE- HAWWH!, HEE- HAWWH!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Instructions &lt;br/&gt;Take the command cards and the Stinky Donkey out and play as a memory game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
