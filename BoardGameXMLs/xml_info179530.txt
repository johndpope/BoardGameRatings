							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Town Center: Beaune / Turku</name>
									
			<description>Beaune/Turku is the newest addition to the Town Center line, which started with Alban Viard's brain-burning, elegant city-building sim game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Beaune is a walled town surrounded by vineyards, there are no suburbs. Also, the &amp;quot;elevator&amp;quot; black cubes must be built in the center. We're guessing that's because in many medieval towns, no building was allowed to be taller than the church, but who knows, the designer works in mysterious ways!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Turku map has two seasons, summer and winter, alternating between odd- and even-numbered turns. During the summer, the two halves are considered separate, and during the winter, when the Aura river freezes, the two parts are considered one city - which allows for some clever play, such as building green cubes &amp;quot;next&amp;quot; to green cubes in the summer, when they are not considered adjacent, only for them to be joined in the winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
