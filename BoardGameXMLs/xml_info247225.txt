			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summoning creatures in your space fantasy campaign means piecing together stat blocks from various templates. With Summoned Creatures, part of Fielo's Guide to Known Space, we've done the work so you don't have to. This PDF includes over 100 stat blocks for summoned creatures, ranging from CR 1/3 to CR 11. Players can have their chosen summons at their fingertips, ready to be cast into combat, while gamemasters can use these as generic foes or have their NPCs call on them as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the creature stat blocks, you'll also find the summon creature spell that lets you call on these allies in battle. This PDF is fully bookmarked and includes layers to toggle page elemnts and illustrations, making it printer friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
