							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Whale Game</name>
									
			<description>Play as migrating Humpback whales attempting to avoid Hazards and accumulate 'survival points' in order to win the game. Choose safer waters or attempt to navigate shorter but riskier waters, grown the size of your Humpback family, and play Bonus cards at the right time to ensure your survival or save them to earn additional points at game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this game is more than about winning where you also learn about these majestic creatures. All Hazard and Bonus cards have carefully researched 'Whale Facts' that help you learn about other life forms and be sensitive to environments beyond what you readily know. There are also opportunities to help other players' whales, such as those that have been beached, which give you additional bonus cards and further the survival of the species as a whole. Whales further ahead in the game can choose to 'wait' and encourage the survival of more whales before returning to their home waters (which immediately ends the game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The environmental group Green Peace has promoted this game and part of the profits go to helping save whales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;The main objective is Whale Survival through the accumulation of points. You roll the die then navigate your whale pod (family) along the paths starting at the Home Waters heading south to warmer waters for the winter, into family waters to find a mate and give birth to young, then head back north again to the Home Waters attempting to end on the same specific location you started from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way you encounter Hazards (cards you draw) which hinder your progress and also obtain 'Bonus' cards which may help you move along faster or avoid Hazards later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The larger your family (up to 4 members) plus bonuses from unused cards and finishing first help determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
