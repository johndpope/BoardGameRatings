			<description>Negative Feedback is a game about negative feedback loops where the players compete to obtain a hand with 0 cards in it. The players go about satisfying this desire by taking cards from other players hands, swapping hands, and other actions. In effect, although it sounds paradoxical, players run out of cards by taking cards from other players. As an added bonus every card has a whimsical statement on it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
