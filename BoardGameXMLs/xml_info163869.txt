							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantastiqa: Audacious Artifacts Expansion</name>
									
			<description>A mini-expansion of 18 (or 12 ... see NOTE further below) artifacts for Fantastiqa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These artifacts can be used to expand your Fantastiqa game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How they work: At the beginning of the game, shuffle all Audacious Artifact cards into the Artifacts deck. As always, include all and only those artifact cards you enjoy playing with - that includes including or removing cards from the base set as well. You might want to change the cards you include each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artifacts included in this mini-expansion include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Cassens&amp;rsquo; Uncanny Clasp of Unfastening (Cost: 4 Gems): Choose one card from your hand or discard pile and tuck it part-way beneath your current Region. A player who ends his turn in this Region must add this card to his discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;     2 x The Complete Troll-Gurgles of Beng Erber (Cost: 3 Gems): Discard as many cards from your hand as you wish, and then draw that many more again.&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Dozer&amp;rsquo;s Deranged Digging Stick (Cost: 4 Gems): Draw five cards from your draw deck and keep two. Discard the others.&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Paco&amp;rsquo;s Paranormal Pencilbox (Cost: 4 Gems): Draw one Beast card and add it to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;     2 x The Summerer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Winter Wonderland (Cost: 3 Gems): If you are in the Frozen Wastelands, draw one Artifact or one Beast card and add it to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Tox&amp;rsquo;s Ill-Tempered Tortoise of Directed Rigor Mortis (Cost: 4 Gems): Choose one card in your hand or discard pile and remove it from play.&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Vasel&amp;rsquo;s Disconcerting Dice of Mischievous Melody (Cost: 4 Gems): Add an additional +1 Point Bonus Token to any Open Quest. (Limit: 3 Tokens total on any Open Quest.)&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Ender&amp;rsquo;s Tollbooth of Never-Ending Adventure (Cost: 4 Gems): Travel to the Region most distant from your current location. (If more than one Region ties, choose either one.)&lt;br/&gt;     2 x The Ever-Clucking Chicken Cup of Rahdo&amp;rsquo;s Bravado (Cost: 4 Gems): Subdue any adjacent single-symbol Creature card and then travel to the Region just beyond it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE:&lt;br/&gt;If you purchased this pack from the BoardGameGeek store prior to January 2016, you only received the following 12 cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Cassens&amp;rsquo; Uncanny Clasp of Unfastening&lt;br/&gt;     2 x The Complete Troll-Gurgles of Beng Erber&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Dozer&amp;rsquo;s Deranged Digging Stick&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Paco&amp;rsquo;s Paranormal Pencilbox&lt;br/&gt;     2 x The Summerer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Winter Wonderland&lt;br/&gt;     2 x Tox&amp;rsquo;s Ill-Tempered Tortoise of Directed Rigor Mortis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
