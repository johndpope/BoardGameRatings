			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1998, author John Tynes was contracted with by West End Games to develop a role-playing game based on the Stargate SG-1 television series; the game was planned to use the successful WEG D6 System.  After substantive development, West End Games experienced severe financial difficulties and the project was cancelled, leaving the game incomplete but also owned by the author.  In 1999, the author published the materials which were completed as free HTML in these major sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Introductory materials&lt;br/&gt;     Character Creation&lt;br/&gt;     Attributes and Skills&lt;br/&gt;     How to be a Supervisor (Game Master)&lt;br/&gt;     The Rules (action resolution)&lt;br/&gt;     Combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
