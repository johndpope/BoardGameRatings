			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a set of notes for a modification of Just Heroes (by James Mullen), which is itself a modification of Apocalypse World (by Vincent Baker). It is just enough to play a game in the setting of Sentinels of the Multiverse, the cooperative comic book card game by Greater Than Games, LLC. If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand any of that and someone talked you into playing anyway, tell that person to stop rambling and just let you be a superhero&amp;mdash;what more do you need to know? A one-page &amp;ldquo;How to Play&amp;rdquo; section is on the next page, followed by a page of Basic Moves, several playbooks for PCs and some resources for the MC. The MC&amp;rsquo;s resources include pages of notes for villains and environments along with a map of Baron Blade&amp;rsquo;s Mobile Defense Platform. Throughout these notes, I have included artwork and descriptions from various sources for inspiration.  card game into roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
