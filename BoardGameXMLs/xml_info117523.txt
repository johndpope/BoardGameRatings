			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Signal Interruption takes place on Naboo during the events described in the first part of The Phantom Menace. When the Trade Federation decided to invade Naboo and take it by force of arms, its first step was to cut off Naboo&amp;rsquo;s communications and sensor systems. Part of that plan involved some covert operations before the actual invasion against a few of Naboo&amp;rsquo;s sensor arrays. This adventure details a raid by a group of free agents (the heroes) against a small sensor array near the city of Kwilaan. Since the Trade Federation has not yet decided to invade Naboo, it dares not use its own forces, thus maintaining&lt;br/&gt;the ability to deny any involvement in the raid, should something go wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short adventure is designed to introduce beginning players and GMs to some of the exciting concepts found in the new The Dark Side Sourcebook.You don&amp;rsquo;t have to have the Dark Side Sourcebook to play, but the guidelines in that book will prove helpful in running this scenario. Because this adventure takes place on Naboo, the additional source material in the Secrets of Naboo campaign pack also might come in handy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
