							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American War of Independence: Brandywine</name>
									
			<description>Brandywine is a large scale game of the early Revolutionary war using the rules from the American War of Independence Campaign Sets. The game is approximately three times as large as those found in the Campaign Sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes an 11x17 inch map, counter sheet, and three pages of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving their forces and attacking enemy units in order to achieve the specific objectives for a battle. One important difference to typical wargames is that before the moving player can attack, his units are subject to defensive fire from the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
