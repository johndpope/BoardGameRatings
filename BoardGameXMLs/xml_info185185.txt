			<description>After countless battles, the King and Queen have grown worried of the strength of their army and thus have issued a decree for their soldiers to train more! Together, a Rook and Bishop practice their combat skills in Red Rook Blue Bishop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Rook Blue Bishop is a micro abstract game that can fit 1 or more players, though 1-4P is recommended as the board is relatively small. The components are minimal, the gameplay is simple, and players may jump in and out at their leisure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay takes inspiration from both Ricochet Robots and the movements of a Rook and Bishop in Chess. The goal is to be the first player to reach 3 points, and a point is rewarded every time a player successfully points out a path to the target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
