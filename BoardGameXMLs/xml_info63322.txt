							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters of the Mediterranean</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Monsters of the Mediterranean&amp;trade; is a catalogue of fabulous beasts taken from the lands around the Mediterranean Sea.  The book contains many entries involving the horrors found in Greek legends, including gorgons (of whom the most famous was Medusa), chimeras, hydras, and cyclopes.  Arabian tales provide the tome with interesting material as well.  You might be familiar with djinni, effreeti,  and perhaps even naga, but did you know that ghouls are Arabic in origin?  Less well known, though no less terrifying, are the beasts of Egyptian lore.  Included in the pages of this book are descriptions of the wadjyt, ta-bitjet, ammut, and sphinxes of all varieties.  And, you'll discover that mummies are not all alike.  Monsters of the Mediterranean is a treasured gaming aid to any referee, but should be avoided by other players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
