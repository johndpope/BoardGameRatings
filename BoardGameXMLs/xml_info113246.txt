			<description>Originally designed especially for the Italian game shop chain Citt&amp;agrave; del Sole, they used to give it as a present to children for their birthday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are birthday parties everywhere and animals wander to wood, pasture, house and pond to celebrate. The guest cards need to be deposited in the correct sequence at the party cards, the first player to discard all cards wins the game. The party cards are laid out, the guest cards are dealt to the players. In his turn a player must place one card and may place more. The first card next to a party card must be a 1 or 6, the following cards must be in sequence, ascending or descending. If a player cannot or does not want to place a card, he must draw a card, if the stack is finished he must place a card if he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premise and Gameplay From Publisher: All the animals must attend the most correct birthday party: in the wood, at the farm, at home or inside the pond. But at the entrance they find a special command, so players must be really skilfull to try to get rid of all their cards, sending all the animals to the correct birthday party. The game mechanism is quite free and players will decide how many cards to play at each turn; they can even not play any card, but instead pick up a new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
