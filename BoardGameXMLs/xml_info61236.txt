							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes &amp; Magic Sourcebook (3rd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Arthad is divided into kingdoms. In every kingdom lives a race who are direct descendants of one of the Galinor favorites, apart from Gadrath the Immortal who has no descendants. Most of the races are human, with rare exceptions that are not covered in this book. Humans are however not a single race but a number of races differing in many ways. You'll find the usual favored class for any race and a forbidden class. A Forbidden class means the race cannot take that class for role-playing reasons (i.e. a Drakand barbarian can't be a literate cavalier), your Referee may, of course, change these rules. In this book you will find several races, a new class and a basic explanation of how magic works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
