							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Domino Castle</name>
									
			<description>Domino Castle is played on a 7 x 8 grid with standard domino tiles. The game is for two players. At the beginning in two opposite corners is one tile the 0/0 and 6/6. Tile 0/0 is the starting tile for a player and tile 6/6 for the other player. All other tiles lie face up on the table.&lt;br/&gt; In your turn you choose one of the open tiles and put it at your starting tile. One side of your new tile have to fit to your starting tile. If you start with the 6/6 tile you have to choose a tile with a 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second round you can choose where you place your new tile. It is not allowed to place a tile with different numbers close together; at the corner it is ok. If it`s possible you could place a new tile in the second (or even third) level. In this case both sides of the new tile must fit with the sides of the two tiles beneath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who can't move passes. The other player continues. To determine the winner, the numbers of stones in the first level are multiply with the number of stones in the second level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
