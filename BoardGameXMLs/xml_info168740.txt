			<description>8 Kingdoms, a fantastic collection of card games for 2-8 players, features characters and artwork from the world of Royal Strawberries and Imperial Harvest. Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom Quest&lt;br/&gt;2-8 players&lt;br/&gt;30 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Ages 12 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: Players start with an Emperor (representing themselves and their realm) and are given a hand of cards from which they must draft/recruit new champions to their Kingdom. Points are obtained through a combination of melding sets (identical champions from multiple realms), runs (a string of champions from the same realm), collecting Kingdom Cards (champions from your own realm), and completing specialty Quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control &amp;amp; Chaos&lt;br/&gt;3-8 Players&lt;br/&gt;45-90 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Ages 12 &amp;amp; up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: A 3-suited, trick-taking card game where players earn points for successfully completing their bids. After 5 hands, the game ends and the player with the most points wins! Can you maintain Control or will the four Chaos Cards disrupt your play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scourge&lt;br/&gt;2-6 Players&lt;br/&gt;45 minutes (full game); 15 minutes per round&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: Players start with an identical hand of cards (their kingdom's champions) and simultaneously bid on cards revealed from the Scourge Deck. High cards win treasure cards, low cards win scourges (which have special abilities), and all ties cancel out. When all cards have been claimed, the round ends and players tally up their scores from accumulated treasures and scourges. The first player with the most points after 5 rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Redemption&lt;br/&gt;3-8 players&lt;br/&gt;20 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: Players take turns guessing how many cards of each suit are held by all players. When another player believes someone has guessed too high, that player may challenge the acting player. When a challenge is made, the loser must continue playing with one of his cards facing toward his adversaries. New hands are drawn with successively less cards dealt out each round. The last player to still hold cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
