			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stealth. Secrecy. Efficiency. These are the trademarks of today's most successful intelligence operations and also the best agents. The perfect mission is one in which the target never finds out what happened, no shots are fired, and no one gets hurt. They are triumphs of planning and execution, flawlessly carried out to the letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah. Sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those of you out in the field know what it's really like out there, and the millions of little things that can go wrong with even the seemingly easiest of missions. That's why, no matter the mission, there's always a &amp;quot;Plan B.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blow it all up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commando gives the Top Secret/S.I. game player a chance to get out of the slick, high-glamour world of exotic locations and beautiful people and instead get their hands dirty in the jungles of Nicaragua, the deserts of Libya, or the bombed-out neighborhoods of Beirut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want to form an Orion Titan team, a crack Mossad anti-terrorist squad, or a band of Contra freedom fighters, Commando is the supplement for you. Up-to-the-minute information on the political and military situation in dozens of countries, including secret police, active terrorist groups, and special military squads, can make your Top Secret/S.I. campaign as current as today's headlines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No anti-terrorist force would be complete without the latest and deadliest in military hardware, and Commando gives it to you. From Claymore mines to man-portable guided missiles to machine pistols, you get complete Top Secret/S.I. game statistics on scores of new, deadly weapons - all with the detail and realism you've come to expect from Top Secret/S.I. products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
