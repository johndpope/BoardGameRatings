			<description>Neptune and the fish is played on a playing field 5x5.&lt;br/&gt;Both players have different goals. Black (Neptune) plays with 3 stones and tries to hit either all the white stones, or position himself so that he cannot hit another stone.&lt;br/&gt;A white stone, which is horizontally or vertically adjacent, is hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White (the fish) plays with 23 stones and tries to get black in a position where all 3 black stones are in the same row or column. White moves a stone to a free neighboring field, white is not able do remove black stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very original unsymmetrical and pretty fast paced tactical game for 2 persons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
