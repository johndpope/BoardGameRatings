							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Light Bobs</name>
									
			<description>Light Bobs was the nickname for the British light infantry, first used during the American Wars of Independence, and later commonly applied to the Light Division during the Napoleonic wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light Bobs is meant to cover actions where hundreds, rather than thousands, of soldiers are deployed. Light Bobs is written at battalion level where the player commands four or more units called Companies. Companies are small (4 to 12 figures). This scale is larger than a man-to-man encounter, but below a brigade or multiple battalion engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic game is between two leaders called Leaders of Worth with each commanding 4 to 6 Companies. Action is fast and sharp with the different Companies being of mixed arms and varying moral types. This is the scale of small units led by individual officers. To bring out the individuality of the scale and the period personality rules are used from which allow players to  watch their Leader of Worth grow as a commander as they go from battle to battle. This system is a sort of paperless campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
