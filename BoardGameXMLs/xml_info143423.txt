			<description>The first board game that melts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GEOlino, the German science magazine for children, wanted its young readers to experience the effects of global warming. Not with dry-as-dust theory, but in a completely child-oriented way. That's why we've developed MELTDOWN - the first board game that melts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to take a polar bear family from the permanent ice floes to safety on the mainland. It's a race against time, as the way leads across real, slowly melting ice floes, which children can make themselves with the accompanying mould, a bit of water and a freezer compartment. The chunks of ice are arranged on a blue polar sea sponge to form a small Arctic. The sponge is used as the game board and absorbs the melted ice at the same time. Now you can start saving polar bears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MELTDOWN makes children experience the effects of global warming in a playful way. Without any wagging finger - just one hand to roll the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
