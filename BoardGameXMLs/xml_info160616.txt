			<description>Each player is the owner of a Coney Island Amusement Park in the nineteen-teens.  All players start with an empty lot and $1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the off season, players take turning buying amusements to add to their parks.  In the summer season, players visit each others parks, and pay money to go on their rides.  If you land on a game stall, you play a game of chance, and maybe you get to win a prize.  The different game stalls each come with their own special rules.  Penny pusher involves rolling dice to see how many pennies you can get to drop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After four years, everyone sells their depreciated rides, the money is added up.  Who ever has the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
