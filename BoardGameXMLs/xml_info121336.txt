			<description>Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked, released in Japan as Samurai Champloo (サムライチャンプルー Samurai Chanpurū), has an original story based on the anime series Samurai Champloo though Bandai has stated it has no direct relation to the events depicted in the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows an original story that combines the Edo Period of Japan (1603&amp;ndash;1867) and the hip hop culture. Each character has his own specific storyline, so playing through the game several times will offer a different experience and adventure with each character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playable characters are Fuu, Jin and Mugen. Upon the completion of the game, a fourth &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; character is made available. The game includes the original three characters: Mugen, Jin, and Fuu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mugen (ムゲン),　is the group's wild card who is not to be underestimated. He has a sword style all his own which incorporates b-boying (breakdancing) techniques. Mugen has little tact and is easily swayed by food, booze, or women. His speed and ability along with his care free attitude and short temper make Mugen a force to be reckoned with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jin (ジン),　who is known quite well for his tremendous skill with the style he uses, which he learned from his former Sensei, Mariya Enshirou of the Mujushin Kenjutsu Dojo, one of the few master swordsmen. Jin is calm, cool, and he keeps his wits about him. As most traditional samurai, Jin has two swords by his side at all times. He is more likely to part with a comrade than his swords. Jin is gentle but when he unsheathes his sword there is no greater force in the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuu (フウ), unlike both of the swordsmen, is cheerful and a quite colorful person. She is indecisive, stubborn and has no greater joy than eating until she is as fat as a cow. She is spunky, brave, and compassionate. She never thinks twice about helping a stranger in need, even if that stranger stole her money pouch earlier in the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worso Tsurumaki is a secret character who is unlockable after the player completes either Mugen or Jin story modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The critically acclaimed TV series comes to the PlayStation&amp;reg;2 computer entertainment system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hungry, cold and broke. On their search for the &amp;quot;samurai that smells of sunflowers,&amp;quot; Mugen, Jin and Fuu's hunt for food ends up costing them more than they bargained for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the northern land of Ezo, danger awaits the wayward trio. There's no way they'll stay out of trouble in a place like this. With curses, witches and of course brawls, it's just another day for this motley crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;    Be a samurai! Play as Mugen, Jin, or the game-exclusive character to unleash your inner samurai moves!&lt;br/&gt;    Fight your way through feudal-era Japan with hip hop style: Execute the combo-system fusing hip hop with samurai sword action.
