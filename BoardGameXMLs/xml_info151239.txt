			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Universes&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Possibilities&lt;br/&gt;One Dark Fate&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;your breath is loud in the confines of the helmet, and you can feel your pulse battering behind your ear. This is it. In a moment, you will step through the portal into the energy field. You will be the first human being to ever breach the mantle between dimensions. You can feel your hand shaking as you step forward, reaching out for the eternal unknown. You enter the field, and the sensation of shuddering in your belly becomes more violent. Your eyes seem to become wider as a ferocious darkness begins to crowd in upon you, and your skin begins to crawl, as if pulled by a billion hot fish-hooks. Your consciousness begins to fold in upon itself, like surf crashing on a rocky shore. There are things in your mind, things that you were never aware existed. Whispers, presences, sullen, bloated things sluggishly bubbling at the back of your twisted perception. You feel as if your bones are corkscrewing within your body, your blood boiling into a red chilling mist, fingers coiling back upon themselves within the protective suit. Something is watching you, something cold and malevolent, watching and waiting, salivating with a terrible hunger, whispering your name. Your eyes open; the helmet is cracked and there is a breeze hissing through the broken plastic. There is sunlight in your eyes: the light is red. You try to get to your feet and look around this new world. Earth: but not the earth you left only moments ago. You have survived the first interdimensional transition. You are the first human to have ever shifted from one reality to another. You take a breath and realise that you feel cold. The suit should keep you warm, but your whole body can now feel the breeze upon it. You lift your hand to check the integrity: there is a wave of terror in your heart as you realise that your flesh and the suit have become one. Switching focus to the crack in your helmet, you see a trickle of blood from the damaged portion. The helmet is bleeding. You and the suit have become a single biological entity. The first human to travel to a new reality did not arrive completely human&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When worlds collide reality is no longer trustworthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book you will find all the rules needed to create characters and run games within the infinite multiverse. The game provides a comprehensive platform to run any adventure in any genre, be it sci-fi, fantasy, horror, super-hero or cyber-punk. Characters can shift between universes to experience other realities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games-Masters can choose to throw characters across the multiverse; one week they are in the old west, the next gothic horror or a future of biotechnological marvels, and the following week? Who knows?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Worlds Collide is a multi-versal, multi-genre role-playing game. To play, you will need a selection of polyhedral dice (available on-line or at you local hobby store), pencil, paper and some friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
