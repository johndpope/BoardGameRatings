			<description>from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 4-6 Mutants Level 1-3&lt;br/&gt;Gen Con 2011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;introductory blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;             Centuries ago, the Ancient World ended in a swirling storm of nuclear fire, toxic bioweaponry, and global upheaval. But life survived, albeit changed and warped. Mutants and humans live side-by-side in the ruins of Ancient civilizations. Twisted creatures roam the radioactive wastes, and poisonous storms scorch the lands. This is the Mutant Future in which you live. &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are more fortunate than other survivors who scratch out a meager existence amongst the ruins and rubble, for you have something they do not &amp;ndash; a job. For several months, you have worked for a large mutant bear named &amp;ldquo;Barter John&amp;rdquo; at the trading post he established in an Ancient military base on one of the major trade routes. Barter John is quick with a smile and a laugh, but even quicker with a bullet to the head for thieves and looters. You work as John's &amp;ldquo;Acquisitions and Recovery department,&amp;rdquo; as he jokingly calls it. In other words, he tells you where to find stuff, and you go get it. John pays well and he lets you take first claim on anything recovered. With room and board on top of that, it's an easier gig than joining a band of mauraduers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John pages you in your barracks over the makeshift intercom system. &amp;ldquo;Meet me in the Ready Room. Bring your gear. I've got an assignment for you and time's of the essence.&amp;rdquo;**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
