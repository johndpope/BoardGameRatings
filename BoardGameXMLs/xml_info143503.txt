							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The War Dancer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystic warriors hailing from the primal lands, war dancers are powerful manipulators of the battlefield. These men and women read the signs and omens of combat, feel the flows of his enemy's energy, and manipulate it to their own advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war dancer is a martial controller, manipulating opponents just like a wizard, but doing it from the front lines. He may not be as physically powerful as a barbarian nor as technically trained as a fighter, but few can change the course of a battle as quickly, or as effectively, as a war dancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third class in our Summer Class Blitz, the war dancer is a class for anyone who loves hard hitting, tactical combat, and staying ahead of their enemies by manipulating them into submission. Aside from the basic class, this pdf includes 2 new war dancer spells, 5 war dancer feats, and two additional archetypes (southern war dancer and arcane war dancer,) showing the different ways war dancing can be incorporated into different societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
