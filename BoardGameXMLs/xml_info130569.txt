			<description>Card game featuring farm animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player draws a card and makes sure no-one else can see it. It will be one of ten possible animals. The other player or players can ask seven specific questions which will be answered with a &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;A couple of question examples:&lt;br/&gt;Good Household Pet?&lt;br/&gt;Meat we eat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every question asked scores the card-holder 1 point. If the animal is not guessed after the 7 questions or is guessed incorrectly, the card-holder scores a bonus of ten points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One nice little tweek - the cardholder must always be honest except he can tell his &amp;quot;Farm Yard Fib&amp;quot; and answer one question incorrectly. He can only do this once throughout the seven questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The points are totalled after an agreed number of turns and the winner is the one with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
