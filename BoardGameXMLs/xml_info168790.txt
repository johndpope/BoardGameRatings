							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS High-Tech: Adventure Guns</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed For Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mid-19th through early 20th centuries were the time of rough-and-tumble Wild West gunslingers and gentlemanly Victorian adventurers alike, an age when death was just a bullet away whether you found yourself in a sooty industrial metropolis or the wilds of the Great White Hunter. With so many people living and dying by the gun, gunsmiths were spurred to revolutionize the art of killing and develop the innovations that made the Great War the bloody spectacle it was. GURPS High-Tech: Adventure Guns brings heroes of this period everything they need to shoot their way out of trouble:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Both iconic and unusual firearms from the mid-1800s through early 1900s -- revolvers, semiautomatic pistols, shotguns, rifles, machine guns, and even a few cannon -- complete with their accessories and variants.&lt;br/&gt;     All the associated gear: ammo, cartridge belts, fast-draw rigs, and hand grenades that don't rely on a fizzing fuse.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules unique to period designs, covering both defects and innovations . . . which were often one and the same!&lt;br/&gt;     Support for the crazy stuff that adventurers get up to, like customizing weapons, improvising ammo, rigging traps, and even mounting TL5-6 cannon and machine guns on steampunk spacecraft.&lt;br/&gt;     Bits and pieces needed to get into costume: the history and description of each weapon, a glossary of slang, guidelines for converting costs to period currency, and notes on firearms legality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS High-Tech: Adventure Guns takes a magnifying glass to one of the most interesting eras covered by GURPS High-Tech and reveals details that will have your TL5-6 heroes shooting up the scenery in style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
