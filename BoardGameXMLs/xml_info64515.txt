			<description>Break the bank... Be a Millionaire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your &amp;quot;Bet a Million&amp;quot; game will give you many pleasurable evenings at home gatherings and parties. You are supplied with complete equipment to play three most fascinating games; Roulette, Nevada Craps and Chuck-a-Luck, exactly as played in the most renowned international casinos. In addition, you are given platic chips or counters in 8 colors and One Million Dollars in play money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two bankers are needed for this game so that two games can be conducted at once. One conducts either Roulette or Nevada Craps while the other conducts Chuck-a-Luck. The bankers start out with 1/3 of the money, with the rest divided amongst the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Felt layouts are included for the gaming tables along with a nice 8-1/2&amp;quot; plastic Roulette Wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
