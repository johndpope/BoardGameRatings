			<description>user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure module made exclusively for the Haunted Highlands Kickstarter that funded July 24th, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released as an exclusive release for the campaign for a stretch reward ($10,000 stretch goal).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Designed for 2 - 6 characters of 6 ~ 9 level with a challenge rating of 7. It can easily be scaled up or down as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; from page 2 of the module&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The characters experience a longish adventure where they are introduced to many different types of gunpowder weapons. The characters are hired to lead a wagon train blessed by Tevnut the goddess of nature, the earth and fresh waters. The trip begins in Mantua, proceeds down through the Northern Steppes and into Mafurrow, and over to Lake Ugashtan. While the group thinks their last stop is the Crater of Umeshti, they are wrong. One of the primary sources of evil in the lad is the Tower of the Necromancer in the Cursed Woods. The characters are urged by the priestesses to take on the challenge of the Necromancer's Tower.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
