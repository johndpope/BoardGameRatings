			<description>The players must &amp;quot;pray&amp;quot; the mighty Horus, drawing from a bag wooden tokens in two different colours. The player in turn declares how many &amp;quot;pray token&amp;quot; will be able to draw from the bag, avoiding the negative colour. The player on the lefts has two options: he can overdeclare or he can &amp;quot;challenge&amp;quot;. If he overdeclares, the player on his left can &amp;quot;challenge&amp;quot; or overdeclare and so on until one of the player challenges the last declaration. Now it's time to &amp;quot;pray&amp;quot;, that is drawing one at a time, the tokens from the bag. A player succeeds if he's able to draw exactly the number of tokens declared without taking the wrong colour. If he fails the wrong token goes to the challenging player, while all the &amp;quot;pray tokens&amp;quot; go back into the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in KidultGame's Game in a bag&amp;quot; line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
