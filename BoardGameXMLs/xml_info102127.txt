			<description>Towering Inferno by US Games, is a video game for the Atari 2600 in which the user plays a fireman going through a burning skyscraper to save victims and put out the fires. On each floor of the building, the player must put out the flames and reach the panel that opens the doors to get back out. While doing so, there is a meter at the top showing how many people are on that floor. The longer it takes a player to open the doors and get out, the more the meter decreases. The object is to work as fast as you can while avoiding and putting out flames to open the doors and escape with the most people remaining on the meter. The game can be played by one or two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Towering Inferno (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
