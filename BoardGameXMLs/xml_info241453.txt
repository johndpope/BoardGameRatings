							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nine Creatures of Steel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Location: Steel jungle regions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many ways to die in the jungles of Steel. The formal Conflicts rage on the planet and often stray to the equatorial zones, and as always in the heat of human war life remains cheap. However, the myriad creatures that can be found on the world often pose a greater threat. A wide range of lifeforms exist, many of them predators, and they have no qualms in adding humans and Uplifts to their menus. For many citizens of the Flame Worlds documentaries about the jungles of Steel are compulsive viewing, especially since so many fellow citizens end up prey to the burgeoning wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are detailed nine deadly creatures of the planet Steel, designed for Exilium but suitable for any science fiction roleplaying game where alien lifeforms are a major hazard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These creatures can be thrown into any campaign that takes place or touches on Steel, and add a flavour of the deadly jungles of that world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
