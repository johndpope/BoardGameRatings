							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of In and Out</name>
									
			<description>There is a box (about 10 x 10) which has been divided inside into 25 little spaces each numbered either 5, 10 or 15. There are six little wooden balls which are thrown from an agreed distance into the box and the score for each person is totalled. From the graphics I would guess that the game was made in the 1930&amp;rsquo;s.   Made in England by British Manufacture. Inside of the lid you will find the rules.   Info on game obtained from Hyde &amp;amp; Seek Board Games from Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
