							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Journey on the Amazon Game</name>
									
			<description>How wonderful it will be to take a journey down the Amazon with your friends Bromley (parrot fish) and Coltica (parrot). You will learn about the actual animals that live in the Amazon.  Along the way, see special places such as Bromley's Flower Garden, the Spectacled Caiman Lodge, Pygmy Owl Singing Classes and the Kapok Hop Dance Camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: &lt;br/&gt;Be the first player to move your game peice on the path through the Amazon to the coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, first you have to construct the gameboard, which is basically a large, 12-piece floor jigsaw puzzle that measures 20&amp;quot; x 30&amp;quot; when put together. Once the board is constructed, it displays a winding path through the jungle or Amazon. Over a dozen animals specific to the region featured are included several times on the game spaces that make up the path. A deck of cards featuring the animals is included and players take turns drawing cards and moving to the animal shown. The first player to reach the end of the path, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra cards add even more fun to the game like certain animals that make you move back spaces, short cut cards, quick sand (lose turn) cards, Piranha cards (switch places with another player), and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instruction booklet includes a bit of info on each animal on the board and cards, so kids can even learn a bit while playing this game. Cards include labels of the animal names in both English and Spanish. For 2-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
