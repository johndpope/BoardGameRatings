			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Ship Book and Adventure for the Cepheus Engine and for the HOSTILE setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re everywhere &amp;ndash; in fact, they are now so ubiquitous that you probably don&amp;rsquo;t even notice them anymore. What am I talking about? The Pioneer Stations. The 600-ton Leyland-Okuda Pioneer is a general purpose industrial operations platform, a five-man space station designed to serve as an operations center, drone control, fuel store or supply dump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains a complete write-up of the station, it&amp;rsquo;s design principles, uses and specifications . It includes full color illustrations as well as complete deck-by-deck plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you also get an adventure supplied:  Vanishing Point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Company has lost contact with a helium-3 mining station and the supply ship sent to investigate has vanished. Your players are the crew of the commercial towing vessel Grendel, assigned to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can they avoid stumbling from one survival crisis to the next? Can they find any survivors? There are difficult places to explore, space-walks to conduct and difficult choices to be made. And &amp;hellip; they are not alone &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vanishing Point uses the deckplans for the Pioneer Station already provided. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
