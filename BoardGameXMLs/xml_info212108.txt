			<description>This is a murder mystery party game for 8-14 guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting / Theme:&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for some teased up hair and Member's Only jackets mixed with a fun '80s story line and trivia challenges! Everyone who is anyone in the 80s will be there, all coming from Hollywood to Broadway through Texas. J.R. and Melinda are throwing this dig to introduce Allegra and her new business. This will be a totally bodacious affair. The guests can chill out and have a blast until that moment when someone gets murdered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh those 80s! What fun years with big teased hair and characterized by a &amp;quot;disco&amp;quot; backlash, Rock and Pop Bands with long hairstyles and citizens with political correctness became popular. Prepare your guests for the 80s murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;Planning:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Host of the Murder Mystery picks the day/time and location for the game which will take 2-3 hours and finds out how many guests can attend.&lt;br/&gt;     Host creates guest list and assigns each guest one of the characters to play.&lt;br/&gt;     Host sends official invite with their character background to each guest.&lt;br/&gt;     Guests create / purchase a costume based on their character.  Thrift stores are good for this.&lt;br/&gt;     Host decorates and plans for food for evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     As guests arrive, the host gives them their instructions for the first round which will include things to say/do/ask.&lt;br/&gt;     After all actions are completed, instructions are given to guests for Round 2.&lt;br/&gt;     Repeat again for Round 3.&lt;br/&gt;     In between rounds you can eat or have activities based on the theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Everyone discusses and says who they think the murderer is.&lt;br/&gt;     Each guest reads their final clue in order leading up to the murderer.&lt;br/&gt;     Winner are those that guessed the murderer.  &lt;br/&gt;     If nobody guesses correctly the murderer wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
