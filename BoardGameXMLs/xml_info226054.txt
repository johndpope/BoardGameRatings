							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Greater Debate</name>
									
			<description>You&amp;rsquo;ve been there for the great debates among your friends: Which player is better than which? What political party is really causing all the issues? Which superhero is better? Is a certain band legit musically or completely overrated? &lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve had a few laughs and some really good debates, but so often you have just agreed to disagree. Now is the time to test your powers of persuasion. Now is the time to settle this once and for all&amp;hellip; or for at least tonight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will take turns debating various topics from serious to the zany. The players will vote on who wins the argument based on the merits of the debaters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standalone expansion to The Great Debate.  This contains all new arguments and enough vote cards for 15 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
