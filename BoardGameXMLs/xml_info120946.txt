							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Push</name>
									
			<description>Push is played on a 15X15 square board with each player having 10 stones. Pieces move one as a chess king, and a player has three moves on a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There must always be a one place buffer between opposing pieces. When a piece is moved next to an opponent piece it is pushed away one space to create the buffer. If a piece is pushed into another piece, or the side, it is captured. A player loses when they are down to one piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Push was an entry in the THE THOUSAND-YEAR GAME DESIGN CHALLENGE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
