							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Karmic Places: Blacktip Bay</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orc tribal settlement.  Pirate Safe Harbor.  Thriving Coastal Town.  Blacktip Tip has evolved and is now beginning to experience growing pains.  The old orcish traditions are beginning to clash with the current ecomonic-driven sensibilities of the growing populace.  Honorable challenges give way to covert house wars, while the rule of the Chieftain is compromised by affluent merchants and his own Council.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karmic Places: Blacktip Bay is a location sourcebook for the Karma Roleplaying System.  Use Blacktip Bay as a launch point for new adventures, or as an exciting addition to your current campaign.  This product provides the complete history of the town, geographic information, and general information regarding the different parts of town.   Delve into the politics of the town.  Don't agree with the way a Councilman is handling town affairs?  Don't vote him out of office.  Challenge him to a fight and take his seat!  Need to earn some coin?  Learn about the economics of the town and take up a bit of coral harvesting or go shark hunting.  Unlock the mysteries of faith in the town by visiting the Temple of Apuk, the Great Shark.  Or brave the wilds of the woods and mountains outside the town to visit the three great shrines and commune with the spirits there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Players:  three new profession ideas, Six new gemstones with strange powers to maximize magical items, unique equipment, and three new disciplines (Apuk Devotee, Ranger, and Rogue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Storytellers:  Six new monsters (blacktip reef shark, bone guardian, Chotha, jellyfish, mekuteye, muck tunneler), histories and stat blocks for a dozen NPCs (including the entire current Council and Chieftain) that can serve as allies or adversaries for the players, story seeds, and a magic item calculation guide that provides the construction data and retail prices of all magic items referenced in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
