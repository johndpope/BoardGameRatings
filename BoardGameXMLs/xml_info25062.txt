			<description>Oldtimer Rally is played with a deck of 68 cards and 2 dice:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 oldtimers (2 of each model/color)&lt;br/&gt; 1 start&lt;br/&gt; 1 finish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;54 road cards with&lt;br/&gt; - 38 normal roads&lt;br/&gt; - 16 obstacles (4 x 4 different)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 54 road cards are put on the table face down to form the race course. Each player gets 2 oldtimers of the same color. Each turn, a player must move both of his oldtimers by throwing the 2 dice. The card where a car stops is turned over. If it's an obstacle, the player must follow the rules for that obstacle and the card is turned back again. If a car would land on a card with another oldtimer, the moving car is going off the course and must begin the race at the start again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the game is the player, whose 2 oldtimers reach the finish line first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
