							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Judges Guild Journal (Installment K - Feb/Mar 1977)</name>
									
			<description>This was the second of the Judges Guild newsletter that would eventually become Judges Guild Journal.  It was one legal size page printed front and back.  At this point it couldn't even be called a magazine really with no dates/authors/editors/etc. listed, just a variety of small articles in an informal newsletter format.  Usually things were just updates to various Judges Guild publications.  The topics were:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jocular Judgements&lt;br/&gt;Scrolls from the Archives&lt;br/&gt;Tips from the Tower&lt;br/&gt;then a &amp;quot;Booty List&amp;quot; of available JG products and acknowledgements and thanks to TSR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
