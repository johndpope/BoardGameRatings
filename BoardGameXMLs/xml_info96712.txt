							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Those Summer Nights!</name>
									
			<description>designer blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's another free, homebrew print-and-play Fiasco playset!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                                &lt;br/&gt;                            &lt;br/&gt;                        &lt;br/&gt;                    &lt;br/&gt;                &lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, this is it. The last summer before senior year. The last truly free summer you&amp;rsquo;ll have. Next summer, it&amp;rsquo;s all about getting ready for college and trying to figure out who you want to be. But for now, for this summer, you are going to make things special! The time of your life, kid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, except that there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to do in this town. All of the desirable jobs over at the Cinema Complex 12 have been taken. So, the next step down is at the Splash It Up! water park. And well, all of the primo openings there (like lifeguard) are also taken up. But at least folding towels will get you some cash, and there&amp;rsquo;s always a chance of a summer fling with someone else, whether they work there, or are just hanging out there for the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                &lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those Summer Nights! is intended to replicate a teen romantic comedy movie. While there may be humiliation, there should not be any horrific deaths involved. In fact, with some luck, the ending for some characters just may turn out to be bittersweet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from the usual Fiasco playset parameters, this playset includes a specialize Tilt Table and a new Aftermath hack to accommodate the softer &amp;quot;end game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
