							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reckless Rufus</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action/puzzle game in which Rufus must collect crystals while avoiding or shooting aliens. Rufus moves by jumping from stone to stone. If he's standing on a &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; stone, he'll jump one space and a &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; stone will be created under him. There are special stones (teleporters, switches, extra ammo...). Aliens can be shot but Rufus has limited ammo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 130 levels, split in two parts. The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Having hidden aboard the vast mining ship, the Astro Cruiser, hoping to save a fortune on a cheap year return ticket to Earth, Rufus had goofed! He had been caught trying to buy some liquorice sweets from a deactivated android - pretty dumb huh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result, Admiral Greave had beamed our reckless hero on to the planet Killey and told him to collect as many of the rare crystals found there as possible and only then would the Admiral decide whether or not to take him back to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems for Rufus were not to stop at simply finding sufficient crystals, but became more complicated with the existence of deadly traps and an infestation of hostile aliens. Fortunately, Rufus had been given a laser gun, although it had a limited supply of laser bullets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Rufus make it or is he doomed from the start?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
