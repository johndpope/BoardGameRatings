			<description>The giraffes are hungry! - Can you help them reach the leaves in the tree?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It takes a steady hand and a clever mind to stack the blocks, reach the reward, and earn the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, you must roll the die to determine which block you have to use. Keep on stacking turn after turn to stack your giraffe's neck as high as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher the leaves are in the tree, the more points they're worth. - Stack as high as possible to win the biggest reward!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware. If your giraffe tumbles, you'll have to start all over, and the other giraffes might start chanting -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Icarus lost his nee-eck! Icarus lost his nee-eck!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the leaves have been grabbed, everyone flips them over at the same time to count up their points. The player with the most points wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
