			<description>Solve the maximum number of crimes to become an expert in criminal investigation.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to solve a series of crimes and do it before the opposing team. A player reads the case and the rest will be detectives. Any player of the team makes a question to the master, he responds with YES or NOT, then any player of the other team makes another question. When a team has enought clues, try to resolve the case. If the explanation is correct, the team wins the game if not, the other team ask again. The team that resolved the crime before the other, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
