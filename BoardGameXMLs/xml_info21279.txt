							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Convoy</name>
									
			<description>Players take it in turns to run convoys of ships in partnerships. Two players are chosen by spinning the compass card to create a convoy. They become players 'North' and 'South'. All other players act individually to try and stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A convoy is a running sequence of 4 'Merchantmen' cards and the 'Home' card. The merchantmen are numbered from 1-6 so there are 3 ways of making a convoy. The convoy has to be in North's hands to score, so North and South work together to realign their cards. When they have a convoy North calls 'Convoy' and the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any other player (not North) can halt a round by declaring their hand when they have collected certain configurations. Other cards&lt;br/&gt;include 'torpedoes', 'mines', 'cruisers', 'destroyers' and 'submarines'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After adding up the points the winner is the first to 1000 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
