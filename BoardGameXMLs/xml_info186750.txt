			<description>In Efterklok, a.k.a. Hinterher ist man immer schlauer, you answer five questions in a row. After you've answered, every player learns how many correct answers you gave, but not which questions were correct. The same five questions are now presented to the player after you, and they can choose to either copy your answers or give their own in the hope of scoring more points. As long as no one has answered all of the questions correctly, this process continues until everyone but the questioner has had a chance to answer the questions. Thus, if you stay alert and can read the other players well, you might be able to win the game even if didn't know many of the answers to begin with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efterklok comes with more than five hundred entertaining, interesting, and educational questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
