			<description>Heracles no Eikō II: Titan no Metsubō (ヘラクレスの栄光II タイタンの滅亡?, &amp;quot;Glory of Heracles II: Titan's Downfall&amp;quot;) is the second game of the series. Unlike the first game in the series, Heracles is no longer the player-controlled character. Instead, the player takes the role of a young boy living in an age where Heracles is already recognized as a legendary hero. The boy learns that the last-remaining offspring of the Titans has crowned himself the king of darkness, causing chaos across the world, and sets off on a journey to defeat the evil king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the game is set to take place directly after the events of the original Heracles no Eikō, the game's plot creates several inconsistencies in the series timeline. The portable spinoff, Heracles no Eikō: Ugokidashita Kamigami, was released in 1992 to fill the gap between the two games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party system is newly introduced into the series, along with time-flow, where the game passes between daytime and nighttime. Most of the characteristics from the original Heracles no Eikō were scrapped, and a basic game system used for many RPGs of the time period was employed in their stead. Though no longer containing a particularly unique game system, Heracles no Eikō II is characterized by its tragic, dramatic storyline, which employs various motifs from Greek mythology. All subsequent releases in the series follow the basic format established in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's scenario was written by Kazushige Nojima, who would later achieve widespread recognition for his work on Final Fantasy VII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Glory of Heracles (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
