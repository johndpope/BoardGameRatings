			<description>The game is designed to train first graders' addition skills. The players take tiles from their hand which show either points or plus or minus. The active player has to add sheep to the current total or substract some, but never going above the limits 0 and 10 or 20. The current sum is shown by sheep tiles. A player who manages that gets a fox, a player who doesn't gets nothing and a player who makes a mistake has to return a fox. The player with most foxes at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
