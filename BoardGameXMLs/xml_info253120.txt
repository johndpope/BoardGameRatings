			<description>In Siege!, one player controls an army that is attacking a castle and trying to capture the other player's king. The other player is defending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces in the turn are placed upside-down to hide their values. Each player has 10 pieces ranging in value from 1 to 4. The king is placed on a marked square on the far side of the board. Each turn, the players choose one piece and move it one square orthogonally (there is no diagonal) movement in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a piece moves adjacent to an opponent piece, the values of both are revealed and the lower one is removed. There are also &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; units which will automatically eliminate any unit they are adjacent to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the defending king is captured or when the the invaders run our of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
