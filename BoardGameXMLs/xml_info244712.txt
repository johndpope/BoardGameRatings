							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Things to Find at Halloween</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is primarily a modern list of 100 base items, with some possible alternatives, that could be discovered at Halloween. Although the items are mostly described in a modern manner, many could be used in historical or fantasy settings by altering the materials and how they function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These items can be used to add Halloween-themed clutter and decorations to a house, but they could also be used for more sinister purposes, if the items such as blood, skulls and skeletons are real, not fake, or they could be possessed by malign spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement has five pages; the first is the cover and the second is the front matter, instructions and start of the list, with the remainder being the rest of the list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example results are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;59. Pile of Skulls (A decorative pile of, probably plastic, skulls, perhaps with battery-powered lights and sound)&lt;br/&gt;60. Plates (Paper or plastic plates in black or orange or decorated with jack o'lanterns, skulls, bats and similar)&lt;br/&gt;61. Pumpkin (Either real, carved into a Jack o'Lantern, or plastic, with one built-in, with either a candle or electric light inside it, such as a real or electric tealight)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
