							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rebellious Archetypes Volume V</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be a Rebel with a Cause!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every evil lurks in deep, dark dungeons far away from innocent townsfolk, waiting patiently for adventurers to kick down their doors and start fighting. Some monsters don't just prey on society from without, but have burrowed and wormed their way into the very heart of the civilized world, and twist and corrupt the very laws that are supposed to protect the innocent, using them to oppress and exploit them, instead. These evils are no less a threat than the ones that most adventurers face, but many PCs are ill-equipped to deal with them. This is a job for rebels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new rebellious archetypes for five different classes. Included are the revolution&amp;rsquo;s fury, a barbarian archetype whose righteous rage serves as a beacon to her allies, rallying them behind her cause, the wild blaster, a kineticist archetype capable of great surges of energy, but who lacks staying power, forcing them to use hit-and-run guerilla tactics, the keeper of the revolution, an occultist archetype that specializes in concealing people and things, and who can gather information through psychic contacts, the prophet of the revolution, an oracle archetype cursed with an aura in which blood flows more freely, and who experiences visions that can empower herself and her allies against tyranny, and the guerilla skirmisher, a rogue archetype that focuses on hit-and-run tactics and is even more slippery and evasive than other rogues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for rebellious villains as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
