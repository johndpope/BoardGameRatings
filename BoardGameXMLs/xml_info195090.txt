			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All-that-is is not like our world - it is world rich in magic and teleology. Here things fall to earth not because they are drawn by Gravity, but because that is the place they are meant to be, the plants grow by their own magic, and the Sun hangs in the centre of the world because that is its place. All-that-is is shaped like the inside of an egg, its inhabitants can see the ground curve up and away from them. The year in All-that-is is defined by the procession of the sun - every 320 days it traces out a circle in a plane through the fattest part of the egg - and in its procession it brings seasons to the lands of the bulge, colder as the sun moves away, warmer as it returns. While the wide end of the world basks eternally in a continual and barely changing heat and the narrow end is unchanging in its cold and ice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is the winner of the Game Chef 2004 competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
