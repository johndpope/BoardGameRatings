			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StockCar Jr. is an auto-racing game. The object is to be the first player to complete 15 laps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players qualify for racing order with a dice roll. Car movement is controlled by rolling the dice as players seek to vie for positioning in &amp;quot;The Groove,&amp;quot; an area of the track which allows for the fastest possible movement. But this is more than just a roll-and-move game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose a car setup that's either Tight or Loose. A Tight setup is more conservative and safe, while a Loose set up gives more reward at the cost of greater risk. Players can also switch between high and low gear. Special rules cover cornering, getting &amp;quot;out of groove&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;out of shape,&amp;quot; and accidents/collisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another interesting feature of the game is the ability to collect Power Points. Cars can gain these when they are caught in traffic or have no legal moves. They can be used later to help with tricky maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cars pit after their 4th and 9th laps. Each car gets a Pit Card which indicates how long the pit stop is how many spaces of movement it gains while exiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in rather large &amp;quot;pizza box&amp;quot; style container with a checkerboard patterned cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include:&lt;br/&gt;- A large gameboard with a track three spaces wide for the cars to travel on, &lt;br/&gt;- 2 sets of instructions,&lt;br/&gt;- 6 sets of control tables which represent high and low gear for the Loose and Tight car setups, &lt;br/&gt;- 6 sets of gauges to track Power Point usage, &lt;br/&gt;- A color-coordinated pair of dice and wooden playing pieces for each of the six race teams (aka players), &amp;amp; &lt;br/&gt;- A set of 20 Pit Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
