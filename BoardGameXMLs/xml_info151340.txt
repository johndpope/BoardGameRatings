			<description>A trick-taking card game focusing on expressions from Bologna's dialect. Players try to avoid taking suits of unlucky events going around the table by either adding a more powerful event of the same sphere, or trumping the suit with an event of a different sphere (the three spheres being home, work or street). If not avoidable, the trick taking can be mitigated by playing a swear word card, or by a Socc'mel card, which transfer the suit to another player. Goal of the game is pushing the other players anger-meter (&amp;quot;incazzometro&amp;quot;) beyond 10 to eliminate them from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is marketed for ages 6 up, with the explicit proviso that obscenities from Bologna are widely accepted and not considered offensive (which is the case, to some extent...).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
