							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">From Beyond Adventure Path Episode 1: Distress Call</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Everything was going as planned, the deuterium arrived on time and was shipped as expected. It was mostly a game of filling the time until the automatic distress call from the Sawshark that is! The players are sent to investigate a mystery aboard the hi-tech mining vessel. All attempts to contact the Sawshark have gone unanswered. A rescue shuttle is arranged for you to take to investigate the state of the ship and its crew.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure takes place in an isolated system with four planets and a massive asteroid belt orbiting a dim brown dwarf star. Players are sent to investigate about a ship suddenly gone silent after sending a distress call to the only outpost nearby and it's up to the them to find out what happened!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
