			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archeus Fantasy Roleplaying was distributed under a GNU Free Documentation License.  The design goal was a simple system that could handle virtually any roleplaying situation, though the system is a generic fantasy setting.  A secondary goal was to ensure that &amp;quot;the bad guys&amp;quot; would always be balanced with &amp;quot;the good buys&amp;quot; (player characters), even as either group advanced in power level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 0.3.1 version of the system was released in 2001 and has not been updated.  The game presents a fairly robust and flexible method for character creation.  Characters have &amp;quot;primary&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;secondary&amp;quot; stats, which are derived from primary stats.  Any number of secondary skills may be created to support any needed action; skills may have active or passive uses.  All opposed actions are resolved by using a lengthy &amp;quot;statistics bonuses&amp;quot; table to modify a statistic which is then compared to a percentile dice roll to determine success or failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hosting site presented a series of online forms that users could access to submit new gaming materials such as skills, monsters, weapons, spells, and equipment which would then be incorporated into the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
