			<description>Easy to Incorporate Deities for Your Own Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is meant to be an aid or supplement to an existing game of your choice. It is intended to be a tool or resource to use when a DM, GM or Storyteller needs to find a deity to use in his or her games without devoting too much time to do so. This list of deities is meant to be a rather complete and universal list of deities to use in one&amp;rsquo;s game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One should remember that deities are not exhaustive, but rather a quick guide to use when one is need of a deity to use. I hope that you will find this list and explanation of deities to be useful and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
