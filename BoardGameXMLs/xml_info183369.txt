							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bulwark: Nevtelen Lucksmith / Carnival of Chaos</name>
									
			<description>This double pack contains two decks - a new hero deck and a new foe deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nevtelen Lucksmith is a gambler. That doesn't just mean he puts wagers money, he also puts his life on the line on matters of chance. For years he's been scratching  that thrill-seeking itch doing a little good as he goes, and the prospect of wlaking away from a confrontation with an army is too good to miss!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Carnival of Chaos is brooding, sinister and unexpected. What happy smiles for children when the clowns have no faces? What joy and laughter can there be when mute horrors swing scythes at any that cross their paths? The mystery at the heart of the carnival may never be solved, but it's up to you to chase it away from the town it has selected to feast on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
