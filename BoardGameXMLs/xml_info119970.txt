							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fire Blob</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;FireBlob is a charming and captivating game &amp;ndash; you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to drag yourself away. Behind its serious facade, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a fun game that will put your reflexes and your memory to the test in turn. It is divided into 30 distinct levels, with two game modes to choose from depending on your style. Share your scores with friends around the world, and compare your achievements with theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descriptions of the game modes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reflex Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In FireBlob&amp;rsquo;s reflex mode, your goal is to earn the highest number of points. To do this, you must catch the blobs that fall from the top of your sceen at varying speeds and rhythms. To catch a blob use your finger to move the vertical selection bar from left to right. If your blob hits the ground when the bar is in another lane, you won&amp;rsquo;t earn any points. If the bar is in the correct lane, however, the point will be yours. Accumulate several points in a row to nail down some bonus points and see your final score increase dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FireBlob&amp;rsquo;s memory mode puts your neurons to work, letting your reflexes take a rest. Your objective is to reproduce the blobs&amp;rsquo; descent in the order in which they fall. Pay attention, because the speed and duration of the sequences increases with each level and during each round. Passing the final levels will require total concentration.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
