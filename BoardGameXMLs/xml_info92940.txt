			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega Man Powered Up is a remake of Mega Man 1 with completely redone graphics and several new features. The game uses 3D character models that are almost chibi-style designs, creating cuter enemies and Robot Masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largest change to the game is the inclusion of two new Robot Masters &amp;ndash; Oil Man and Time Man &amp;ndash; which brings the number of stages to eight, matching the other Mega Man titles. There are also two playable game modes. Old style emulates the original title as much as possible using the new character and stage presentation, while New style offers a range of new capabilities. These abilities include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Being able to exit a stage at any time, even if it is incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;- Weapon energy is refilled after every death.&lt;br/&gt;- The Energy Balance is standard equipment, causing energy capsules to fill the lowest energy weapon.&lt;br/&gt;- If an enemy injures Mega Man and he falls on spikes, he is not instantly destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the stages have been reimagined. The general layout remains the same, but alternate paths have been added, and a new intro stage has been included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
