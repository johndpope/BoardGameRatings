			<description>Human being is at the edge - but does not know about!&lt;br/&gt;Mother nature strikes back and reduces the mankind to save the planet from being destroyed by what calls themselves homo sapiens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players cooperate in taking the role of a Virus and try to infect people all over the world. They use events like the Olympic Games to spread their deathly effects. To be a step ahead of the human scientists the players develop special features like infection by blood, via animals or resistance against medicals, heat or coldness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in clockwise order. In your turn you draw an event card which forces you to take back one or more of your tokens from the board (healing a city). If it is the last one in this city, the &amp;quot;healing token&amp;quot; on the specific track moves forward and you loose, if it meets your marker on that track. The event card gives you some additional &amp;quot;DNS points&amp;quot; (some kind of money) too. In the second step of your turn you spread your virus depending via the infection ways you have developed already. You gain additional DNS-points for each infection (=placing new tokens onto the board in the cities). Third, you develop (buy for DNS) more features for your virus like infection via animal, resistance against coldness or medicine - or your ability to kill people. Finally you throw dice according to your skill for kill and depending on the result you replace your tokens on the board with dead tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players win, if they have placed all dead tokens in the cities. They loose, if the draw pile is runs out or the human beeings have made enough healing steps on the specific track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be able to save the planet and reduce the population of the greatest danger for the world: The Human Being?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
