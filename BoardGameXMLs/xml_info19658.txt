			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The alternative games in this booklet are all designed to be played with standard equipment. They offer exciting new dimensions to games played on or with draught boards, cards, pool tables etc., helping to eliminate the constant financial burden of purchasing expensive and often short-lived new games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of at least three booklets with rules for games designed and published by New Zealander, Tony Crow. Two other titles are &amp;quot;Alternative Games for Those Who Like a Challenge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Alternative Games for the Studious&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games are variations on existing games like draughts, ludo and Scrabble. The booklet is divided into four sections: Card Games, Draught Games, Other Games and Billiard Table Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
