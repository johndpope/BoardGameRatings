			<description>&amp;quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour, known in Japan as Mario Golf: Family Tour (マリオゴルフ ファミリーツアー), is a sports game developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube. It is the sequel to the 1999 Nintendo 64 title Mario Golf, and is the fifth game in the Mario Golf series. It was released in North America on July 29, 2003, in Japan on September 5, 2003, and in the PAL region on June 18, 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toadstool Tour is a golf game featuring characters and elements from the Mario series. There are 16 playable characters in total, each with a set of golfing statistics defining their style of play. The game's main mode involves the player competing in tournaments to obtain new features, although there are alternative modes consisting of training session and variations to the golf format. This includes &amp;quot;Ring Attack&amp;quot;, requiring the player to hit the ball through rings of varying sizes while remaining on or under par. Players can transfer characters between Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour and Mario Golf: Advance Tour using the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toadstool Tour received a positive reception from the media, gaining an aggregate score of 82% from Game Rankings. In general, reviewers praised the game's visuals, sound, and variety of courses, although a perceived lack of advancement from its predecessor was criticised. The game became part of the Player's Choice label in 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game marked the first appearance of a character from the Donkey Kong Country series (aside from the title character) in a Mario game: Diddy Kong (other DKC characters would go on to be featured in other Mario sports games later on).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mario_Golf:_Toadstool_Tour,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
