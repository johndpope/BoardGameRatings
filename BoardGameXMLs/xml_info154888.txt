			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George's Children is a story roleplaying game about children in a post-apocolyptic world devoid of adults. In this version of George&amp;rsquo;s Children, the characters are aged 7 to 12 on a journey to find the mysterious figure, known only as George. They have just one day to wake, find food, and journey to George before the sun sets. Perhaps George isn&amp;rsquo;t real? Perhaps he&amp;rsquo;s a legend? Or perhaps he can tell them where all of the adults have gone?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
