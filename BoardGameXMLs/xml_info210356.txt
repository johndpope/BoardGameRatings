							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kiss of Walt Whitman Still On My Lips</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play occurs as a conversation between players embodying pairs of queer lovers, immediately following the discovery of a mysterious and ancient artifact. You play using tarot cards, tapping aspects of yourself and providing hooks that other players can grab on to. You will use these Traits to influence your conversation and actions throughout the game, and you will use the Traits of your friends to get them involved as well. As the curious discoverers of The Artifact you will want to unlock as much knowledge as you can, keeping tally as the game progresses, but that knowledge comes at a price. Be cautious of attracting the attention of The Artifact&amp;rsquo;s destructive power, and try your best to keep your lover safe as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
