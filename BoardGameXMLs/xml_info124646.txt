							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Karmic Monsters: Chul&#039;achar</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you cut your way through the thick jungle undergrowth, a small reptilian biped appears in front of you.  It stops, tilting its head curiously.  At just over 3 ft tall, its awkward appearance and inquisitive nature make it appear harmless.  You reach into your backback to offer it a treat, and think maybe it would make an intriguing exotic pet.  Unfortunately, you never notice the rest of its pack circling you from behind...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chul'achar is a new monster for the Karma Roleplaying System.  This supplement includes the complete creature write up and stat block for the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an additional bonus, this supplement also includes a special 3.5 variant for use with the Neiyar: Land of Heaven and the Abyss 3.5 campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
