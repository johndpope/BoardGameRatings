							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Card Armies: Battle for Wesnoth</name>
									
			<description>Elvish archers are advancing through the forest, but you already have a line of loyal pikemen in place to hold them off while your mages drive the rebels out of the town. Suddenly word comes that your bowmen are falling back in disarray before the shadows rising out of the graveyard. With your reserves already stretched thin, you have only one chance to turn this around -- it's time to bring in the paladin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Armies: Battle For Wesnoth is a strategy game. You control an army in the fantasy world of Wesnoth, and must combine planning, tactics, and luck to emerge victorious over your rivals. The game can be played as one-on-one battles, multi-player mayhem, cooperative campaigns, and even solo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
