							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scrumpit</name>
									
			<description>Scrumpit is an &amp;lsquo;Old English&amp;rsquo; word which means to steal your neighbours&amp;rsquo; fruit &amp;ndash; The game is for 2, 3 or 4 players, involving tactics, strategy and wordplay with the option of scoring for yourself and/or frustrating other players by stealing their letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game. Each player aims to get their own colour letters into their &amp;lsquo;Home&amp;rsquo; Scrump zone of the same colour. Using typical crossword play techniques, each player endeavours to build words in their own homeward direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The moment a player (say yellow) has entered their own Yellow (&amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo;) Scrump zone, two actions come into play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firstly, the player entering their &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; Scrump zone begins to score points immediately, by multiplying the point value of each letter tile placed in the &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; Scrump zone by the value shown on the side of their &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; Scrump zone grid (1 to 7).&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, this player is now permitted to &amp;ldquo;Scrump&amp;rdquo; up to any two letters from anywhere in the central 15 x 15 board (you can even &amp;lsquo;Scrump&amp;rsquo; your own letters). Any &amp;lsquo;Scrumped&amp;rsquo; letters must be used in that turn. It does not matter if words are broken up as a result of the &amp;lsquo;Scrump&amp;rsquo;. However, it is part of the fiendish plan to frustrate you opponent(s) by scrumping their letters to stop them getting to their &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; Scrump zone. By doing this, they cannot score, and they cannot Scrump your letters until they are &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Any player reaching the &amp;ldquo;Apex Star&amp;rdquo; 7, finishes the game. All the other players must then deduct from their score, the value of the letter tiles remaining in their racks. The winner of the game will be the player who has the highest score &amp;ndash; not necessarily the player who finishes the game. To player a full match each player must have one turn at starting a game. A match consists of one game (turn to start) for each of the 2, 3 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
