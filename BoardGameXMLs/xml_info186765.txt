							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Liquibot Experiment</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2709 A.D., and man has conquered the galaxy using faster than light drives and vast armies of AI robots.  The mighty Solar Fedearation is, in truth, only a figurehead for the great interstellar corporations that control the Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, one of those Corporations, Blackstar Advanced Robotics, has made a major technological breakthrough.  A liquid metal robotic design has been created, that will allow unprecedented battlefield infiltration and regeneration capabilities.  Two high corporate executives and their staff are now taking the trade ship High Runner to a secret Federation testbed world, where the new robot design will be tested against captured alien xenomorphs.  Unofrtunately, these break free on board ship and begin to rampage.  The captain turns on the ship&amp;rsquo;s anti-hijack program, only to find that his robotic crew now grabs weapons and turns on the passengers.  The captain, mate, and the two Federation Lords and their companions will have to find a way to stop the xenomorphs and shut down the robots, or else escape from the ship alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
