			<description>You spin a spinner which as numbers to add and subtract and you move buses around to different buildings collecting apple tokens when you finish at the schoolhouse.  When there are no more apple tokens, the game is over.  The buildings and buses themselves are tiles themselves.  This is a part of the Schoolhouse in a Fun Box series be Ed-U-Cards.  Quite clever use of a roll &amp;amp; move mechanic to teach simple addsition and subtraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
