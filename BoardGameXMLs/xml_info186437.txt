			<description>Each player is dealt a cone card. The reverse side of it tells you what you should be adding to your ice cream cone: chocolate, strawberry or vanilla ice cream, almonds, cherries or wafer sticks. On your turn you draw a card and place it on your cone or replace the topmost card on your cone with the new card or you can place the card on someone else's cone. The game continues until everyone has five scoops on their cones. Then you score every card. If the card shows components that were required by your cone card you score positive points for the card and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
