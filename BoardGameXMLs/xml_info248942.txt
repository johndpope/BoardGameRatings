			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thunder Trains blaze their trail across the Known Lands, bringing trade back to the nations of Aden. Each of these massive engines pulls numerous transport cars, filled to the brim with cargo and sometimes passengers. At every stop, countless tons of cargo are removed and replaced with new goods, until the entire continent has been crossed and crossed again a dozen times over. It's not uncommon for traveling adventurers to catch a ride on a Thunder Train, but what will they find there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of the Aden Gazette includes details on the interior of the transport cars of the Thunder Trains as well as ample table to generate as much random cargo and passengers as you need for your adventure encounters! And with a full page tactical map of a transport car interior, Thunder Train encounters have never been so detailed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
