			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cadwallon is a tactical role-playing game published by Rackham. It is set in the fantasy world of the miniature wargame Confrontation. The combats are supposed to be played with miniatures from that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in Cadwallon, the Free City. Cadwallon is a cosmopolitan city outside of the conflicts of Ragnarok. The city is divided in eleven fiefdoms, each with its own ruling family. The families are vassals of the elected Duke. In addition to the duke and the nobility, the guild also wields considerable power. Player characters are all part of another power in the City: The Free Leagues, heirs to the mercenaries that helped to found the city. They are bound to the Duke, but may also be hired by all other people to do jobs for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have six base stats (attitudes), the value of which is determined by their race and culture. Furthermore, a character will belong to one or more classes (trades), which determine what his starting skills are, and what skills he can train. Finally, a character can have one or more distinctive features or feats, which give him special advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ability checks are made by rolling a number of D6s equal to your ability score. You then select the highest number rolled, add +1 for each additional time this number has been rolled, and then add the score of the corresponding attitude. If your total is greater than or equal to the difficulty of the test, you have succeeded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attitudes are more than simple stats, they reflect the behaviour of every character in the game (even NPC). If you are in the right attitude for specific actions, you may gain bonuses (free dice, for example).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also two different game modes: normal play and playing oppositions. Oppositions are a round-based game mode which may be used in combat and non-combat situations. Oppositions are the tactical part of the game where you have to use action and reaction pools that are split from the character's Potential. Every (re)action has to be paid with dice from the pools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
