							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quantum Flux: Unique Superscience Artifacts</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With his second law, that &amp;ldquo;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,&amp;rdquo; Arthur C. Clarke articulated a concept that could have been a shadowy undercurrent in the wider consciousness for centuries, possibly even millennia. All the items in this book were designed with two ideas in mind: they were created using Ancient technology so advanced that it seems like magic and they&amp;rsquo;ve gone through Hell since the apocalypse. Damaged, jury-rigged, infested with nanites and parasites, warped by energy, rebuilt by insane machines &amp;mdash; these are the kinds of changes that make these artifacts dangerous, unpredictable, and, above all, unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Flux contains 86 unique superscience artifacts suitable for use in any modern, sci-fi, or post-apocalyptic setting, and range from amulets to buildings. They were designed to show game masters the possibilities for superscience artifacts in their campaigns while emphasizing that these items are not just treasure or one sentence, throw-away items. Each has a history that will hopefully enrich, inspire, possibly even drive your own gaming story and most entries are longer and more detailed than for equivalent gear in other equipment or treasure books. Some entries contain plot hooks, some describe NPCs, others provide adventure locations in broad strokes, some have all of the above. Each artifact can become a central plot point or continuing idea for a whole gaming session &amp;mdash; or an entire campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Mutant Future&amp;rsquo;s compatibility with Goblinoid Games&amp;rsquo; fantasy and horror products in particular and OGL products in general, the contents of this book can easily be transported from one genre to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About half the contents of this book appeared previously in five issues of the Wisdom from the Wastelands game supplement, #39, #42, #44, #48, and #49.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
