			<description>My Baby Boy is a Nintendo DS video game released in North America on November 4, 2008 and in Europe on November 28, 2008.  The games teach players the skills of parenting (the player can choose to be a daddy or a mommy) and to the experience of raising a or son in the months that they spend as an infant. &lt;br/&gt;The player can choose a nationality for their child in addition to their eye color.  Players must create a given name (up to eight letters) to his or her character before beginning the actual game. However, there is no need to insert either a middle name or a surname because of memory constraints.  Two developmental challenges (i.e., teaching the baby how to speak or teaching the baby how to crawl) must be passed before the baby is allowed to grow by one month.  Using the microphone to expand the baby's vocabulary and the stylus to put on new clothes for them helps provide the challenges that new parents face with their infants every day.  Babies must be given baby formula in a bottle and the game is similar to the Tamagotchi devices of the mid 1990s.  There was originally an option to create a &amp;quot;My Baby&amp;quot; game combining two genders in one cartridge but the idea was funneled off into two different cartridges.  One of the other mandatory features of the game include flatulence, cooing, and the changing of the diaper when the baby urinates or has a bowel movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;My Baby Boy,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
