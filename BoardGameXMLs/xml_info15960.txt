							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Damon Hill Motorsport Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Players race around the monopoly style track around the edge of the board collecting sponsorship money and car bits.  This also qualifies them on the grid.  When all players have their cars on the grid players race around the track in the center of the board.  Race stewards and hazards may send you to the pits.  Team managers mark of the laps on a score card provided.  Simple game with nice cartoon style artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
