			<description>Whole game is now fully available as Print &amp;amp; Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of Moonriser is near-future Moon colonization. Players colonize the modular board, which represents a resource rich area on the Moon, by tile placement where tiles represent colony parts. The player whose colony has the highest value will become the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colony value consists of individual tile values and the values of functional relationships between individual tiles created by the tile's positions and rotations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is 2113. Mother Earth has shown her other face after a long period of prosperity. Ocean streams changed their directions, weather conditions started to be cruel and devastating. Mankind spent our last reserves of fossil fuels, global war has started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War is never good. On the other hand - it has positive influence on technology development. Mankind is able to control fusion power and reach space - to reach the Moon to be more precise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Moon - nobody was interested about the Moon just century ago with the exception of dreamers and poets. The Moon - a huge reserve of Helium-3 - new source of energy. The Moon - a new hope for a new life and peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four nations have sent their colonization ships to the Moon to get all those resources and to end the war - China, Europa, USA and India. Who will manage to conquer the Moon and to enter new age of mankind as a winner?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moonriser is a tactical card game for 2-4 players with playing time of about 60-90 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not only important WHAT cards are being played in this game but also HOW they are played in terms of their relative positions. Two players can have exactly the same cards but their territories built from those cards can have a completely different strength. One needs to plan really carefully how to place cards into your territory to use the full potential of those cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
