							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Fistful of Modern: 02</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the author of the '100' series of Adventure Seeds books, a new, shorter form source of inspiration for Games Masters. They might be adventures, non-player-characters, monsters, places... all ready to be dropped into your campaign, regardless of system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Little Boy Lost: A child and his father go missing, the mother is traumatised. It's obvious what happened. Right?&lt;br/&gt;    Anna &amp;amp; the Kings: A low level street contact stumbles upon some really, really dangerous information and needs help to be safe and to make use of it.&lt;br/&gt;    She Used to be Beautiful: A very old woman in a home is murdered. Who would do this to someone so close to death anyway and what's the point? How could they be a danger to anyone?&lt;br/&gt;    What it Takes to Feel: A series of seemingly random murders have only one link. A weeping woman seen at every scene.&lt;br/&gt;    Lay My Vengeance: The Irish and Italian mobs have someone cutting a swathe through their ranks with ironic, poetic and biblical punishments. They're desperate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
