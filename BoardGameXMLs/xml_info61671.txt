							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon&#039;s Legacy</name>
									
			<description>Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s Legacy is a set of rules allowing players to game warfare during the period 1795 to 1865, taking in the Napoleonic Wars to the American Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules arose from the collective fascination for the variety of conflicts during this period of history shared by the writing and testing team. We also felt that there was a need for a faster playing set of rules for the period that kept charts and calculations to a bare minimum. Legacy is a flowing game, with the element of surprise and frustration built in to simulate the Fog-of-War using commands issued by dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core rules apply to all the conflicts during the period. You will find that the battle tactics used by the warring nations throughout the period covered by these rules were taught to all officers under the huge shadow cast by Napoleon. With the army lists provided towards the back of the book there are additional rules for the conflicts in which these armies took part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Napoleonic doctrine would be present at every battle to 1865 and the end of the American Civil War: Johnny Reb and Billy Yank were part of Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s Legacy&amp;hellip;. As are you, as you play this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
