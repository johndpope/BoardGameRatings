			<description>&amp;quot;The Weider Game - it's more than a game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;An educational fitness game based on dice, trivia, and physical challenges.  Game play is divided into two parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with players trying to win medals in a series of events based mainly on dice rolls.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Weight Lifting - up to 3 dice rolls to gain the most points&lt;br/&gt;    Walking - dice roll race with some values given special meanings&lt;br/&gt;    Long Jump - simultaneous distance choice, identical numbers are canceled&lt;br/&gt;    High Jump - dice rolls for numbers higher than an incremental value&lt;br/&gt;    Sprint - dice roll race in turns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weider Marathon&lt;br/&gt;In the Weider Marathon players roll dice and move along the path.  On trivia squares, players answer educational questions about nutrition, anatomy, and sports.  Surprise squares often have the player trying to complete some physical task; some easy, some not.  Medals are used to fulfill a difficult question or challenge.  A player who retains a medal to the end does not have to finish with an exact dice roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
