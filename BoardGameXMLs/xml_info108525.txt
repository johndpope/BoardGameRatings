			<description>Horse and Musket miniatures rules for the period 1700 to 1900.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an innovative set of miniatures rules that uses both cards and dice to control various aspects of tactical battles, designed by Bob Jones of Piquet and Zouave fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play templates are provided to enable several wars within the period to be played immediately, while the players can easily adapt and modify other periods or even the base rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow for a tactical scale battle and will work with most figure sizes, with the emphasis on 28mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update:  The game has been reissued as Die Fighting II with many improvements and new mechanisms.  It is now in a Enhanced DVD Multimedia format which includes a 1 hour professionally produced and chaptered video; a slide show in both PDF and Quick Time Movie formats, and printable PDFs which include templates for a wide variety of periods from 1699-1902, player aids, Phase cards,a Rule Summary keyed to the video and slide show, and several other player aids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
