			<description>Taken from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breakfast at daVinci's is a quick game requiring some observation skills, for 2 or more players. Each card of the deck depicts a unique combination of ingredients and special symbols. Players are called to identify, after three cards have been placed face up on the table, how many complete breakfasts can be put together. As you may know, a &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; breakfast is made up of milk, coffee, sugar and donuts: all you have to do is quickly count all the relevant symbols on the cards but careful! The waiter's hand cancel an ingredient, while the &amp;quot; 2&amp;quot; doubles it... can you still find out how many happy clients you will have? If yes, congratulations!, but in order to score you still have to be the fastest to do so! After 9 rounds the game ends, and whoever has scored the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
