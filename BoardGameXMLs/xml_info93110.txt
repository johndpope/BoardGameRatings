			<description>From the CH webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHITE BEACH ONE: Peleliu 1944 is just for you if you are ready to smash your way ashore at the infamous island, as one of the soldiers of the 1st Marine Regiment under Marine nonpariel Chesty Puller. It's for you if you are ready for a colorful map, new die-cut counters depicting weapons like the T20 shoulder-fired mortar. If you want historical leader counters, a battlfield unlike any other in the annals of historical modules. Taut scenarios, easily digest special rules in two column format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ten hut!&amp;quot; It's time to get in the boats... then back out of the boats and ashore. You'll be wading in all the way as the water is shallow and inside the reef at Peleliu's White Beach One. And once you go ashore we're planning one way for you to come back out, and that' with a captured enemy battle flag clutched in your fist, the job done and done well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for the real deal. WHITE BEACH ONE: Peleliu 1944 is a new historical module that provides 8 scenarios, all playable on the new map and ranging from fast-play to monster. It includes a sheet of new color die-cut counters and special rules pages in two column format. If you've been following the HBO miniseries 'The Pacific&amp;quot; or perhaps read &amp;quot;With the Old Breed&amp;quot; a few times (we know you have) then you're already equipped with the intel that these here are Chesty Puller's Marines and you are ready for this experience NOW!&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME.  STATUS MARKERS, RULEBOOK, AND PLAY AIDS ARE NEEDED FROM ANY COMPLETE GAME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Japanese and Marine unit counters are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
