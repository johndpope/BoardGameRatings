			<description>Seasons change, and flowers blossom. The nature, sun, and wind enjoyed by visitors in the mountain are all beautiful memories of their journeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formosa Flowers is adapted from (inspired by) a traditional Japanese card game, Hanafuda. Through playing flower cards of the same months, players collect required icons for card sets. In the game, the timing of scoring is very important. Obtaining high points while scoring before other players leave the round requires skill and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
