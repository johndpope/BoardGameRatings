			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Fight between two groups of kids on the playground. Victory: Drive the opposing gang off the playground.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Eight to ten spaces are marked with obstacles such as Jungle Gyms, Monkey Bars, Teeter Tooters, Swings, Slides, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miniatures or counters are used to represent the kids. Each side has eight kids - two are on skateboards, two are on bikes, and 2 have skates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the shared deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
