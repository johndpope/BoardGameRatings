			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 24 x 20 inch, full color battlemap of a Medieval Tavern .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT), and include a 360 degree view of the interior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Someone has poisoned and killed the winner of tonight&amp;rsquo;s tale telling contest, Brad. No one leaves until the city guard gets here and can begin their investigation.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Fireside Tavern Barkeep&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Tavern is a combination of the interior of a medieval tavern and the exterior grassland surroundings outside. The product includes a 360-degree panoramic view from inside the tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Tavern is intended for use in fantasy and medieval historical period settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tale Telling Contest: The Fireside Tavern has a contest on Saturday nights. Meat is roasted in the center of the inn, usually pork but sometimes beef. While the meat is cooked, a tale telling contest is held around the fire. The bard with the best tale gets a free cut of pork or steak. The combination of the smell of roasting meat and anticipation of a good meal paired with ale and mead paired with good stories being told packs The Fireside on Saturdays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group may visit The Fireside to rest after an adventure. A bard or troubadour character might even be actively part of the contest.  The night goes as planned until the winner of the contest, Brad, eats his free steak, becomes violently ill, and drops dead. The barkeeper seals The Fireside to prevent the killer from leaving and waits for the city guard to arrive and begin an investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group may be able to convince the barkeep to allow them to head the investigation until the city guards arrive provided they were not part of the contest and their reputation is good. Everyone in the tale telling contest is a potential suspect as well as the kitchen staff. The assassin who poisoned the steak is still in the tavern and the group should be given a chance to ferret him out before the city guards arrive. If they do figure out who is the assassin, they have to deal with a powerful poisoner who loves to use envenomed light weapons to deliver his deadly venoms to his victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who ordered the hit on Brad? A fellow bard who lost the contest too many times and hated his rival enough to kill him? A rival tavern sick of the Fireside&amp;rsquo;s Saturday night dominance determined to ruin the reputation of the storytelling contest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
