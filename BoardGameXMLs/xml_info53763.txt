			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to BALDEMAR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this booming town on the banks of the river Wythyn, danger and adventure lurk at every turn.  Stroll the quaint streets of Old Town, where the Guild Council conducts the government's business.  Visit the shops of New Town and purchase exotic items from the far corners of the earth.  Crosriver caters to adventurers, offering food, entertainment, and services.  But only the boldest dare enter the dark alleys of the Warrens, where the cruel Warren Lords dispense their own brands of justice...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baldemar is a complete town setting in the medieval style, compatible with any fantasy role-playing game.  it describes over 450 buildings and 125 noteworthy residents, which you can customize for your own campaign with less than an hour's work.  Full personality sketches of Baldemar's most important citizens are included for maximum role-playing enjoyment, but you determine their actual powers and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baldemar also offers a game system for handling public opinion -- both political and social -- that is so simple, yet so versatile, that you will want to use it for your entire campaign!  This valuable tool can add an extra dimension to your game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
