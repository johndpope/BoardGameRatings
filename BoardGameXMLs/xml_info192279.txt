			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tremendous earthquake has diverted the raging river that has separated the Ablas and Ublas for decades, reuniting the two tribes. The only problem is that each tribe's language has changed over the years, and they cannot understand each other. Queen Abla and King Ubla, needs you work together in a series of crazy challenges in order to communicate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Abla Ubla!&amp;rdquo; is a family/party game for 4-12 players, for ages 10+. The duration of the game is approximately 30&amp;rsquo; minutes. Players form 2 teams, in which they write down words and try to describe them to their teammates as quickly as possible, but must abide by the rules and the challenges of the Abla-ublas, like speaking with their tongue hanging out their mouth or keep their teeth clenched together while talking, in order to work out what on earth their team-mates are trying to describe! The game contains 85 Category cards that can be erased when filled up and 15 Challenge cards that will keep players excited for a long time! There are 2 modes that we can use the Challenge cards, for even greater replayability. The team with the most Victory Points wins the game. So get ready to Twist your tongue and tangle your words!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
