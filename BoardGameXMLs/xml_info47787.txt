Magic is now as unique and creative as you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sourcebook shows you how to adapt your current world or create a new one of your very own.

This is a game that you will grow with, but never grow out of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hero System is a series of games that work alone or together.

It's everything you could want in a game and more.  The magic has come back to gaming with Fantasy Hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
