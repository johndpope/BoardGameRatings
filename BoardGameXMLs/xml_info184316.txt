			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is designed for players and GMs alike to create their very own ships as quickly as a couple minutes. It's fully compatible with the White Star Roleplaying Game, and ports easily over to any other OSR system, if it's not already 100% compatible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It goes beyond the basics of starships presented in the White Star core rulebook to allow deeper customization with a standardized point-buy system. There's no bookkeeping beyond spending your points and choosing what you want the final stats (HP, Armor Class, etc.) to be. No poring over endless tables to find which hull rating your ship has and thus which reactor and other equipment it needs to install!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's an expanded space combat system that gives every crew member something interesting to do during a fight, not just the Pilot. Five new classes, the Commander, Engineer, Flight Officer, Medical Officer and Science Officer expand the rich class selection of White Star with more space-themed character options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interstellar travel section allows you to send your players to the stars with new rules for using FTL drives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new selection of four ships, three designed for players and one to use as an antagonist, rounds out the book. Fly the Lightning Bug-class courier on smuggling missions, shuttle all sorts of interesting passengers through the galaxy with the Queen of New Brisbane-class yacht and engage your enemies in combat with the devastating Swallow-class fighter. Pit the players against the fearsome Supremacy-class super dreadnaught for the fight of their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure is at every star, and with Galactic Ship Ops you can take your game there immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
