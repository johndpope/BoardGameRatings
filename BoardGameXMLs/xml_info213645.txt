			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;忍城の戦い (Oshi-jō no tatakai) translates in English as Battle of Oshi-jō, although  'The Siege Of Oshi' would be a more accurate name for this wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in 2011 by a small doujin circle Dōjin Club Ludens Faber (同人会ルデンス・ファベル), the designers and illustrators of the game want to remain anonymous. The game was produced in a polybag, with an A4 map, an A5 booklet of rules and history, and a small sheet of counters. This game was later substantially revised and upgraded and published in a new game Battle of Oshi-jou, with a larger map, revised rules and more than double the number of units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1590 Siege of Oshi (忍城の戦い Oshi-jō no tatakai) was a battle during Japan's Sengoku period. Oshi Castle, a stronghold of the Narita clan, was besieged by forces loyal to the Toyotomi clan. The castle was famously defended for over a month by a force consisting of only 619 samurai and 2000 local conscripts against forces numbering over 20,000. The battle is also famous for the actions of Lady Kai (甲斐姫 / Kaihime), who led 200 Narita men into battle to rout the initial attack against the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game incorporates standard hex-and-counter movement on a map representing the region around the castle. The game proceeds in an &amp;quot;IGO-UGO&amp;quot; manner. Units may perform ranged fire in an attempt to cause enemy units to become disordered (recovery from disorder may be attempted at the beginning of each turn). Enemy units may also return fire to cause disorder on their attackers. Close combat proceeds on a simplified, odds-based combat resolution table using a single die (d6), and can result in disorder, losses and retreat. If an army suffers enough losses, it becomes demoralized, suffering combat penalties and the elimination of any unit that becomes disordered. The game includes special rules for Lady Kai's ability to boost the morale of conscript units under her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;A4 map (210mm &amp;times; 297mm / 8.3&amp;quot; &amp;times; 11.7&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;50 mounted, back-printed counters (not die-cut)&lt;br/&gt;A5 rulebook: two pages historical notes, four pages &amp;quot;Warring States Folio&amp;quot; series rules, two pages game-specific rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
