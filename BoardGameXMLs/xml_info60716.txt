			<description>Each player has a cherry tree and places a number of cherries (red chips) on the fields of the tree. Some worms have to be covered, too. The active player now takes cherries from other players' trees and places them on his or her tree until he or she uncovers a worm. Then it's the next player's turn. The first player to have filled his or her entire tree with cherries is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
