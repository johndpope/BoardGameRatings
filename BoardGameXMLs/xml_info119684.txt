			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Do you like singing? What about the singing games? Random Sopanen (artist) - Play and Sing is a fun children's game in which you qualify Satu Sopanen colorful and joyous songs of the world. Do you recognize the right words of the song? Do you know how to perform fun tasks properly? In this game, the main issue is having fun with music! Fairy-tale songs from Sopanen has characters to act a like and there are different music programs. Sing and act with Random children's favorite performers and act out the musical instruments in air. Includes CD's, with 18 pieces of previously unreleased songs, and Satu Sopaselta Tuttiorkesterilta.&lt;br/&gt;Game idea is to collect the full piano (made from puzzle pieces,  6 of them). Each player in his/her turn takes a card (from 4 different categories) and acts accordingly. You either have to act the singer (moving mouth to the words), make instruments in the air, sing along with the music making the sound of the animal you drew with the card or be part of the duet. You are scored by other players, basically if they are happy with the performance and collect a piece. If not happy, you may take another card and try again. If still not happy, you pass and wait for the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;Game is over when piano is completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
