							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Briefcase: City Hall</name>
									
			<description>This is an 11 card expansion for Briefcase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It includes 8 City Hall office cards and 3 Inspector cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offices: For each game players randomly choose 4 of those offices to use in the game. At the start of each turn, each player may activate one office and take advantage of its one-time ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspectors: All Inspector cards are shuffled in the Buy deck. If, while producing a new B card, a player reveals an Inspector card, he/she must also place the Inspector card in to his/her discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;When a player draws an Inspector card, he/she may play a Buy card to pass the Inspector card to the player on their left. When the game ends, players lose one victory point for each Inspector card remaining in their deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
