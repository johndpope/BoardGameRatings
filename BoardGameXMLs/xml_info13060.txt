			<description>Based upon the Guinness Book Of Records, players answer trivia questions to complete a medal on the board. The game has a large board showing a medallion with spaces in relief to take discs and shapes. There are two cartons of 4750+ question card, and a large book of striking colour pictures referenced in some of the questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a record fact (Fact - The worse reported case of compulsive swallowing was by a female who complained of 'slight abdominal pain'. She had 2533 objects, including 947 bent pins, in her stomach.) and then 4 questions of increasing difficult vaguely related to the fact just read out (What was invented by American Walter Hunt in 1849?). Answer the questions correctly and collect the right pieces to complete your side of the medallion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
