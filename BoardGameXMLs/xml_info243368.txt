							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inner Chains</name>
									
			<description>Inner Chains is an FPS (18+) horror embedded in an unprecedented surreal world. The objective of the player is to understand and unravel the mysteries of the mystical world while overcoming many dangers created by the biomechanical environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world, in which we find ourselves in Inner Chains no longer resembles the one we know. It is the world that is hunting us &amp;ndash; we are a small part of it trying to unravel its mysteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throwing you into the dark and mysterious world, we want to make you feel lost, discover it piece by piece and learn to use it against enemies. In designing the levels, we want them always to have more than just one way to the goal. We will not walk you through it. We will only give you clues. How you handle this alien and hostile place depends entirely on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From forgotten, mountain ruins, through a dangerous forest where flora and fauna are our mortal enemies, to the great temples built by a mysterious caste, whose existence and objectives hide many secrets &amp;ndash; wandering through this world you will be able to learn about the story carved in these places, and use it to fight the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
