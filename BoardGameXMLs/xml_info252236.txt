			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar, but is a stab at the health of human society.&amp;rdquo; â€• Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As long as there have been people, there have been secrets. And as long as there have been secrets, there have been those whose mission is to discover those secrets. Espionage is the practice of gaining information without the consent &amp;mdash; or preferably knowledge &amp;mdash; of the information&amp;rsquo;s owner. Thanks to popular media, intelligence agents (also known as operatives or spies) are presented as dashing, resourceful, hypercharged superheroes, capable of breathtaking feats of derring-do and seduction in the pursuit of information or larger-than-life villains. In reality, the life of an agent is rarely one of guns, tuxedos and car chases; most real-life spies report that the tradecraft (the practices and tools of espionage) is actually one of patience, lots of talking to various people, and above all not being noticed. Now 2D6 players can operate in the shadowy world of intelligence gathering and espionage. Violation of Truth is an RPG supplement based on the Mongoose 1st Edition 2D6 OGL system (which is itself based on The Original Science-Fiction Roleplaying Game first published in the 1970s) and adapted to create heroes and adventures suitable for an espionage campaign. The system takes a back seat to Referee and player creativity, allowing them to craft the missions they want within a framework of minimal rules. Nine distinctive Disciplines are offered within the category or one career: Agent. Also offered are rules for building a network of contacts; adapting the rules for use during career generation; additional skills; expanded equipment and vehicle lists; and a discussion of integrating martial arts into the game, using a stripped-down version of 2D6 Martial Arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Violation of Truth: live a life of lies to get at the truth of what the enemy is doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
