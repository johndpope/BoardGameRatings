			<description>A card game for 2-4 players based on the Dark Crystal movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck. Of these, 11 can be utilised to create a Crystal Combo (required to win the game), the others have special abilities which allow players to undertake a variety of actions (i.e. draw cards, steal cards, look at cards, switch hands &amp;hellip;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start each player is dealt 3 cards. 12 cards are then spread facedown evenly over the play area &amp;ndash; these are called Table cards and are available to be drawn (picked) by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns, with each turn having 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Fate Phase &lt;br/&gt;-   Take the top 2 cards of the deck and place them face down on the play area. If there are ever 12 or less Table cards available, draw and place extra cards face down until there are at least 12 Table cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Prophecy Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may play 1 card to use its special ability. When you play a card either discard it or return it face down to the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Quest Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 3 Table cards and put 2 of them in your hand. Return 1 of these cards to the Table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Crystal Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Reveal the Crystal Combo if you have it to win and end the game. The combo must contain 4 cards: one of each of the following 4 types: &lt;br/&gt;I. The Gelfling or Jan or Kira card&lt;br/&gt;II. The Crystal Shard or Dark Crystal card&lt;br/&gt;III. The Castle of the Crystal or Sacred Chamber card&lt;br/&gt;IV. The Grand Conjunction or Alignment of the Suns or Heal the Crystal card&lt;br/&gt;The Prophecy card can be used as a wild card for any of the 4 types of cards needed in a combo. &lt;br/&gt;-   If not, max hand size is 5 cards.
