							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broch Groddath</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers are hired to find an unusual object that is believed to be among the collections of a strange, disgraced family, in a great home that is shunned. The item is indeed there, as are clues about the family and its fall...and worse things...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROCH GRODDATH is a &amp;ldquo;haunted house&amp;rdquo; scenario, with its own defining twists. Its key features are creepy atmosphere, disorientation, and horror. It touches on several genres and themes, including Low Fantasy, Sword and Sorcery, Cosmic Horror, and Dungeon Crawling. A fantasy milieu is assumed, but with moderate changes it could be played in a modern Lovecraftian setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is intended as a one-shot adventure, to be dropped into an existing campaign, without larger implications (unless desired). Probably two sessions are needed to play it out. The scenario is written for four adventurers, but three or five should be fine. Four sample characters are included, for an instant start to a weekend&amp;rsquo;s fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical details have been constructed using the MYTHRAS game system from The Design Mechanism. The write-up should translate well to other d100-style rules (and still other systems, with more work).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
