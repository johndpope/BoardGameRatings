			<description>The players start from different cities and have to travel by plane around the world and back to their starting point. The players roll a die to earn money. They get as many coins as they roll eyes. When they have got enough coins to pay for their journey to the next city (as indicatet near the black line between the cities) they roll the color-die to determine if the reach the city (blue), wait one turn for better weather (yellow) or have engine trouble (red). In the later case the have to pay for the journey, but have to stay where they are and resume to earn money. The first player to complete his world tour wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
