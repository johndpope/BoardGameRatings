			<description>A game in the Mancala family adapted from Tschuba with a novel starting position. Associated 1891 US patent: number 448,574.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description following provided by Milton Bradley prior to 1897.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chuba is an adaptation from a rude game of Eastern Africa which is greatly enjoyed by the natives, who squat on the ground, and play in holes scooped out of the sand, using shells, young coconuts, etc., for counters, which they move from hole to hole.&lt;br/&gt;As now presented to the civilized world for its diversion, Chuba is a game of skill for two players. It is made up of a board with 4 parallel rows or pockets, 11 in each row, and 60 small beads used as men or counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who captures all his opponent's men.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
