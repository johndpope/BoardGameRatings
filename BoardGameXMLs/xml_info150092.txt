			<description>In Construction Site, you and your friends are builders. You have received the plans for the buildings you will construct and you have ordered the materials you will need to build. However, there has been a mix-up. Instead of receiving the materials you asked for, you get random shipments delivered at regular intervals. You and your fellow builders must team up to sort through the mess, selling what materials you can to pay for the materials you need before time runs out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One to four players must follow Blueprint cards and play Material cards to build the structures on the Blueprints before the deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to &amp;quot;pay&amp;quot; for any Materials that they play by discarding other cards from their hands or removing cards from the Material deck. When a Blueprint is completed, players earn a reward, which is to return some cards from the discard pile to the Material deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construction Site fits in a small box that fits in your pocket, containing all necessary components to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
