			<description>This is an old Parker Brothers game that simulates a day at the links. The game board depicts an entire 18 hole golf coarse with tees, greens, fairways, and hazards. The fairways have lines marked on them to indicate yardage. Each player has a ball pin to indicate their locations on a hole. A deck of cards is used to indicate the results of a swing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player calls out the club he is using, choosing from a (very 1920s) selection of: Driver, Brassie, Midiron, Mashie, Mashie-Niblick, Niblick, Putter. The player then turns over the top card, consults the club he called, and moves his pin down the fairway the amount of yards indicated. Some cards indicate a poor swing by declaring the ball out of bounds or in the rough. A ball landing in a hazard has a limited club selection for its next shot. For example, a ball in the rough can only be played with a Mashie, a Mashie-Niblick, or a Niblick. When a player's yardage generated equals the yardage of the hole, he has holed out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since this is an old game that was published before stroke play became the standard, the winner is the player who won the most holes (match play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
