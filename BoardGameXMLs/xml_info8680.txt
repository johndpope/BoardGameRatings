			<description>FROM THE BOX:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When last we left the Flatt Marble Company, George Flatt had a gorgeous new secretary. She had George dreaming. She had Slate, his son, scheming. She had Aggie, George's long-suffering wife, steaming. Then she walked in...Fetisha! What's the Flatt family to do? Will Slate get the girl? If so, which one? Where does that leave George? Will he lose his wife? Or just his marbles? Tune in and if you play your cards right. you'll get out of all these...and more...Predicaments.&lt;br/&gt; You'll become part of the story. Just answer the questions these wild characters ask you and earn points which move you around the game board. Be the first one around the board twice and you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the world of soap operas shocking scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a VCR game in which players watch parody scenes from a soap opera and use game cards to answer questions asked by the characters in the scene. Answers are often quite humorous and may also fall in the &amp;quot;None of your business&amp;quot; category. Players score points according to the value of the answer cards they played during the scene. Players move around the board according to points scored at the end of each scene. The first player to make it around the board twice wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great game to play after the kids are in bed since the themes are much more suitable to adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
