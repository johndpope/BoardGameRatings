							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Hero Memoir 40K</name>
									
			<description>A mashup board game lifting components and rules from the three games Memoir '44, Space Crusade, and Heroscape. The result is a 40K themed light 3d combat game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the basic section cards of Memoir '44 to control troops, players move their figures across the landscape looking for the &amp;quot;artefact&amp;quot; glyph, after which they need to get it back across their own base line to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the board from Memoir 44, the terrain from Heroscape and the figures from Space Crusade. Line of sight is a physical vision, just like in Heroscape. Each player controls two teams of 5 figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
