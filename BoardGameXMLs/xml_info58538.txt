			<description>From the publishers website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Fleets II is a miniatures game of naval warfare during the age of the battleship. From the ironclads of the late 1800s to the super-dreadnoughts of World War II, players can take command of the ships that altered the course of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great pains have been taken to accommodate a wide range of preferences: hexes or no hexes; any miniatures scale; simultaneous or sequential play. The choices are up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the basic rules for surface actions between 1890 and 1940, Grand Fleets includes advanced rules for things like time of day, smokescreens, crew quality, and destroyer flotillas. Best of all, you'll never have to wait for &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; publication of your favorite ships: comprehensive, step-by-step guidelines are provided to generate data cards for any vessel that put to sea during the battleship era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, raise the battle ensign, sound general quarters, and damn the torpedoes! your destiny awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
