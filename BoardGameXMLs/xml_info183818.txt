			<description>From the Intorduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a system for referees to create new races and feats for their campaign settings. An appendix at the end contains 38 example races in short form ready to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is this different from all the other fan-created races?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons players have been using unusual races since the days of 1st edition, which had tens of magazine articles offering new races. Therefore it is unsurprising that we are seeing a lot of fan-created races for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition (5e). Some of these look good and balanced, others are obviously over-powered, and some look fine but on deeper inspection are 'out'. This is because these races are created by using the Player's Handbook (PHB) races as a rough template in a monkey see, monkey do fashion and relying on intuition to judge whether the traits and overall result are balanced. The problem is, with a new game this past experience from other editions can be misleading and so intuition is flawed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So how is this article different? In Part 2 I have analysed all the race and feat traits in the PHB, Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG), and Elemental Evil Player's Companion (EEPC) and then reverse engineered the system Wizards of the Coast uses in-house to create PC races. There may be differences in some of the relative point values presented here but otherwise this is what WOTC uses. This provides a basis beyond intuition to evaluate races and greater creative freedom than using existing races as templates. I'm confident most of the races produced by this process will be balanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How's this different from last time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have already released one article describing a method to convert monsters into PC races (RPG Review issue 25). This new article uses a simpler point-buy method. Not only is this easier but it enables you to create new races from your own imagination or recreate classic PC races from previous editions. This version also takes into account the PHB errata released in 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
