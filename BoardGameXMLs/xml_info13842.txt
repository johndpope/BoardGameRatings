							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Spot</name>
									
			<description>Hot Spot is played on a board that has 64 spaces (8x8) like a checkerboard/chessboard. Each player starts with 12 pieces, each containing a number 1, 2, or 3, denoting how many spaces the piece moves. Pieces may only move in straight lines and over or onto their own or the opponent's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces are captured by being in an opponent's movement range. The captured piece is turned over on the board. The game is won, when a player's eight pieces are captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer, Daniel E, McGuire, sent a copy of the rules to Martin Gardner in 1961.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martin then forwarded the rules of Hot Spot to Sid Sackson on 1/ 2/ 62.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spotnik is a military type of game in which simulated artillery pieces are used in an interesting battle of wits between two opponents.  It is a game of fast action and short playing time, averaging about 30 minutes.  It is played upon a standard checker or chess board.  It was sent to Parker Brothers in 1960 for consideration.  On 3/20/61, he writes Martin Gardner to share that it is to be manufactured by Parker Brothers under the new name Hot Spot.  On May 25, 1961 in a letter to Martin Gardner, he shares that he has recently toured the factory where Parker games are made.  In addition, the Pittsburg Post-Gazette published a story on 6/11/61 in their Sunday magazine section with a picture of Mr. McGuire and his younger son Eugene playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Strong Museum&lt;br/&gt;The Brian Sutton-Smith Library &amp;amp; Archives of Play&lt;br/&gt;Sid Sackson Collection&lt;br/&gt;Box 1-2.6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
