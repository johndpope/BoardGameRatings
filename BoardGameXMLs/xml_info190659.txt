							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RCA Studio II</name>
									
			<description>The graphics of Studio II games were black and white and resembled those of earlier Pong consoles and their clones. The Studio II also did not have joysticks or similar game controllers but instead used two ten button keypads that were built into the console itself. The console was capable of making simple beep sounds with slight variations in tone and length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;RCA Studio II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
