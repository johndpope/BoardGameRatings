			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 2nd-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six&lt;br/&gt;agents of levels 7, 12, or 17 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agency &amp;ldquo;administrator&amp;rdquo; known as Asylum &amp;mdash; the &amp;ldquo;Ninth Man&amp;rdquo; and head of Agency internal security &amp;mdash; is in fact a traitor within the organization. As a member of the Invisible Hand criminal organization, Asylum obtained his position through blackmail and coercion, and has since used his position to conceal the Hand&amp;rsquo;s activities as they acquire advanced technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the Invisible Hand is ready to make a major worldwide move against the Agency, but requires one final piece of technology &amp;mdash; an Agency decoder unit. To acquire this device, the villains target the Agency&amp;rsquo;s San Francisco base of operations, a communications hub for its U.S., Pacific, and East Asian offices. They must take care to ensure that the Agency doesn&amp;rsquo;t discover that its device has been stolen, or the codes will be changed. The Hand&amp;rsquo;s solution is to destroy the base during the theft &amp;mdash; along with everyone in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
