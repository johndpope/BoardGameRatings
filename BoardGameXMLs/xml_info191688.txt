			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;A game for two players, one of whom plays the Lover, and the other the Beloved.&lt;br/&gt;The Lover is deeply enamoured with the Beloved and makes romantic entreaties, always declaring their love. The Beloved is initially reciprocal but grows more distant as the game progresses. In order to elicit a positive response from the Beloved, the Lover must tear a banknote whilst declaring their love; the further the game has progresses, the more passionate a response the Beloved will give in reaction, but also the more rapid their reversion will be, and the more negative will their default mood be.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after fifteen minutes with the Beloved leaving the room, and the Lover left to put the banknotes back together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
