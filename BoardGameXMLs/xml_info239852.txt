			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your first life is your own. The rest belong to the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phoenix: Dawn Command is fantasy roleplaying game by Dan Garrison and Keith Baker. It's a story-driven game that combines action and mystery. You are the last hope of a world besieged by nightmares. You possess supernatural power, but you'll never defeat the Dread unless you can unravel its mysteries. Your misions are dangerous, and you may not survive the night... but death is how you gain power. You're a Phoenix, and you have seven lives to save the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the core rulebook for Phoenix: Dawn Command, providing all you need to know about the setting and the system of the game. This PDF includes the seven-mission adventure arc Dark Omens. However, THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME. PDC uses a card-based resolution system and you must own these cards to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
