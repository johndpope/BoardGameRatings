							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Future/Perfect: Part 4</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future/Perfect: Part 4 details the &amp;quot;Offsite&amp;quot; location, which can be reached from the facility found at the end of Future/Perfect: Part 3, and describes events that occur at an outpost in the distant past. Part 4 also introduces some additional elements that may be used throughout parts 1&amp;ndash;3 if desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is highly recommended that Part 4 not be used as the introduction to this campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The depth and complexity (as well as the remote location&amp;mdash;in time and space) make Part 4 ideal as the culmination of the campaign and it is those same qualities that make it difficult if not impossible to imagine as a beginning. Parts 1, 2, or 3 should be used to ease the players into the subtleties and convolutions of the mission before Part 4 is even attempted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, adding elements from Part 4 (the Motion, the Great Race Agent) throughout other Parts of the campaign to expand and expound upon the mysteries presented here will help to reinforce the impact of Part 4 if and when it does arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
