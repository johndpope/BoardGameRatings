			<description>Shelfie is all about arranging your board games on the shelf. With unique goals and interest every game shelf will look different. Manage your hand of cards and utilize their powers to arrange and rearrange games on the shelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place cards into your library and unlock abilities. You can swap games, move games, acquire new games, or discard games. Each player has a type of game they love and a type they hate. Secret goals along the way help give focus to how your game shelf should be arranged. At the end you'll take a shelfie and see who has the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are awarded for alphabetical order and for shelf arrangement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
