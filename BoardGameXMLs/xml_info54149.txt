							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Whimsy Cards</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Whimsy Card gives a player the opportunity to break into the storyline and add something to the ongoing story in a certain way.  Each Whimsy Card allows a different kind of intervention, but interpretation of just what a particular Whimsy allows is mostly up to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Whimsey Deck contains 48 cards.  One is the title card and three are blanks.  Each of the other 44 cards has a title and a short description to guide you, as well as an illustration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are given one or more Whimsy Cards at the start of an adventure.  When a player plays a card that aids the troupe, the card is usually not replaced.  A player who plays cards that adds detail to the story line or even makes the troupes job more difficult may receive one or even two replacement cards.  Players may always veto cards that affect their character and, of course, GMs may veto any card use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
