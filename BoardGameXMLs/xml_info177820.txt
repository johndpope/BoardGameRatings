							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ryubix Manor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ryubix Manor is a 300+ area haunted house adventure, written in a system agnostic style (OSR/OGL compatible), and is suitable for most fantasy role playing games. For 4-8 players, scalable up to 20th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three brothers &amp;ndash; Staunton, Segar, and Severin &amp;ndash; founded House Ryubix four centuries ago atop the windswept hills of the southern coast. The Ryubix brothers were respected Lords of Order, who ruled fairly (and taxed lightly) the small but thriving community under their protection. Unfortunately, the descendants of Ryubix Manor would begin down a path that would ultimately lead to their own destruction. Born into a life of idleness and ease, the subsequent Ryubix lineage slowly descended into wickedness, each successive generation subtly worse than the last. A unique curse lies on Ryubix Manor, one tied not only to the Manor, but to the Ryubix line itself. The haunting of the Manor has endured for 111 years. It is now up to you to break the curse and cleanse Ryubix Manor once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
