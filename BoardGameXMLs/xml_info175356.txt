							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minilaous Keep</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minilaous is a keep and barony southwest of the Kandian city of Aleath. The keep is nestled atop the high cliffs of Mercia Bay. The region has a rich heritage, arising from a mix of cultures. The area was decimated during the Thecracy of Tekhos but emerged as an independent kingdom before becoming part of the Kindom of Kanday. The barony is held by Baroness Iala Pesirias, the only female tenant-in-chief in the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minilaous Keep article describes the settlement's history, government, religion, and economics, and provides details for some of its craftsmen and other locations. A full description and color floor plans are given for the keep. Also includes color local maps for GMs and players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portions of this article were originally published in 2001 as part of the Web of the Widow CD-ROM adventure module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
