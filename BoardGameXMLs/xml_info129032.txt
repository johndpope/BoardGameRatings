							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Flight</name>
									
			<description>A World War II era card game where each player tries to be the first to complete a &amp;quot;Flight&amp;quot; and win the game by playing a Terminal card on his/her turn. A completed Flight consists of an Aeroplane card, A Pilot card, Map cards and a Terminal card all of the same color. The Air Hostess card (acting as a wild card) may substitute for any Flight card to assist in completing a Flight. Players first draw a terminal card to determine which Flight they need to complete. These are kept face down. Six cards from the deck are then drawn for each player and play continues with each player attempting to complete the Flight color that matches their Terminal card. All flight cards played are placed face up and used communally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A point variation for this game my be played where players not completing a Flight total the points from the cards remaining in their hands and the lowest cumulative score over four completed games is declared the winner. In this version all cards except the Air Hostess (50 points) have an assigned value of 10 points. In this version penalty points (100) for poor play may be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 60 cards divided as follows: 4 Aeroplane cards. 4 Pilot cards, 36 Map cards (9 for each of 4 flights numbered 2 through 10), 4 Storm cards, 4 Storm Buster cards, 1 Air Hostess (wild) card, 7 Terminal cards. Cards are colored white, yellow, blue and pink for each of the 4 flights. The Air Hostess (wild) card is green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
