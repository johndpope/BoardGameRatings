			<description>Madden NFL 09 is an American football video game based on the National Football League that was published by EA Sports and developed by EA Tiburon. It is the 20th annual installment in the Madden NFL video game franchise. This game is known for realistic graphics and big hits. The game was released for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles, as well as mobile devices. It was also the last game ever made for the Xbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike previous versions, the game was not released for the PC. EA Sports has said that they are &amp;quot;retooling the PC version&amp;quot; after not making 09. Despite these claims of 'retooling', PC users were again ignored the following year as no Windows version of Madden 10 were released.In June 2009, EA Sports announced that for the year 2010, the games Madden NFL, NCAA Football, NASCAR, NHL, NBA Live, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour would not be shipped for Microsoft Windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wii version of the game is titled Madden NFL 09 All-Play and was launched under EA Sports' new All-Play brand exclusive to the platform, taking a slightly different approach to the game and taking advantage of the motion controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_09,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_09,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
