			<description>Welcome to the Vietnam Air War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phantom Leader places you in command of a US Air Force or US Navy Tactical Fighter squadron in Vietnam between 1964 and 1972. You must not only destroy the targets but you must also balance the delicate political repercussions of your attacks. If you strike too hard, your air offensive might be put on hold, strike too light, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be blamed for losing the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the campaigns can be played with either an Air Force or Navy squadron. The targets assigned to each service are different and change the complexion of the campaigns. Each campaign can be played with three different durations of: Skirmish, Conflict, or War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
