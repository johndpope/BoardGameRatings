			<description>The player is the CEO of a movie studio during the golden age of Hollywood (1927-1955). Competition for talented people is fierce, and the public's tastes in movies change all the time. The player has to manage and hire new people, and approve the right films, so that the have as much Fame (victory points) as possible, at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created for the 2013 Solitaire Print and Play contest, Cine-vilzation uses six small containers to manage the production and payout of film genres.  Players have to do their best to predict when films will become popular, as timing a film release correctly will earn the player fame and clout in the film industry, which can help produce even more films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve film types are grouped into three genres centered around the resources that make Hollywood run, capital, acclaim and power.  Players keep track of these resources, using tokens, dice and cards. The tokens can only be used once, and may need to be held to pay upkeep costs at the end of each round.  Cards can be played to help pay for a film, but holding on to them will generate tokens. Dice can be used multiple times, but cost tokens each round.  Dice also control an invisible opponent, who tries to get cards before you do, and speeds up the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have to evaluate their supply of resources, the popularity of films, and how much time remains to try to make the best films they can.   When resources are dedicated to a film, they get placed into a container, and will be unavailable for several rounds.  The containers shift during upkeep, with any dice inside the first container getting rolled for the AI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
