			<description>City Blocks is an abstract game of placing &amp;ldquo;pentomino&amp;rdquo; pieces onto a 20 by 20 square board for 2 or 4 players.  Each player takes turns either placing a single piece onto the board or passing.  When all players pass in the same round the game ends, scores are calculated and the winner announced.  Points are scored for the largest single area that each player has covered and for each edge bordering an empty square on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
