			<description>An Incredible Storyline &amp;ndash; Delve into a sprawling storyline spanning nearly one thousand years and experience the world of Terra through over an hour of flashback cutscenes. Uncover the destruction of the once grand Elven culture and the rise of Human civilization. Follow the path of a modest main character and companions on their ascent to glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex Role Playing &amp;ndash; Experience a highly non-linear RPG where the decisions you make change the world around you. Will you gather and trade the Ancient Elven Relics for a Dorian ship, or trek through the uncharted depths of the Woods of Despair? By virtue of the choices available in Last Dream, there are over five hundred unique paths in your journey through the mystical land of Terra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tremendous Replayability &amp;ndash; Last Dream allows the freedom to choose any 4 character party you wish from 8 distinctive character classes. With over 4,000 party variations, you&amp;rsquo;ll never run out of new experiences. In addition to myriad party combinations and various selectable difficulty levels, you can also build each character as you see fit, so the possibilities are nearly endless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Side Quests Galore &amp;ndash; Whether you love the rush of gambling at Lucky&amp;rsquo;s Casino, the sensation of adrenaline pumping through your gauntlet-covered veins as you stare down your opponents at Cecil&amp;rsquo;s Arena, or even the feeling of frantically racing your Giant flightless bird to win first place, Last Dream has it all. You&amp;rsquo;ll find much more waiting for you to explore in the world of Terra&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
