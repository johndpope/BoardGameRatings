							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperial Settlers: In-store Event Kit 2018</name>
									
			<description>This kit contains three cards for each base faction (12 cards) with a unique artwork in a &amp;ldquo;panorama view&amp;rdquo;. This artwork can be put together into one huge art piece &amp;ndash; when a player puts all three faction cards next to each other, it creates one big amazing scene from the World of Settlers. In the kit you will find two sets of those cards (24 cards total).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are alternate artwork and replace the similarly named cards in their respective decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each faction will get their card with three different artworks. The left card will not have a right border, the center card will not have a left or right border, and the right card will not have a left border. This facilitates the &amp;quot;big amazing scene&amp;quot; mentioned below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this kit contains a big playing mat (dimensions 23&amp;times;13&amp;Prime;) for Imperial Settlers and a poster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Settlers: In-store Event Kit 2018 – Raid Alternate Artwork Cards&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Settlers: In-store Event Kit 2018 – Trade Route Alternate Artwork Cards&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Settlers: In-store Event Kit 2018 – Pyramid Alternate Artwork Cards&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Settlers: In-store Event Kit 2018 – Administration Alternate Artwork Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
