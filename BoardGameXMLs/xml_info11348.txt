			<description>Kestenga: Another Fight to the Finnish is a Brigade level game depicting the fight for the Murmansk railroad in July 1941.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In July, 1941, Finnish troops began a thrust through the wilderness just south of the Arctic Circle, hoping to reach the important rail junction of Louhki, a vital link on the Soviet Union's lifeline, the Murmansk Railway.  Despite the assistance of Adolf Hitler's vaunted SS troops, they were turned back by the Soviet Forces, who later launched a counterattack of their own.  The village of Kestenga became the center of several fiercely fought battles as the world's largest nation and one of its smallest struggled for their existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second Axis thrust to cut the Murmansk Railroad crossed the pre-war border near Kestenga in the Summer of 1942. The Soviets were caught unprepared for the German-Finnish assault and had to hold out until reinforcements came up. The Germans met guards tank units for the first time in the Finnish campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 counters, 11 x 17 map, 8 pages of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 2 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 1.2 miles / 2.0 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 11 x 17&amp;quot; four color map&lt;br/&gt;One single-side printed countersheet (100 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 8-page Kestenga rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 1-2 Hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
