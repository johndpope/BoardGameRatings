			<description>The goal is to become the first EUREXPERT answering knowledge questions on various European states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents Europe with its capitals, and color paths joining the big cities. Each country has five areas of knowledge: Art (literature, music, painting, cinema), Company (history, sports, science, institutions), Environment (geography, crafts and industry), Special (specialty, folklore, anecdotes), European Community (history, general, relations between states). Initially each player secretly sets its goal to answer 3 questions in five areas, or answer 6 questions in three areas, or answer 12 questions in one single domain.&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes his departure from the capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player rolls the dice with colored faces and moves his pawn to space with this color. Player may answer the question in any space during the moving. If he answers correctly he may continue moving, if the answer is incorrect his turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;When a player has reached his goal, he announces it and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
