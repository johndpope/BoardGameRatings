			<description>Death By Cube is a twin-stick Shoot 'em up video game, released on the Xbox Live Arcade service on January 20, 2010. It was developed by Premium Agency and published by Square Enix.&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a top-down visual scheme. Players assume control over the amnesiac robot Leo, controlling his movement using the left thumb stick and aiming and firing using the right thumb stick. Additionally, a dash move can be executed using the left trigger and a shield can be deployed using the right trigger. The player must eliminate all of the enemies on the map, many of which are cube shaped, while avoiding getting hit by projectiles fired by the enemies. Enemies that are killed explode into large gushes of blood-like red oil. Some levels have additional objectives, such as defending a base or surviving with only one life. Players acquire computer chips, the form of in-game currency, by performing well enough in a level to receive a bronze, silver, or gold rating. Chips are spent on upgrades to Leo or to unlock additional levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Death By Cube&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
