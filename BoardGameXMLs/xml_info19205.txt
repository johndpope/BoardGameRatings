			<description>From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're going to start, and run, a business. You will choose an industry and a business type, acquire the stuff to operate your business, and expand your business as quickly as you can. When it suits your timing, you will want to finish. Along the way get all the Oh Goody and Progress cards you can, and try to avoid getting any Oops cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is easy to handicap to compensate for differences in skill, age and experience levels and the versions are as varied as you can imagine: a 30 min. game, a role-playing game, an international championship game, and four others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
