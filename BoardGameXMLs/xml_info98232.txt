							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Videocart-11: Backgammon, Acey-Deucey</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backgammon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game of Backgammon is to be the first player to remove all 15 of his stones from the board. Each player alternately moves one or more of his stones according to the value of a pair of dice which is rolled to begin his turn of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acey-Deucy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play of the game of Acey-Deucy is identical to that of Backgammon, with the following two exceptions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original position of the stones for each player is off the board, similar to being on the bar, except that the player need not enter any more stones in order to move stones already on the board. However, whenever a blot is hit and sent to the bar, it must be re-entered before any other stone of that player may be moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rolling of a one and a two, called an acey-deucy, gives the player special moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
