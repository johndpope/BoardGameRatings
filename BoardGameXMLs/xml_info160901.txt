							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Assembly</name>
									
			<description>Progress isn't perfect&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mysterious organisation known solely as the Assembly has been conducting secret experiments underground, their astonishing breakthroughs only made possible by operating outside government scrutiny and society&amp;rsquo;s morals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what is the Assembly hiding?  How far will it go to keep its existence buried?  And what will it sacrifice in the pursuit of progress?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, a chain of events threatens to expose this shadowy group.  Play as two individuals &amp;ndash; each with their own motivations &amp;ndash; and discover the mysteries of the Assembly&amp;rsquo;s facility through contrasting perspectives.  Make tough decisions, overcome trials and shake the foundations of this enigmatic collective.  Will your actions and their future repercussions save lives, or lead to catastrophe?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Assembly is a first-person interactive drama for mature audiences, created from the ground up for virtual reality headsets.  An experience with two sides to everything, where the truth is never clear, and a question is always left open: When does the end justify the means?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
