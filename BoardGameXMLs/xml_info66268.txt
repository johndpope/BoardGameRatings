			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Lexico is a game and a dictionary combined in a unique and fun way. Beside its excellent game value, it also has a huge educational value and is of interest to anyone who wants to learn languages. Lexico features altogether 9000 commonly used words from five different categories: Human, Living environment, Nature and hobbies, Science and technology and Common words. The words are divided into 3 difficulty levels and the idea is that every player plays the difficulty level best suited for his/her language skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
