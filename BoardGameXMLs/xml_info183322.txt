							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ensign</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ensign is an imaginative prequel to the iOS hit, A Dark Room. There is no difficulty setting other than permadeath, and players will die often.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is limited to NSEW. Players are trying to uncover the map, the story, upgrade equipment -- all while being threatened by the different creatures and occupants of this strange planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story element of the wanderers and the invasion are what will keep players hooked on this game. As an added bonus, the developer has included several audio commentaries on different aspects of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
