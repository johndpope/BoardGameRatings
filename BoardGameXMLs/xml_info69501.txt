			<description>From the pdf:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lochs have invaded a long-standing Ondine city and taken it for themselves in a bloody battle. They obviously don&amp;rsquo;t want Apocalypse Prevention, Inc. to find out, since the attack was unprovoked and the company would likely not approve. The Ondine have found political roadblocks when it comes to reporting this offense to API (by the name of Solo), so they are using the corpses of fallen Lochs to raid the Californian shores to kill humans in the hopes that API will investigate immediately. Then they plan to tell the agents of the atrocities that have occurred with their city, but if API doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to help, they are prepared to destroy the city and all within it with their pet Kraken. Agents must pick a side very carefully. The wrong choice could lose some powerful allies and make dangerous enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
