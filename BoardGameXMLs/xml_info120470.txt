			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bag It!, you bag groceries, and you don't even get paid.  &amp;hellip;but these groceries are anthropomorphized, and helpfully quiver and look up nervously if you're about to crush them with too much weight.  Fit the groceries in the bag, stacking them and turning them as necessary to get them in there.  Once they're all in, you balance or tilt your device to keep them from falling in such a manner that damage would be done.  The game features achievements, bonuses, and combos (e.g. Double Date or Complete Breakfast') to provide additional incentives and replay value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
