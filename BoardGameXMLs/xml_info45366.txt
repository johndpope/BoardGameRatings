			<description>Players have 3 pawns that they move (after rolling the dice) on the map of Budapest that shows the streets, museums, monuments, cinemas, theatres, libraries, 'discotheque's of the Capital of Hungary. Whenever a pawn arrives at a place (a section of a road) containing one of these they have to answer some questions in the given topic. They get points for good answers; the first to collect 100 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;The most interesting categories are 'disco' as it shows the then-stars of the '70s and '80s and 'cinema' as you need a copy of the program magazine for cinemas. You also have 'chance' cards and 'pig in a poke' cards - in the latter you find a question that you should answer - or get minus 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
