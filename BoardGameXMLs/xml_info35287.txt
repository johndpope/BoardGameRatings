							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hex CCG</name>
									
			<description>A fan-created CCG set in the world of the Hex TV show, in which players try to either corrupt Medenham School, using main characters such as Azazeal, Jo Watkins, and Malachi, or try to resist the evil forces, using characters such as Cassandra 'Cassie' Hughes, Thelma Bates, and Ella Dee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players start at 10 corruption, and the first to reach either 0 corruption or 20 corruption wins. Players gain/lose corruption via combat and reaching or opposing purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game's Buffy CCG roots can clearly be seen, there are many differences. The main ones being: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each character has six stats: fighting ability, intelligence, persuasion, mysticism, integrity and charm. &lt;br/&gt;    The purposes have both good and evil sides, so both players can attempt them, regardless of their side.&lt;br/&gt;    The turn structure is much less organized, as players play cards, move characters, and resolve actions all in the same phase, instead of having move, resource, combat and end steps.&lt;br/&gt;    Cards have a corruption cost, so the more powerful cards can only be played later in the game, and only by players of that alignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial set has 482 cards, of the following types: starting effects, characters, items, skills, plans, events, locations and purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
