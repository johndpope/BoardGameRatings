			<description>&amp;ldquo;Based on the battle at the end of Harry Potter &amp;amp; the Order of the Phoenix. Battle between Dumbledore &amp;amp; his Followers vs Voldemort &amp;amp; his Death Eaters. Abstract skirmish level combat. Each figure represents a single wizard. Victory: The Dumbledore player wins if Voldemort is &amp;lsquo;defeated&amp;rsquo;. The Voldemort player wins if Dumbledore or Harry is &amp;lsquo;defeated&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the wizards. The Dumbledore player has twelve wizards and the Voldemort player has thirteen. A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
