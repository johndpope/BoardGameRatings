			<description>A quiz game in which players know the category and then have to bet with their cards (2 sets of 1-4 per player). The players betting the highest cards are playing the current round and trying to answer first to win the point. The questions are usually hints that are read by a non-participating player slowly, so people competing for the question can answer as soon as they think to know the answer.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 3 rounds of 8 questions each. In round 2 and 3 the players not in the lead may steal a question once each if they are faster than the active player(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
