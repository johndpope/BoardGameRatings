							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monstrous Monograph: Monstrosities Volume I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing the Monstrous Monograph, a growing collection of monsters with which Fifth Edition game masters can challenge their players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each volume of the  Monstrous Monograph presents a handful of creatures of a given monster type. Grow your collection a few monsters at a time for far less than the price of your morning coffee!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monstrous Monograph: Monstrosities Vol. I contains two monsters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ever wondered why the game has a hybrid part-owl part-bear, yet so few other animal mashups? The CR 2 Abominable Beast is the answer you never knew you needed! Really dozens of monsters in one, the Abominable Beast represents all manner of magical hybrid creatures created through magical experimentation or mishap. In addition to the features of its base statblock, you select two or more animal templates from which your unique Abominable Beast derives a number of other traits. Included beast templates are: Badger, Bear, Eagle, Horse, Octopus, Rhino, Scorpion, Shark, Spider, Tiger, Toad, and Wolf. &lt;br/&gt;    The CR 5 Amphisbaena is a venomous snake with a second head where its tail should be. Typically dwelling in deserts, amphisbaena have the unique hunting strategy of interlocking their fangs and curling into hoops that can roll rapidly down the dunes at their prey. After knocking a victim prone and coiling around their body to restrain them, both of the amphisbaena's heads proceed to inject powerful venom with their bites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
