			<description>Energy flows all around us, embracing our existence. It was energy that first started life and molded matter as we know it.&lt;br/&gt;So maybe fighting the light is turning on yourself...&lt;br/&gt;So what would it be? Giving up now? Or boarding that pretty little spaceship of yours and fight for survival of your species?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eyes Bandegades is a serialized videogame that takes place in the very limits of the human universe. Each chapter is a whole new adventure. Unravel the enigmatic origin of the Nagjut, discover the true potential of the Eyes, and the hidden intentions of the corporations of men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
