							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythrole: Merchants</name>
									
			<description>Mythrole: Merchants is a board game of strategic trading set in a fantasy realm.  Players take the part of powerful merchants attempting to gain economic prominence throughout the Known Lands.  Gold is earned by using caravans to transport resources (wood, grain, fish, stone, ore, and precious metals) from source locations to demand locations which change dynamically during the game.  Trading is not always peaceful, though, and merchants must hire mercenaries and build warehouses to protect their shipments.  Diplomacy plays a key role as players are free to make all manner deals and treaties with other Merchants, including such things as setting up toll roads or extorting weak trade groups by threatening them.  Mythrole: Merchants is suitable for 2-6 players working alone or in teams, and plays in 2-6 hours, with the length being customizable by choosing the appropriate victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
