			<description>After playing this game, students will be able to describe early California Indian life and understand their values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game Players try to go from START (the village) to FINISH (the eagle ceremony) and collect skill cards, culture cards, and food cards. The winner of the game is the player to reach FINISH with the most cards. After the first player reaches FINISH, the rest of the players must travel directly there on their turns, and not try to collect extra food cards.
