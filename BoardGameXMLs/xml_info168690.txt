			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many moons ago (the early 90&amp;rsquo;s), I was introduced to everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite role-playing game by means of a large black box with a wrathful red dragon on its cover; delving the depths of the dungeon of Zanzer is one of my favorite memories from back then. Aspiring game masters were directed to then stock the map of a dungeon which was once a dwarven stronghold that had been taken as a lair by a young white dragon named Kamro. This sparked my imagination greatly, and I have been creating, stocking, and running players through dungeons ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A couple of years ago, I started a new campaign with one of my groups, and decided to begin with Zanzer&amp;rsquo;s dungeon, followed with Stonefast. That campaign continued on in the thunderous mountain rift setting that accompanied that era of the game, but this dungeon can be easily plopped into whatever campaign setting you prefer, with whatever plot hook you&amp;rsquo;d like to get your players there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following is my version of Stonefast, converted from the BECMI edition to the new Fifth edition. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
