							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fat Mask</name>
									
			<description>Fat Mask is a 1-4 players arcade puzzle brawler game where you acrobatically create giant combos by matching small blocks together. BEWARE! Other players will try to steal your combos and you must defend them at all cost if you ever wish to win! Thanks to a unique mix of brawler and puzzle mechanics, Fat Mask creates a frenetic experience that is sure to ruin some friendships. Steal your friends' hard earned monster combos in this quirky action-packed game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our goal was always to create a quick-paced multiplayer arcade game that would explore new territory by diverging from the usual fighting mechanics that defines the genre. After a lot of sweat and prototypes (32 of them), we settled on the basic mechanics for Fat Mask: create, steal and fight over ownership of gigantic tetris-like combos with your friends. A keypoint for us was to create an interestingly fresh solo mode which would go beyond the multiplayer mode. That&amp;rsquo;s how we came up with our unique stressful single player mode where you must compete against time itself to create as many combos as you can to inscribe your name at the top of the worldwide leaderboards. In short: every combo you claim buys you a few more seconds to create another one. From this gameplay dynamic also came a co-op version of the game where ultra-competitive combo makers can still have fun with more casual oriented players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-   Local multiplayer for real old school fun (Free-for-All and Coop)&lt;br/&gt;-   Single Player High Score mode&lt;br/&gt;-   Realtime Steam Leaderboards directly in-game&lt;br/&gt;-   18 unique levels&lt;br/&gt;-   Best soundtrack ever&lt;br/&gt;-   You can fart! (and it serves no purpose)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
