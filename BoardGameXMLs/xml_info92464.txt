			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender is an action adventure title for Windows. The game differs from the console titles by the same name, and roughly follows the events of the first season of the television series Avatar: The Last Airbender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control Aang as he travels from the Southern Water Tribe to the North Pole in an effort to find a Waterbending master. Prince Zuko of the Fire Nation, however, is on his tail, trying to capture him. Players play in a third person perspective and can switch between three offensive and three defensive moves during combat. There are a number of minigames built into the main storyline, such as flying on Appa and a meditation minigame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
