			<description>BARRAGE is a rules set designed to re-fight battles during the period of 1904 - 1935. Not only is the Great War (1914 - 1918) covered in detail, so is the Russo-Japanese War (1904 - 1905), Russian Civil War (1917 - 1921), and the Russo-Polish War (1919 - 1920). Typical unit sizes are infantry companies, cavalry squadrons, machine gun platoons, and artillery batteries. A player would generally command either a regiment or a brigade of soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World War One portion of the rules covers the following: African, Balkan, Egypt &amp;amp; Palestine, Eastern, Italian, Mesopotamian, and Western fronts. The Tables of Organization &amp;amp; Equipment have detailed information for 16 different nations. The rules are designed to re-fight the open warfare of the early part of the WWI along with the more static trench battles later in the war. Can you lead your troops in a successful offensive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Piquet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
