							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Steadfast Shield</name>
									
			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Secrets deep within the abandoned temple are  about to come lurching into the sunlight. The  undead have a new master who needs only  find the Ruby Key to unleash an ancient army  of evil, dooming the people of Keaswauk  County. The village of Tuvines is plagued  with troubles. The harvest rots on the vine, as  the people now fear to go out doors. Foul  things that bay like dogs gone mad spirit away  young men and women. Dark-shadowed  forms are about, terrifying the good people of  Tuvines and stirring up who knows what sort  of mischief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed to be an  introduction to Dungeons and Dragons. It  takes place at a holy temple, long ago  abandoned. The temple is large enough that  several different groups of creatures have  come to call it &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; . The encounter levels  range from 1 to 6, providing ample challenge  to parties from 2nd to 4th level. A well- balanced party has the best chance of success  in the Steadfast Shield. The undead figure  prominently in the lower level, so it would be  advisable for the GM to &amp;quot;bone up&amp;quot;  on the uses  of channeling positive and negative energy, as  well as the specific monsters presented here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
