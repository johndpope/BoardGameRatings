			<description>From the box, &amp;quot;Catch a Mouse for Lunch! The fast action, Motorized Game of Cat &amp;amp; Mouse! Each time you catch a mouse remove a pin from above your mouse's head. The first player to remove all their pins ... is the master mouse muncher and the winner!&amp;quot; This dexterity game is similar in style to Hungry, Hungry Hippos. Four Weeble-like mice are placed in the bowl-shaped playing area and are kept in constant motion by a spinning piece of cheese in the center of the bowl. The object of the game is to try to catch the mice in your cat's mouth by operating a lever that opens your cat's mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
