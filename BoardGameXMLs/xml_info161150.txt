			<description>Misi&amp;oacute;n Imposible features up to four competing Intelligence Agencies (players) in a frantic battle of wits and resources for the ultimate espionage feat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agencies' goal is to be the first to acquire classified reports on six different Government areas (Military, Space, Air Force, State, Naval and Nuclear secrets). On each turn, Agencies roll their dice and move their tokens around the board, acquiring the reports &amp;quot;naturally&amp;quot; by landing on the proper spaces. Reports can also be stolen from rival Agencies who have already acquired that particular piece of the puzzle. This is achieved by sending spies to their facilities. Players must balance spy missions with the need to conduct counter-espionage against the other agencies' spies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware -- not all of the reports collected are authentic, so it'll require the powers of observation and skills of a true agent to smoke out the false data and avoid spending precious resources on mere decoys!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As they race against the clock, Agencies will recruit the help of Super-Agents and Super-Spies, get mission-disrupting directives from Headquarters, and receive situation updates via state-of-the-art Telex communications!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first agency to get their hands on six authentic classified reports (one for each Government area) will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
