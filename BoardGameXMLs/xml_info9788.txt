			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture This is the new fast paced drawing game for adults that's bound to have everyone laughing. Imagine drawing the word &amp;quot;yodel&amp;quot;, or even more crazy, &amp;quot;stock broker!&amp;quot; It doesn't matter how well you can draw, it's how well you can think. (The ability to draw stick figures doesn't hurt either!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players form teams of 2 or more people and draw words within the one minute time limit in a race to earn points. There's never a dull moment since all players are actively participating at all times. Plus there's the added element of strategy with the special &amp;quot;challenge card&amp;quot; which gives players a chance to &amp;quot;zing&amp;quot; their opponents with particularly difficult words. When there's just 3 people playing, just pick a permanent &amp;quot;doodler&amp;quot; to draw for the 2 opposing players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture This comes complete with a topics card, game cards containing 2600 words, colorful game board, challenge card, 8 markers, one-minute timer, die, 4 drawing pads and 4 pencils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
