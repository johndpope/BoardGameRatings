			<description>Hit me! is a comic book style push your luck card game. Players will be playing Hit! cards to make other players discard cards from their Life deck. The last player with cards remaining in their life deck is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin with a small deck of face-down cards that make their life deck and a single Hit! deck in the middle of the table. During a player's turn, they draw a card from the Hit! deck and place it face up for all players to see. They continue to play cards until they choose to stop or they Bust and are out of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player draws a Hit! card, they place it in front of any other player. If the current player stops before Busting, all other players will discard 1 card for each Hit! in front of them. All cards are added to a communal discard pile. If the Hit! deck runs out of cards. All of the cards in the discard pile are reshuffled to make a new Hit! deck. If a player draws a Trip! card, they place it in front of themselves. If a player ever draws 3 Trips! they Bust, and they instead discard 1 card from their life deck for each Hit! in front of all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
