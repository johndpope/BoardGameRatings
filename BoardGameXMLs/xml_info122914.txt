			<description>Are you good enough to survive a Zombie Armageddon? Don't panic! Use your brain first and if necessary your sledgehammer. Dead Block is a 3rd person zombie themed arcade game with a unique mix of action, humor and strategy.&lt;br/&gt; Set in the US during the idyllic 1950s, Dead Block takes players to a simpler time when a gallon of gas cost a few pennies, the &amp;quot;golden age&amp;quot; of cinema was in full swing, and that new (and apparently insanely evil) craze called rock n' roll swept the nation&amp;mdash;and caused an apocalyptic musical plague to turn the deceased into the walking dead!&lt;br/&gt; As one of three survivors of the shuffling zombie onslaught &amp;ndash; Boy Scout Mike Bacon, construction worker Jack Foster, and no-nonsense meter maid Foxy Jones, each with their own unique &amp;quot;Smart Bomb&amp;quot; attack &amp;ndash; players will fortify their area by boarding up windows and setting a variety of unique unlockable traps, collect items and power-ups, take on zombies one-on-many with a variety of upgradeable weapons, and even rock them to shreds with awesome guitar power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
