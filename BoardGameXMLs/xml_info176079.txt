			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hey there and thanks for checking out Amethyst Role-Playing! The generic system where you can pick up and play in almost no time at all! With its creative rules of play, as well as the modular style of the Core Rules, you and your group can play watever genre you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amethyst:RP is based upon the idea of Player input to create an interesting story, so the GM can focus on fleshing out an idea, not creating one. This is done through play-sets or game supplements that are separate from the Core Rules. These supplements are not supplements at all, they are an extension of the Core Rules! So that if you wanted to play a Supernatural game of Investigation, grab that play-set!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Players are not limited to just what we offer for play-sets! There will be rules on creation of play-sets as well (in an update coming soon)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get ready for any kind of fun you can imagine, in a world where the Game-Master doesn't need to work so hard.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
