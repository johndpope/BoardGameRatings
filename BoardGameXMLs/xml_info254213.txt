			<description>In Boomerang, the &amp;quot;come-back-again&amp;quot; card game, players travel round the great south land, trying to see and do as much as possible &amp;mdash; but will the cards you want to see come back to you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boomerang could be described as a card-drafting game (like 7 Wonders or Sushi Go!) mixed with a roll-and-write game (like Yahtzee or Qwixx).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players select one card from their hand to play, then pass the rest of their cards to the next player. Will you take what you really want, or a different card so as to deprive another player of something cool?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round, players mark different things off on their score sheets, corresponding to what they earned from the cards they selected. Players earn points for seeing sights, collecting Australiana, seeing animals, and so on. After five rounds, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
