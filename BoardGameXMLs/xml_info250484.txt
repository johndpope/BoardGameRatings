			<description>Grab family and friends, select your favorite bird and race to the backyard to compete in a frenzy of animal fun. In Pit Patrol players take actions flying to a location, collecting resources, and buying habitats to score victory points. Bonus tokens are earned once a habitat is bought making each bird richer and faster. After each round players can disrupt their opponents future flight plans by rolling dice to activate Stealin Steve the squirrel and Patch the pit-bull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stealin Steve takes a resource from the location and any bird present, hording them in his nest. Patch blocks locations preventing birds from buying habitats or gathering resources. Birdies beware your opponents will soon be able to do the same to you when it is their turn to roll the dice.  In the end the bird that best manages their movement, most wisely uses bonus tokens, and buys the most habitats will earn the most victory points and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pit Patrol is a family style, set collection, take that game for 3 - 4 players. In just 20 - 30 minutes players can take each other on in a fast paced game that will leave your opponents feathers ruffled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
