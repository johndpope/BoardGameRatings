							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Journal</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This is a booklet of blank campaign journal sheets with a nice layout.  It is probably most useful for old-school fantasy games, as one-third of each page is formatted for treasure, monster records and time-keeping found most often in the dungeoncrawl game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The DM's Campaign Journal&lt;br/&gt;This 28 page free download is intended to keep track of the session number, session date as well as campaign dates. You can also add adventure notes, NPCs that the characters run into and any tiny plot hooks that come up. There is also a place to keep track of Treasure found, monsters encountered as well as their experience and hit points. And keeping track of time in the adventure can be challenging when there is so much else going on so check boxes for rounds and turns have been added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you fill this booklet up with your notes, add a volume number and begin filling up the next book, you'll have records of all your sessions as well as any tiny event that happened which can be referred back to in your organized volumes for new plot hooks and session ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This accessory is available as a free download from the designer's blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
