							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Fall: The Last Days</name>
									
			<description>A fully cooperative survival miniatures board game. Mission-based with a highly modular game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player takes the roll of a survivor to fight against the reavers and horrifying mutants, causes through the outbreak 5 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood Fall: The Last Days offers a great combat system where positioning is the key to survive. You have to find Items, weapons, crafting upgrades with components to manage your character. You can learn skills to improve your chances to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beside the combat system one of the great and innovative game features is the enemy AI. Every enemy acts by itself. They have movement paths and smart combat mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game design has finished to 90%. The artwork is about 90%. Actual focus is on mission design for great adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Testers Voice:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So complex, but not complicated.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Highly cooperative. Don't split the group!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The best weapon system i've played with...a shotgun feels like a shotgun and a kitchen knife -puh- feels like that. Great.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Very smart A.I. system. The routing of the enemies is great and acts as a natural timer. If you had the chance to test it. Test it!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
