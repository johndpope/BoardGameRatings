			<description>This WWII British game bears neither a date nor a publisher, but vivid graphics make its objective clear: fly your planes to the big X over Berlin in the center of the board and drop your bombs! The board is almost square (13.9&amp;quot; x 12.8&amp;quot;) and is divided into quadrants with player bases at the corners. There are two &amp;quot;Bomber Stations&amp;quot; at opposite corners and two &amp;quot;Fighter Stations at the other corners, where players start their planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is a spin-and-move affair, with snakes-and-ladders type tracks in each quadrant leading to two shared final approach lanes to Berlin. The bomber and fighter tracks have different hazard and bonus squares. In addition to the bonus and hazard spaces, a plane landing on an occupied space must return to base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has four planes, and must fly them sequentially to Berlin, needing to spin a 6 for a plane either to take off from base or to return from Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
