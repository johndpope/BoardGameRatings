			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In myth and literature, wizards are depicted as lonely hermits puttering around secret libraries and seeking out ancient crypts, always in search of clues to unlock the secrets of forgotten spells and occult wisdom. Among those who travel and pursue adventure they are wise in the languages and cultures of other lands and vanished peoples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In d20 fantasy games...not so much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What of the legendary wizardly bookishness and need to study the forgotten arts, ancient manuscripts and tomes of strange lore? What of the hidden secret powers of the mage's art which the wizard may obsess upon obtaining and spend years researching and unraveling? What of the quest for those magical powers mastered by mages long ago, yet lost or considered entirely mythical by the magicians of today?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first book in Wild Hunt Studio's &amp;quot;Way of the Magus&amp;quot; series -- intended to expand the options available to both wizard characters in the d20 system and to those playing them -- &amp;quot;On Language and Research&amp;quot; concentrates on helping both GM and player bring the archetypal wizard character to brilliant life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In that spirit, this book contains rules to help inspire the wizard to study crumbling scrolls and cryptic diagrams, and to seek out all containers of arcane knowledge. &amp;quot;On Language and Research&amp;quot; contains rules for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     including and using multiple magical languages in your campaign&lt;br/&gt;     magical spell experimentation (and its disastrous effects!)&lt;br/&gt;     spell research rules that allow a wizard to build up knowledge of a spell bit-by-bit&lt;br/&gt;     turning old tomes, fragmentary spell scrolls, and weird diagrams carved into walls sources of useful magical knowledge&lt;br/&gt;     moldy parchments and books on magical theory as useful and exciting additions to the treasure horde&lt;br/&gt;     creating culture-based spell lists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
