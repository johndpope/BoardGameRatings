			<description>from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for train lovers across America!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 140 years ago, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act.  With this historic stroke of a pen, the stage was set for Union Pacific to open the American West to settlers and, in the process, connect a continent.  The transcontinental route heralded the Industrial Revolution and modernized transportation, turning the grueling, six-month, $1,000 journey from New York to San Francisco into a week long trip costing a mere $70.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took an army of 20,000 men, working 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for six years, to connect America east to west by rail.  It was a remarkable feat, as the system was built primarily by hand.  With the driving of the Golden Spike on May 10, 1869, the route was complete, and a vast, largely unpopulated region was poised for growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the 50,000 men and women of Union Pacific still connect America&amp;rsquo;s communities, transporting the raw materials and finished goods that keep our economy, and our country, moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokens include: Railroad crossing signal; Engineer&amp;rsquo;s cap, Golden Spike, Caboose, Locomotive, and a Lantern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
