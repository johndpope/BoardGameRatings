			<description>A series of Monopoly clones about various Swedish cities. Each game has an identical set of rules and components, except for the game board, which is adapted to the city in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Monopoly, the game is about moving around a board, buying property, drawing cards and paying rent. The object of the game is to eliminate all other players by forcing them into bankruptcy. The players can also agree upon an alternative victory condition before the game begins; the player who owns at least half of all properties is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is covered with advertising. The properties you buy are actually real Swedish companies who reside in the city the game is about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The big difference from the original Monopoly is the possibility to buy stock. There are five kinds of stock (coffee, coal, iron, oil and gold) with different odds and payout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
