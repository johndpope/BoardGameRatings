			<description>A game with multiple choice questions where you have to guess which answer someone else would give. A handheld electronic buzzer-object will tell you if the answer is correct or not. If answered correctly, you get to draw another card, and the first person to get ten correct answers is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So each turn, you draw a card and ask the question and answers on it (for example, &amp;quot;what would you take out of a burning house?&amp;quot; A my pet, B photo album, C diary or D hairgel and facial cream). The player to your left has one electronic object, you hold the other. Choose the letter that corresponds to the answer you think that person would give and hold the two objects together. If answered correctly, there should be a buzzing sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get to know each other a little better, and the best &amp;quot;mind reader&amp;quot; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
