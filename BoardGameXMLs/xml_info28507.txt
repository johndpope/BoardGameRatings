			<description>This is basically Risk using the United States, instead of the world, as a map. There are 51 territories (the states and the District of Columbia) in which to place the four colors of plastic chips (each representing &amp;quot;an army of 1,000 soldiers). Set-up, by alternate picking of territories, and die roll combat is identical to Risk. The came contains 153 cards (infantry, cavalry, and &amp;quot;governor&amp;quot; cards for each of the 51 territories), and card play is significantly different from Risk, as a card from a stack of shuffled infantry and cavalry cards is picked every time a territory is conquered. If a player acquires both the infantry and cavalry cards for a state, the player is awarded the governor card for that state and immediately takes that state over. If another player has the other card, there is a one-die showdown to determine control. Play continues until all 102 infantry/cavalry cards are drawn, and the winner is the player with the most territories at that time. The game is well-made, with front &amp;amp; back box printing, a mounted board, plastic insert, 153 cards, 6 dice, 4 sets of 64 plastic chips, and three rules booklets (English, Spanish, French).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
