			<description>From the game's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the game about?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collision between mortal and Fae or Other realms. Due to the actions of the powerful, perhaps a well-intentioned mage, or a power-hungry Lord, the lines between worlds are weakened and dangerous events ensue. Those drawn into the conflict may seek out or find themselves gifted in magic to right the wrongs, or balance the scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do the character do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters unravel a mystery about what is causing strife in their world, discovering their own path to magic, as well as doorways to other worlds close to their own. One character hounds the others, while they fight to discover its secret, and turn it from its trajectory toward destruction or conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
