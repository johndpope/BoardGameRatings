			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACE lets you fly an unnamed plane in an unnamed country, as only  pilot to fly your multipurpose attack fighter in defense for your country. &lt;br/&gt;The map suggests a communist invasion on the Southeast shores of the USA, but no ingame datails are given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Options&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ACE you can opt for 1 or 2 players, in two player games one being the pilot and the other the weapons officer, targetting and shooting the missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the time it was released, ACE was remarkably advanced. Gameplay was dynamic as enemy units did conquer land and eventually (unless the player prevented this) overran airbases.&lt;br/&gt;The game featured both air to air missions, ground attack and sea attack missions, night flying, summer and winter and different plane loadouts.&lt;br/&gt;On top of that, not only could the player land to be refueled and rearmed by landing on one of his 3 bases, he could also tank mid-flight by flying to a passing propeller tanker plane and subsequently aiming his automatically extended probe in the para-drogue, a feat which needed quite some practice - even more than landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;After getting air supremacy and detroying all enemy tank divisions (consisting of a number of AFVs, like tanks and SAMs) the player had to defeat an incoming follow-up invasion fleet, accompagnied by a new horde of enemy fighters. If those were defeated, the home land was saved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
