			<description>Designer's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Sticks &amp;amp; Stones features an improve-as-you-go experience system. No more downtime leveling up characters or being restricted to a class system. Whatever your character spends the most time doing is where they'll improve. Races are fully customizable through a easy-to-follow point buy system that can create uncountable combinations. The common-sense combat rules include weapon speeds, simultaneous character and monster actions in given combat cycles, stamina system to account for wide usage of powerful abilities and fighting techniques. Magick is fully customizable with traits designed to put the affect and effect of each spell into the hands of the player and so much more. For Storytellers, everything is streamlined to allow for improvised monster, treasure, traps and other challenges without having too much down time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
