			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampire Savior 2: The Lord of Vampire is an updated version of Vampire Savior that was released exclusively in Japan only a few months after the release of the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minor tweaks and changes were made to the characters move lists and the combo system, such as the removal of air chains. The game features the same character roster and soundtrack as Vampire Savior and included Donovan, Huitzil and Pyronbut but removed Jon Talbain, Dark Talbain, Rikuo and Sasquatch. Oboro Bishamon, Marionette, and Shadow were included as secret characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
