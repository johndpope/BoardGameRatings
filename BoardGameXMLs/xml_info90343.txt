			<description>Creep Night(1996) had a horror film set, and 3 different tables(and after finishing all challenges in a table, you could travel to the other ones):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Castle, fragmented in town, castle area and graveyard. Its challenges are Zombies (three zombies appear for you to knock down), Goblins(goblins randomly appear in the table), Runaway (a goblin riding an ATV runs through the table), Vortex (multi-ball, in which you must shoot in the vortex) and Wraith (a female magnetic ghost tries to capture the ball).&lt;br/&gt;    * Tower, a mad scientist lab. The challenges are: Rat (similar to the &amp;quot;Runaway&amp;quot;), Energy Gate (similar to Vortex, but &amp;quot;single-balled&amp;quot;), Beast (a squid appears in the table's giant water tank, and you need to hit its tentacles), Goblin and Dynamo (you need to a hit a dynamo). After finishing all 5 challenges, you revive a &amp;quot;Frankenstein monster&amp;quot; and need to hit him 5 times.&lt;br/&gt;    * Dungeon. The Challenges are: Gobbler (a ghost chases the ball to eat it), Spiders (similar to &amp;quot;Goblin&amp;quot;), Dimension Door (that if hit, activates a &amp;quot;Simon&amp;quot;-like game), Trapdoor (similar to &amp;quot;Vortex&amp;quot;) and Skeleton Escape (six skeletons come out of the cells for you to hit). Like in Tower, after beating them a Catapult appears, and you have to hit it some times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And after finishing all the 3 tables, you go to a changed Castle table, with 5 new challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;3-D Ultra Pinball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
