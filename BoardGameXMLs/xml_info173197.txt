							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Treasure of the Bone Soldiers</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I introduce a group in this adventure, but I don't give any background. Bone Soldiers. Anyone who has read Starter Adventures will find mention of them in magic-user entry, On the Road. Bone Soldiers are a group of folks dedicated to the necromantic arts. One of their artifact was hidden here many years ago. To get players interested in the adventure I was thinking of just throwing a treasure map in the way. A crude thing that mentions buried treasure. Simple, but effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is short, but thick with character ending possibilities. First there is the simple you fall a 100' and turn into broken meat sack. Then there is the harpies charm ability, depending on the game this could be a permanent situation. And lastly, the life draining ability of the wraith. That ain't no joke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
