							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek Battle Manual</name>
									
			<description>Star Trek Battle Manual was Zocchi's first foray into space combat games. It is very similar to his later Alien Space Battle Manual and Star Fleet Battle Manual, with good reason. Zocchi did not have a license to publish a Star Trek game when this came out, and in addition to the title the game uses images of ships from the series (the Enterprise is on the cover), not to mention the names and pictures of the characters. Paramount objected and Zocchi was forced to recall the game from stores. A few copies had already been sold, which are the ones occasionally seen today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following year, Zocchi released Alien Space Battle Manual, with all the Star Trek references replaced with ones he invented. When he obtained a license from Franz Josef Designs (allowing him to use ship designs and names such as &amp;quot;Klingon&amp;quot;), he published Star Fleet Battle Manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, optional rules are given for the special abilities of some of the Enterprise crew - these of course do not appear in the later games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
