							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Feats</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Feats is a consolidation, revision and clarification of the many strange powers available to the heroes and horrors of the Black Tokyo Campaign Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook presents feats in a modified format that should make them easier for players to choose from, as well as for myself and other designers to utilize in stat blocks and adventure design. Within you&amp;rsquo;ll find (almost) every feat from core sourcebooks like Races of the Tatakama and Black Tokyo Unlimited, as well as feats from secondary sourcebooks like Expanded Races: Kami, among many others. You&amp;rsquo;ll also find dozens of completely original feats, some building on previous work,  others designed to take the campaign in new directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a collected and fully revised list of starting traits for Black Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s adventurers. As with the feats, these traits are culled from a variety of sources mixed together with new traits, from mundane talents like expertise in adult video fetish photography to mastery of Akihabara&amp;rsquo;s electrical sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Feats is broken into several subheadings. The first five sections of the book detail the different kinds of character traits: Combat, Faith, Magic, Racial and Social traits, in that order. The sixth section details Birthright Feats, which can only be chosen by first level heroes. Finally, Other Feats details all the other feats available to heroes and villains alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
