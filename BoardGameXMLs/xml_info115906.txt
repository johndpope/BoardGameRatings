			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An IP-free version of Chapter Nine, &amp;quot;Mortal Stunts,&amp;quot; from The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game, Volume 1: Your Story, made freely available on the faterpg.com website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Are Stunts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just enumerating a person's skills doesn't quite give you the full picture of what he's capable of. Most people have little tricks, advantages, or knacks that they pull out when they need a bit of something extra. We call these little knacks stunts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Stunts Do&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stunts exist to provide guaranteed situational benefits. These benefits might be the result of special training, unique (but non-supernatural) abilities, or something that's just innately cool about your character. A stunt may grant a character the ability to use a skill under unusual circumstances, using it in a broader array of situations than normal, substituting it for another skill, or using it in a complementary fashion to another skill. A stunt might allow a character to gain an effect roughly equal to two shifts used in a specific way or to otherwise grant other small effects. Put more simply, stunts allow the usual rules about skills to be bent&amp;mdash;or even broken. We'll get into how to build your own stunts shortly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some stunts may have prerequisites (other stunts or even aspects). Particularly potent stunts may also require the use of a fate point to be activated. In general, a character should not take a stunt tied to a skill he does not have at least at Average level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
