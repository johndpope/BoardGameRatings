			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've all been there as DMs. You describe the bedroom as having a bookshelf or the basement as having a couple crates and the next thing you know your players are investigating them further. But you haven't prepared for what they contain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This chart is ideal for when you need to come up with something on the fly that you haven't prepped for. It includes crate contents, barrel contents, mundane book titles, magical item effects, item curse effects, and even weather!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't fumble over your words or let your players send you scrambling anymore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
