							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scenario 2: ...And Night Must Fall</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...And Night Must Fall is a mid-range scenario, designed to introduce the Referee and players to the combat mechanics of Shakh&amp;agrave;n, as well as to demonstrate the unique characteristics of Telostic's dank, sinister Underworld complexes. The scenario involves an adventure in the Underworlds to the east of the city of R&amp;ograve;lon. It is meant for two separate groups &amp;ndash; one aligned towards &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and the other aligned towards &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; each of 3 to 6 characters of moderate Experience Levels, from III to VI in the primary Level and no more than II to IV as a secondary or tertiary Level. Due to the objectives (see below) assigned to each party, the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; group should either include one or two more characters (player or nonplayer) than the &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; one, or, alternately, should have more characters of higher level than the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as a ZIP archive that includes two DOC files (the scenario and an announcement regarding tournament play), four CorelDraw image files (maps), and fifty-one excel files (character sheets).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
