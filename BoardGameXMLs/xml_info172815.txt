			<description>Description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first one to pull your team over the line.  The proper placement of four different coloured player cards on either side of the rope will show your ability as a quick thinker.  This is a fast-paced tug of war game for two or four players that teaches you to match up colours.  You still have to watch out that you don't lose your balance and let the other team pull you into the water because you didn't match up your colours correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
