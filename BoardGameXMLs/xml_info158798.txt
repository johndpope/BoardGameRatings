			<description>From the Kickstarter description:&lt;br/&gt;Mirrors is a fun and easy-to-master card game about the direct and infinite reflections found throughout existence. The inspiration for this project came to me from my childhood adoration for Pok&amp;eacute;mon cards,etc; and the minimalistic design and approach pay homage to Hanafuda&amp;rsquo;s beauty and simplistic brilliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirrors plays much like a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in that there is a power hierarchy in which Triangle beats X, X beats Circle, and Circle beats Triangle. [...] Both players will flip their cards at the same time and who ever has the dominant Happening Symbol, wins, and is given the choice to either inflict damage upon their opponent or to use their card&amp;rsquo;s special effect. The amount of damage a card can inflict is indicated by a card&amp;rsquo;s Energy which is the whole number located under the symbol. In the case that both players play the same Happening symbol they are to look at the decimal number under the Energy. This number is the cards Gravity, and whoever has the highest Gravity, wins the that match. Players repeat this until one player&amp;rsquo;s Ego Points are reduced to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
