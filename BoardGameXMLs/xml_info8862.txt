			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;An old pirate has hidden three treasures on an island. In this 2-player deduction game for children, one player is a treasure hunter trying to find the treasures while the other player gives hints on where the treasures are hidden. Afterwards, the players change roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Earning the most points by correctly locating the treasures while needing as few hints as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;The game board shows an island with 15 connected circles. These are the potential hiding places for the treasures. Each circle is identified through a symbol and also shows one, two or three dots. There are also 15 cardboard discs corresponding to the hiding places (same symbol). The discs have a hole in them.&lt;br/&gt;One player starts the game as the first treasure hunter. He/she gets the 3 red markers and tries to find the three treasures.&lt;br/&gt;The other player shuffles the discs, draws three of them and looks at them, without letting the treasure hunter see them. These discs specify the locations where the treasures are. The other discs form a face-down stack.&lt;br/&gt;The treasure hunter then takes the first disc from the stack and places it on the corresponding location on the board. His/her opponent checks how many treasures are adjacent to that location and marks this by rotating the tile in such a way that the hole shows the same number as dots as there are treasures on adjacent spaces. This is repeated until the treasure hunters thinks he/she knows where the three treasures are. He/she marks the suspected locations with the red markers. Then the actual locations of the treasures are revealed. The treasure hunter gets positive points for location discs not used, and minus points for incorrectly marked locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the players switch roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 6 rounds. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
