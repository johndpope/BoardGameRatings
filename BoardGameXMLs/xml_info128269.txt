			<description>Another game by the company that specialised in making designs so that partially or totally colour blind people can play. They mainly made traditional games but this is an original game by the company owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 7 x 7 grid. Each player must try to get four pegs in a row, hence the name of the game. It is a refined version of Go-Moku or 5-in-a-Row. The limit on placing pegs is that each peg played must be adjacent to an opposition peg. First to get four in a row, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
