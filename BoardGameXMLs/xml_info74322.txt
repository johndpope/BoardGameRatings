For 4-7 characters, levels 8-12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;Susurrus Tenebrarum. Well over a century ago, six noble houses from the dark elf city Dar Multai grew tired of the incessant, petty political maneuverings of the seven other noble houses in the city.Moreover, they were experiencing a profound loss of faith in the patron deity of their city, the capricious and largely uncaring Spider Goddess. In spite of their chaotic natures, representatives from these six frustrated noble houses spent several months concocting a plan to leave Dar Multai permanently and seek their fortunes elsewhere. They eventually discovered a long-abandoned dark elf city organized around the worship of an elder, largely forgotten god in direction opposition to the Spider Goddess. It took these dark elves several decades to rebuild the city to its former glory, and they are now poised to declare war on all of the cities of the lightless realms beneath the earth...An all new adventure based in the Usherwood Adventures campaign setting. Use with the dar Origo Liber campaign setting, or set within your own campaign world. Designed for First Edition and OSRIC(TM) fantasy-based roleplaying game systems.
