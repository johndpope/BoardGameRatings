			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 62 x 40 inch, 2 level, full color floorplan of a Saxon Village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product due to its size only comes with the Square Overlay version and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Vikings have come to raid and pillage the village! Bring your axes and plowshares lest there be nothing left of our town but ash!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product includes two maps of a Saxon village. The first map is an exterior view of the village showing the thatched roofs. The second map is a cutaway map that removes the roofs to see the house interiors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in fantasy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viking Raid: The Saxon village is under attack by Vikings. They have come to raid and pillage for plunder and then raze the town to the ground when they are done. The adventurers staying at the town&amp;rsquo;s inn must come to the defense of the northern gate in order to help the town fend off the attack. A wooden platform rising above the palisade and the guard tower can be used to survey the battlefield and pick off Vikings with ranged attacks. With melee characters throwing ladders off the platform and defending the archers and if worse comes to worst defending the town in a desperate last stand when the gate collapses. The Vikings are after the rune-inscribed monument in the center of town and kill anyone in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
