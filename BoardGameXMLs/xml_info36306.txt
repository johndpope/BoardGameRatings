			<description>&amp;quot;Card game. Simulates small unit tactics in World War II.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck of cards. Tokens are used to represent soldiers. Two six-sided dice are also required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each player starts with one squad of one of the five available nationalities. American squads start with 12 men. German, British, and Japanese squads start with 10 men. Russian platoons start with 36 men.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differences between the nationalities are depicted in other ways, such as the number of cards drawn each turn and through National Trait Cards which have a different effect depending on which nationality plays the card. The rules also account for range, morale/rally, being pinned down, covering fire, opportunity fire, and terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: There are two ways to win: Kill or rout all members of your opponents squad. Collect 3 Mission Objective Cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
