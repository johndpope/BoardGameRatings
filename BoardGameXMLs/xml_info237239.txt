			<description>The players have to get their 14 playing pieces (crowns and bishop's miters) from their starting position to the starting position of their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;Forward movement is by jumping diagonaly over friendly or opponent playing pieces. The pieces may move diagonaly backwards to get in position for other pieces to jump over them.&lt;br/&gt;The playing pieces can't move onto the white spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
