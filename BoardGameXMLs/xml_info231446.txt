			<description>Mercenaries incorporates a mix of a tabletop game with the strategy of a deck building game. Players move around a grid while fighting monsters using cards from their hand. Be careful though, only the player that lands the killing blow gets the glory! Players must strategize when to attack, when to defend, and where to stand. Players also have to contend with other players using their abilities to turn the game on its head, charging ahead of the pack, making a monster retaliate against someone else, or coercing other players into helping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a deck building game that incorporates strategical movement on a tabletop board. We have removed as many dice as possible to prevent the game from being too luck based, allowing your own strategies by what cards you acquire to thrive. The game also has multiple strategic levels. What cards to acquire, where to move on the board, and when to attack. All of these can alter what other players might be planning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
