			<description>From the rules sheet-&lt;br/&gt;The Legend: Bayard was a huge horse of tremendous strength. It is said that he saved the lives of four knights and ridiculed the army of the great King Charlemagne by jumping hills and rivers from Spain to Germany.&lt;br/&gt;Like Bayard, you must use strategic skill to avoid the opponent's soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;Bayard, a game easily learned, is an exciting and challenging way of increasing your reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays very similar to checkers but with some twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of game - capture all opponent's soldiers and Bayards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is 10 rows of 5 circles with lines connecting them.&lt;br/&gt;The players set up their 20 soldiers (glass beads) on opposite sides of the playing mat. Like checkers, each soldier can only move forward one space. Unlike checkers, each soldier can capture a piece by jumping forward or backward. If a soldier reaches the opposite side, it becomes a Bayard, and a different colored bead is used to represent it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bayard moves and jumps like a King in checkers. However, unlke checkers a Bayard piece can move several spaces at a time. Also, can capture pieces by jumping even if there are several spaces between the opponent's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
