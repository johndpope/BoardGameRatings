							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Japhet Jenkins&#039; and Sally Jones&#039; Visit Tu Bosting</name>
									
			<description>The rules say the full title of this 1868 game from Milton Bradley is: &amp;quot;A Side-splitting Account of Japhet Jenkins' and Sally Jones' Visit Tu Bosting with the Old Meere and a Load Uv Pro-Duce&amp;quot;, subtitled &amp;quot;A facetious fund of funny fancies from fact and fiction&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One part of the game consists of a booklet with title page, publishing information and preface, followed by a 20-page story told in a kind of country-bumpkin dialect and containing many blanks. The other part of the game is made up of 162 small (2.5&amp;quot; x 1/2&amp;quot;) cards each printed with a noun and one or more other words (e.g. &amp;quot;A rusty rasher of bacon&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;A fighting parson&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One member of the party is designated as the narrator, and the small cards are distributed equally among the rest face down. As the narrator reads the story, he points to one of the players as he gets to each blank, and that player turns over his top card and reads it aloud. Merriment ensues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
