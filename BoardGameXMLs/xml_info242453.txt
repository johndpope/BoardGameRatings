			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music echoes off the poorly decorated walls of the Rusted Edge Inn, an old inn located in the vast alleys circling the great arena of Kameff in the land of Kre&amp;rsquo;uul. The players, a band of mercenaries, are sitting around a table in the back of the inn, counting their payment from a recently finished job. From behind one of the players, a cloaked figure approaches the table, takes a seat, and begins to speak in a broken, crooked sounding voice. &amp;rdquo;Whatever it is you desire, whether bone shards, glory, or power, it shall be yours if you believe you have the strength,&amp;rdquo; the cloaked figure lowers its voice, &amp;ldquo;I have a request, a job for someone in your profession. And, if this job were to be completed, you will be payed in anyway you desire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
