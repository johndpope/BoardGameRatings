			<description>The board game for business studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Teen-Trepreneur students choose to run one of six businesses in the game and are given the challenge of leading it to business success! Each business is different in terms of its opening value and start-up capital; each entrepreneur has a personality and business background that will also affect the chances of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective for students is to be the first to achieve &amp;pound;5,000 profit. They&amp;rsquo;ll only do that if they take risks and manage sales and costs effectively. Students can run a luxurious hotel or an everyday market stall. They can even invest in the businesses run by other players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains features such as: generating sales, expenses, the stock market, investment, opening businesses abroad, loans and interest. It helps raise a young person&amp;rsquo;s understanding about how a business is started and how a business is being run in today&amp;rsquo;s world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
