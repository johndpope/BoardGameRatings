			<description>Rockit to Number 1 is a premium pop and rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll trivia board game that engages and entertains all players no matter how much music trivia they hold in their heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experts on the popular music from the 60's right up to today will love the challenge but with a little strategy and a lucky spin of the Category Record, even a casual listener to Top 40 radio can be the player to Rockit to Number 1 and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rockit to Number 1 is packed with 3,000 questions in 5 categories. The 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's+ categories organize the world of pop and rock&amp;lsquo;n&amp;lsquo;roll trivia according to the year it happened: the major events, the albums and singles, record sales and hit parade accomplishments, and more.  It's Only Words, the wild category, challenges your memory for the lyrics of your favorite songs from the 60's to today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spin the Record, choose your category and answer the question.  Each correct answer moves your Hit Single up the charts, but be careful: depending on your Hit Single's current position, a wrong answer can mean sliding back to &amp;ldquo;last week's&amp;rdquo; position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move their Hit Single into the Number 1 position on their Top Twenty Chart is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
