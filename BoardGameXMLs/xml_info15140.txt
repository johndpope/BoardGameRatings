			<description>Theme: In this game, elephants balance from tree to tree!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the jungle, a square containing 36 tree cards. Each player controls two elephants of his color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, the top card is revealed. The action described upon it will then be accomplished successively by all players. The 4 different actions are:&lt;br/&gt;- take off a tree from the jungle&lt;br/&gt;- move a tree&lt;br/&gt;- move an elephant to a nearby tree&lt;br/&gt;- make an elephant jump over the nearby tree&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all action cards have been revealed, they are shuffled again to create a new pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the trees disappearing, it becomes harder and harder for the elephants to stay in the jungle. Indeed the movements are compulsory.&lt;br/&gt;If an elephant cannot complete the action, he falls from his tree (only one elephant per tree, heavy enough!) and is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;The game stops when only one player has elephants left in the game and he is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
