							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1st &amp; Goal: Mideast Division</name>
									
			<description>1st &amp;amp; Goal: Mideast Division, an expansion for 1st &amp;amp; Goal, contains 28 dice that make up four custom teams. The Dice Football League (DFL) Mideast division includes the following teams:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Birmingham Black Widows &amp;ndash; The Black Widows enter the league of 24 inaugural teams with a top 10-ranked running and passing games. Despite a strong offense, the Black Widows are in danger of getting stomped on defense. Coach Harris Gray states, &amp;quot;We spent all our money on offense. Our defensive squad is pretty much all volunteers.&amp;quot; Nose Guard Mildred Dinkins had this to say: &amp;quot;I just go out there every Sunday and do my best. Can I say 'hi' to my grandson?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Columbus Cobras &amp;ndash; The Cobras enter the league with the 10th-ranked running game and the 16th-ranked passing game. Not only do the Cobras enter the league with a top-ten running game, their defense stands at 9th in the rankings and is one of the most consistent. Coach Bobby &amp;quot;Bam&amp;quot; Boozell states, &amp;quot;I'm so proud of our defense. That's a tough group of young men. They may not be the best out there, but we rarely have any surprises.&amp;quot; As mentioned, the Cobras have a top tier running game, led by running back, Cole Kutz. Mr. Kutz had not released a statement by press time. Rumors report that he was out looking for a sandwich endorsement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Scranton Scorchers &amp;ndash; The Scorchers enter the league with the 7th-ranked running game and the 19th-ranked passing game. Despite an inconsistent offense, the Scorchers have a top eleven defense. Coach Gus Tufwin states, &amp;quot;Right now I'm afraid our passing game blows. But our defense comes in like a hurricane, so hold on to your hats!&amp;quot; Wide Receiver Buddy Fingers commented: &amp;quot;Coach makes a lot of noise about our passing problems, but I'm quick as lightning, man, fast as the wind. I just have a problem holding on to the ball sometimes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Toronto Thunder &amp;ndash; The Thunder enter the league with the 17th-ranked running game and a bottom ranked passing game. Despite a weak offense, the Thunder have a top ten defense. Coach Hammond Ecks states, &amp;quot;We're going to hatch some surprise plays that should have the other teams scrambling to catch us.&amp;quot; Quarterback Cuba Sugar commented: &amp;quot;I got the sweet moves, baby, but I'm not afraid to hang out there and take a lump or two myself.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
