							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Axe to Grind</name>
									
			<description>Publishers Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The frontier town of Ehrshire is expanding rapidly, much to the delight of the burgeoning town&amp;rsquo;s lord, Earl Wallace Viktir. In need of timber to expand his seat of power, the earl has sent logging crews to the surrounding forest, although recent delays have caused him to become anxious and impulsive. Earl Viktir has left for the logging site to see what is causing the setbacks, only to discover it disturbingly vacant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The task now falls to the PCs to catch up with the missing Earl Viktir and sort out the trouble in the woods, but such as task is easier said than done. Something has roused the local plant-life into a frenzy, as if the entire forest has an axe to grind against the loggers! Will the party be able to get to the root of the problem&amp;hellip; or will they be left barking up the wrong tree?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Axe to Grind is part of Dungeons on Demand: Volume Three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
