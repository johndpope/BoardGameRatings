			<description>Anex-A-Gram is a variant of Anagrams played on a 13x13 square grid of circular holes punched through the game board.  The game pieces are black wooden tiles with a circular peg on the bottom (to fit in the board's holes) and a raised-relief white letter on top.  (Or in the case of one tile, a red cross.)  Tile racks are included for each player.  The game is an early attempt to move Anagrams onto a game board, like the later Scrabble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with these other games, the goal in Anex-A-Gram is to be the first to use up all of your tiles and to score the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
