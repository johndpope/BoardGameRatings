			<description>Uuno Turhapuro muuttaa maalle is a side-scrolling video game, available for the Commodore 64. It was developed by the Finnish programmer Pasi Hyt&amp;ouml;nen in 1986.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the popular Finnish comedy character Uuno Turhapuro, created by Spede Pasanen and played by the actor Vesa-Matti Loiri. The game was released in the same year as the movie with the same name. Uuno Turhapuro muuttaa maalle was the first Finnish game based on a movie license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uuno Turhapuro muuttaa maalle is a traditional 2D side-scrolling game, where the screen continuously scrolls from left to right. The player is controlling the character Uuno vertically by avoiding different obstacles and a few odd enemies like birds and angry neighbors. The player must travel a certain distance with four lives and earn money in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists three different levels loosely based on a movie. In the first level Uuno has a farming plough and he's being pulled behind the car (you don't see the actual car in the game) on the dirt road of his hometown. In the second level he's water skiing and in the final level Uuno is at the local forest looking for his father's moonshining stills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Uuno Turhapuro muuttaa maalle (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
