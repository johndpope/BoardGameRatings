			<description>Described in the book Calculate!, Away Across is a game where players try to connect opposite sides of a 10x10 board of 100 numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play makes use of a calculator, though can be done by hand.  A player selects a square on the board and a number that is entered into the calculator.  The second player multiples this number by another number.  Play then alternates between players, marking and subtracting values on the board from the running difference with the person who gets the value to zero or lower claiming the set of marked values of his or her color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who connects his or her two edges of the board with captured sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
