			<description>&amp;ldquo;Rome was the scene of civil unrest. The Senate needed a strong leader to restore order, but they feared creating a dictator. They decided to appoint three men to share command - Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The plan began to unravel when Crassus was killed in Egypt. This set up a power struggle between Caesar, who was in Gaul, and Pompey who was in Rome. Caesar stopped at the Rubicon River with his army. He knew that if he crossed the river it would mean civil war, a gamble that might cost him his life.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;With the famous words &amp;lsquo;the die is cast&amp;rsquo; he crossed the river, sparking a civil war with Pompey's supporters. The decisive battle of the war was fought in 48 BC at Pharsalus. Caesar was triumphant. Pompey fled to Egypt, where he was killed. Casesar became dictator, turning the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire in the process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).
