			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good has fallen and the great Woonder Well is chasing even the Labyrinth Lord with his heard of cows away.  Will the Woonder Balls be enough to entice the adventurer's to go down and find what has spoiled it?  Something bad has happened and maybe more evil things are on the way.  Time to climb down to the bottom with a sword drawn and an invicible attitude. Down down DOWN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Wrong With The Woonder Well? is a mid level Labyrinth Lord adventure.  Sure enough to bite even the mightiest armored adventurer in half!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
