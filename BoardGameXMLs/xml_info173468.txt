							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Post-Apocalyptic Dispatch (Issue 15 - 2008)</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Twisted Earth is filled with desperate men and wastrels, men young and old whose only recreation is drinking, gambling, and fighting one another. But Moe's Moving Picture Emporium offers a much more tantalizing distraction from the misery of the dry desert outside; here, behind the junkyard walls, lurid ancient film reels play over and over again to a debased clientele who will pay almost anything for a glimpse of the physical pleasures that elude them in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Moe's is more than just a seedy adult movie theatre; Moe is an avid collector of old Ancient-era arcanum (in the form of films), and a PC getting on his good side might be able to convince him to put something else on for an evening. Such a character would have to be able to pay for the customers lost (after all, most people come here for dirty movies, and will be greatly disappointed if they don't get what they paid for), but it might be worth it to some characters to get a chance to see something from the dreamy, wholesome, Ancient world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
