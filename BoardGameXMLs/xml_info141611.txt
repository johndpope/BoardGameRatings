							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ancient Warriors: The Vikings</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A-Viking We Will Go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vikings. These ancient warriors, seafarers, and explorers have left an undisputable mark on the course of western history. Throughout the middle-ages they were feared and hated throughout Europe as an unstoppable scourge of rabid barbarians. In the East, a group of Vikings formed one of the most elite military units in the Byzantine Empire. They were far ahead of their time in terms of seamanship, and their extensive travels brought them to nearly every corner of the world, long before most of their contemporaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you, too, can harness the power of the Viking. This book takes a look at what it means to be a Viking, both from a historical perspective, providing information on Vikings in the way that historical evidence indicates they really were, and from a mythological perspective, providing information on the modern myth of the Viking, and the way that Vikings are seen today by many people, regardless of whether or not it&amp;rsquo;s accurate, and also provides some advice and suggestions for running Viking-themed adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even better, though, Ancient Warriors: The Vikings provides seven brand new and highly expansive and detailed archetypes for a variety of classes, allowing them to bring out their inner berserker. On top of this, the book contains three prestige classes&amp;mdash;the berserker, the housecarl, and the jomsviking, each of which not only has new and exciting mechanics that make the class come alive, but also contain detailed background information and tips on roleplaying characters of that class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of Vikings, this book is a great tool towards creating a truly memorable Viking experience at the table. If you&amp;rsquo;re somehow not a fan of Vikings, that&amp;rsquo;s fine too: by the time you&amp;rsquo;re done with this book, you will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
