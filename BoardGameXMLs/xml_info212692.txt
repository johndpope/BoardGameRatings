			<description>Promo coaster released at Gencon 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spilled Ale:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the Spilled Ale side of the coaster on the board. It covers a 3&amp;times;3 square area.  These are called &amp;lsquo;Ale&amp;rsquo; squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any character that moves into an Ale square (and is on the floor) slides until they move off of the coaster, or hit a table, wall, or another character.  This only counts as one square of movement. They may continue moving once they exit the coaster or are stopped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they hit a table, they stop sliding.  If they slide into a square with another character, both characters start sliding until they are both no longer on the coaster, or hit a table or wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If player is Knocked Back onto an Ale square, they slide as above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for POKER TABLE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Poker Table side of the coaster can be used one of two ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Poker Table: Use two Large tables to support the Poker Table on the board. It is a 3&amp;times;3 table, and is subject to all Table rules. It may be pushed, flipped, etc.  The two tables that are supporting it are considered part of the Poker Table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Ilicit Gambling: The coaster is placed off of the board. Any time a character has to give reputation to another character, and the Coaster has three or fewer reputation on it, place one Reputation from the bank on to the coaster, in addition to the normal effects of the Action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the coaster has four or more reputation on it, the next time a character gains reputation they also take all the reputation from the coaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an action causes multiple characters to give reputation, one reputation per character goes on the coaster. A character may only take the Reputation when it has at least four at the start of the Action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
