							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bermuda Crisis: Discovery Dawning (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>At its core, The Bermuda Crisis: Discovery Dawning is a free-form card game about skill acquisition and management. Players accomplish this by drawing resources they then spend to obtain various abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time you'll use the various resources you've collected to build and upgrade base camps. These camps specialize in (1) defense &amp;amp; resource efficiency, (2) game control &amp;amp; magic, and (3) trading &amp;amp; secret missions. Striking a balance between focus and diversification is the biggest challenge players will face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the game by acquiring victory points, but there are two alternate endings. As the game progresses, an imaginary hourglass counts down the island's doom. If time runs out, a victor is chosen via the collection of &amp;quot;nature points.&amp;quot; The third way a game can end is if a player collects all three pieces of Brinehorn's Scroll, which are scattered randomly throughout the island and unlock the esoteric history of The Bermuda Triangle. Both alternate scenarios create palpable suspense as players race towards their preferred ending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, The Bermuda Crisis: Discovery Dawning is easy to learn but challenging to master. It appeals to different personality types and finishes on an exhilarating note. You and your gaming comrades will want to explore the island time and time again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
