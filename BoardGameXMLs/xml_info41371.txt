			<description>A word card game, whose deck has 85 cards, each with a letter and its value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game, a player's turn consists of turning over 3 letters face up in order, and naming as many words as they can that contain those 3 letters in that order.  Example: with PAT, you could name sPAT, PArT, sePAraTe, etc.  Then the score is the sum of the cards' values time the number of words stated.  There is a maximum of 5 words, and a time limit is recommended for the turns.  If the player thinks no word is possible he declares a Stymie, and if no one else can think of a word he gets 100 points; if someone can, she gets 50 points while the declarer loses 50.  After the deck runs out, highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several variations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Juniors - For younger players, use 2 cards instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Sliders - use 2 cards, and only 5-letter words with both letters adjacent are allowed, one each of XXxxx, xXXxx, xxXXx, and xxxXX.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Twos - Use 2 cards, and think of any number of words (up to ten), of any length, with both letters adjacent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Famous Names - Use 2 cards, and try to think of a famous name with those initials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Initials - Use 2 cards, and think of a phrase, or two related words, the begin with those two letters.  (E.g., with MD, Medical Doctor.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Solitaire - use 3 cards, and find only 1 word per triple; try to find one for each triple dealt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Charades - Use 2 cards, and act out a phrase starting with those two letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
