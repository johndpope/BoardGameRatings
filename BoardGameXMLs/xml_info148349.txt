			<description>Welcome to the wildest and funniest, &amp;quot;screw your neighbor&amp;quot; game for 2-4 players. It is a fun game you play with your friends, as you put them down one card and one lap at a time.  Racing is the motif, but not always the main goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Play as the Rednecks, Hippies, Soccer Moms or the Old Folks&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Each team has a unique flavor and sense of humor&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Use your hand of cards to help yourself and hinder your opponents &amp;ndash; BEWARE THE TERNADER!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    100 Action cards all with different art will ensure that you enjoy looking at, as well as playing this game&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    This is a &amp;ldquo;screw your neighbor&amp;rdquo; game &amp;ndash; play with your friends and destroy them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Summary&lt;br/&gt;Every play gets to use a custom racing team of their choice.  16 teams to choose from, each with a unique racing team and car!  You appear to be racing around a race track trying to be the first to finish the race (on one of 3 tracks), but really you are just trying to survive while you and your opponents try to wreck each other out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of seven cards at the start of each players turn and when you are trying to move you are playing good cards on yourself while everyone else is playing cards to try to hurt your chances.  It is a rough place to drive but oh so much fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your turn is over you and the other players start trying to ruin the day for the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrash-Car uses a combination of a hand of cards (resource management) and dice (roll for your life) to push the players around this track in the exciting race of their lives.  You have to make sure you have enough cards to help yourself while still being able to mess with your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to cross the finish line OR the last car running will be the victor in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Play as a hilarious over the top character &amp;ndash; own the persona and enjoy the ride&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Each team has a unique look and sense of humor&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    You have to carefully manage your cards to ensure you can hold off the other players while still being able to wreck them out of the game&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Car art from over 10 unique artists make the game as visually appealing and unique as the game play itself&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
