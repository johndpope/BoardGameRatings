			<description>Your parents have given each of their children a part of the family farm in the small but growing town of Cottonwood. You have three years to show that you can make your share profitable. You may plant corn and grain, raise animals, and gather berries and herbs from the countryside. You may sell goods at each of the three Markets, and enter the income in your ledger. The sibling who has the most money in their ledger after the third year wins the contest, and will receive the remainder of the family farm. [Source: rules]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Cottonwood Contest, players develop their farms by plowing fields, planting corn and grain, building pastures, raising animals, weaving baskets, and gathering herbs and berries. Double-ended farm cards depict the choices for what the farmers may do with their day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three scoring phases, triggered by drawing a market card. Prices for each item fluctuate, and players must determine the best time to sell their items. Corn and grain may be sold, or used to raise sheep and cows. Players may sell the wool from their sheep and the milk from their cows, or the sheep and cows themselves. Players may sell berries and herbs, or make the berries into jam and dry the herbs to sell at a later market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the most money in their ledger after the third market is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
