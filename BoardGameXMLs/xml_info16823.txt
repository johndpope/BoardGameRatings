			<description>In the 1960s, Milton Bradley capitalized upon the popularity of bridge by publishing a series of games by bridge master Charles H. Goren. This is one of the more obscure titles in this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is described as, &amp;quot;An exciting, fast playing bridge game that scores differently and simply for 3, 4, or 5 players with one winner. It is strictly cutthroat in the bidding, but it creates a variety of partnerships against declarers after the bidding. The new and novel scoring system forces players to bid daringly, and sometimes play with exuberance.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a plastic playing platform with pegs to track bids, scoring, and card slots to facilitate dummy play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
