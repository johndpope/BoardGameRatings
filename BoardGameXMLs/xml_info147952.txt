							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skull Throne</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 16 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a fantasy throne room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Skull Throne module is a single room map with a giant throne of bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Skull Throne is intended for use in Fantasy or Horror games. It could also make an excellent alien throne room in a Science Fiction game.  &lt;br/&gt; One adventure with the Skull Throne could be a large city with a massive sewer system starts experiencing a string of murders at night with an ever-increasing death toll. The Player Characters are hired to investigate the murders by the town&amp;rsquo;s leaders who are under a lot of political pressure to stop the murders. The Player Characters might find out about what is happening by making streetwise tests to question witnesses who have seen shuffling creatures coming from the city sewers or successfully tracking the footsteps of skeletons from the murder sites. Once in the sewers, the Player Characters have to fight off any number of carrion eaters before coming upon a horde of skeletons. The skeletons are going to the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters can choose to engage them or to sneak by them. Once they either defeat the skeleton hordes or sneak past, they find the skull throne room. Sitting on the skull throne is a necromancer who has been killing the townsfolk and raising them as skeletons slowly but surely building an army. The necromancer hates the town leaders and wants them overthrown. The necromancer has quite a few tricks up his sleeve. For example, he could animate the chained skull heads, using them to try and bite anyone who gets near him and some powerful skeleton bodyguards as well. The Player Characters need to defeat the necromancer to save the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
