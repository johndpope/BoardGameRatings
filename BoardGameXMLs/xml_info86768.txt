			<description>&amp;ldquo;Abetto&amp;rdquo; is a dynamic, exciting game, where players become gentlemen and ladies brought from Arsen Lupin's stories and compete with each other for the name of the greatest burglar, lover and fencer of the nobel underworld.&lt;br/&gt; There are several ways to achieve success. By means of committing burglary you can get trophies and gadgets that are essential to win the game. They also help you in overcoming challenges of the game as well as give you an opportunity to harm your  opponents. By shooting at rivals or dueling with them you can steal their chosen trophies but you may also lose yours.&lt;br/&gt; Mechanics of the game is based on modified roulette rules. Players bet the result on a special even/odd table and a number table (1-36). The probability of failure is small &amp;ndash; only 25% - and can be further  reduced  by means of some gadgets. The esthetic wooden roulette is attached to the game.&lt;br/&gt; In order to smooth down certain randomness that accompanies burglaries, shoots and duels, so called task cards were introduced to the game. There is a different task for each round and after accomplishing it a player receives prize in the form of trophies and gadgets. Fulfilling the task depends solely on player&amp;rsquo;s behavior.&lt;br/&gt; The game board is based on a tile system. Players arrange it themselves and each time they compose a different district in which the game takes place.&lt;br/&gt; Abetto game provides large interaction between players and a great deal of emotions. Even during another player&amp;rsquo;s turn you take active part in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
