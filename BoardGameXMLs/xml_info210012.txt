							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">vs. Stranger Stuff</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adolescent Supernatural Mischief in the 1980's!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the VsM Engine created by Phillip Reed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;vs. Stranger Stuff is a mini-rpg of 80&amp;rsquo;s inspired adventure/horror/ sci-fi, typically involving children and teens. Of course we were in influenced by the recent hit Netflix series Stranger Things, but also those great films that inspired that series. What does this mean? It means that a game of vs. Stranger Stuff will involve you playing an adolescent during the 1980&amp;rsquo;s going against strange and unusual adversaries (often supernatural) with the aid of your loyal group of childhood friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;vs. Stranger Stuff is a complete roleplaying game using the VsM Engine in a slimmed down and quick to use format. Experienced gamers will have no problem creating interesting characters, learning the rules, and starting a game. All you need is paper, pencils, and a deck of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
