							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spacehawk: Lone Wolf of the Void</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUPERHUMAN ENEMY OF INTERSTELLAR CRIME!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one knows where he comes from. Few have seen his face. But the name of Spacehawk is spoken in hate-filled whispers by pirates and despots throughout space, for they live in fear of the day he comes after them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early in his career, cartoonist Basil Wolverton applied his unique style to a wild fusion of superhero and pulp sci-fi elements in the &amp;quot;Starhawk&amp;quot; series. It was the story of a mysterious man who roamed space, defeating criminals and protecting the innocent wheever he found them. There has never been a series like it, and Wolverton's cartoonish yet creepy aliens and monsters remain unmatched even though it's been nearly 75 since they first saw print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spacehawk: Lone Wolf of the Void contains the best of a series that was too weird for readers at the time, yet which is exciting and fresh to this very day exactly because of its weirdness. We are presenting this collection with the original coloring in place so you can experience them as the original readers did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to five great Wolverton classics, Spacehawk: Lone Wolf of the Void contains feats and two nrew talent trees for use with d20 OGL Modern geared toward making sci-fi heroes in Spacehawk's image and a brief introduction by editor Steve Miller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IN OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD COLORS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
