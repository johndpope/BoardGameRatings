			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Road to Revolution Campaign Arc; a series of adventures designed for use with the 3.5 version of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular role-playing game. Set in the Great City, this epic campaign takes characters from their humble beginnings, all the way to powerful adventurers upon whose actions the City will come to depend. The Campaign Arc contains six adventures in all, each written by the original authors of the Great City Campaign Setting. Arc adventures can be played individually or linked with others in the series to create a complete campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Skullcrackers is the first adventure of the series, written by John E. Ling Jr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lightless warehouse alleys of the Trades Ward fester like the sour, fly-covered belly of an old nag. When the streetlamps dim, the wood-planked warehouses seem to stagger with their own decrepit drunkenness, and what little pity the ward can muster comes from beggars too poor to split a copper or toughs who gather in vacant storerooms to wager coins and chickens upon their fists. Is it any wonder then, why it sparks such a romantic attraction to off-duty military officers? For here, there are no lingering eyes of justice, no harsh penalties or judgments other than what a man can dole out with his own muscle. In a minute, a man can prove himself a primal warrior, or fall to the dust and tribunal humiliation of his silent peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Skullcrackers is a low-level urban adventure designed to introduce players to the Great City and is appropriate for four characters of 1st-level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
