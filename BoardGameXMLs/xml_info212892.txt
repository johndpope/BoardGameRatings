			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for Some Strange?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a visit to London, Nathaniel Night discovered magic in the scrolls of Le Mort du Arthur, and unfortunately, gained the attention of the agents of Lork Orkus. Earth's Merlin intervened in an ensuing attack and took Nathaniel on as a new student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When this new student became the next Merlin of Earth (PL 13), he made an ememy of Khabal, the master's closest apprentice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the new Merlin of Earth, Night has battled many mystical foes, and made an ally in Cantor, the son of Lord Orkus. The two have agreed to make peace with their two realms and work together to defeat their mutual foe, Lord Orkus, once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
