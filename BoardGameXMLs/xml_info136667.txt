							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wisdom from the Wastelands (Issue 8 - Mar 22, 2012)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue #8: Diseases &amp;amp; Medical Options&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the final wars that destroyed the Ancients&amp;rsquo; civilization, some of the most horrifying weapons unleashed were terrible biological diseases and plagues. Such diseases were great equalizers, their viruses and bacteria striking down unlucky victims regardless of wealth, ethnicity, or homeland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the Mutant Future core book touches on optional rules regarding diseases and their effects, this issue will provide Mutant Lords with a wider range of possibilities. These additions expand the Constitution Table, include healing rates and negative hit points, and provide simple but effective rules covering mutants using the Ancients&amp;rsquo; drugs and medical equipment. Several new types of disease &amp;mdash; both infectious and mutagenic &amp;mdash; are also introduced, as well as detailed rules covering symptoms and a new type of saving throw. In short, everything a ML needs to make player characters&amp;rsquo; lives that much more &amp;ldquo;interesting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
