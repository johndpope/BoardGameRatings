			<description>Your Family Rocks puts your family memories at the center of the board game. The game uses your own family photos as the 60 &amp;ldquo;family cards&amp;rdquo; in the game, being the first your-photos-transformed-into-cards board game, where your photos play the central role in the game, influencing your strategy, your score, your control over pieces, and in the end, how the game plays out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever is in your pictures is now fair game - you are now the creator of your board game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game unfolds over different dynamics about family memories (photos). The better the players perform on these dynamics - Family Challenges - the more Family Time they will earn. As in real life, it takes time to raise a family, so players will use their Family Time to grow their family members, values, rules and objects - each worth different prosperity points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of game, the most prosperous family wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
