							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunger: Zombies Must Feed</name>
									
			<description>We've all seen it. The zombie watches the terrified human climb up the ladder to safety. The zombie stares at the ladder, then at his hands, and then slowly, awareness begins to filter in. And then, one rung at a time, he starts to climb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunger is an add-on for any genreDiversion i game, including HardNova II, Coyote Trail, or the GDi Manual. In it, you play a zombie who wanders the earth devouring humans, and slowly reconnecting with his former life. Needless to say, Hunger is for mature audiences only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is quite tough being a zombie. Not only are you hungry all the time, and constantly at risk of being destroyed by crazed humans, but you also have this nagging feeling that something is missing in your unlife. And with each life you take, with each person you devour, you remember more and more of that which you have lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunger includes new rules, gimmicks, and zombie templates, as well as a sample of play, story seeds, and an adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunger requires the genreDiversion i Manual, HardNova II, Coyote Trail, or any other GDi-based game for play. Hunger can even be used with Iron Gauntlets for fantasy zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
