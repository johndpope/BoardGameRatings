			<description>Death Skid Marks is a trashy hard as hell car combat game about a post-apocalyptic road trip to the ultimate gig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drive 666 KMs to the ultimate concert.&lt;br/&gt;Unique blend of top-down arcade action, RPGs and rogue-likes&lt;br/&gt;Trashy humor and art.&lt;br/&gt;Original metal/rock/punk soundtrack.&lt;br/&gt;Battle charming people in crappy cars such as inbreds and intolerant fanatics.&lt;br/&gt;Arm yourself with high tech weaponry such as pistols, bricks and chainsaws.&lt;br/&gt;A full run that lasts around 1H30, replay often but die often.&lt;br/&gt;Completely random levels, infinite replay value.&lt;br/&gt;30 achievements that all unlock new content.&lt;br/&gt;32 vehicles to drive.&lt;br/&gt;Over 70 different items to buy.&lt;br/&gt;Choose how you earn money with tasks.&lt;br/&gt;Gambling mini-games.&lt;br/&gt;16 hitchhikers.&lt;br/&gt;11 bosses and around 50 different enemy types (not counting variations).&lt;br/&gt;Meet friendly but misunderstood bosses who will probably kill you often. To make this even better, there are more bosses than room for them in each runs, so you won't be able to predict what charming friend awaits.&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade your ride to outdrive your foes and get wasted on drugs to upgrade your stats!&lt;br/&gt;Four different endings.&lt;br/&gt;Total lack of zombies and chiptune sound samples!&lt;br/&gt;You will die often.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
