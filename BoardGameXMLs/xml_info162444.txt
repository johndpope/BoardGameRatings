			<description>The King&amp;rsquo;s brother is looking for a few good men to help him in his cause to be king.  Each player is either a loyal guard or an assassin. You must find and work with the other assassin to kill the king or find and stop the assassins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with the same hand but must master how to play it.  Each card helps tell a little of what your opponents are up to.  As assassin, it&amp;rsquo;s vital to find your partner and go for the assassination of the king.  Or, as guards you must block the assassins.  Each round the characters are switched and you have to reread all the players all over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 4 player deduction game without bluffing.  The more you play the crazier it gets.  As soon as you learn a strategy to beat your opponents the quicker they adapt a new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
