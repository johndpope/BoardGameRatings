							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Giro d&#039;Italia</name>
									
			<description>The game &amp;quot;Giro d'Italia&amp;quot; was included in Spielbox 3/91 as part of the &amp;quot;Spiel im Heft/Game in the zine&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board depicts a race track which is 40 hexes long and 3-4 hexes wide. Each player has 4 playing pieces, 4 speed cards (numbered with 3,5,6 and 8) and 3 chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played as a race including effects like slipstream and blocking other pieces. Only one single round is carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movements are handled with the 4 speed cards, where all 4 cards must be assigned to one of the 4 playing pieces. The speed can be increased by using slipstream or also by sacrificing some chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the middle and at the end of the race, chips are won by the first three arrivals. Winner of the game is the player with the most chips at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
