							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shattered Empire</name>
									
			<description>When mankind first discovered warp points, the gravitational anomalies that allowed him to travel to the stars, humanity spread like wildfire. A mighty Empire of Man grew in all directions. Colonies were planted on any planet that could support them. New spacefaring races were encountered, trade established, wars fought. Until finally the Empire of Man grew too large; internal dissention and external jealousy conspired to destroy it. First the far-flung Empire became too difficult to control centrally.  Outer systems demanded more sovereignty, leading to rebellion and civil war. And once that war was lost, neighboring races pounced, snatching what they could. The collapse culminated in the bombardment of Terra and the subjugation of most of the remaining colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, years later, humans on Old Terra have finally recovered. Humanity has spread all over known space, but humans on Mother Terra are ready to reach again for the stars. Ready to reclaim their Shattered Empire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shattered Empire is a Print and Play (PnP) solo game in which the player takes on the struggles of the people of Earth to rebuild and defend their new star empire. The map depicts the systems around Old Terra and, beyond that, the regions controlled by other governments and races. Each turn represents about a decade of time and each ship counter is an individual starship. Players try to expand and defend their empire and score victory points over a 150 year period of time (less if your empire completely succumbs to its foes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
