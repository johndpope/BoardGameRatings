							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slammin&#039; Bananas Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Object: To be the first player to get rid of all the cards in your 4 stock piles.&lt;br/&gt;Stock Pile 1 - 1 card face up&lt;br/&gt;Stock Pile 2 - 1 card face down and 1 card face up&lt;br/&gt;Stock Pile 3 - 2 cards face down and 1 card face up&lt;br/&gt;Stock Pile 4 - 3 cards face down and 1 card face up&lt;br/&gt;Stack the rest of the cards face down at the far left of the row. This is the banana pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together, players begin to take the top cards from their banana pile and place it face up in the center&lt;br/&gt;between them. As quickly as possible and at the same time, and using only 1 hand, both players play cards in sequence up or down from their face&lt;br/&gt;up stock piles onto either of the center cards. For example, if one of the center cards is a 4, either a 3 or a 5 can be played on it. Then a 4 or a 6 can be&lt;br/&gt;played on the 5, and so on. &lt;br/&gt;If a player&amp;rsquo;s banana pile runs out, he takes a center pile (leaving the top card in the center), shuffles it, turns it over to become his banana pile, and&lt;br/&gt;continues playing.&lt;br/&gt;Game End: The first player to play all of his stock pile cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     52 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
