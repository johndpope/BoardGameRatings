							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1st &amp; Goal: Midwest Division</name>
									
			<description>1st &amp;amp; Goal: Midwest Division, an expansion for 1st &amp;amp; Goal, contains 28 dice, which make up 4 custom teams. The Dice Football League (DFL) Midwest Division includes the following teams:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Knoxville Knights &amp;ndash; The Knights enter the league with the 2nd ranked running game and the 9th ranked passing game.  While they are able to mount a solid offense, the Knights are shielded by a less than chivalrous defense. Coach Arthur Roundtable states, &amp;quot;The football is our queen and we will protect it.&amp;quot; Quarterback Lance Lott states: &amp;quot;Yeah, well I'm the king! Protect me! Me!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Louisville Locusts &amp;ndash; The Locusts enter the league with the 8th ranked running game and the #1 ranked passing game. Despite an incredible offense, the Locusts have one of the lowest ranked defenses in the league. Coach Paul Ishtoff states, &amp;quot;Our team puts points on the board. Period. You can't stop us on the ground or in the air. Unfortunately, our defense bugs me.&amp;quot; Quarterback Rick O&amp;rsquo;Shea, the mastermind behind their brilliant passing game, had this to say: &amp;quot;We have a very simple formula for success. Our offense only has to put more points on the board than our defense gives away. Then it's all gravy!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Milwaukee Monsters &amp;ndash; The Monsters enter the league with the 15th ranked running game and the 6th ranked passing game. Despite less-than-stellar talent in running, the Monsters have one of the best passing games in the league. Coach Frankie Stein states, &amp;quot;We definitely need to work on our ground game, but when the Monsters put the ball in the air, we are scary.&amp;quot; Quarterback Wolfgang Mann could not be reached for comment. When asked about this, wide receiver Billy Phantom replied, &amp;quot;Yea, sometimes he disappears for days at a time. By the way, did you see that moon last night? Beautiful!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Springfield Spartans &amp;ndash; The Spartans enter the league with the 23rd ranked running game and the 15th ranked passing game. Despite troubles on offense, the Spartans have the #3 ranked defense in the league. Coach Colin Toksho states, &amp;quot;We rely on our defense to get us out of trouble. Unfortunately, we're usually in trouble.&amp;quot; When asked about the lukewarm running attack, running back Jackie Mollasses commented, &amp;quot;I may not be the fastest runner in the league&amp;hellip; what was the question?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
