			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vampires have always been, lurking quietly in the darkened streets, killing only when they had to, their existence a carefully guarded secret. Then something happened... no one knows exactly what, but now the bloodsuckers have lost control and unleashed their wrath on the defenseless and terrified city. So grab your stakes and holy water and get ready for some good old-fashioned vampire-hunting... Horror Rules style! &lt;br/&gt;Horror Rules Mini-Games provide all the fun and mayhem of Horror Rules without the rule crunching! Included in this Mini-Game is everything you need to play, including Paper Forge Minis, maps, weapons and item counters and more - just print and go! Use the more than 60 Horror Markers to simulate the challenges, dangers, perils and scares of the vampire-infested urban jungle, and change the mix to make a different game every time. You pick the size, scope, number of pieces and even the goal of each game. The Horror Rules Mini-Game system is flexible and fully customizable, great for veteran gamers, kids, families, parties or as a way to introduce new players to the wonders of gaming.
