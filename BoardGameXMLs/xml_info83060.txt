			<description>Taken from Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;ALL THE POWER OF SHINGEN IS IN YOUR HANDS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are SHINGEN, 16th century Samurai war lord. This is the ultimate in war simulation games. With your skill as a strategist you develop your country into a war machine. You control agriculture, mining, and morale among your people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must overcome typhoon epidemics, mine cave-ins, as well as powerful enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now enter SHINGEN's dream of total domination. Riflemen, Lancers, Calvary, and Ninja spies are waiting for your commands on 42 different battlefields. Only your skill shall determine victory or defeat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken from Wikipedia, 14sep10&lt;br/&gt;Shingen the Ruler (武田信玄２) is a turn-based strategy game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), produced by HOT・B in 1989, and released in North America in 1990. The original Takeda Shingen video game was never released in North America. This game was called Takeda Shingen 2 in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set during the Sengoku period of Japan. The player is Takeda Shingen, who is based in the holding of Kai and Shinano. The goal of the game is to conquer central Japan, roughly spanning from Kyoto to Kamakura. With the exception of &amp;quot;General Li&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;General Su&amp;quot; in the holding of Noto, the remaining warlords depicted in the game are actual historical figures, including Oda Nobunaga and Uesugi Kenshin. Play starts in January 1545, and the player may make one action per province (up to four) per month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must build and train an army, cultivate provinces, make (and break) alliances with neighboring daimyo. The game featured both random disasters (such as floods) and predefined events (such as the death of Shingen's father). One could also train Shingen's heir, Takeda Katsuyori.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat consists of a field skirmish, followed by a battle at the castle itself. Each holding's field and castle varies in layout. An automatic battle system is also provided, which calculates damage done by each army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shingen the Ruler,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
