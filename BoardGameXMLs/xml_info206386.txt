							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Weapon and Armor Charms - Special Mundane Item Qualities</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reliance on mundane equipment in 5th edition fantasy games is more important than ever. Magical items are rare, and most characters will be relying on unenchanted equipment for a large portion of their adventuring career. As such, there exists a gap between mundane items and magical equivalents. The concept encompasses a dynamic system for low-level powers that can enhance weapons without disrupting balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider the following items as not a replacement for magic weapons and armor, but to act as intermediary items that can make lower level loot tables feel more special and interesting. The best part is that they can supplement otherwise mundane equipment that is special to a character, such as heirloom armor or a sword that, while not magical, is made of a meteorite, for instance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of these charms are especially powerful or potent, and they won&amp;rsquo;t generally grant a competitive edge, but they do bestow interesting and character defining little tricks and boons that make your weapon and armor feel just a slight cut above the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
