			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover the Magic of the Goblins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many different approaches to magic, and different groups are able to master it in different ways, creating strange and exotic spells that others would never dream of. Goblins are no different in this regard, and their strange magic, which ranges from tribal shamanism to a great way to make things go &amp;quot;boom,&amp;quot; provides a number of potent spells for those who have a chance to learn them. While such secrets are rarely shared with outsiders, a number of these spells from the goblin warrens have been collected in this tome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains 18 new spells for a wide variety of spell lists, all of which are thematically linked to goblins, with a handful of spells devoted to their bugbear and hobgoblin cousins. Living in filth and squalor, some goblin shamans use eat disease/poison simply to have a safe meal, although they're sure to take advantage of the fact that they can transfer any disease or poison they ingest to their enemies with a touch. Transform your enemies into goblin dogs and ride them into battle with goblin dog transformation. Goblinruption transforms a single goblin into a potent explosive, unleashing a great kaboom in the event of its death. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking for unique and exciting spells for your goblin NPCs, or just want to expand your wizard&amp;rsquo;s ever-growing spellbook, the magic of goblins is not to be overlooked!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
