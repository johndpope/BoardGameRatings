			<description>Long Ago, Etheria was once a land of living legends. Throughout the ages, brave warriors across the realm stood together against the forces of evil, led by immortal beings known as the Old Ones. After a titanic struggle, these champions locked away the power of the Old Ones, inside Eternia Crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These legendary heroes have recently left their younger kin in charge of the common castle chores. Bored with their dreary duties, the inexperienced pupils decide to play. And accidentally unleash an ancient force that has long been dormant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Defenders is an original hybrid of two hot genres: Tower Defense and cooperative online Action-RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game puts players in the role of one of four distinctive hero classes, tasked with fending off hordes of invading beasties by strategically summoning a variety of Defenses &amp;amp; Traps throughout their castle. But as much more than just a strategy game, players directly participate in the action-packed combat with their hero characters, while upgrading their statistics, gathering tons of loot and inventory items, customizing &amp;amp; upgrading equipment, and developing unique class abilities. All of this can be enjoyed in seamless online and split-screen local multiplayer, as players cooperate and compete through the story campaign and challenge missions to build the strongest heroes and achieve the highest scores in the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining the depth of strategic gaming with the satisfying action of RPG character building, in a beautifully stylized &amp;lsquo;toon fantasy setting, Dungeon Defenders is designed to be a distinctly addictive, easy-to-play experience for casual and hardcore gamers alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
