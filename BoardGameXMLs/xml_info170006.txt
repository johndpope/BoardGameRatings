			<description>This basketball game starts like the real thing, with a &amp;quot;jump ball&amp;quot; to determine starting player.  From your hand and the two decks, two players go head to head placing players on their basketball team and defining the offense and defense.  First draw from the player deck and play a card, then draw from the coaches deck and play a card each turn.  Player cards will only score for you if they are played in the right positions on the court.  This results in free-throws, jump-shots or 3 pointers. The coaches deck helps you pick which offense or defense both teams are using. Use the REF card to remove your opponents key player just before the quarter ends. With this simple 2 deck card game, you can re-create four quarters of a basketball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
