			<description>[From the back cover.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2021--Peace or Pieces?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paraguay was bad, but nothing could have prepared you for Los Angeles. Back in the jungle it was still a tribe thing--you wanted to kill them, they wanted to kill you; no one knew why. But here, death isn't good enough. Here, they want you to hurt first. The sets, the '30s, the fly-jackers, the Estro-Gin addled punks--the only things standing between you and a body bag are your trusty GCS DW 770/g and designer genotype. You'd be surprised how often a skin that can shrug off .44 caliber loads comes in handy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, the punks will identify their real enemy and begin the serious violence--bloodshed of the people, by the people, and for the people. Until then, it's time to run a check and take this war down into the Underground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
