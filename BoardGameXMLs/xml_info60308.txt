			<description>2109 is a dice game set in the not-so-distant future of the year 2109. Players roll 7 dice to improve their ships in various ways, to attack other players and to earn valuable items to use later. Victory points are awarded for various accomplishments and/or trade-ins. The winner is the first player to earn 10 VP. The game is fast, usually around 20 mins, and plays with 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2109 is currently free to Print-And-Play, compliments of the designer. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
