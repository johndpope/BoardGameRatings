			<description>This game was published in spielbox 1992 #1.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has an 8x8 fields paper sheet, on which they should write words, using one field pro letter. The first player says a word with 3 to 5 letters and all players write this word on their sheets, one letter pro field, but only the consonants! The fields corresponding to vocals are kept empty. One can write the word where and how will, from the left to the right or from above to below. After all players have written this word, the next player says his word and the game proceeds in this way. If a player is unable to write a next word, he is out of the game. The aim of the game is writing the words in such a way, trying to have the fewest empty fields. Naturally, the words will have no sense after the empty fields have been filled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
