			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Shen Mue was a revolutionary action adventure game where the player tries to follow the trails of his father's killers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists mainly of following the thread of events by talking to different inhabitants of Yokosuka. Certain scenes are resolved by so-called Quick Time Events, where the player is supposed to quickly react and press the corresponding buttons. Fights are resolved in a fighting-game style environment, not unlike Virtua Fighter, where Ryo gradually learns more and more complex techniques the more he fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shen Mue was revolutional in the aspect of the living town of Yokosuka, in contrast to the typical &amp;quot;static&amp;quot; towns in role playing games. Time passed, people walked around town, from their houses in morning to their jobs, almost every inhabitant had a unique face and voice, and the detailed environment gave an illusion of being part of a living town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back:&lt;br/&gt;In the snowing Yokosuka, people are walking next to each other. One boy is erring through the town, in search for an answer. What feeling is contained in his clenched fists? What awaits him on the other side of his path?&lt;br/&gt;This is a story of love, of courage and of friendship. It's Ryo's, and your story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Yu Suzuki: Writer, director&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
