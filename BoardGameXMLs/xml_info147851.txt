			<description>[From the back of the box]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two fun games with a colour fact pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beautifully illustrated colour fact pack includes details on 24 dinosaurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 collectable playing pieces from the Original Monsters in my Pocket range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two great games on a double sided board bring the Age of the Dinosaurs back to life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dinosaur Dig - Simple collecting game for younger children who have to collect the pieces to build up a dinosaur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from the Volcano - Exciting dinosaur battle using the colour fact pack - can you beat the other dinosaurs and escape the exploding volcano?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun to play, and full of fascinating facts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Details on each game]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dinosaur Dig - Players roll the die and move around the board attempting to land on the dinosaur dig locations. Landing on a dig location enables the player to draw a &amp;quot;dig&amp;quot; card which contains one of the four dinosaur pieces that they need. Players get to keep any pieces they find that they don't already have but must return duplicates of pieces they already have. The first player to collect all four pieces is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from the Volcano - Players roll a die and move their dinosaur figures around the outer track trying to land on the challenge squares. Landing on a challenge square allows them to challenge all the players to a dino-duel. The type of challenge square determines what ability the challenge is testing. Players then select a dinosaur &amp;quot;fact&amp;quot; card from their hand to enter the challenge contest. The player whose dinosaur card has the highest value in the challenge ability wins and they move their counter one space away from the volcano on the volcano track. The player who is the first to have their counter reach the tenth space on the volcano track has escaped the volcano is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
