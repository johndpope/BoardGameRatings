							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbie Shopping Day</name>
									
			<description>Barbie needs a new outfit for her evening date with her girlfriends, so she wants to shop for a new top; new trousers or a skirt; new shoes; and a new handbag &amp;mdash; and all of this in one afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up Barbie Shopping Day, lay out the sun with its rays, as well as all garment parts. On your turn, use the spinner and take the indicated garment. If the spinner shows the sun, you take away one of the rays and can either take a garment or must give back a garment. If you are the first to completely dress Barbie, you win. When the sun has lost all rays before that, there is no winner and all players put one garment on Barbie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
