							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken Water Main</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The district, home to various small businesses, has always been a quite neighborhood. The narrow streets, one story brick and mortar houses with the large display windows and wide walkways always had a charm of their own. Unbeknownst to the people working or shopping above disaster was brewing below the surface though. Not too long ago a water main, weakened by years of wear and tear finally gave in and burst. The water flooded the streets and to a degree the buildings as well. At least it was a fresh water pipe and not a pipe of the sewer network. The water has been turned off since then, but the broken pipe and the washed out street still need to be fixed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
