			<description>Trantor: The Last Stormtrooper is a video game for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, MSX, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST released by Go! (a label of U.S. Gold) in 1987. It was produced by Probe Software (the team consisted of David Quinn, Nick Bruty and David Perry). It was released in Spain (as &amp;quot;Trantor&amp;quot;) by Erbe Software. The game is a mix between shoot 'em up and a platform game, but it was mostly known for its large and well-animated sprites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls the titular stormtrooper who is the only survivor of the destruction of his spaceship (hence the title). Gameplay revolves around exploring the play-area and collecting code-letters. The play-area consists of several different floors which can be explored freely via connecting lifts. However, Trantor is up against a very strict time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The levels are infested by various aliens and small flying robots which sap Trantor's strength if he touches them. Fortunately, Trantor is armed with a flamethrower with which to destroy these pests. Unfortunately, fuel for this is limited although he can re-fill this at fuel-points located on many of the floors. Whenever Trantor finds a code-letter, his timer countdown is reset and then counts down again until he finds another letter. For this reason, much of the gameplay is a race-against-time. There are also lockers scattered around the floors which contain pick-ups to assist Trantor. These include hamburgers (restore strength) and clocks (reseting the time, as finding a code letter would). The game ends when Trantor's energy runs out or if the timer reaches zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor&lt;/a&gt;:_The_Last_Stormtrooper,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
