			<description>Was kommt dazu (What's added now) is a tile laying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of 72 square cardboard tiles, similar to the tiles of a memory game, and a rulebook. There are 6 tile series with different pictures. 3 series of 16 tiles each (steamboat, wonder machine, sun flower), 2 series of 9 tiles each (flowers of the spring, bird), 1 series of 6 tiles (helicopter). The basic idea is that one tile of each series has the least amount of small details, another one the greatest amount of details (like with or without doorknow depicted, a bee with or without wings etc.). These cards must be sorted according to the amount of details picted from least to most in ascending order. A check is possible by turing the tiles around. On each tile back is one half of an animal or thing - horse, train car etc. If the cards are in correct order those halves match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook suggests 3 games:&lt;br/&gt;1) Solo game: The solo player takes one or more tile series, shuffles them and must lay them in the correct order. &lt;br/&gt;2) Group game: The short helicopter series is done away with. Each player gets one tile series (well shuffled). Players start to put their series in order. The first player to do this wins - if he did correctly. This can be done with one round or in several rounds. If rounds are played the player who finishes first and has his order correct he gets victory points equal to the number of tiles in the series plus 5 extra points. The other players get one victory point for each tile that is in correct order. For the next round the series are shuffled again and each player gets another series than before.&lt;br/&gt;3) What is disappeared: A series is laid on the table in random order. The picture with the most details is laid in the middle. Players look out for the tile where just one little detail disappeared then the next one etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
