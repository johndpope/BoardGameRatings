							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Into the Borderland</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is set in the Borderland sector of the Trojan Reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are contracted to deliver a cargo of technical equipment to a remote settlement on Iilgan, where they discover a team of Border Guard personnel working with the locals to improve conditions. It becomes apparent that there are several such teams on the world. Whether the characters think this is a god idea or not, they are soon drawn into a chaotic local situation, in which the Guard team represents not only the sole force for law and order in the area but ultimately the only hope in the face of a natural and man-made disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The early stages of the adventure see the characters travelling overland to deliver their cargo and interacting with the Border Guard personnel in the town of Onsler Rapids as they carry out the second part of their contract &amp;ndash; teaching the locals and their allies how to operate the equipment. The nature of life in the outback of Iilgan is gradually revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters then become involved in a series of crises that beset Onsler Rapids, beginning with a search for missing personnel and rapidly expanding as severe weather strikes the town. There are opportunities for action and gunplay, but for the most part this is an adventure about tough decisions and decisive action in other areas of human activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the adventure is self-contained and has all the information a referee needs to run it, Borderland and Alien Module 1: Aslan may both be useful in expanding a campaign beyond these pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
