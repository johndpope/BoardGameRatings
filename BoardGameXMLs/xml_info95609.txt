							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nu Monte Carlo Blocks</name>
									
			<description>Is is a set of 58 colored tiles, small discs and cardboard cards (like bingo)that enable players to play a number of different games: Nu Monte Carlo Blocks, Poker, Rhumy (sic) Dominoe (sic), Cassino (sic), checkers, Color Lotto, Hoo Doo and Color Blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for Nu Monte Carlo Blocks: &amp;quot;To start the game a dealer is chosen. The blocks are placed on the table same as dominoes, face down and are shuffled. Each player draws one block starting from the right of the dealer. When a Red block is drawn, the drawer neither puts or takes from the kitty. When Green block is drawn the player places one chip in the kitty. When a Yellow block is drawn the player places two chips in the kitty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;TO WIN, the player getting the first three in a row of same color receives three chips from the kitty. The player getting first four in a row of the same color receives four from the kitty. The player getting first five in a row of same color receives all the chips in the kitty. At no time is a winner to pay any chips to the kitty.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If that makes sense to you please explain it to me. Rules for other games are included in the images section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
