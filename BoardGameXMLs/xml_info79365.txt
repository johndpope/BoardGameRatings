			<description>Dragonseeds is a video game where the player must clone a dragon and train it to fight. The gameplay is similar to that of a tactical RPG. The player gets to choose from five basic dragon types and two secret dragons. The game also allows the player to receive extra dragons through the saves files of certain games, if the memory card is placed at the second slot. The game also allows a two player mode, where each player can battle each other with their own dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Dragonseeds , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
