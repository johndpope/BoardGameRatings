			<description>&amp;quot;Major League Baseball 2K7 (or MLB 2K7) is a Major League Baseball licensed baseball simulation video game developed by Kush Games and published by 2K Sports. Released on February 27, 2007, it is the only 2007 MLB licensed game available for the Xbox 360 and Xbox. It is also available for the PlayStation Portable, the PlayStation 2 and, for the first time, the PlayStation 3, though its competition came in the form of MLB 07: The Show from 989 Sports. Portable versions for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, and Game Boy Advance were released. It is the first baseball game to be released for the Nintendo DS and the last major release for the Xbox game console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the third year in a row, Derek Jeter is the cover athlete, and ESPN baseball broadcasters Jon Miller and Joe Morgan serve as announcers, despite the loss of the ESPN license to Electronic Arts. Steve Physioc and Jeanne Zelasko cover the pre-game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Major_League_Baseball_2K7,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
