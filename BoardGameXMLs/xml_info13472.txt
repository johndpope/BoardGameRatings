			<description>The Siege can be played in two different ways: either as a wargame or as a boardgame.  As a Wargame, The Siege can be played with two or more players.  It is turned based, with a few options for how the turns progress.  Paper miniatures are included in the game package.  A grid, consisting of squares, is used as a board.  Some scenery may be included, such as buildings and castles.  All creatures are fantasy/mythology/medieval based.  The players will assimilate military battles using the miniatures.  Success is determined by rolling dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a boardgame, 1-4 players can play.  There is an option, similar to Choose Your Own Adventure, in which a single player can enjoy a variety of adventures.  With more than one player there are progressive levels to play through.  A game master will increase the enjoyment for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both portions of the game are works in progress.  If you are interested in playing, contact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;thesiege@hotmail.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
