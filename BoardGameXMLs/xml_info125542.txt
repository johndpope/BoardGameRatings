							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Simulator</name>
									
			<description>Artemis is a multiplayer, multi-computer networked game for Windows computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artemis simulates a spaceship bridge by networking several computers together. One computer runs the simulation and the &amp;quot;main screen&amp;quot;, while the others serve as workstations for the normal jobs a bridge officer might do, like Helm, Communication, Engineering, and Weapon Control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artemis is a social game where several players are together in one room (&amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot;) , and while they all work together, one player plays the Captain, a person who sits in the middle, doesn't have a workstation, and tells everyone what to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artemis was created by Thom Robertson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Single player can take on all roles and switch between them via tabs.  Supports play-by-internet, although it is recommended that players communicate via VOIP or telephone.  Supports multiple independently staffed ships so maximum players per scenario may approach 18, possibly more.  No official PvP support yet as of version 1.65.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
