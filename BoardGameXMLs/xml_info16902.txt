			<description>In a manner slightly reminiscent of Milton Bradley's game of &amp;quot;Life&amp;quot;, two to six players choose whether to follow a path of self-employment and eventual sellout to Megacorp, or a university program that leads them to employment with Megacorp. However, both paths eventually converge and lead the players onto the path of a corporate takeover. When all players have reached either the &amp;quot;Pyramid&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;Over Budget&amp;quot; squares, the player with the greatest total of Common Stock Shares becomes the Chief Executive Officer of Megacorp and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
