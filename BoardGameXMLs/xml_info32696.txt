			<description>From the rules:  G.H.Q. is a Strategic war game for two players, one player representing the Allied Armies and the other the German Army.  The theater of War is the Western Front and the territories of countries adjacent to that front.  The Object is to occupy ONE of two capital cities of the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the map the principal towns are shown as red circles and connected together by thick red lines which represent the road and railway systems.  Towns with black centers are Corps garrison towns and the associated units are marked on the map.  The units (armoured, motorized and infantry corp) are represented by different shaped wooden pieces with Flags attached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Germans always go first and movement is governed by a roll of the dice.  The roll will be between 1 and 3 and the number thrown indicates the number of units which may be moved.  Armoured corps can move 3 spaces, Motorized 2 and Infantry 1 space.  Destruction of units is based on having units adjacent to the target enemy, 3 friendly units are required to kill an armoured unit, infantry and motorized are destroyed by two friendly units in adjacent towns.  For every enemy unit destroyed the player gets another roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
