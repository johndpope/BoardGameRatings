			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city has been quiet for the last few weeks, apparently a record for Ravens Bluff. The numerous adventurers in town have been glad of the respite. It is the middle of the afternoon as you make your way through the market. Perhaps nowhere are the effects of the war more pronounced than here at the market. The stalls display a meager selection of goods at inflated prices. All of the merchants seem nervous and uncertain of what the future will bring. Amidst all of this, Giles Morgan, captain of the City Watch, comes striding into the market, the sunlight gleaming off his plate mail. A large man, Captain Morgan towers above the heads of most. He glances around for a moment and then heads your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
