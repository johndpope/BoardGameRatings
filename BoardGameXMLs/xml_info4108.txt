							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Bucks Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Not a stats based game and not a &amp;quot;replay&amp;quot; game. Teams are fictional and can be built based on fixed points or amount of money the team has. Players are of three average, good, exceptional and cost different amounts of money to &amp;quot;hire&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;Money can either be a fixed amount in pick up games, or using the advanced economy rules, can be obtained from running concessions and selling broadcasting rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dual-fold, multi-color game board folds for easy storage. Each comes with three teams of ten sculptured ABS figurines, each with individually stenciled numbers. A designated hitter is included on each team. Since the whole family can play BIG BUCKS BASEBALL, one set of figurines is female.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes 3 special challenging dice, 32 player upgrade snap rings, 12 ball/strike markers, 10 concession/broadcast replicas, 2 miniature game baseballs, 90 pieces of currency, 32 special event cards, 2 reproducible score sheets, and a complete instruction booklet and quick start guide. All of this is packaged in a compact 10-inch by 10-inch durable game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a unique system of roulette type spinner based on batter and pitcher's experience (3 levels) to determine the outcome of each pitch. Once a pitch is hit the defensive team can still field the ball using a system of color coded dice. Careful through, failing the fielding roll will increase the effectiveness of the hit (error). Also there are event cards such as injuries and automatic player upgrades (having a good night) which influence the game randomly.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
