			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1536; Stage One: Ella McConnell; Stage Two: Jaye Foster; Stage Three: Meera Barry&lt;br/&gt;Stage One and Two Title: WWB: World Wrestling Bakeoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules text:&lt;br/&gt;Professional wrestling wasn&amp;rsquo;t pulling in the crowds; the grandmas who used to shout out anatomically unlikely encouragement had found a new passion:  &amp;ldquo;Pie High&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Fondue of You,&amp;rdquo; the two highest rated food channel shows. Intense sessions behind RecipeNet and Mr. McMacaroonof the World Wrestling Wranglers came up with a solution: The Bakehouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bakehouse wrestlers are the best in the business snack-stand hot dogs now only come in spelt sourdough buns, and the mention of a &amp;ldquo;heel&amp;rdquo; is just as likely to be referring to the end of a loaf of bread as it is an antagonist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
