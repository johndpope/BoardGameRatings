							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Explore the 50 States</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the 50 States from Maine to Hawaii - and all points in between. Explore the people and places that make the United States such a unique country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question cards teach kids interesting facts about the geography and history of the fifty states, while Travel cards add a fun twist - moving players forward or backward on their adventure.  Additional facts are included on the cards to make the topics more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addition information:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin to determine which type of card to draw. Three of the four decks include questions about history, geography, or state flags. Answering correctly means the player can move forward. Drawing a travel card simply moves a player forward or backward. The player who circles the board first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
