							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game Boy Advance SP</name>
									
			<description>This entry refers to the Game Boy Advance SP portable console.  Since this system was not region locked, it encompasses all regions in which it was sold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First released in Japan February 14, 2003, the Game Boy Advance SP &amp;mdash; Nintendo model AGS-001 &amp;mdash; resolved several problems with the original Game Boy Advance model. It featured a new smaller clamshell  design with a flip-up screen, a switchable internal frontlight, a rechargeable battery, and the omission of the headphone jack, which requires a special adapter to be purchased separately. In some regions owners of the original Game Boy Advance received a special limited offer to trade their old models into Nintendo and merely pay the difference on the Advance SP.[citation needed] In mid September 2005, Nintendo released a significantly improved SP model, unofficially dubbed the &amp;quot;Mark II&amp;quot; or GBA SP +, in North America, and officially Nintendo model number AGS-101, that featured a high quality backlit  screen instead of a frontlit, similar to the Game Boy Micro screen but larger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
