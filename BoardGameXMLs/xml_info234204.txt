							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic Triland</name>
									
			<description>Description from the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;Magic Triland is a small, forgotten island in the ocean. The island emerged when a volcano erupted a long time ago. The lava cooled to form a terraced landscape and with time the island became inhabited by people. Kingdoms emerged in the three corners of the island, all there to extract noble metals from the lava.&lt;br/&gt;Today, the kingdoms are ruled by the Queens of Copper and Gold and the King of Silver. Alchemists have settled on the misty shores. Alchemists have the ability to transmute the gold, silver and copper into magic pearls. The kingdoms send out messengers to get magic pearls made by the alchemists and to bring them back to the kingdom. All the messengers wear rings made from the noble metals. They&amp;rsquo;re on the move day and night, exchanging the rings among themselves as alchemists require two different metals in order to make a magic pearl. It is therefore customary on Magic Triland to carry out trades by bartering at every encounter. A kingdom possessing magic pearls, possesses the highest wisdom and magical power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board with hexagonal blocks of different heights, that form a different board every time. Each player has to pawns with rings (metals), that come in each players color. He moves his pieces using cards covering the height difference between the blocks. Exchanging rings between players when playing pieces meet, enable a player to collect pearls along the side of the board. First player to bring home a pearl of the color opposite to his starting hexagon wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
