			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, characters play giant fighting robot characters.  Robots are identified with a specific chess piece during combat.  Players spend Body Points to build their robots, distributing the points into Armor Level and Structure Level statistics for several body parts.  Characters then spend Weapon Points to weaponize their robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a campaign that links together individual robot combats.  Combat is structured and played with pieces on a chess board (chess rules are not used) in rounds where all actors take a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
