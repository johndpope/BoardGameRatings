							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jewel Duel</name>
									
			<description>There can be only one. One court jeweler, that is. And of course this can only be you, if nothing fishy's going on. &lt;br/&gt;But isn't it always?  It is right here and right now in the kingdom of Gemonaria. Here the best jeweler has to prove herself / himself by cleverly obtaining gold and jewels from the gemstone market and creating more beautiful jewelry than her / his opponents in a contest.&lt;br/&gt;Only this way can she / he impress her / his king / queen (delete as applicable) and become court jeweler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jewel Duel is a largely abstract family level strategy game by Thomas Staudt  for 1 - 4 players that compete for resources (wooden cubes) using a novel chip mechanic in order to create jewelry (buy cards) and accumulate the most victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is available as a free print &amp;amp; play download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
