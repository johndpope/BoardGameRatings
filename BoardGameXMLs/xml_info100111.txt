			<description>Paper-and-pencil game where from 2 to 4 players aim to score as many points as possible by crossing whole rows or columns of an 8x8 board single lines of their own colour or by crossing existing lines of the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player throws a die and draws in his colour a single straight line crossing orthogonally as many squares as points on the die. Spaces crossed both vertically and horizontally can't be crossed anymore. For each enemy line crossed a player scores one point, for each whole row or column all in a player's colour the player scores another point. Play goes on until only single spaces can be crossed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
