			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erinia was the first brazilian MMO. It combines elements of RPG, medieval fantasy and monsters from the brazilian Folklore like Saci, Mapinguari (Yeti), Homem do saco (man of the bag) and many others. It remained officially open for about a year and after that some fans and ex-GMs took over and now you can play it from time to time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was developped by a team of fourteen people during a period of less than a year. The server was programmed in Java and the client in C++. It had two releases: one in Brazil and another in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
