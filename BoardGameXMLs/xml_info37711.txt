			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Year: 2357 AD&lt;br/&gt;Human beings from the planet Earth have expanded into the far reaches of space. For over 100 years, humanity has explored, colonized and expanded civilization on new, unpopulated planets and has made no contact with any sentient forms of life... Until now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, an outpost on Copernica Prime has ceased to transmit regular communications with Earth. Probes show no sign of survivors but return signals of some form of advanced Cybernetic beings. Damage to the colony leaves no doubt a violent struggle occurred and the colonies put up a fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your orders: Deploy a small force, gather intelligence, search and destroy. The force deployed ... Jump Force Alpha!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire action where by the Human Forces player plans his assault on the captured colony and executes his move. The play of the Robotics player is generated by programmed moves. Robotics automatically respond to the Human players moves and Robots move towards the closest human and attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is determined by the type of mission mounted. Before the Human player may enter the colony settlement, the perimeter fence must be breached. Once breached, the alarm is sounded and the Robots begin to deploy and move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human player must execute the mission, leave no marine behind and return to the carrier transport to get off world and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
