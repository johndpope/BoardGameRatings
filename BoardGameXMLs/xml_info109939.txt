			<description>Game No 4375. For two or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions for Playing : Place a ball upon each of the pedestals in the bottom of the box, placing them on the pedestal or corresponding color. To Wind the top: Place the wooden disk over the center pin with the small metal pin and end of wire spring against the top of the top. Hold the bottom part of the top firmly in the left hand and give the wooden disk a few turns to the right. To release the spinning part of the top, hold the wooden disk firmly in the hand and press one finger on the center of the metal pin. The spinning top must be dropped into the center small circle of the playing board. Each player has one spin at a turn and at the end of his turn the score is taken, counting the numbers in front of the pedestals from which a ball has been thrown. If two balls of one color are thrown, it doubles the score of those two balls. A game may consist of 300 points; or it may be played by rounds, the player having the greatest score at the end of an agreed upon number of rounds, being the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pedestals are numbered as follows in clockwise direction :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red: 20 points&lt;br/&gt;Blue: 15 points&lt;br/&gt;Green: 10 points&lt;br/&gt;Yellow: 5 points&lt;br/&gt;Orange: 10 points&lt;br/&gt;Red: 5 points&lt;br/&gt;Blue: 20 points&lt;br/&gt;Green: 15 points&lt;br/&gt;Yellow: 10 points&lt;br/&gt;Orange: 5 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a wooden coloured ball, corresponding in number and colour to each pedestal. The game is played inside a square wooden box with a height of about 5cm (2&amp;quot;). The box is 34cm square (13.5&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for this game come from --- Famous Belgian (famousbelgian).
