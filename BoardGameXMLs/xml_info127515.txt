			<description>Mix Fix is a reaction game where you are trying to get rid of all your cards first.&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning every player get six cards showing six symbols. There are 4 different symbols in this game (fish, ship, sheep, frog). In each round 4 dice are rolled. Each dice has one symbol on four sides plus two blank sides. The players must then quickly find a card which shows all rolled symbols. If a matching card is found the player has to put it quickly in the middle of the table and has to name all symbols. If all was correct the player gets rid of this card. If he has made a mistake (wrong card or misspelling) he has to take it back and gets a new card as penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
