			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have to collect 5 different colored discs with their animal as quickly as possible. But the animals differ from each other in their ways of walking and their special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their journey through the woods, the animals leave tracks that are marked on the board with the special pen. If a space has been entered twice, it acts as a barrier for the next animals, because the frequency of the animals has attracted the attention of the poacher. Consequently, the field of play constantly becomes more restricted and the way more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the game pieces, you can cause further difficulties for the other animals or clear away obstacles from your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 board&lt;br/&gt;4 animals&lt;br/&gt;24 game pieces: 3 double moves, 6 wolves, 7 worms, 8 gamekeeper's hats &lt;br/&gt;20 colored discs in 5 colors&lt;br/&gt;1 colored pen&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
