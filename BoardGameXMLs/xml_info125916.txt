			<description>Job Creator(?) is an economic strategy game.  Players are members of the &amp;quot;1%&amp;quot; in a small town.  They own means of production and shops in the town, employ the citizens and produce and sell goods back to the population.  In the beginning of the game, a small percentage of the town is employed, however the population has all of the money they need to buy goods and keep the economy moving. As play progresses, franchises (and later Big Boxes) move into the town, both of these change the purchasing dynamic of the town and makes doing business much harder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines &amp;quot;rondel&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;worker placement&amp;quot; gaming, along with economic strategy.  Victory is determined by Victory Points, which are primarily earned by paying workers (although there are other ways to gain and lose points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
