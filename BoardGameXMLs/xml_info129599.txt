			<description>Translated box black blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;School Order Rep has come to investigate any personal items student have brought to school. As a student, you must treat the Order rep correctly so as to avoid punishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, by seeing to that your BL fanzines aren't &amp;quot;unnecessary&amp;quot; items, of course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;A simple card game consisting of different types of attractive boys, guys and men (anime style). Players take turns being the Order rep, who decides what preferences are OK, and the remaining players (students) try to play their cards so that they match them as much as possible. A game of deduction and creative guessing. And laughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with identical rules called &amp;quot;Model Men&amp;quot;, where the players try to guess what combination of model will sell the next fashion mag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
