			<description>To be the player with the smallest score, trying not to take pawns and crowns. Play a card from your hand on one of the branches of the Tree of Life, following the Decktet suits. If once placed, all the cards from that branch add up to more than 12 points, then you'll have to take a number of those cards, from end towards the beginning, until they add up to at least 12 points. You've got to try to take the least number of cards, but if you've got to take many, at least try to have the most cards possible from that suit, that way you can be immune to its power. There are 8 poisoned cards (4 pawns and 4 crowns) that spoil the branches and lower your score. Try not to take them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a resource management game for the Decktet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Revelation at the Decktet wiki&lt;br/&gt;    * Revelation blog post from the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
