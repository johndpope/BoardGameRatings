			<description>A board game for 2-4+ players. Theme: The social and political revolutions in the Middle East and North African countries circa 2010+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a circular track of 50 spaces.  Each space is large enough to hold 1 card.  There are 2 types of Spaces: Revolution and Country. Eleven countries are represented: Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Oman, Yemen, Syria, Jordan, Bahrain, Iran and Iraq.  Each country will comprise either three or four spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a Common Deck. There are three main types of cards: Revolution Cards, Resistance Cards, Motivation Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common set of Victory Tokens. &lt;br/&gt;Each player has a pawn and a set of counters of a unique colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players draw 2 cards from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising five Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 1 card and place it in your hand. &lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard a motivation card to draw 2 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Roll 1 die and move forward that many spaces OR discard a card from your hand and move forward a number of spaces equal to its force value. &lt;br/&gt;-   If you land on a Revolution Space you may do one of four actions: &lt;br/&gt;    -   Roll the die and move again&lt;br/&gt;    -   Move to any other revolution space on the Board&lt;br/&gt;    -   Draw 1 Card and place it in your hand&lt;br/&gt;    -   Play a Counter onto any Country Space you have radicalised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If you land on a Country Space that has no card on it, you may play a Revolution card to that space. Tuck it partially under the Board directly next to the space. Place 1 of your counters on the space if you placed a card there. If you have a card under a space you are said to have radicalised it. If a country already has 1 card of the same type, you cannot play a second. For example Tunisia can only have 1 Intervention card tucked under its spaces.   &lt;br/&gt;-   If you land on a Country Space that you have already radicalised (You have a card and one or more counters there already) you may do one of the following: &lt;br/&gt;    -  Place an additional counter on the Space.&lt;br/&gt;    -  Exchange the tucked card with one from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;    -  Draw 1 card and discard 1 card (it may be the same card). &lt;br/&gt;-   If you land on a country space radicalised by another player, you can either do nothing or play one or more resistance cards with a combined force value equal to or greater than the number of counters your opponent has on the space. If you do so, discard all the counters on the space and the card tucked under it. Remove the resistance cards from the game. &lt;br/&gt;-   If you land on a country space that is overthrown skip over it and go to the next space and resume your move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Overthrow Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If you played a revolution card under a country space this turn and all the other spaces for that country have already been radicalised (by you or others) the country is now said to have been overthrown. Immediately score Victory Tokens (VT) for the country. &lt;br/&gt;-   You gain 2 Victory Tokens for playing the final card to overthrow the country. &lt;br/&gt;-   The player with the highest combined total of counters and card force values gets 5 VT. &lt;br/&gt;-   The player with the second highest total of counters and card force values gets 3 VT. &lt;br/&gt;-   All other players with at least 1 card and counter in the country get 1 VT each. &lt;br/&gt;Overthrown Countries are out of play.  Pawns cannot land on them, they simply move past them without counting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.  End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when 4 countries have been overthrown. &lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 1 extra VT for each Space they have a counter in. &lt;br/&gt;The player with the most VT at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
