			<description>Arvoch Alliance is the definitive first person 3D space combat simulation from StarWraith 3D Games. As a flight commander in the Alliance Navy, you will take on the challenge of leading a team of pilots through a series of missions spanning the vast region of space known as the Evochron quadrant. As the story unfolds, you will take part in the events that eventually lead to the end of the Federation/Alliance war and the liberation of Evochron. In the midst of an ongoing war, the sudden return of the Vonari signals a dramatic change in the course of human history as forces unite in an epic battle for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With single player and multiplayer gameplay modes, varied objectives, diverse control options, Newtonian style physics, realistic avionics, versatile combat systems, and tactical focused gameplay, Arvoch Alliance provides a feature-packed and immersive space combat experience. And with its design and story elements, it presents a unique vision of the future where mankind has colonized space and encountered both awe-inspiring wonders and immense dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
