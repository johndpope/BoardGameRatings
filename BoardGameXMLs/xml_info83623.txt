							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Go Fart</name>
									
			<description>This game consists of a whoopie cushion and a poker card deck with various names of farts on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The farts are graded by the Fart Meter as follows:&lt;br/&gt;2 - Whoopie Cushion&lt;br/&gt;3 - Hand over Mouth&lt;br/&gt;4 - Hand Under Armpit&lt;br/&gt;5 - Hand Under Knee&lt;br/&gt;6 - Loud But Harmless&lt;br/&gt;7 - Foghorn&lt;br/&gt;8 - Tea Kettle&lt;br/&gt;9 - Loud and Odorous&lt;br/&gt;10 - Spotters&lt;br/&gt;J - Forever Fart&lt;br/&gt;Q - S.B.D.&lt;br/&gt;K - The Flamer&lt;br/&gt;A - Atomic Bomb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a Go Fish variant where the person who makes an unsuccessful request for a card, can either draw for the card they need, or they can attempt a fart that matches the card they desire.  So if the player asks for a 4 and they are told to &amp;quot;Go Fart&amp;quot;, they can draw from the deck or they can do a &amp;quot;Hand Under Armpit&amp;quot; fart, which is what the Fart Meter shows for a 4.  Other players judge the fart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box....&lt;br/&gt;If you plan ahead you can really have &amp;quot;a gas&amp;quot; with this game.  The have a &amp;quot;leg up&amp;quot; on your opponents be sure to consume large quantities of beans or chili with carbonated beverages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: The object of the game is to be the first person to get rid of all your cards by creating three of a kind or a run of three consecutive numbers i.e. three Spotters (three 10's) or a run of J,Q,K (Forever Fart, S.B.D., The Flamer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
