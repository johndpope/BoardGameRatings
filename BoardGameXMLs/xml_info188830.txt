			<description>The players start at the ship, then dive to the wreck on the ocean floor and come up again to the ship. The first player to achieve this, wins the game. Movement is determined by two dice. If one of the diece Shows a 6, the shark (black meeple) is placed on the black space on the diving track and blocks any movement of the diver. It stays there untill another player rolls a 6 on one die. When a diver on his way down is past the black space, a 6 has no special meaning until he starts to go up again. If a diver gets on a black space, he gets eaten by a shark and is eliminated from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published between 1939 and 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
