			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Trouble in Pembrook&amp;rdquo; is an introductory adventure for A Game of Thrones RPG, designed for 4-8 player characters of 1st to 3rd Level [25-50 Character Points]. The intent of this scenario is to introduce the players to both the game system and the flavour of the George R.R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s world setting of Westeros. To that end a wide variety of characters should be used for this adventure with at least one noble, one hunter, and one maester in the group to resolve this scenario.Note that the adventure is written for the d20-based Open Gaming rules, but includes the corresponding Tri-Stat System rules [italicised, in brackets], when appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is structured around the &amp;ldquo;Noble House&amp;rdquo; campaign style. It is not completely scripted, and requires the GM to flesh out certain details and make important decisions about some aspects of the plot. Additionally, it does not provide stat write-ups for the major NPCs, instead referring to the sample NPCs from the core rulebook. The player characters are assumed to all be nobles of, or loyal retainers to, House Flint &amp;mdash; a&lt;br/&gt;minor bannerhouse to the Stark family. The head of the family is Lady Lyessa Flint, and Widow&amp;rsquo;s Watch is their seat. The original branch of the Flints, however, live in the mountains north of Winterfell and south of the Wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters all live in the fastness of the &amp;ldquo;mountain Flints,&amp;rdquo; a small walled keep called Flint&amp;rsquo;s Rock. The head of the household, Uther, known to his people as &amp;ldquo;the Flint,&amp;rdquo; heads up the Northern Clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
