			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HackMaster Basic was released with the presumption that players wanted to learn the game &amp;ndash; not the character generation system. As such, this version includes a selection of ready-to-play characters to facilitate rapid play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it. Learning how to build a character in any system takes some trial and error. You really have to play the game to know how to build a Player Character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve played HackMaster and enjoy the game, HackMaster Basic Plus is the perfect step up. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the added features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Character Generation&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Full details for advancing up to 10th level&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Extra Equipment choices&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; More Spells&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; More Skills&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Expanded Combat Options&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 12 Special Combat Moves&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Crunchier Initiative System&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; PCs can survive past zero hit points&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Rules for Shooting into Melee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the GameMaster&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Expanded Treasure Tables&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Disease Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;227 page PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in HackMaster Basic and HackMaster Basic Plus are fully interchageable and can be readily integrated into the grestly expanded rules system featured in the HackMaster Players Handbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
