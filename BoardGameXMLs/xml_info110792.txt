			<description>Kirby's Return to Dream Land, known in Japan as Kirby of the Stars Wii (星のカービーWii, Hoshi no Kābī Wii?) and in Europe as Kirby's Adventure Wii, is a Kirby video game and the twelveth platform installment of the series, in development by HAL Laboratory, and will be published by Nintendo. While Kirby's Epic Yarn was released in 2010, Kirby's Return to Dream Land is the first traditional Kirby platforming home console game since Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, which was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. The title is currently scheduled for release in North America on October 24, 2011, and in Europe on November 25, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kirby's Return to Dream Land features the staple gameplay of traditional Kirby platform games, in which the titular character Kirby possesses the ability to inhale and copy enemies in order to attain forms which give him a variety of attacks such as breathing fire or swinging a sword. The game supports cooperative multiplayer gameplay, allowing up to four players to control various Kirby characters, including Waddle Dee, King Dedede, and Meta Knight. Kirby's plot focuses on the characters retrieving the scattered pieces of a crashed alien spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first announced as a Nintendo GameCube title with a projected release date of late 2005, but development was later shifted to its successor console, the Wii. While it was later denied that the game was still in development, the game resurfaced in 2009 with an updated release date for that year. The game was then presumed to be cancelled following the announcement of Good-Feel's Kirby's Epic Yarn in 2010, but was then officially re-announced at a financial results briefing on January 28, 2011. The game was then playable at E3 2011 under the tentative title Kirby Wii, with a projected release date of fall 2011 in North America. Its final titles were announced in the following months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kirby's Return to Dream Land&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
