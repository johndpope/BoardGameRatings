							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CORPS: Diceless Conspiracy Roleplaying</name>
									
			<description>What if all the strange tales you hear are true? What if there really are UFOs, vampires, mind-reading mutants, secret societies, and government conspiracies? What if the world is not as it seems, but as those who really run things just want it to look like? And what would they do to you if you found out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CORPS is a game setting for Active Exploits Diceless Roleplaying and can also be used as a sourcebook for other game systems. Although, it does not require the Active Exploits core rules for enjoyment, the book does make use of Active Exploits for specific abilities and powers (most, if not all of these can be ported over to Impresa with ease). This book was designed for the first edition rules, but is compatible with Take2 (second edition) -- see CORPS Take2 for an updated print version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
