							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">This Sceptered Isle</name>
									
			<description>This Sceptered Isle consists of 4 battles of the Wars of the Roses. Towton, Mortimer's Cross, Barnet and Tewkesbury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It uses an evolution of the system from his pre-gunpowder quads published through 3W (Age of Chivalry, Crusades, Sword &amp; Shield, Henry V, Crusades II). The command system has been changed to accommodate leader character - leaders are rated as aggressive, controlled, or timid, and are likely to gravitate to an order stance that is in keeping with their character as the battle unfolds. Correct exploitation of their capability in the battle plan is important for victory.  The melee and fire combat mechanics are also quite different from the other games in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The counters are nicely done, icons. The maps are DTP standard. Best of all, the rules are short, counters few, and you can set up and play and finish in an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
