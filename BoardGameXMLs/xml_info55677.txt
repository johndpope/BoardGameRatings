			<description>Using &amp;ldquo;Nano-Bots&amp;rdquo; as computer programming aids, you are trying to create circuit pathways to allow your nano-bots to complete their assigned programs before your opponents do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you&amp;rsquo;ll have to watch out for other players nano-bots that are trying to throw you off the board into a heat sink, or giving you advanced programing codes you don&amp;rsquo;t need.  The board has a unique relay system that flips over every time a nano-bot crosses over one, possibly changing your path to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
