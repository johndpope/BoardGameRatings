			<description>60 MINUTES TO SAVE THE EARTH is a boardgame that pits industry against the environment against the clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board comprises a stylized world with 25 double-sided environmental jigsaw pieces which allow you to change the earth for good or bad as you travel across the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires players to make money by successfully running major industries (nuclear, oil, timber etc.) whilst also being environmentally aware. The winner is the player who can strike a balance between greed and conscience during the 100 years (60 minute) duration of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commodity cards are distributed evenly between the players - these indicate the jigsaw pieces on which this particular activity can take place and environmental (green) or industrial (gray) means by which the commodity can be exploited. Environmentally sound exploitation allows the jigsaw pieces to be placed green side up, and green tokens to be earned. Industrial exploitation requires the jigsaw piece to be gray side up, but generates income. Pieces can change from green to gray and vice versa dependent on how they are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play involves taking a Fate Card, and following the instructions on it, rolling the die and moving. If the place moved to is on one of their commodity cards then it is ticked off - if not a question must be answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When 60 minutes (100 years) have passed, play ceases and the green jigsaw pieces are counted. If the required number of pieces (this is a group task and depends on the number of players) have not been turned to green, the Earth is lost and there is no winner ... If the required number have been achieved, the player that has accumulated 10 green tokens, 300 million and visited all the destinations listed on their commodity cards wins. In the event that this is not achieved, the winner is the player with the most Green Tokens, money and destinations visited, in that order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
