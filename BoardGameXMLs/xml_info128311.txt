							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frog Skins</name>
									
			<description>Frog Skins was created for a Game Design Challenge, which charged its competitors to create a game that improved humanity in 60 seconds or less.  Its target: inflation.  The game gives new meaning to a CCG being a license to print money, because in this CCG, the &amp;quot;cards&amp;quot; are money &amp;mdash; various denominations of bills from $1 to $100, to be more precise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player creates a deck of five bills.  As in War, each player presents a bill, and the higher bill wins the round.  Ties go into a tie pool.  Whoever wins the most rounds wins the game and the money.  The hook, and the mechanism that combats inflation is that you may choose to rip a full bill into halves, which in the game, counts as two copies of that &amp;quot;card&amp;quot;, but in the real world, causes a smidgen of deflation (the rules state that you must throw away torn bills after the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
