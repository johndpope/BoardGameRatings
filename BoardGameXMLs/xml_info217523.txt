			<description>From manual&lt;br/&gt;You play the part of Fred MacMuscle, the world's greatest stuntman. At least that is what it says on your publicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth is just a little bit less romantic and exciting - you have not worked in a milm for over 2 years and are beginning to get a little rusty. It also doesn't help that you are down on your last few thousand in the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily for you, the new series of RICKY STEEL - SECRET AGENT has just started filming in your area and you are asked if you will handle some of the stunts needed for the film. This is you big chance to become famous again. The only problem is that the film company expects you to have your own insurance. Luckily they afree to pay you for each stunt that you succesfully complete so the more stunts you try the more films you are able to take part in&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note the C16 version of The Real Stunt Experts contains only one enhanced event&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
