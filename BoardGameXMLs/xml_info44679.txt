			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blossoms Are Falling&lt;br/&gt;It was an age of peace and tranquility that crashed to a close with a war so violent it shattered the foundations of Japan. It toppled the old imperial order and gave rise to the Shogun. An era containing the zenith of art and culture, but the nadir of strife and suffering. It was the twilight of one epoch and the dawn of another. It was the Heian era, and Japan would never be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this new supplement from Burning Wheel Headquarters, you play fearsome bushi trapped between honor and shame, wise Shinto priests who seek to placate the spirits who protect Nihon, powerful Buddhist monks who pray for the souls of the dead while plying strong influence at court, and powerful courtiers battling for control of the failing state. Whichever role you choose to undertake, you will determine the fate of the era: Will Nihon walk her doomed path or will history be changed? Will the state survive or will it descend into anarchy? Will the emperor retain his rule or will the samurai rise and claim his power? You are at the center of this maelstrom and you will decide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 212-page book contains a Clan Burner to help your group design a campaign for this setting, five new lifepath settings, four new emotional attributes, 100 new traits, more than 30 new skills, ten new Japanese monsters, six new forms of natural magic, Feats of Valor, challenges of honor, rules of etiquette and the poetic Duel of Verse. Plus dozens of new illustrations, and fiction by Robin D. Laws!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blossoms Are Falling is a setting supplement for The Burning Wheel (Revised Edition) that covers Heian era Japan (794-1189).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this book, you will need the Burning Wheel core books as well as the Monster Burner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book's full title, as given on the title page, is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this shimmering spring,&lt;br/&gt;Ah, with ever anxious heart&lt;br/&gt;The blossoms are falling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
