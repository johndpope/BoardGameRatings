			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the world's only American Civil War espionage game. It allows the players to spy for the south and see if they can influence the war. In the first scenario they try to steal the plans of the Monitor. In the next scenario it is 1863 and they get to try and influence the outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg. The last scenario is in 1865 and involves a fellow named John Wilkes Booth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is and Engle Matrix game of moderate complexity. Players take turns moving character tokens on a map to set up scenes and create sections of the narrative. Each addition to the story is evaluated in terms of how likely it is to happen and how well it fits with the overall story. This evaluation determines the number that needs to be rolled for the new segment of the story &amp;quot;to happen&amp;quot; and to be added to the main narrative.&lt;br/&gt;The player who contributed the most significant elements of the story is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
