			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;High!High?High!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game of High!High?High!!, players try to collect cards so that card values are arranged in ascending order, while avoiding collecting the same value as an opponent's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you draw a card. You may place that card face-down in front of you if the card's value is higher than the highest card you have in front of you, or lower than the lowest. You may collect up to five cards in this way, but players may end collecting earlier because bonus points are added according to the order they finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of game, reveal all cards players have collected. You add up total value of your cards from the lowest, but if one of your cards has the same value as one of an opponent's card, you must stop counting immediately. Add the bonus points previously mentioned, and that's your score. The highest scorer wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backs of cards are color-coded according to their values. Cards with values 1-4 are blue, 5-8 are yellow, 9-12 are red. You should consider the color of the opponents' cards and decide if you take the drawn card or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;数字が被らないように推理してカードを獲得していくバッティングゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;裏向きに置かれたカードはターンが進むにつれ明らかになっていきます。&lt;br/&gt;カードのデザインにもヒントが。&lt;br/&gt;他のプレイヤーが置いたカードを推理しつつ、いち早く自分の場を完成させましょう。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
