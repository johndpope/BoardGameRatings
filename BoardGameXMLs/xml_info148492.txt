			<description>In Dystopian: the manhunt, one to four players assume the role of special agents of the Dystopia Police Department (called Sector 9), with the goal of investigating a murder case, finding the criminal, among four suspects and, eventually, catching him, it or her, before he gets away.&lt;br/&gt;The agents will move around the megalopolis of Dystopia, investigating the numerous locations (distributed among districts and suburbs) meeting people, talking to them, gaining and finding hints and leads that make the investigation progress, bringing them closer and closer to the murderer.&lt;br/&gt;Dystopia is a City controlled by two rival Corporations (Varcom and Infracorp), that are in the business of AI-Roids: artificially intelligent robots that live with the humans.&lt;br/&gt;Dystopia features a plethora of many different locations, where the players will have to conduct their investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dystopian: the manhunt features the following mechanics: worker placement, variable player powers, action selection, network building, cooperative/solitaire play, press your luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will have to roll dice, and allocate them on their agent's sheet to gain these resources: &lt;br/&gt;1) warrants: to enter a location&lt;br/&gt;2) attack: to respond to an attack from an encounter&lt;br/&gt;3) evade: to hide from an attack from an encounter&lt;br/&gt;4) interact: to interact with encounters or locations&lt;br/&gt;5) analyze: to analyze hints and gain evidence about who committed the crime&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such resources will be used to deal with encounters the players will meet around the city, to advance their agent's abilities, ultimately, to catch the suspect who is found guilty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided in 2 stages: the first is the Search, where players have to discovered who, among the 4 suspects, committed the crime; and the second, the Chase, where the suspect tries to hide in Dystopia, and it's up to the agents to seize him (it or her).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
