			<description>BLITZ BOLIDE is a racing car game based on Formula 1 race. &lt;br/&gt;THE PURPOSE OF BLITZ BOLIDE IS TO PLAY WITH 1/64 MINIATURE AND HAVE GREAT FUN IN DOING THAT. At this scale, a car has 7,5 cm or 3 inches length.&lt;br/&gt;Blitz Bolide is played on tracks which are made of spaces. The average length of a lap is between 40 spaces (fast tracks) and 60 spaces (long tracks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY : a car has four levels of gear : low, intermediate, high, and extreme.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, his driver can increase or decrease this gear by 1 level.&lt;br/&gt;After that, he rolls 2 dice : according to the results of the dice, and according to the gear, the car is moved by a certain number of spaces. &lt;br/&gt;Move bonuses (in terms of spaces) are given by tyres, fuel gauge, suspension, etc...&lt;br/&gt;Once moved, a car can engage another car in order to gain its position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two important difficulties in the game :&lt;br/&gt;a) How to manage the Damage Points (DP) ? &lt;br/&gt;Each car begins the race with 8 DPs. DPs are lost during brutal brakings, during engagement, when the car is going out of track, at extreme gear, etc...&lt;br/&gt;A car is eliminated if it goes under 0 DP.&lt;br/&gt;The higher the speed, the faster you lose DPs. But you cannot win if your speed is too low...Here Pit Stop strategy is very important for purpose of managing DPs.&lt;br/&gt;b) How to take the corners ?&lt;br/&gt;Each corner has an optimal gear. If its gear exceeds the optimal gear while taking a corner, a car can goes out of track (losing speed and possibly DPs). &lt;br/&gt;However, a driver has 3 choices when his car is about to take a bend : short, medium, or long trajectory. With a short trajectory, you go faster, but it's risky. With a long trajectory, you take the corner more easily, but you become an easy target if engaged by opponents...&lt;br/&gt;Here, tyre strategy, set-up (aero grip, suspension, etc..), are very important things for purpose of taking a corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic rules cover : hard or soft tyres, fuel gauge, pit stop, optimal gear in bend, fast bend, etc...&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules cover :advanced set-up (pit stop efficiency, bolide's toughness, etc...) defective gearbox, rain tyres, meteo.&lt;br/&gt;Expert rules cover : aero grip, suspension, oversteering, understeering, engine power, qualification lap, Events card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the moment, there are 8 tracks : Monaco, Canada, Belgium, Japan, Italy, Catalunya, Singapore, China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
