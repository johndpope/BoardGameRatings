							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Ronin</name>
									
			<description>This expansion for Malifaux includes 3 Outcast mercenaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've got to love these girls. Once viewed by many as the best 5pt model in Book 1, they were errata'ed to make them more balanced, but still a very strong contender. High mobility, resilience, strong in melee and a shooting attack for when melee isn't the best option, combine to make a model which has many strengths and few weaknesses. Nevertheless, although pretty much a must have in a crew led by the Viktorias, Ronin are rarely seen in crews led by other masters despite the fact that as mercenaries they can potentially be taken by all factions (albeit for the cost of an additional soulstone).&lt;br/&gt;As a cheap basic crew which can be simple to pick up and play competitively then you can't go far wrong with the 2 Viktorias and a blister of 3 Ronin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
