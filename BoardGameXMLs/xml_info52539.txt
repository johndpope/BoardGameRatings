			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When agent Tatyana Ivanova blew the turbocharger in her highly-modified Orion Foundation sports car, she vowed to teach the manufacturer a lesson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was right before she disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the Orion Foundation has decided to send in a crack team of agents - the players - to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail leads from the Grand Canyon, to Provo, Utah, and across the Pacific to the island of Maui, but the globe-hopping investigation raises more questions that it answers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Why is an army of KGB agents descending upon the research facility of a reclusive professor?&lt;br/&gt;- Who is responsible for the disappearance of the classified Defense Department parts?&lt;br/&gt;- Who does &amp;quot;Marvelous Marc&amp;quot; Moscatello think he is?&lt;br/&gt;- And what does all this have to do with a blown engine and a missing secret agent, anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a taste for adventure as well as a flair for the dramatic, you'll find the answers to these questions in Operation: Starfire, an adventure for use with the Top Secret/S.I. espionage roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
