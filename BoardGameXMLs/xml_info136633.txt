							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lilliana Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lilliana. Sexual hedonists, sex-pots, beautiful and seductive sirens, succubi, the list goes on and one to describe one of death&amp;rsquo;s most beautifully created ladies. Most Lilliana have an ethical following that argues that pleasure is the only intrinsic good -that only things that are pleasurable are good. This ethical code is used as justification for their actions weighing things as what will bring them the most pleasure or pain. To put it plain, the Lilliana try to maximize their pleasure in all things to get the most out of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In living a hedonistic life, the Lilliana can expect to seek out pleasures in order to attain a state of tranquility and freedom from fear as well as an absence of pain though their knowledge of the workings of the world and our desires. The combination and fulfillment of these? Happiness and bliss. Lilliana teach their trinity of knowledge, friendship and living a life in pursuit of pleasure, however, there are limits that each Maker bestows upon their Liberi. By having too much sex, there is the natural fear that one could become dissatisfied with their partner, by overeating, one could lose a taste for their food. Heeding these warnings, the Lilliana teach that living a life in pursuit of pleasure is only good with a balance in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
