			<description>&amp;quot;Besser Essen&amp;quot; is a board game based upon a german TV show about healthier eating. The two to four players have to arrange a healthy food plan for one week, including three meals a day, snacks and drinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each eatable item is represented by a card and has a point value and a fat value. The point value is good for the scoring, while the fat value is important for planing the daily dishes. Each day only allows 15 fat points in total for the meals, the snacks and the drinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make the game more interesting you cannnot only play cards onto your own meal plan, you can put cards to the meals of your opponents, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each day, the players get points based on there meal decisions and after one week the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
