			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every story has a beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beginning of the story of Shaintar is an epic all its own...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As vast and imposing as the Kal-A-Nar Empire is to the people of Shaintar, it is but a speck in the eye of the giant that was the Empire of the Starfather. Seven stars and a least a dozen inhabited planets, united by Starfall Gates and Arcdrive Ships, fell under the eternal, generally benevolent rule of the Starfather and his family. His mate, once called the Radiant Mother (now, the Mother of Night), and his children and grandchildren (the Scions and Offspring, respectively) helped manage and rule this vast civilization. Aided by the techno-magical might of the Builders and other gifted beings, the family of the Starfather seemed destined to not only rule for eternity, but expand the Empire of the Starfather to distant stars and worlds beyond the Veil....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From this grandiose beginning, the tale of the cosmology of Shaintar flows through these pages, giving the reader a sense of where it all came from, how it all went so horribly wrong, and a roster of all the key players of the past, who remain present in Shaintar's unfolding journey into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saiderin. The Silver Unicorn. Archanon. The Ascended. All are covered here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well, matters of great importance to druids and priests are addressed, including: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Trappings&lt;br/&gt;    Blessings&lt;br/&gt;    Clarifications of certain Gifts and Miracles&lt;br/&gt;    The Oaths of Obligation for each spiritual road&lt;br/&gt;    Magical use for those just beginning their journeys with a d4 in a spellcasting skill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
