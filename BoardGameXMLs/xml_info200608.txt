							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Australia puzzle map</name>
									
			<description>A simple roll-and-move race game along a 30-space track circumscribing a map of Australia. Starting from any space, players roll a die and move that many spaces clockwise around the track. Each space contains a hand-painted image of a location on the map in the centre of the board. When a player lands on a space, another player identifies the location, &amp;quot;googles the location on a smart phone&amp;quot; and asks the moving player three questions about that location. If all three questions are answered correctly, the moving player gets to remain at the new location, otherwise he returns to his previous space. &lt;br/&gt;The first player to return to his starting space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
