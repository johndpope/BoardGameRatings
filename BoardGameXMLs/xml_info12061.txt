			<description>Quite similar to Checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played with 4 sets of 18 pieces (&amp;quot;knights&amp;quot;) on 8 boards (4 straight, 4 L-shaped) with 12 holes on each board. The goal is to hold three of the boards by removing the opponents' pieces from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns by moving one of their pieces either one hole horizontally or vertically, or jumping over their own or opponents' pieces. If an opponent's piece is found between two hostile &amp;quot;knights&amp;quot; or between one &amp;quot;knight&amp;quot; and the edge of the board, it is removed from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player (or a team of 2) controls three boards (which are randomly placed - giving the game some diversity!) the game is over and the other player/s lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alex Randolph: Unfortunately containing a fatal technical flaw (you might see it: the pawns tend to get stuck in the board, so when you try to move a pawn you often lift the board with it.&lt;br/&gt;Moreso the small flags on the pawns break very quickly - Hermann Huth)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplements:&lt;br/&gt;Castile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented by:&lt;br/&gt;Claim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
