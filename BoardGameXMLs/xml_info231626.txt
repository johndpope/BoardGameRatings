			<description>From The Press Kit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Beast Mode: Night of the Werewolf, a new game by solo developer Apeirogon Games. You play as a Werewolf whose sole purpose in life is to decimate a group of hapless hippies as they party in the woods, the desert or even on the moon! As the match begins, a timer ticks upwards and your goal is to kill all of the hippies as fast as possible. Kill several hippies in a row and you can chain together unlimited combos for bonus points, with every 5th kill being emphasized by an announcer shouting out an exciting killing related verb such as &amp;ldquo;Slaughter&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Carnage&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
