			<description>Looney Tunes TAZmania game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place strips of plastic, called bars, in their own side of a cage holding none other than the Tazmanian Devil in the form of a ball with his face on it. But this ball moves, and if players take enough of your bars away during play, Taz will bust through your side of the cage making you...not the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cage guards are Tweety, Sylvester, Daffy and Bugs. The cage needs adult assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you set up your cage bars as strategically as possible, crossing them if you think that may help. Then on your turn, concentrate on pulling the bars out of your opponents' sides of the cage, causing Taz to escape from any side but your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
