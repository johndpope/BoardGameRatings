			<description>This game is played until one team scores a number of goals agreed to before the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is controlled through cards, moving the puck and allowing shots, which are resolved through dice rolls. However, when a &amp;quot;VCR&amp;quot; card is drawn from the deck, a videotape is consulted which can result in an opportunity to try for a goal by flicking it from a spot on the board into a net.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
