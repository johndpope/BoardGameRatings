			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of Nations was an upcoming MMORTS video game for Microsoft Windows. It is anticipated to combine the action and strategy of a traditional real-time strategy game (RTS) with the persistence, progression and social features of a massively multiplayer online game (MMO).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is presumed cancelled. Trion has since removed all mention of End of Nations from their website. As of November 2013, following a restructuring at Trion Worlds, Inc. it appears that the development of End of Nations is in limbo. No new information nor patches have been provided to Alpha Testers since August 2013, and there have been no activity by the development team in the Alpha forums since this time. On March 2, 2014, all mentions of End of Nations were removed from Trion's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;End of Nations&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
