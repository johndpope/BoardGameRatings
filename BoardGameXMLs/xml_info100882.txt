							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wildlife Lotto</name>
									
			<description>This is a nature-themed Lotto game. One player is designated &amp;quot;caller&amp;quot; and every player is given a large 3x3 card featuring images of wildlife. The pictures are unique to the each card are not repeated, unlike traditional Lotto. The caller has a deck of smaller cards that have been shuffled and placed face down. One by one, the caller turns over the cards and announces the name of the animal or plant shown on the card. If someone has a match, he claims the card and places it on the corresponding art on his large card. The game is over when a player has completed all nine matches on his large card. That player is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
