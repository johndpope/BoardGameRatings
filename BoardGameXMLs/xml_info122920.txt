			<description>Unusual game in that it was made by the Royal Navy Careers Service, as a tool to attract youngseters to a career choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules card:&lt;br/&gt;How to become an expert at recognising the shlps. missiles and aircraft of the Royal Navy.&lt;br/&gt; You can use these cards in many ways that will help you memorise the 'hardware&amp;rsquo; of today&amp;rsquo;s Royal Navy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Recognition Quiz is one game you can play. Each card is numbered so you earn that number of points for every ship you Identify,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are two card games you can play:&lt;br/&gt;Navy Snap&amp;mdash;Deal seven or more cards to each player. Place remainder of pack in centre of table. Play in rotation, each player trying to match from his own hand the top card of the table pack (which is discarded on to a second pile).&lt;br/&gt;Players match cards by producing any ship of the same type &amp;mdash; i.e. any class of frigate with any other class of frigate; a nuclear sub with a nuclear sub but any non-nuclear class of sub with any other non-nuclear.&lt;br/&gt;Players may be challenged on their matching and. If they have mixed one type with another, they have to take their card back and forfeit their throw next time round.&lt;br/&gt;First player out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navy Rummy &amp;mdash; Deal seven cards to each player. Play like ordinary rummy, collecting sets of three (i.e. three subs of any type. three aircraft. three ships of any type) and runs of four (in ascending or descending order of displacement tonnage &amp;mdash; i.e. carriers, auxiliaries, cruisers. Polaris subs, missile destroyers, frigates and so on).&lt;br/&gt;First player out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win a presentation colour picture for your own idea. If you think up a game of your own &amp;mdash; which must be simple as well as fun &amp;mdash; let's know about it at the address on the other side of this card. If we like It we&amp;rsquo;ll send a presentation colour picture of a modern Royal Navy ship or aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
