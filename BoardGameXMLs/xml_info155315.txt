							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New York 1776</name>
									
			<description>New York 1776 is the first volume of the American Revolution Campaigns series.  It is strategic in scope with battles tactically carried out on a battle board.  Wooden blocks are used for fog of war.  This campaign involves point to point land and water zone movement.  Group movement can only be done with commanders and some commanders can move faster than others. The British win by capturing Washington or reducing his army and holding New York City at the end of the game.  The Americans win by avoiding British victory or reducing the British army to less than 20 strength points.  Quick playing, deep strategy, and battles that show the weakness of militia facing trained professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New York 1776 campaign of the American Revolution  pitted a newly formed American army, comprised of Continentals and militia, facing a large, highly disciplined British army that included a significant number of Hessian soldiers. This campaign involved the largest number of troops of the war. An inexperienced army faced a very experienced one. It unfolded with an intricate set of maneuvers around New York City and its waterways involving a large British fleet executing numerous amphibious landings in an effort to trap the Colonials. It was truly the best opportunity the British had for capturing Washington and America&amp;rsquo;s entire army. Historically, the Americans just barely escaped to live and fight another day. Can you, as the British player, defeat the American army and end their revolution in its infancy? Or as the American player can you, like Washington, defend your country while avoiding disaster?  The decisions are yours&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
