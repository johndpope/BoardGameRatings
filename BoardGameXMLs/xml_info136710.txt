			<description>In Bump Bump Pig, piggies with many different characteristics live in a peaceful town, and if they &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; against someone, they bring a change of fortune to the other individual, possibly good, possibly not so good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns acting as the Master, and in each round the Master receives piggy cards from other players. Some piggies will allow both players to score or take some special action, while others might have bad effects. The Master can use piggy cards in front of himself to avoid harm or seek out the highest reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
