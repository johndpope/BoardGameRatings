							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Get In That Tub</name>
									
			<description>The game involves running a device down a plastic strip. That device would then speak phrases giving reasons for not taking a bath. Stuff like &amp;quot; I can't swim&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I don't feel good&amp;quot;. These excuses would then govern your movement around the board. Object of the game was to get all of your pieces into the plastic bathtub which came with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
