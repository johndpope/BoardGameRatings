			<description>Le Sourire Du Dragon (The Smile Of The Dragon) is a board game where players are characters from the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Animated Series cartoon (Hank the Ranger, Eric the Cavalier, Diana the Acrobat, Presto the Magician, Sheila the Thief and Bobby the Barbarian). Starting at the roller-coaster that bought the children into the magical Realm, the goal of the game is to reach the Vortex home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players navigate the board by rolling three dice; one for Movement and one for Adventuring, but must declare which one is prioritized before rolling; with the highest die roll being the prioritized one and the lowest die roll being the other (the middle scoring die roll is ignored). Players move clockwise around the board a number of squares equal to their Movement score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various illustrated Adventure Boxes present tasks that their Adventuring score must not be lower than otherwise the player remains on the square and has to try again next round. The Adventure Boxes and their scores are Armoured Warrior (6), River (4), Castle (6), Dragon (6), Wall (4), Village (0), Crevasse (5), Magician's Peak (6), Treasure (0), Desert (4), Lake (5), Spiders' Webs (6), Whirlwind (6), Castle Of Shadows (3), Venger (7), Tiamat (7) and Dungeon Master (5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must draw a card from the deck when they land on a green square. Cards can be Monsters, Magical Items, Commands, Dungeon Master or Uni the unicorn. (Black-spotted cards indicate that the card is kept by the player.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster cards are numbered and the player's Adventuring score must not be lower than it otherwise the player is moved back to the previous Adventure Box. The monsters and their scores are Frog (2), Wolf (3), Bullywug (4), Orc (5), Dragon (6), Lolth (7), Venger (8) and Tiamat (8).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magical Item cards can be used by any player and provide bonuses with the bonus greater if the item belongs to the character (e.g.: Hank the Ranger and his Bow). The Magic Item cards are Bow, Cloak (which makes Sheila immune to the Brawl rule), Club (gives Bobby automatic success on Castle, Wall, Magician's Peak and Castle of Shadows), Hat (gives Presto random bonuses and penalties), Javelin (gives Diana automatic success on River, Castle, Wall, Crevasse and Magician's Peak) and Shield (prevents Eric going back to previous Adventure Box when losing against a monster).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command cards can move the player forward two Adventure Boxes, backwards one Adventure Box, make them give their cards to the last player, make them give any magical items to their proper owners, negate missing a go on an orange square and select a card from another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Master card can be played once to automatically succeed on an Adventure Box and Uni the unicorn gives a bonus to either Movement or to Adventuring (but only when picking a monster card) throughout game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players do nothing on yellow squares. Players miss-a-go on orange squares. Players sharing squares can swap cards and even steal them if the other player refuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To move from the outer track to the inner track the player must land on the Whirlwind where he is transported (if his Adventuring score is 6 or more) to the Castle Of Shadows and then continues (if his Adventuring score is 3 or more) around in a circle until he lands on the green square with an arrow pointing to the Vortex. If the card he has drawn does not result in him moving off of the arrowed square then he has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game board x1&lt;br/&gt;Playing pawns x6&lt;br/&gt;Playing pawn stands x6&lt;br/&gt;Dice x3&lt;br/&gt;Instructions x1&lt;br/&gt;Cards x56 (see below for individual cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Master card x1&lt;br/&gt;Uni card x1&lt;br/&gt;Frog card x1&lt;br/&gt;Wolf card x5&lt;br/&gt;Bullywug card x2&lt;br/&gt;Orc card x10&lt;br/&gt;Dragon card x5&lt;br/&gt;Lolth card x1&lt;br/&gt;Tiamat card x2&lt;br/&gt;Venger card x4&lt;br/&gt;Bow card x1&lt;br/&gt;Club card x1&lt;br/&gt;Cloak card x1&lt;br/&gt;Hat card x1&lt;br/&gt;Javelin card x1&lt;br/&gt;Shield card x1&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Give Your Cards To The Last Player&amp;quot; card x2&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Do Not Miss-A-Go&amp;quot; card x2&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Pick Any Card You Want&amp;quot; card x2&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Go Back One Adventure Box&amp;quot; card x2&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Advance Two Adventure Boxes&amp;quot; card x4&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Give Object To Its Owner&amp;quot; card x6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
