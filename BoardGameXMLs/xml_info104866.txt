			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pariah is a roleplaying game of supernormal powers set in a paranoid society where the gifted are pursued and persecuted simply for being different. Each player assumes the role of a child or young adult with supernormal powers. The characters must struggle to survive and succeed in a world that has no love for them. The government hunts them down to exploit their powers, yet officially covers up their very existence. Ancient secret societies seek to use them or destroy them for their own ends. Normal people fear and shun them when their powers are revealed. The gifted live in fear of discovery all the time. There are few whom they can turn to, and no one they can ever fully trust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
