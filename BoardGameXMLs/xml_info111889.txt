			<description>Press Release&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 3, 1999--Electronic Arts(TM) (Nasdaq:ERTS), the world's largest interactive entertainment software company, today announced that it has shipped Superbike World Championship for the PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the latest franchise for the industry-leading EA SPORTS(TM) brand. Electronic Arts has the exclusive license to the SBK Superbike World Championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superbike World Championship features blistering-fast 3D racing for the PC. This high-end motorcycle racing simulation allows gamers to push precision built Superbikes from Ducati, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Yamaha to the absolute limits on the long straightaways of international tracks like Germany's Hockenheim Raceway. Racers can also tune the bike to assist in perfecting cornering skills on the many contoured Superbike tracks like the curvaceous Laguna Seca Raceway in California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Superbike World Championship is an excellent addition to the EA SPORTS line-up,&amp;quot; said Marcus Iremonger, executive producer of Superbike World Championship. &amp;quot;This game raises the bar to new levels for hard-core motorcycle simulations. EA SPORTS' Superbike gives you the opportunity to pull on your leathers and prove that you can handle over 150 horsepower on the toughest international raceways against the very best riders.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superbike World Championship offers different modes of play that enable gamers of all skill levels to enjoy the experience. Those new to PC racing will enjoy the Action mode which includes a computer assisted artificial intelligence that forgives many rookie mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die-hard gamers will be challenged by the demanding and totally authentic realism of the Simulation mode. The Sim mode challenges gamers to master all aspects of Superbike racing. To become a Superbike champion in Sim mode, one must have superior race skills and strategies on 12 of the toughest road courses in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, the racer must analyze telemetric data to identify and implement the optimal Superbike setup, and learn to handle the bike in traffic and variable weather conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to make the game as realistic as possible, the Superbike production team enlisted the help of the 1998 World Champion Ducati Team. The team's input was critical in the development and implementation of the Superbike telemetry and physics model used in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superbike World Championship is fully compatible with a variety of major Direct 3D(TM) accelerator cards including 3Dfx VooDoo2(TM), which greatly enhance the 3D presentation of the richly textures track environments, riders, and motorcycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 official International Superbike tracks in the game, including Phillip Island (Australia), Donington (United Kingdom), Monza (Italy), Brands Hatch (United Kingdom), Assen (Holland), Sugo (Japan), Misano (Italy), Hockenheim (Germany), Laguna Seca (USA), A1 Ring (Austria), Albecete (Spain), and Sentul (Indonesia). All are accurately reproduced from topographical and geometric data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplayers can race as any of the 18 following SBK Superbike icons: Carl Fogarty, John Kocinski, Akira Yanagawa, Pierofrancesco Chili, Pierogiorgio Bontempi, Noriyuki Haga, Jochen Schmidt, Simon Crafar, James Whitham, Mike Hale, Pere Riba Cabana, Andreas Meklau, Aaron Slight, Scott Russell, Neil Hodgson, Colin Edwards II, Igor Jermanb or James Haydon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EA SPORTS is the leading interactive sports software brand in the world.
