							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Threshold: Tragic Superheroes</name>
									
			<description>Simple mechanics. Fast action. Narrative elements in the control of the players. Threshold: Tragic Superheroes is a fun, super-fast game of superhero action. But, that's not all it has. Threshold: Tragic Superheroes explores what it is to be at the end of your rope, but in a way to empower you in that exploraion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Threshold: Tragic Superheroes, you take on the role of a person who is dying; someone who has little time left among the living. Yet, even during this dark time, there is a glimmer of hope. A mysterious company, Speed Silver, has given your character a drug, the Elixir. This high-tech drug invades the character's body and grants superhuman abilities previously unknown among the modern human race. While the Elixir may prove more lethal to the character than their terminal illness, it does allow them to get out and experience life in their last few days and weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system powering Threshold: Tragic Superheroes is fast and loose, using three attributes, Physical, Mental and Social, to represent your character's strengths and weaknesses. Combining this with the character's Regret and Vice, these simple mechanics allow each group to tell intense stories where each person sitting at the table is part Actor and Director, injecting their own vision into the scene and incorporating it all into one glorious story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
