			<description>CHAMPIONSHIP AUTO RACING recreates the excitement of open wheel racing. The game is based on actual statistics of the great drivers from yesterday and today. Any number of people can play. Championship Auto Racing can even be played solitaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 7 different Race Tracks, 41 Driver Cards based on driver statistics from both the IRL and CART 2002 season, 36 Driver Cards of past racing legends based on their statistics from the Indianapolis 500, Race Car Markers, Hazards Sheet, Lap Sheet, and Instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the 36 drivers from the &amp;quot;Legends of Indy&amp;quot; set include... Mario Andretti, Emerson Fittipaldi, A.J. Joyt, Jr., Arie Luyendyk, Rick Mears, Lou Meyer, Mauri Rose, Johnny Rutherford, Wilbur Shaw, both of the Unser brothers (Al and Bobby), and 25 more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the 41 drivers from today include... Cristiano de Matta, Gil de Ferran, Adrian Fernandez, Paul Tracy, Eddie Cheever, Helio Castroneves, Kenny Brack, Michael Andretti, and 33 more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player decides when to pit for gas and tires. Stretch out your pit stops and risk the chance of running out of gas or blowing a tire! And watch out so you don't spin out on the marbles. The winner is the first driver to complete all the required laps and cross the finish line. Play with as few or as many drivers as you wish, and race as short or as long of a race as you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
