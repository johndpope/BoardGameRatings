							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek Timelines</name>
									
			<description>Star Trek Timelines is a strategy role playing video game developed by Disruptor Beam for iPad and Android platform. The player is the captain of a ship and can form their ship's crew from characters from any era of Star Trek, while steering the fate of the galaxy through diplomacy, science and force of arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set after the events of Star Trek Nemesis and Star Trek: Voyager's series finale, Star Trek Timelines begins as the player captains their first starship command to investigate an unknown temporal anomaly. Upon arriving at the anomaly, the player meets Q, who immediately explains that a full-on temporal crisis has begun throwing people, places, and objects from other timelines (including the Mirror Universe) into this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Trek Timelines lets players recruit characters from all eras of the Star Trek TV series, including Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Enterprise, The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation movies. Players take on the role of Captain, in command of their first starship (a Constellation class starship, just like Jean-Luc Picard's first command.) Soon, players must recruit crew and build starships from across the timelines in order to aid Q by sending crew on Away Missions, engaging in Starship Battles, and completing main missions to progress the story and choose which game factions take further control of a galaxy in chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Timelines Star Trek Timelines]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
