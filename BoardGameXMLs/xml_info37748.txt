			<description>From the manufacturer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Game of Action and Thrill, developing unexpected situations and startling climaxes so rapidly that you are constantly 'on edge' with suspense.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a deck of cards, all of one 'suit,' and a pair of six-sided dice with the six on each replaced by a check mark. Nine cards are dealt to each player, with the four remaining cards forming the discard pile. The dice are thrown by each player in turn, and on each throw all players may discard one card corresponding to the total number thrown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a check turns up, the player throwing must take the top card from the discard pile rather than discarding, though other players may discard a card which equals the number thrown on the other die. When two checks are thrown, the throwing player must take two cards. When one player runs out of cards, each other player pays him one cardboard chip for each card remaining in their hand. Players play to &amp;quot;100, 200 or any agreed number of points.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
