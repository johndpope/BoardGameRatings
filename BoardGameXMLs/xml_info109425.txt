			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by industry veteran and Pathfinder fan favorite, Owen K.C. Stephens, this book combines two of Super Genius Games's most popular PDFs &amp;mdash; The Genius Guide to the Time Thief and The Genius Guide to the Time Warden &amp;mdash; into a single 32-page, full-color print edition. It also includes extra advice and material to make it easier to bring these classes and their chronomantic powers into any campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book was made as an exclusive product for Paizo Con 2011, contains extra art not in the original PDFs, and was printed in an extremely limited run. Now that the show's over, we're making the few copies that went unsold available exclusively on Paizo.com. We have no plans to reprint this full-color edition, so get yours...while there's still time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
