			<description>The stage: Venus, near the end of 21st century. It&amp;rsquo;s been several years since the race to exploit resources, and the suceeding collapse of the bubble economy. The mega-conglomerate, Venus Material Inc. (VMI) is at a standoff with the Sentinels of Terra, an organization formed by the world&amp;rsquo;s superpowers to keep conflicting interests in check. Now, the situation approaches what was &amp;mdash; in a century past &amp;mdash; a &amp;ldquo;cold war&amp;rdquo;, just like the last century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On an airfield in the suburbs of Terra Structure #3 is the base of the Raiders, a civilian group that undertakes various jobs. To complete these dangerous tasks, a special license to own and utilize weaponry is required &amp;mdash; Ellea Southline, the Raiders&amp;rsquo; driver, is an owner of said license. One day, she is asked to retrieve a certain object from inside a laboratory now occupied by an armed group. She manages to slip through the enemy and get the object. However, on her way back, the Raiders squad is attacked by an unknown force in a demilitarized zone. They send out a distress signal, but both VMI and the Sentinels show up, quickly turning into a firefight. The situation escalates into all-out war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
