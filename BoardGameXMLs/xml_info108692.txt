			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;What is Twilight?&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a good question. Twilight is a role-playing game designed to be quick and fun to play, yet offer incredible depth at every level of play from character creation to a trip to the market to a raging battle. Have you ever played a game where you are limited by character classes? The Twilight system allows you&lt;br/&gt;to make anyone or anything you can imagine,  right off the bat. Have you ever swung a longsword, barely nicked your  foe, yet done maximum damage? The Twilight combat  system makes sense &amp;ndash; you even  fight badly  when  wounded.  Have  you  ever  wondered  whether  that  new  spell  your  character researched  is particularly overpowered? The Twilight power system breaks magic down into components that can create any spell, game balance guaranteed. (Sadly, it&amp;rsquo;s unavailable in the demo version.)&lt;br/&gt;And all you need to play is a handful of six-sided dice (the d6). Once you get the hang of it, you won&amp;rsquo;t even need the rulebook &amp;ndash; the system doesn&amp;rsquo;t use many tables, and the core mechanic is very simple.&lt;br/&gt;And  finally, there&amp;rsquo;s a conversion guide that allows you to convert to or  from D&amp;amp;D  (3rd edition). Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s very quick &amp;ndash; most of the point totals don&amp;rsquo;t even have to be changed.&lt;br/&gt;So come on &amp;ndash; into the Twilight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapters by Contents&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 1 &amp;ndash; Game Concepts&lt;br/&gt;This chapter describes the concepts used to run the game, and what numbers you need to know.&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 2 &amp;ndash; Character Creation&lt;br/&gt;This chapter describes creating a character and advancing him or her through experience.&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 3 &amp;ndash; Skills&lt;br/&gt;This chapter describes all the skills used in Twilight, including racial skills. These are what give characters,&lt;br/&gt;monsters and equipment their distinctive abilities.&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 4 &amp;ndash; Damage, Equipment and Miscellany&lt;br/&gt;This chapter describes other rules needed in the running of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 5 &amp;ndash; Training&lt;br/&gt;This chapter is an exercise designed to bring you up to speed on the subtleties of Twilight. You should run&lt;br/&gt;through it, preferably with a friend, to get a hang of how combat really works, after reading through the&lt;br/&gt;book but before trying to do anything with it.&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 6 &amp;ndash; Conversions&lt;br/&gt;This chapter describes a method for converting between the Twilight and d20 game systems.&lt;br/&gt;Appendix 1 &amp;ndash; Skill Summaries&lt;br/&gt;This appendix provides one-line summaries of all the skill components, and is probably the page you want&lt;br/&gt;in front of you while playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
