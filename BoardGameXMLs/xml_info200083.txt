							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNO: Frozen</name>
									
			<description>The usual Uno rules - Players race to empty their hands and catch opposing players with cards left in theirs, which score points. In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color or number to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw cards from the draw pile until they are able to place a card. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit. Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: Olaf&amp;rsquo;s Summertime Card. When you play this card, you are permitted to discard up to 3 cards from either pink, or yellow colors. This card permits you to also change the color of play. If this card is the first card that is turned up to begin play (the first card of the Discard pile), the starting player gets to choose which card color he can put down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
