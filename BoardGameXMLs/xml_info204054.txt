							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Plane Shift: Innistrad</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clouds of purple and red shroud the sky above the forbidding mountains of the Geier Reach, never allowing the sun&amp;rsquo;s full light to shine on the ground below. The jagged spires of Maurer Estate jut up from the peaks, keeping silent watch over the isolated valley. Stoic and enduring, the people of Stensia huddle in their stone-crafted villages &amp;mdash; Shadowgrange, Krezk, Lammas &amp;mdash; built against the mountainsides. Wisps of thick fog twine amid the trunks of black pines in the Somberwald, thick bogs suck dead trees slowly down into their murky depths, and dusky pastureland provides scant sustenance to flocks of scrawny sheep. The lord of this bleak, remote part of Stensia&amp;rsquo;s outland valleys is Strefan Maurer, who drank angel&amp;rsquo;s blood alongside Edgar Markov and Olivia Voldaren centuries ago. His bloodline is small and mostly irrelevant to the larger world, but in the outland valleys of Stensia, he is the ultimate master. Avacyn and Sigarda offer scant hope to his grim subjects. Abandoned by their angels and hunted by vampires, all the Stensians can do is endure the unending dusk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time Plane Shift: Zendikar saw the light of day, the game and story of Magic: The Gathering had moved on from Zendikar and started the tale of Shadows over Innistrad. I had already finished writing The Art of Magic: The Gathering &amp;mdash; Innistrad, at the same time that Curse of Strahd, a horror-themed adventure for Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, was on the shelves. All this meant that I turned my attention pretty quickly to the next installment, Plane Shift: Innistrad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting point for this document was The Art of Magic: The Gathering &amp;mdash; Innistrad. Consider that book to be a useful resource in creating your Innistrad campaign, but not strictly necessary. An abundance of lore about Innistrad can be found on the Magic website. This document is designed to help you turn the book&amp;rsquo;s adventure hooks and story seeds into a resource for your campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&amp;amp;D rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document also contains guidelines for adapting the Curse of Strahd adventure to set it in Innistrad. With a bit of creative improvisation, these tips should get you on your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
