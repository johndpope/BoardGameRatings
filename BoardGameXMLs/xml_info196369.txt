							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wondermind</name>
									
			<description>Wondermind is a unique suite of online games and interactive films for children aged 8-12, designed to illustrate the neuroscience of the growing brain in child development in simple, fun ways. The games aim to encourage an understanding of core aspects of neuroscience, including neural plasticity, spatial cognition, memory and language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quests include searching for the Cheshire Cat in an increasingly complex maze using reflected light; catching the White Rabbit whilst trying to keep untrodden paths from growing over; and making sure the Mad Hatter serves the right type of tea to his eccentric guests. The games use familiar and engaging mechanics to convey basic concepts of neuroscience to a non-scientific audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the themes were developed in close collaboration with scientists currently working in the field, led by Dr. Michelle de Hann, Reader in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience at the UCL Institute of Child Health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wondermind also includes a series of interactive videos created by award-winning director Martin Percy that allow players to have conversations with scientists currently working in the field. An associated blog provides a wealth of additional information and artworks for children to discover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wondermind is a fun, engaging and illuminating experience which fuses art, literature and science for a young and inquisitive audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
