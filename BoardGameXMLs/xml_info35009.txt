Today the only thing that remains of the Venusians is this game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players setup the pyramids in a cross formation touching each other, centered on an overturned mouse pad and role a D20 at the pyramids. Scoring more points for knocking down more pyramids. Players get additional balls for throwing strikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Icehouse Pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
