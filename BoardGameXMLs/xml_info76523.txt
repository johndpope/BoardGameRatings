			<description>Innocent Until Caught 2: Guilty is a graphical sci-fi adventure game, originally released in 1995 and published by Psygnosis. It is the sequel to Innocent Until Caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's two main characters are Agent Ysanne Andropath and Jack T. Ladd. Ysanne, who works for the Federation Police and pilots the space ship Relentless, is a tough feminist redhead, while Jack is a notorious thief and womanizer. The game starts with Ysanne capturing Jack for his crimes, when the player gets to choose one of the characters to play the game as. The locations and evolving plot are largely the same both ways, but the player can experience two sides of the story, and will be solving different puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After being jailed aboard the Relentless, Jack escapes his cell and destroys the ship's hyperdrive, forcing the duo to land on a mining planet for fuel. It turns out that there is no one on the planet, and they have to figure out what has happened. The clues lead to another planet, and an alien invasion. As the unwilling team goes from planet to planet, they try to locate the source of the alien invasion and eventually stop it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Innocent Until Caught 2: Presumed Guilty,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
