			<description>The boardgame based on the popular Dutch television show &amp;quot;Wat vindt Nederland?&amp;quot; in which two teams compete against each other, trying to find out what the general Dutch opinion is. Teams will get a statement - mostly based on recent events - and have to try and guess what the opinion of the Dutch public is on the statement. Whichever team is closer, wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like the RTL4 show this game is about opinions and how well you think you know them. The game uses a large variety of recent issues on which popular opinion has been polled. Your task is to find out which is the general consensus among the Dutch audience and score points by doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
