			<description>Hurry Home is a game designed to teach letter sounds to young children. It was published as part of a Scholastic Phonics Reading Program boxed set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hurry Home, players must get Sound Hound home to his doghouse.  Each player chooses a path, made up of a number of spaces marked with pictures, leading to the doghouse. Each player takes turns spinning a spinner marked with 0 to 3. The player then draws that number of cards from a stack of cards marked with words or pictures. The opposite side of the card shows the first letter of the picture or words. The player must then say the name of the pictured item or read the words (an adult facilitator may help with reading) and the say the letter. The player then looks at his or her path and places a marker on any picture that starts with that letter. If no matches can be found, the card is placed at the bottom of the pile. The first player to place marker on every space on his or her path brings Sound Hound home and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
