							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nelumbu</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing the first Plant-based Aquatic PC race for the Cerulean Seas Campaign Setting and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game! Nature is not good, nor is it evil. Its children could as easily save a lagoon, as pollute a bay. Living embodiments of nature have often been portrayed as either avid protectors or reclusive and dangerous hermits. This has been especially true of sentient plant species. However, most of all, nature is unpredictable. Perhaps it was in this spirit the nelumbu were born. When the first nelumbu swam in from far away shores, the viridian naiads cheered a new ally. After all, the nelumbu have all the hallmarks of a friend of the flora; being basically medium sized living water lotuses with bright and colorful blossoms. However, the nelumbu cared little for conservation. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Nelumbu are an industrious species that has little regard for sentiment or emotion. Coldly logical, the nelumbu took up branch to their own cause; the betterment of themselves. Like nature, they are not inherently good or evil; they could as easily take up sides with a goodly king as they could a deplorable dictator. So catch some sun, grow some roots, and spread your leaves. This powerful new PC race can come splashing into your game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book expands on the material presented in the Cerulean Seas Campaign Setting, bringing you a new PC race for aquatic adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
