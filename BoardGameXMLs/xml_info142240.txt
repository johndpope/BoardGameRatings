			<description>One Thousand is a fast-paced battle card game for 2-4 players. Go head-to-head or play as teams and be the first to inflict 1,000 casualties and emerge victorious! Game play is similar to Mille Bornes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your battle cards to launch artillery strikes and unleash deadly gas attacks. Use aerial recon to scout your enemy and counterintelligence to thwart their offensive. Muster your troops and mount your attacks in a race to inflict the most damage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aligned as teams or playing head-to-head, players arrange their cards on the battlefield as they attempt to launch an offensive and score attack points. Opponents can use Sabotage cards to stall an offensive and disable any future attacks until the Sabotage cards have been remedied. Perk cards can be played to permanently prevent a particular Sabotage card from being used. Hand management is an important part of the game as, to win, a team or player must reach an attack score of exactly 1,000 to win the battle. Multiple battles are played and scored as part of a campaign in which teams or players attempt to be the first to reach a total of 5,000 victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
