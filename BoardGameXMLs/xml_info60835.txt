			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hi again and welcome to the SuperBabes Another One Night Stands! These are mini-modules designed to be one night adventures that can easily fit into your existing campaign or will work well as starting games to bring new groups together. After all, &amp;quot;You all meet in a bar&amp;quot; doesn't work very well for superheroic games. So with that in mind, we've designed some quickie adventures including character sheets. Most of the conceptual work has been done for you; all you have to supply are a few stats, some scenery and players, and you're ready to play. We hope you enjoy these short adventures, and we'd like to hear what you think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
