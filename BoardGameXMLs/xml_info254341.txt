			<description>You want to fight a dragon? Let's think about this a moment...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting aside the fact that it has a large mouth full of nasty, sharp, pointy teeth, it outweighs you by about four tons, it flies, and it breathes fire. And you're going to pick up a sharp, pointy stick and wrap yourself in metal skin like some kind of TV dinner waiting to be cooked? Of course you aren't! But the king commands it, and all the other knights are watching, so you have to do something!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I Would Fight The Dragon... is a fun, fast-paced game of bluffing and bluster. Show no fear, make your excuses, and foist gear onto the other knights to help them on their way. One brave soul will be facing the dragon today. Don't let it be you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
