			<description>A Wargames System for the Flintlock Era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fusilier is a wargames system designed for the period 1700 to 1815. Although it is recognised that flintlocks were used before and after these dates. It was mainly during this period that the flintlock musket and its associated socket-bayonet was the standard arm of the line infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is designed to be used with any scale of figures. There is no formal figurescale, the unit sizes being dictated by the base sizes, which in turn are based on the frontages of the prototype units. An infantry battalion might be, for example, ten 25mm figures, twenty 15mm figures or fifty 5 mm figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is expressly designed for use with large formation games and is unsuitable for actions involving less than brigade strengths. Note that throughout the rules the term &amp;ldquo;formation&amp;rdquo; is used to convey the sense of brigade groupings and higher, whereas the term &amp;ldquo;unit&amp;rdquo; is used of bodies of troops making up brigades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
