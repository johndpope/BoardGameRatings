							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Smurfs Tag-athon!</name>
									
			<description>A collectible miniatures game sold in single figure blind packaging. A game can be played with as few as 4 figures to as many as both player's agree. (Three or four figures per player is best.) To start the game, each player places a small object on their side of the table and nominates it as their base. Next all of the Smurf figures are placed in contact with their designated base. The object of the game is to be the first to tag your opponent's base. Each turn, a player may move his entire team of Smurfs. To do so, he may move the length of one standard playing card (such as the the enclosed rule card) an any direction indicated by the arrows on the smurf figure's base. If at anytime you can move one of your Smurfs into base contact with an opponent's Smurf, you may immediately move EVERY Smurf on the opponent's team (including the one you tagged) the distance of two short sides of the card, again in any direction indicated on the Smurfs base. The first one to tag the opposing base, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
