			<description>Battle Tank: Escape from Giant Robot Island is a modular strategy board game for 2-4 players which pits battle tanks against giant robots. The players take on one of four roles, Mad Scientist Dr. Victor von Mechanstein, Sergeant Roger Stammel, OSI Agent Cynthia Collins or henchmech E-Gore Mk.IV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay progresses in turns with each player moving their token(s) then resolving attacks before play passes to the next player. Each unit has a set movement rate and attacks are resolved by rolling a six-sided die (D6) and then comparing the number rolled to the range and the target's armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has two of its own, often opposing, goals. One goal is active and ends the game on the turn it is achieved, and the other goal is passive and is only checked after 10 turns have been played. Mechanstein wants to prevent his tanks from being taken off the island, Stammel simply wants to escape with his soldiers, Collins wants intelligence on the Mad Scientist's forces and E-gore wants to please its master by recapturing the prisoners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the tank players move toward the beach as more and more robots appear to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action is modified by two sets of cards: Mad Scientist Events and Tanker Tactics. Events are large scale effects that change the game in some way or affect all the players tics are short and Tactics are minor effects that can give a boost to many actions as well as repair damage, improve speed or even find a new tank if one has been destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing area itself consists of 7 hexagonal tiles with a hex-grid printed on them. One tile is Mechanstein's volcanic lair and the other six are unique combinations of roads, cliffs, forests and open terrain. The non-volcano tiles can be rotated to any orientation and placed into one of several formations and are designed in such a way to always have the roads match up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
