			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A brilliant little platform game which suited the Spectrum's graphics superbly. It had a humorous horror theme as you, Frank N. Stein, run around collecting the bones of the monster, avoiding the usual enemies running left and right. One amusing novelty was the light bulbs inset to the platforms - walk on these and you get an electric shock which briefly paralyses you. As you fry, your shocked body shows an X-ray of your skeleton! You also slip on ice, slide down poles and bounce up on springs. After collecting all the parts, you nip back to the top and trigger the creation of your monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then there's an intermediate screen where you simple get to the top and hit a trigger and on to the next game screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using all the Spectrum's tricks to its advantage, Frank N. Stein  uses all the familiar elements in a very amusing and challenging game. There's nothing new, but the game does everything very well, with very tight timing and moves and you're never left in an impossible position if you can handle the keys well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
