			<description>Players are employees in an advertising company. However, they never know what they are supposed to advertise. &lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player draws three different images onto small sheets of paper. Then s/he puts them into three pouches, hands in the pouches, and all pouches are shuffled. A moderator for the round draws a task now, i.e. something that has to be advertised. S/he randomly picks three pouches then, reveals the pictures and everyone discusses which picture is most suitable for the task. After a time of such discussion, each player secretly votes 2 - 1 - 0 points on the three designs. Votes are simultaneously revealed. Players get bonus points for agreeing on something. Also, a player may make a guess as to who drew a certain picture. If noone is able to guess, the artist gets extra points, if there are correct guesses, these are rewarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all images have been awarded points, a second round starts, in which the same pictures are used again, but for different tasks and in different combinations. At the end of that second round, the final scoring happens: One after one, the players reveal what images were theirs and receive points. The highest overall score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
