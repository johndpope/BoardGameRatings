			<description>Web description of this fan-created game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Middle-Earth Adventure Game (MEAG) is a generalization and expansion of the rules created by ICE for the Middle-earth Quest Book series and then used for the Lord of the Rings Adventure Game (LOR) (ICE #LR0, LR1, LR2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are designed specifically for roleplaying in a ME environment, with new roleplayers in mind. MEAG is simple enough for use as an introductory RPG for players new to roleplaying, yet complete enough to be used by anyone who does not want the system to get between the players and the roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a copy of the rules and sample characters see this URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/ambarquenta/home/the-offical-games/meag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/ambarquenta/home/the-offical-g...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
