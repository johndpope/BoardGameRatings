			<description>Elliot got out of jail and works at the gas station that belonged to his adoptive father. As a bandit, it is this place that you decide to rob ... and as much to tell you that you fall badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily, Elliot has you in the right, and agrees to teach you the basics of the job. But before, you will have to prove yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose the places to point, select your equipment and sharpen your skills to become the biggest gangster in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hold-Up is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
