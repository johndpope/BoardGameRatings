			<description>Two players each have a board with a mirror at one side and two two-sided pieces with a red and yellow pattern on them. Each round, one of the cards is turned face up, showing a pattern that can be made with the two pieces and their image in the mirror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simultaneously, both players try to create the pattern on the card with their two pieces. The first player who manages this gets the card, which counts as a victory point. When the deck is exhausted, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For solitaire play, the rule book includes extra patterns using all four pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
