			<description>Naturally Disastrous is a 1-6 player co-operative dice driven game of peril and adventure.  Your mission is simple enough.  Arrive at your destination, verify the conditions and then set up a long range communication array to deliver your findings back to your superiors.  Easy, right?  Your visit to Earth is supposed to just be a quick investigation into how the planet is doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you enter the atmosphere massively destructive storms make it hard to navigate.  Giant volcanoes, earthquakes, thermal gas explosions and flooding are rampant and tearing the Earth apart and what happens next? You and your crew are shot at by some natives claiming that you are violating their air space.  As your ship tears itself apart and plummets to the desert floor you know that your only chance of survival will be to pick up the pieces of your communications array that are now conveniently scattered across the driest most self-destructing climate you have ever seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you have to do is find and set up the four parts of the communications array and signal the mother ship to come heal this planet and get you out of here.  You will have to navigate around the perilous hazards, avoid snipers who want you gone, secret agents who are stealing your technology, crazy mad scientists who want to perform experiments on you, and a completely different alien race who may even abduct you.  Work together efficiently as a team and you will avoid a Naturally Disastrous fate! If you become mutated, you turn against your former allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a randomized map, with randomly placed tokens. Each turn, the active player must roll to activate a disaster, and then has 3 actions per turn (move, probe, etc.) Combat is resolved with dice. As each part of the communications array is found, it must be transported to one of the corners of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
