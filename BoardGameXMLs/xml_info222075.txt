							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure Shorts, Volume Five</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure shorts volume five is series of five short encounters, written for the fifth edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game. They can be played as stand-alone encounters or dropped into an existing adventure or campaign and are meant to last for about a one-hour gaming session. As in some of our other titles we&amp;rsquo;re providing balanced encounters and treasure for a party of five characters of levels four, six or eight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The encounters include monsters, traps, obstacles, and treasure to challenge your fifth edition players. We&amp;rsquo;ve also included printer-friendly maps that can be used to set up your own player grids. The encounter titles are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Ruin of Torvil Prison - The fief magistrate has lost communication with the notorious Torvil Prison and needs help finding out what's gone wrong.&lt;br/&gt;     Plateau of Krazo - Unknown to travelers, the road traversing a plateau has become riddled with sinkholes after a major rain storm, making passage difficult.&lt;br/&gt;     The Challenge - A knight guards a major river crossing from his fortified tower and anyone hoping to cross the bridge may not like this tollmaster&amp;rsquo;s terms.&lt;br/&gt;     Detour - A long-forgotten stone wall still may yield one fresh surprise for anyone trying to pass through its rusty gate.&lt;br/&gt;     Alchemy Shop - A lonely alchemy shop offers travelers magic items, spell components, and magic books. The shop has also attracted the attention of a few less than desirable customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
