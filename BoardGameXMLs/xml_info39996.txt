			<description>This game appears to be an Air Combat version of Battleship. Each player has two pegboards. One pegboard is hidden behind a screen in which the player secretly places his pieces. The other peg board is played in the open and used to track which points have been identified. Game Pieces differ in sizes from occupying between two to four peg holes. Game lasts slightly longer than a typical game of Battleship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
