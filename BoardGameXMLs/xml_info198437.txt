							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms of the Inn</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inn is a dungeon. It is a campaign setting. It is a town or even just a home for the parties to come back to and visit. It can be and is whatever you need it to be. Literally offering its guests worlds of opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inn is as expansive and expandable as any premade dungeon has ever been and much more than others could have ever hoped to be. It provides your characters a place to grind, explore, call home and anything else you and your party wants it to be in order to do whatever is the most important part for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Inn there are many thousands of Rooms available. These Rooms can be explored, exploited, conquered and controlled. The backup dungeon master&amp;rsquo;s campaign setting can even be in a Room, making switching campaigns both easy and part of the story line. The only limits of what possibilities there are, are the limits you set for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
