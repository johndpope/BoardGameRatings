							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Something&#039;s Cooking</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're looking for a light-hearted adventure, you've come to the right place. Can a wizard and her beloved chef live a quiet life of baking and brewing, or is trouble destined to enter their innocent kitchen? It's up to the player characters to see what these two have cooked up before things get too hot to handle (without potholders, anyhow).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game designer Andy Collins offers the latest in our series of monthly free adventures. This original Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons scenario, including full description and stats for a crusty new culinary creature, is suitable for a party of four characters of 2nd level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Andolyn met Gendrew, it seemed a match made in heaven. Andolyn was a skilled wizard with a love of a good meal, looking for an excuse to settle down from adventuring, while Gendrew was a master chef looking to create new methods of cooking. Together, they took up a quiet life of baking and brewing, content to live in a small cottage on the outskirts of town. But now one of their experiments has gone horribly wrong, and the characters must save poor Gendrew from his own delicious concoction, while defending themselves from the inhabitants of the cottage, and one unwelcome invader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Hooks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any one of these suggestions could be appropriate for interesting the characters in the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The characters overhear a local complaining about &amp;quot;those wizards&amp;quot; who live on the edge of town. &amp;quot;They're always brewing up something strange,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;And just this morning I smelled the foulest stench yet coming out of the chimney. They're up to no good, I reckon.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The characters are directed to seek out Andolyn to purchase alchemical substances or potions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A patron of the characters has sent them to negotiate with Gendrew for the chef's services for an upcoming banquet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
