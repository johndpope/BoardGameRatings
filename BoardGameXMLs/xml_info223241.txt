			<description>This is a simple roll and move game. The players have to roll &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; to get from one of the starting circles to space 0 (Z&amp;uuml;rich). The first player to reach space 100 (back in Z&amp;uuml;rich) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player gets passed on a yellow space he has to go back to the last square space. But if a player gets passed on a red space, he has to start again at the beginning. On a space with an arrow the player has to move forward or backward as shown by the arrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be supplemented with additional cyclists to form &amp;eacute;quipes of 3 or more cyclists or for Play with more than 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
