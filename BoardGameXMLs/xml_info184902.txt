			<description>A Warning/Exploration/Thought Experiment/Game of the New Young Gods&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;From the Game Text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gods are real. Gods Plural. Gods for everything, for anything important enough fur us to place our hopes and wishes upon. They look and act just like us. Religious texts have it backwards. They are formed in our image. They have names and clothes and foibles. Some even have jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this thought experiment, you need to imagine a person on the street. A normal person with their own attitudes, opinions, and ignorances. Now give him limited omnipotence, especially over one narrow thing. Something like smartphones or coffee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that you and whatever friends you have present have imagined these hypothetical gods and know a bit about how they work, what do you do? Ah, there's the rub. You're a person with the intellectual maturity of a teenager, or maybe if we're very lucky an early 20 year old. You have absolute power but not much idea how to use it well. What would you do? That's what they do. All the poor decisions and good intentions and selfishness coupled with omnipotence. What do they do? More like what don't they do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
