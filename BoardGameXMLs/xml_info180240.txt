			<description>Sv&amp;auml;lta r&amp;auml;v (literally &amp;quot;starve fox&amp;quot;) is a traditional card game played in Scandinavia that is similar to War and Beggar My Neighbour but differs from both of those games and may not have quite the same reputation for interminableness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deck of standard cards is dealt evenly to the players, face down. Then, each player simultaneously turns up the topmost card in their pile, starting to build a face-up pile. If one or more of the cards turned up are in the same suit, the player with the highest card showing in that suit wins all the cards in those face-up piles (but not the piles currently showing any other suit), adding them to the bottom of their face-down pile. This procedure of turning up cards continues until all cards are held by a single player, who wins the game. A player who runs out of face-down cards flips over their face-up pile and continues playing, while a player with no cards whatsoever is (mercifully?) out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
