			<description>Based on the Disney Channel show&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game came as one sheet of cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game:&lt;br/&gt;All aboard the New York Subway for an underground adventure with your friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, detach the game board. Then pop out and assemble the dice and the game pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice and count the circles to see where you land. Read the clue to see what happens next. If you stop on a [yellow circle], you might jump ahead or get knocked back. If you stop on a [star], you can jump to a different line on your next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But if another player lands on your spot, you must go back down the line to the nearest station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First person to Riley's house wins! Good Luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
