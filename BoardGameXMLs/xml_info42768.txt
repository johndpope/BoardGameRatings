			<description>Bilderstrasse (Picture Street) matching game by Selecta is similar to a cross between a jigsaw game and dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is for children to find a picture that matches with a picture on a tile already played. As play continues, the row of pictures grows slowly. Encourage storytelling during play. The clown needs his umbrella, the tower needs a roof and the moon needs the sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bilderstrasse is one of a series of similar but not identical play games by Selecta including Picture Snake, Picture Worm, Picture Bingo, Picture Chain,and Picture Dice. All these games feature beautifully-finished large wooden tiles or wooden cubes in the case of Picture Dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
