			<description>WINFALL is for anyone who has ever dreamed about what they would do if they won the lottery. The object of the game is to do things in order of how you would actually do them in real life (if you won the lottery) and end up with the highest net worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pretend you just won TEN MILLION DOLLARS what would you do first? New car? New house? Take a vacation? Then what? Invest in stocks or business? It&amp;rsquo;s time to make some decisions and see if you can build an empire. Purchase cars, homes, stocks, businesses, toys, sports teams, give money to family members and take holidays. There are 3 prices for each product, you decide how much you want to invest and at the end of the game each category has a new value. The game ends whenever you like or when one player runs out of money. Each player then adds up the total amount spent in each category and the player with the highest net worth wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
