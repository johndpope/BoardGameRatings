							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Catalyst Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our world is crumbling. Demon armies have marched through their horrid portals on a genocidal campaign. As if the blood-thirsty monsters were not enough, a plague swept over the lands and claimed nearly every human left standing. Fate gave us control over the mysterious magical forces fueling the demon troops; those of us left may yet survive. Our civilization is ruined, our leaders are dead, and our hope is a fleeting dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity needs a catalyst to change their course in this war. Join the tattered remains of our species in this long-form role playing game. Weave a rich story between a game master and a group of survivors in this alternate-present reality. Embody compelling characters with Catalyst&amp;rsquo;s classless character system. Engage in tense battles with our unique card-based combat. Attempt to save the world or just live to see the next day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES CATALYST DIFFERENT?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Catalyst's demon invasion is set in our world and during our time. You are not fighting on another planet; you are battling in your country. Instead of trekking through the Elf Forest, you are fleeing Denver through the Rocky Mountains looking for safe haven. Your group's favorite bar becomes the resistance's meeting point and the ornate church down the street is the headquarters of a demon-worshiping cult. The magic brought by the demons blends with the technology of modern humanity; survive in your city however you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Combat is card-based. Everyone in Catalyst simultaneously chooses a card representing their action, creating tension at every moment. Do you lash out with your knife and leave yourself open? Do you try to dodge, knowing the enemy is near-death, but a crossbow bolt from a single demon will end your life? Do you cast a powerful spell at a foe, betting on your quicker ally stunning them with deft crowbar hit? Revel in correctly reading the mind of your opponent or think up an impromptu backup plan when your friend unexpectedly runs away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters: Be the character you want. Catalyst has no classes or professions. You decide who your character was before the demon invasion and what they become. Save the world as an autistic drug dealer with divination magic, a wannabe action hero who can throw foes with their mind, or a smooth talking frat bro able to cloak himself in darkness. Be the person the demons will learn to fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
