							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nos Morituri: We who are about to die</name>
									
			<description>From a judges description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nos Morituri is a game that revels in its visceral brutality. Set in the gladiatorial arenas of Rome, the game sets up its characters and knocks them down. It&amp;rsquo;s a competitive game but not in the way you might imagine &amp;ndash; the competition doesn&amp;rsquo;t stem from the game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics but from the players&amp;rsquo; description of their gladiator&amp;rsquo;s bold entrance and agonizing death. The game really appeals to my sense of melodrama and one-upmanship. - Marshall Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was a finalist in the 200 Word RPG Challenge 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
