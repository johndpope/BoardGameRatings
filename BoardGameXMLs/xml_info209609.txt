			<description>This undated motoring game comes in the form of a single sheet of thin cardboard with three panels. Two of the three panels form the game board, with a network of major and minor roads dotted with numbered obstacles and traffic signals. The third panel has the rules, the descriptions for the numbered spaces, six cut-out cars and three numbered tokens that are used instead of dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose whichever combination of routes they wish, but must respect the rules of the road - a rough road may be shorter, for instance, but require slower movement (two tokens instead of three).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has an artist's signature (Schreiner), but no date or indication of publisher. The physical format suggests that it might have been an insert in a magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
