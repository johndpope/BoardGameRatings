			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who practice magic, whether mystics wielding the primal forces of the universe, or technomancers dabbling in the union between magic and technology, often learn magic from an academy or a mentor. Over the centuries, mystics and technomancershave drawn upon the same pool of classic, well-known spells. When a spellcaster discovers a new spell or unearths a long-forgotten dweomer, such a find represents rare treasure&amp;mdash;one to be guarded jealously and kept secret. Here are eleven new spells, some for mystics and others for technomancers, to introduce into the campaign. The GM can decide how spellcasters acquire these new magics, such as locked within an ancient computer, scribbled in a tome in a ruined library, or granted as part of a dream as part of a greater purpose. The spells are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Artificial Personality. You give a device a temporary artificial personality of your choosing.&lt;br/&gt;    Combat Precognition. Gain increasing attack and damage bonuses against a single enemy as you learn their combat style.&lt;br/&gt;    Conjure Gremlin. You conjure a gremlin to go on the rampage against nearby technological items.&lt;br/&gt;    Dendritic Weasel. Conjure a small creature able to deliver your touch spells for you.&lt;br/&gt;    Disguise Radiation. Mask the presence of radiation in an area.&lt;br/&gt;    Disassembled Device. You can disassemble and later reassemble a small, hand-held piece of equipment or technological device.&lt;br/&gt;    Machine Warding. You inscribe a sigil of protection on a surface, preventing machines and constructs from entering the warded area.&lt;br/&gt;    Mind Lock. Creature loses access to skill ranks, spells known, spells available, as well as extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities.&lt;br/&gt;    Psychic Feedback. Inflict psychic damage against a creature using detect thoughts or telepathic message on you.&lt;br/&gt;    Quantum Flux. Subject suffers a penalty on its next attack roll or skill or ability check.&lt;br/&gt;    Transform Weapon Tech. You can temporarily add or remove the weapon property analog or archaic from one weapon in range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
