			<description>from the website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHINOBI &amp;amp; SAMURAI is an old-school fantasy roleplaying game. The rules are very short compared to the tomes required to play many recent (and also many older) roleplaying games,  but contain everything necessary to run a fantasy campaign. This small rule set is a powerful tool,  as it allows players and game masters to improvise things on the fly, quickly modify rules when the situation demands it and ad new aspects with little effort. All of this is not only possible but in fact encouraged. &lt;br/&gt; This is not a game for traditional Western fantasy campaigns. SHINOBI &amp;amp; SAMURAI is designed for campaigns in an Oriental setting with honourable samurai and agile ninjas. It is in no way an accurate historical game. Magic exists, and so do malicious oni, mighty dragons, evil spirits and  heroes ready to face them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
