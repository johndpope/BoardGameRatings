			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diseases are all around us! From tiny bacteria to deadly viruses, our bodies are constantly under attack from ravening hordes of microscopic attackers. Though if you roleplay in a fantasy D&amp;amp;D world we&amp;rsquo;ll forgive you if you had forgotten this fact.  With only a handful of diseases in the game most characters rarely encounter a disease, let alone suffer from a cold. Have no fear! A Pox Upon You! remedies this issue and provides you with over 25 new fantasy diseases for your game! Not satisfied with diseases of our fancy? Want something that&amp;rsquo;ll bring a little touch of home to your fantasy sick ward? A Pox Upon You! has that as well with over 25 Earth-based diseases, from anthrax to yellow fever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pox Upon You! also provides a new use for the heal skill, new powers, rituals, two new paragon classes and more equipment and magic items than you can shake a tongue depressor at. And did we mention the monsters? These creatures are vectors for a multitude of diseases that will keep your players on their toes (well &amp;ndash; mostly on their back as they recover from their illnesses).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you purchase A Pox Upon You! you also receive a set of cards with all the diseases, powers and monsters featured in the book. Print out the diseases and hand them out to characters so they constantly know what afflicts them, add the new powers to your repertoire, and make combat a snap with the monster cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
