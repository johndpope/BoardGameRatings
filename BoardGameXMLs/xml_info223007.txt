			<description>The party game where you kumquat, pussywillow, and shuttlecock your way to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We ask you a question and give you a bunch of hand-selected amusing words, and you come up with a unique, hilarious, or sometimes ridiculous answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone selects 9 cards, each with 5 words, made up of nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.  Each player also has a &amp;quot;free words&amp;quot; card, which includes connecting words to help players come up with their answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reader, who changes each round, reads a topic card aloud.  All players (including the reader) the cards in front of them (maximum one word per card with the exception of the free words, which are unlimited) to come up with an answer.  The responses are written down and handed to the reader, who reads all answers aloud.  Everyone votes on their favorite, and each vote counts for one point.  The winner is the player who earns the number of points required to win (this differs based on the number of players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll be amazed at what your friends come up with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
