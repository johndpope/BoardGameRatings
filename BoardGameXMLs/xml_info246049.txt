			<description>A Roleplaying Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a worldwide tremor. Many places sunk beneath the earth. The tunnels &amp;amp; sink holes were closed and barricaded. Only those in power know why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is shattered. Where once stood streets and entire cities now lies rubble. The sadistic among the population have taken to the underground in order to torture and torment the poor and weak. Strange creatures spill forth onto the streets of towns and cities, as the governments struggle to keep these monstrosities a secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this world the lawful and the wealthy require the services of the bold and adventurous, to fix their issues and recover their possessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a world torn asunder, revealing hidden, fantastical lands beneath its surface. Places of wonder and danger, unseen but for myths and legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worlds have collided and adventure awaits the brave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
