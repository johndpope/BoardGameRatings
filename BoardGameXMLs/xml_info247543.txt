							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High School Chums: Shark Bait</name>
									
			<description>One year after you graduated, your overly optimistic class president arranged a reunion at sea. Things got a little heated, and one sunken boat later you are stuck on a raft made of debris with a bunch of people that really have changed since high school. With limited supplies, can you survive the next 3 days at sea with them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High School Chums: Shark Bait is game of choices: do you want to accumulate cards to defend yourself against sharks, or to attack other players? Do you want to build up your honor by protecting others, or just bully your opponents? Do you want to break the raft apart, or work to make it more secure? Do you spend your time keeping yourself healthy, but possibly make yourself a target?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These choices are managed by a card selection phase (simultaneously taking one card and passing the rest until the final two are discarded) and then taking turns playing your action cards. Along with your actions, you move on the raft to setup attacks or defend yourself against the man-eating shark circling the raft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the unfortunate case that you die, you take the role of an additional shark that circles the raft. If you are fortunate enough attack someone, you add onto your honor, and still have a chance to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
