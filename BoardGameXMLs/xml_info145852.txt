			<description>Send your wrestlers into the arena to fight under secret rules known only to your opponents &amp;ndash; except when you set the rules, that is! Your winning weapons in this fun challenge that sends crazy characters into epic fights are tactics, intuition and bluffing &amp;ndash; but in the end, it's all just a game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round in Wild Arena &amp;ndash; winner of the Cartamundi Award in Premio Archimede 2012 &amp;ndash; the first player plays a Referee card (which shows how to win the round) face down and a Wrestler card (which has a value) face up. All other players in clockwise order then play a Wrestler card, trying to guess the rule. When everyone has played a Wrestler, the Referee card is revealed and the winner of the bout is determined!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
