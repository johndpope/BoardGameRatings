			<description>Party game where each player select a famous phrase (among many listed proverbs, title of songs, books or movies) and applies to it 5 consecutive &amp;quot;transformations&amp;quot; as ordered by 5 cards received randomly at start. Goal of the game is to guess original phrases of other players and use your 5 transformations to make your own phrase as much difficult as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are assigned depending on which level of &amp;quot;transformation&amp;quot; you eventually guess a phrase (1-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
