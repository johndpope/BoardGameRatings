							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader</name>
									
			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes during the third Crusade (12th century AD), a seal was broken and a door to other universes opened, allowing demons and spirits to come to earth. This event, called the Dysjonction, also allowed magic to function in our universe. Three hundred years later, a descendant of Richard Lionheart finds himself caught in the power struggles of the Renaissance and tasked by a mysterious spirit to find allies and seek her destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader is a computer roleplaying game in the vein of previous Black Isle RPGs. The game features several opposing factions (players are asked to join one of them in order to advance the main quest). The classless character development system is an adaptation of the Fallout SPECIAL system, with realtime combat instead of turn-based, and a lot of magic-related skills. Though the game is set in an alternate universe, the game makes heavy use of historical events and characters, allowing players to meet famous persons like Leonardo da Vinci and Cortez.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses an isometric graphic engine with 2D prerendered sprites and features a multiplayer mode allowing up to 4 players to take part in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
