							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate College Basketball</name>
									
			<description>Arguably the best college basketball game created - the game came in a box reminiscent of Strat-O-Matic, and most of the play was quite similar as well. Each year, however, brought a new batch of rule changes and upgrades, which makes playing cross-era very difficult. Cards are used to drive the action and for rebounding, but shots are taken using dice. A glaring omission is assist ratings for guards, who instead are an integral cog of the offense (without a well-rated guard in the lineup, the team will perform significantly worse).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
