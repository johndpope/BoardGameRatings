			<description>A simple trick-taking game for 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EQUIPMENT: The deck consists of 4 suits of 9 cards each: Birds, Domestic Fowls, Wild Animals and Domestic Animals. Of the Wild Animals, the Lion card is the wild card and super trump: it counts as any suit and trumps any suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY: cards are shuffled and dealt evenly to all players, with the person to the left of the dealer leading the first card. As with trick-taking games, the other players must follow suit or place what card they have, with the highest ranking card of the suit led, or the Lion card, taking the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL: to be the person with the most cards from one of the suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
