							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rawl</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early days of human civilization, the rawl were plentiful and voracious. Sprawling across the open landscape, they claimed many of the premier locales needed by the humans to build their cities and they never feared to spill blood defending them. Without the advancements and knowledge of humans, however, they were quickly wiped out and forced to retreat into the mountainous hillsides of forbidden valleys. Today, they exist in small numbers and many explorers consider them a myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rawl is a new player race designed for 4e. Huddled from the outside world by the mountains, they are brutal opponents sporting sharp blades of hair on their backs and arms. Slicing through armor and injecting their victims with twitching poisons, their solitude has been interrupted by the prophecy of doom forecast by the spirits. Presented as a fully detailed race, this edition of CA includes rules for creating rawl player characters, as well as standard monster stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, CA10 provides the first sampling of our Not Suitable For Work: Darkvision entries. Get three examples of how your characters can gain darkvision in ways that could be more interesting than you would think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
