			<description>Purple Ronnie's Groovy Game of RISKS AND RHYMES is an adult game involving moving around a board, making up poems, acting and drinking (preferably alcoholic beverages)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two decks of cards:&lt;br/&gt;the first represents different character types (i.e.slob, sex goddess, mummy's boy ...)&lt;br/&gt;the second comprises risks and rhymes.  Risk cards involve acting out whatever is written on the card.  The rhyme cards contain a short poem to which the final line needs to be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move round the board as per the roll of a die.  The space they land on determines what action they need to perform:&lt;br/&gt;- Borrow a character card from another player&lt;br/&gt;- Miss a turn&lt;br/&gt;- take a Risk and Rhymes card for themselves or another player&lt;br/&gt;- Roll again&lt;br/&gt;- Give a character card to another player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All risks and rhymes must be performed in the style of the character card in play at the time with a successful performance resulting in winning of that character card.  The winner is the player who, at the end of the game, has collected the most character cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
