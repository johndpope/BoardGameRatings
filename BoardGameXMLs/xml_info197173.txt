			<description>From the Guide's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Eos Event Guide &amp;ndash; Conclave II. Here you will find all find all the necessary information in relation to the site and anything else specific to the weekend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in your return pack should be the following items:&lt;br/&gt;- Event Guide&lt;br/&gt;- Ticket&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you require an updated creature guide, please email us. If either of these items is missing then please contact us immediately and we will do our best to rectify the situation. If you are a new player and need any additional material, please just let us know. Most things are available from the website but we are more than happy go through any questions you might have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conclave II is a shorter event than normal, so it is important that you check timings, when you can get on site etc. Adventures begin at 2pm with Time in for the evening at 5pm and time out at 2am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also if you have been to a Hicks with Sticks event before you will know that we normally run a bar and do food. This event is different as the site comes with a bar and catering, so this will be provided by a separate organisation. No meal tickets are available and no food is included with your ticket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for your continued support and trust in us, hopefully you are enjoying our events and we can provide you with another great live role-playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
