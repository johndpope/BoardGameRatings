							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arthur! Ready to Race</name>
									
			<description>Arthur and his friends (Francine, The Brain, Binky, Muffy, and Buster) need to make the best race cart they can. Cameo appearances by Arthur's younger sisters (D.W. and Kate) and his mother (Mrs. Jane Read) can also be seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is very easy for the young audience. They can race alone with AI or CPU controlled players that are controlled by the computer or with friends, and they can be able to solve problems that will show up in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
