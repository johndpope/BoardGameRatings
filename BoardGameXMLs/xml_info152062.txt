							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Insidious Intentions: The Book of Villainy Volume I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reach New Heights of Depravity&lt;br/&gt; It is the fond dream of nearly every gaming group to run an &amp;ldquo;evil campaign&amp;rdquo; some day. You know the one: instead of playing brave heroes out to save the day from dastardly villains, the party takes on the role of the evildoer, and, between trying to demonstrate how much more nefarious they are than each other, work together to perform some truly heinous acts of evil. It&amp;rsquo;s a chance for the party to let their hair down, take the kid gloves off, and really have some deliciously immoral fun. And now that there are popular adventure modules written for this very purpose, it&amp;rsquo;s easier than ever for GMs to accommodate this sort of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what about the players? While there&amp;rsquo;s certainly room for moral ambiguity in just about every one of the standard Pathfinder classes, the rules are still clearly written with heroes, not villains, in mind. Creative players can certainly find ways to put existing abilities to use for evil, but what if there were entire archetypes and groups of class features written specifically for those of malign intent? Imagine what sorts of horrors players could get up to then!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains several new archetypes and alternate class features for five different classes: the alchemist, barbarian, rogue, summoner and witch, all of which is designed to make it fun and easy to build truly insidious and reprehensible villains. From the mad science of the body artist&amp;mdash;who can chop up still-living victims and harvest their body parts to form powerful grafts&amp;mdash;to the dark rituals of the altar-bound witch, who specializes in human sacrifice in order to gain incredible magic power, the archetypes, discoveries, rage powers, rogue talents, and hexes included in this book allow players to unleash truly wicked characters on their game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be running an evil campaign to get use out of this book. The content is also great for building NPC villains to throw against players of every sort, and the unique mechanical abilities that are provided will help ensure that combat is memorable, and that the villain really gets under the party&amp;rsquo;s skin&amp;mdash;sometimes literally. So don&amp;rsquo;t wait: begin your reign of terror today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Please be aware that this book addresses some topics that may make some readers uncomfortable. Because the book is tailored to villainous and evil characters, there is discussion of a variety of villainous and evil things, including (but not necessarily limited to): dismemberment, serial murder, human sacrifice, kidnapping, enslavement, and torture. While we have done our best to handle these topics with care and tact, we recommend using your own judgment in determining whether or not this book is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
