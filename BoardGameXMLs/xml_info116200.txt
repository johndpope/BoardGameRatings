							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Millionaire</name>
									
			<description>Millionaire is a management game originally written for the ZX Spectrum by John Hunt and ported to the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro. Millionaire is a text-based management game in which the player takes the role of a home-based games programmer who has written a program and must market it to the retailers. Starting with an investment of &amp;pound;500, you require this money to pay advertisers and tape duplication costs. Meanwhile you must constantly write new games promote your products and keep a tight lid on costs. Other aspects of the game is a character called Honest Harry who could offer you deals such as cheap cassettes, which will lessen the cost of your distribution costs, or programs. Sometimes, these deals are not so good as the programs could be bugged or stolen, ultimately costing you dearly.&lt;br/&gt;Progress in the game is monitored by observing the sales figures at the end of each month. If the player made enough money the a screenshot of a bigger and better house/office was displayed. Chance played a part of the game, involving certain events which will affect your sales, such as a good review or someone digging up your past. The game itself is simplistic and will only offer limited appeal, as essentially its has too much randomness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Millionaire (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
