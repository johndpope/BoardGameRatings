			<description>In sightlesswordfight, two or more players (as many as you can handle, logistically!) battle blindly with words!  The start player declares a word, which each player must place on her secret grid.  The next player then declares a word that crosses the original word, which each player places wherever she wants, crossing the original word.  For the rest of the game, each subsequent player declares a word that crosses at least one previous word, and everyone else must place the word on her grid such that it crosses at least one previous word.  Each time a player can't place a word, the game gets a strike.  Three strikes, and the game's over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the introductory game, players simply earn a point for each letter of each word placed.  In the recommended Be Fruitful and Multiply variant, when you place a word, you multiply its length by the number of other letters it crossed.  This has the nasty side-effect of encouraging players to make their grid less suitable for more words, because the players strive to cross as many words as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, Zero Tolerance, a cutthroat variant ideal for two players, proclaims that one strike ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the instructions and game sheets to print and play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
