			<description>A commercial game for 'Deutsche BP AG'. Produced by Otto Maier Verlag, Ravensburg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws some cards which determine the tiles they have to reach on the modular labyrinth-like board. Once a player has reached all the symbols stated on his cards he has to hurry back to his starting tile in order to win the game. However, the layout of the board is going to change through the course of the game by exchanging or switching/turning tiles - which of these actions take place is determined by the player in turn using a wheel as random generator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
