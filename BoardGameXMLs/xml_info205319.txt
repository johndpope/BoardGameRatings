							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island of the Dead</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lipalla is a very small island in the Midland Sea. It is privately owned. About 200 years ago Lipalla's then-owner, a noble in the Dragon Empire, built a summer home there. The home and island were passed down through the generations. But the family's fortunes waned, as family fortunes are wont to do, and they could no longer afford the upkeep. The house was neglected and fell into disrepair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This introductory adventure is designed for a party of new first-level characters. It will work with just about any combination of icon relationships.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are tasked with clearing a small private island of undead and any other monsters they may come across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
