			<description>A card/dice game relying heavily on chance as players try to steal money away from Dicken's Ebenezer Scrooge.  Players take the role of a famous character, Mr Pickwick, Artful Dodger, Fagin, Mr. Micawber or Oliver Twist.  By rolling a lettered die and numbered die, you determine if you collect or deposit money with Scrooge, and sometimes you draw one of the lavishly illustrated cards (with artwork from Habiot Browne, George Cattermole, Robert Seymore, George Cruikshank and John Leech) which forces you to pay extra fees or gather extra gains.  The game was designed with the aid of the curator of the Dickens House Museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
