							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snap-Jacks</name>
									
			<description>The board consists of a 4x4 square grid of scoring positions with a point value of either 5, 10, or 15. Each scoring position contains a 5x5 grid of holes. So the overall interior grid of holes is 20x20. Around the edges of the board are 23 additional single holes which are scattered sparsely, with values from 25 to 75.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a seesaw-like device with a hole in one end for placing his or her jacks. Players then 'snap' the other end of the device to fling the jack into the air and (one hopes) into a hole on the board. Jacks that do land in holes on the board score based on where they land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
