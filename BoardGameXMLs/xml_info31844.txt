			<description>360&amp;deg; Air Hockey with sound FX.&lt;br/&gt;Fast flipper action for 2-4 Players. Ages 5 and up&lt;br/&gt;It' just like air hockey.The object is to try and score in your opponents goal. The first one to score 10 goals first wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 Player:&lt;br/&gt;Place puck in center and let the fun begin! First person to 10 wins! Every time you shoot the puck into your own goal you lose a point. Just keep score on the score marker by sliding it over the number of pucks you have shot into an opponent's goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 Player:&lt;br/&gt;Same as above only the inserts are used to block two of the goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other ways to play:&lt;br/&gt;Place all 5 pucks on the playing field at once. When you have let 10 pucks into your goal you are out! Place one insert in to block one goal and continue this way until only one person is left....and you have a winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Takes 2 D batteries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
