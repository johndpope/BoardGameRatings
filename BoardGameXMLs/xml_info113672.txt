							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peter Pan In Never Never Land With Tinker Bell</name>
									
			<description>Players begin the game in the Nursery of their home as one of 4 characters. Peter Pan, Wendy, John or Richard.  Peter Pan takes the players into Never Never Land where Captain Hook and his pirates are located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peter Pan begins by shaking a little box that represents Tinkerbelle. When a bell rings Tinker has landed on a movement circle. That movement number determines how far Peter can move trying to get back home. After Peter moves the other players also try and get numbers that will help them get home. There are places to stay away from. Landing on a Double Circle means that the player must take a longer route home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While all of this is happening Mom &amp;amp; Dad at home become aware that the kids are gone. The are very worried and remain so until one child gets back to the nursery thereby winning the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
