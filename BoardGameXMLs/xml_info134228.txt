			<description>A flicking game similar to PitchCar but with plastic components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastic caps are flicked along a track composed of plastic  pieces. Two flicks are allowed per turn. If your cap leaves the track, it is put back in its previous position. The first player to complete the course three times wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several variants are described in the rules. The number of flicks allowed can be changed as well as the number of rounds, bonus points can be assigned for being the first to reach certain points on the track etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces can be put together differently to allow for differently-shaped tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
