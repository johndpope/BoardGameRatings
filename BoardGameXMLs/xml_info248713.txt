			<description>In 2009, Avalon Games released it first Mini-Game, Graveyard Dash, and since then we have released a new Mini-Game every month.  Mini-Games can be anything&amp;mdash;a simple dice game, card game, or print-to-play board game. Avalon has always published these simple but fun games to explorer different types of games and genre, often allowing us, the game designers, the opportunity to develop a game without the hassle of dealing with a full-blown game of complicated rules and components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month, Avalon is releasing our 200th Mini-Game and, as a reward for all the loyal fans, we are offering it for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S&amp;amp;G Dungeon is a simple but fun game of dungeon exploration.  Using the powerful S&amp;amp;G game engine, you can play several heroes as they delve into a dungeon full of danger and rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full expandable, and every few months this year we will offer new dungeon to explore and new heroes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, gather up your gear, get your sword and a few fools&amp;hellip;um, friends, and go explore a dangerous hole in the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Extras:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This consists of three PDFs, the main, 68 page rulebook, the 38 page Book of Monsters and a sample adventure, Goblin Tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steel &amp;amp; Glory Dungeon is an expansion to the S&amp;amp;G system, allowing you to, as a group or through solo play, run through a random dungeon-like adventure. This RPG-light add-on to the system allows for you to advance your characters to higher levels and thus experience more dangerous adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
