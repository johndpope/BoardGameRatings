			<description>These adorable animals will steal your heart in this crazy card drafting and dice stealing game. You will have to think on your feet to make the most of the animal cards you are given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses an animal to play.  The cards are dealt and dice are rolled.  Then players draft cards each turn and place their dice to try to get the highest score.  Each card has two possible effects depending on which player drafts the card.  To win the game, players will have to choose the best combos of dice and cards.  After 5 rounds the hand is done and players add up their scores.  See the tutorial link for more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
