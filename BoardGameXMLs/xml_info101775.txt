			<description>Back of the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is your favourite type of game; space, arcade or adventure? &amp;quot;Journey to the Planets&amp;quot; presents and intriguing combination of all three as you find yourself on a strange planet in a strange universe. Luckily the local gods are friendly and provide you with energy, a space-ship and weaponry. In return you agree to search the universe for treasures for the gods. Board your ship, take off, and accelerate through the upper atmosphere and out into space. Your flight should take you past many other inviting planets. With a slow approach and skilled maneuvering, you drop down through the planet's sky to a soft landing on its surface. Disembark and wander through several TV screens full of mystery and excitement. A different adventure awaits you on each planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
