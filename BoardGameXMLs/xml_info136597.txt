							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Retreat to Waterbury Falls</name>
									
			<description>Retreat to Woodbury Falls takes place days after a catastrophic yet preternatural tectonic plate shift left the land riddled with sinkholes and worse... a collapsed society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the board you control three different survivalist leaders on their quest to take over competing base camps. Players survive by gathering and trading resources to recruit other survivors to their own camps and exile those who hold them back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once players have recruited an efficient survival group and have equipped themselves with enough tools and utilities by way of deck building they can move towards the final goal... take over a rival base camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retreat to Woodbury Falls utilizes the popular deck management mechanic but still allows players control of physical board pieces. The most unique aspect to the game is building a deck based around card combat. You will be able to select different class survivor cards throught the game. You will find synergies and combos between the survivors and the items you equip to them both during deck building and combat. Yes, You actually get to use your deck in combat against other players to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retreat to Woodbury Falls is an easy to learn game that still maintains a high level of strategic command and decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
