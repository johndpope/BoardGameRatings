			<description>&amp;quot;Cyborg Commando is a science fiction role-playing game (RPG) published by New Infinities Productions, Inc in 1987 and designed by Kim Mohan and Frank Mentzer based on an outline by Gary Gygax, (one of) the creator of the original Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in 2035 at a time when the earth is invaded by aliens called Xenoborgs intent on subduing humanity and taking control of the planet. Luckily humanity has developed a new kind of soldier: the Cyborg Commando, a mechanical/electronical man-like structure that can be implanted with a willing human's brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative in some ways, one reviewer said that &amp;quot;whilst Cyborg Commando isn&amp;rsquo;t the worst game written, it is outstandingly poor. This is a product that should be held up to designers as a lesson in how not to write a game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyborg Commando introduces the d10x system. This is a dice rolling system where players roll two ten-sided dice and multiply the numbers together. A single roll of d10x is used to determine both whether an attack hits a target and how much damage it does. d10x rolls are also used with a character's skill levels to determine if the character succeeds at tasks he attempts.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cyborg_Commando,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
