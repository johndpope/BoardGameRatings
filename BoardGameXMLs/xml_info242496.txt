			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mattel Football is a notable, early handheld video game providing a simple football simulation.  The player always controlled the &amp;quot;quarterback&amp;quot; (indicated by a bright LED) and the computer always controlled the &amp;quot;defense&amp;quot; (indicated by several less-bright LEDs).  In two-player &amp;quot;hot-seat&amp;quot; games, players would alternate controlling their &amp;quot;quarterback&amp;quot; against computer-controlled defenders.  Play continued until the player achieved a touchdown or until the &amp;quot;quarterback&amp;quot; occupied the same space as a defender (a &amp;quot;tackle&amp;quot;).  Generally, the ten-yards/four-downs rules of football were in (abstract) effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play involved using the up, down, and forward (only) buttons to control the motion of the &amp;quot;quarterback&amp;quot;.  Additional options included displaying the time remaining, the current score, or &amp;quot;kicking&amp;quot; (punting).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although not quite the first-available handheld game, it was the first enormously commercially successful game.  There are several &amp;quot;imitators&amp;quot; offered by other manufacturers - sometimes as attempted forgeries, but more typically as &amp;quot;enhanced&amp;quot; games.  Successfully exploiting sentimentality, Mattel manufactured and distributed a second implementation in 2000, essentially duplicating the play experience of the original in almost identical packaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Mattel released their Football II product in 1978, the Football packaging was revised to indicate Football I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
