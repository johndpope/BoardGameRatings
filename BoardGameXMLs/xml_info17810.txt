							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strawberry Shortcake Card Game Kitchen Capers</name>
									
			<description>You can make Strawberry Shortcake deliciously happy by collecting Recipe cards for her housewarming party. But watch out! The Purple Pieman will try to take your recipes from you. The player with the most Recipe cards at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal three piles of cards. Draw a card from any pile. If it is a recipe card, keep it. If it is a Purple Pieman you lose any Recipe cards you have drawn this turn. Keep drawing cards or stop at any time to make your Recipe cards &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
