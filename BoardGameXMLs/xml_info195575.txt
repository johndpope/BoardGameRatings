							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Numenera Artifact Deck</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Ninth World, artifacts are items of ancient mystery and power. Compared to cyphers, they're relatively permanent and often have straightforward applications. But their workings are incomprehensible&amp;mdash;a device powered by transdimensional siphons using nanotechnology to rewrite reality on the subatomic level often appears more magic than machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Numenera Artifact Deck contains 100 new artifacts that haven't appeared in any previous publication. Whether you're looking for a little inspiration as you prep for your game, or need to come up with a artifact on the fly during play, simply draw a card. There's an image of the artifact on one side and complete description and game content on the reverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
