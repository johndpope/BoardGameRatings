			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long shadows stretch like tentacles through the empty tent camp. The darkness seems to overshadow any trace of people - but the camp actually is abandoned. The glacier camp is empty and the tents blow in the wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her boots crunch through an icy crust and sink into deep snow. Behind her, her sister is checking her guns and monitoring a supersonic scanner. Both whisper a prayer for protection to the Virgin Mary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then they hear a shout from the far side of the camp, and they begin to run.  Soon they find a path of trampled snow that leads toward an excavation site.  From the depths of the hole  stench of sulfur wafts upward. The whisper of the wind seems to carry the sounds of a demonic revelry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are mercenaries working for a secretive organization rooted in the Jesuit order of the Vatican.  They seek to prevent demonic incursions into the world; when they don't prevent them, it's their job to send the demons back to Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
