			<description>From Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Space Travel Hazards game was developed to help reinforce knowledge of space travel and some of the potential hazards associated with space travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to get from Earth to Mars and back along one of two pathways to accomplish a successful mission.  Along the way, teams acquire Radiation Points (RPs) that are detrimental to the mission.  Teams will also acquire Mission Points (MPs) that measure the success of the mission.  When the game is finished, plot the total Radiation Points and Mission Points on the Tally Card to see if the team had a successful mission and determine the game winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- copy of game procedures and rules&lt;br/&gt;- copy of game board sheet&lt;br/&gt;- Astronaut game pieces, 1 per team&lt;br/&gt;- Chace Cards&lt;br/&gt;- Tally Card&lt;br/&gt;- One 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;- Pencil&lt;br/&gt;- Score Chart (graph)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
