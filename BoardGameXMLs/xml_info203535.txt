							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White Text on Black Cards</name>
									
			<description>White Text on Black Cards was designed from the despair and despise of seeing and being asked to play all of the variants of white text on black card games. Now when I am asked to play such games, I can play this as an alternative and in just one quick round! After that, your group can easily move onto a better game of any type -- just not these!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in one round. It begins with you laying the one black card on the table and dealing the white cards as evenly as possible to all players. Then players choose the best response to the one black card and hand the to you. As the person who started the game you get to decide which answer is the best for that moment and the player who chose it gets a point. The game is played as many times as you like and points are tallied and scored most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
