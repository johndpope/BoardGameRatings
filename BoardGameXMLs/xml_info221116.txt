A great war rages across the world. &amp;ldquo;The war to end all wars&amp;rdquo; some call it and it seems to be living up to its name, for a more terrible yet strange war the mankind had not seen before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is definitely nothing like those that came before it, for here the men lie, waiting, almost peacefully, in the lines they have drawn. For months together, nothing has stirred over the now, black land. No bird flies over, nor any beast roams here. The silence is almost unbearable, as the men eat, sleep and go about their business in absolute monotony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, the frail sense of security is shattered by a deafening noise, as a bombshell explodes nearby, causing the men to drop their jobs and scuttle for cover. One explosion is followed by another and another and another&amp;hellip; and so the pounding goes on and on&amp;hellip; for days and days&amp;hellip; till all nerves are frayed and every muscle is jittery. Just when they were beginning to think that it would never stop, it ends, as abruptly, as it had started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deafened by the onslaught on their ears, the soldiers strain to hear, fearful of that which is to follow. Soon enough, they hear a distant pattering of feet, getting closer and closer or are they? Surely, it is the sound of gunfire that they hear now or are their ears still playing tricks on them? The men arise as if from a great slumber and peer over the parapet. What they see is incredulous, for what was earlier a barren wasteland is now a rising sea before them. Their knuckles whiten as they tighten their grips over their weapons and wait for the incoming tide to draw closer, nay, wash over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is clear, that thousands will die this day and whether or not they themselves would survive, will ultimately depend on your wisdom, as their commander and the support of the brothers, by their sides. So take charge and stand fast. For the empire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somme: The game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: To play, each player chooses and commandeers a faction, the British or the German, consisting of a squad of 8 soldiers that are laid out in a row on the table. Rest of the cards are shuffled and 15 each, are distributed to the players, of which 8, are assigned to the soldiers already on the table while the rest of the 7 are held in the player&amp;rsquo;s hand as reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy: Each of the fighting units under the player&amp;rsquo;s command is unique, with different loadouts and a susceptibility to specific hardships that may be exploited by the other player by playing the hardship cards. Additionally, the players&amp;rsquo; squad as a whole, might also be affected by certain events that may be triggered by playing the event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The object of the game is simple, eliminate the rival faction before they eliminate you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn Mechanics: The players alternate between attacking, with a combination of Personnel Cards and assigned Attack-Defence Cards from the table and defending, with a combination of Personnel Cards and assigned Attack-Defence Cards from the table or the reserve Attack-Defence Cards from the player&amp;rsquo;s hand. According to the unique player interaction that ensues, the soldiers may either loose morale, possibly even leading to elimination or on a few rarer occasions, gain morale, coming out stronger to face another sapping day in the trenches. Both the player&amp;rsquo;s soldiers are resupplied at the end of each turn by drawing replacement cards and so the grinding war continues, till only one side remains standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
