							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Simplz: Zoo</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Simplz: Zoo is a game that was created by Reflexive Entertainment and jointly developed with South Wind Games. The game is a puzzle and simulation game. The puzzle part is the match-3 game (similar to Big Kahuna Reef). The simulation part is where players build their zoos. Players play through matching levels to collect resources and money which they spend on their own personal zoo. The zoo is the player's &amp;quot;home,&amp;quot; and it is where the player buys animal exhibits, creates gardens, and upgrades power-ups for the matching game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Simplz: Zoo&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
