							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Government-Funded Robot Assassins from Hell!</name>
									
			<description>Clearly a very small-release inside joke, in this game players use their Robot Assassins in a race to earn 100 points by killing &amp;quot;various targets.&amp;quot; The various targets include figures from the gaming industry such as Steve Jackson, Gary Gygax, Mike Stackpole, Richard Garfield, and the games' own designer (sadly, I don't see a target card for Reiner Knizia). Each player starts the game with a &amp;quot;Plain Bot&amp;quot; and may spend points to change the model of the Robot Assassin. Play is a simple matter of using cards to benefit assassins and targets and rolling dice to overcome modified target values. Game includes dice small enough that you could accidentally inhale them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
