			<description>Ready to hit the water? Rapala Pro Fishing takes you to 12 different locations across North America and beyond. Start off as a novice angler and become a pro with a tackle box full of awesome gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over 750 different lure combinations, a multitude of rods and many different types of fishing line. You&amp;rsquo;ll need as much gear as you can get when you head out to catch Bass, Muskie, Salmon and other trophy fish. Every species of fish has its own specific behaviors and each has a different appetite when it comes to what lure they&amp;rsquo;ll bite on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free Fishing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fish in any unlocked location and try out the gear you&amp;rsquo;ve unlocked in the tournaments. You can practice your casting and get to know what gear is best for what situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tournament:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tournaments give you the full fishing experience. Fish in any location and try out the gear you&amp;rsquo;ve unlocked in the tournaments. You can practice your casting and get to know what gear is best for what situation. Success in Tournaments will unlock lots of new lures, rods and line along the way. As you progress, you can compete in 21 tournaments. Each tournament will bring you to a different fishing location in Minnesota, Florida, California, Alaska, Texas, Arkansas, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Rapala Pro Fishing there are two main camera modes: angler view and lure view (underwater). These can be toggled or rotated at any time if your lure is in the water (if your lure is not in the water, you may not switch to underwater view). Drive the boat to the desired location (careful not to scare the fish), and start fishing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
