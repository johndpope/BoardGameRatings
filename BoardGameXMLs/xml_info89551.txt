			<description>A word building game where players form words from a common pool of letter tiles. The pool begins with three random letters and then letters are randomly added one at a time. At any time a player may call out a word that can be formed from the available letters. When a player makes a word, that word is then placed in their scoring area. Additional words may be formed either by using only letters from the pool, or by using one or more letters from the pool and an existing word in a player's scoring area. If a player uses another player's word, that word is taken and given to the player forming the new word. When no new words can be made, each player scores the words in their area. A word's score is equal to the number of letters in the word minus one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
