			<description>Description from Spielbox:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dirk Hanneforth invented this teaching game for the very young. Each child gets a colored shoe as well as a matching shoelace. The shoe has holes which have colored edges. Now, the color die comes into play. The first player tries his luck: If the die shows his own color, then he gets to thread his shoelace into one of the next two free holes in his shoe. If it&amp;rsquo;s a different color, then he has to look carefully: If red was rolled and a free hole is also red, then he gets to thread the lace. If, however, none of the next holes are red, then he gets to give away the color by choosing an opponent who needs the color and can use it to continue threading his lace. As soon as a child has succeeded in completely threading his shoelace, he wins the game. If he can then also tie a knot, he&amp;rsquo;s laughing. The others can practice via the illustrated instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up. Artwork: Kerstin V&amp;ouml;lker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
