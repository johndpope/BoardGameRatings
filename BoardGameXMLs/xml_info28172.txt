							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fire In The East, Europa Play Aids Kit 1</name>
									
			<description>(from the back cover:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I first founded Games Research/Design (GR/D) it was to do a project like this. I made some preliminary playing aids for Narvik and Drang Nach Osten! but time did not permit me to complete the project. With the publication of Fire in the East I felt the time had come to produce the Play Aids Kit 1. Naturally I chose to do #1 for Fire in the East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea for playing aids is certainly not a new one. I know that other Europa game owners have done some designs to assist their playing. But I wanted to achieve a high quality product with charts and maps that most game owners would want, something above the usual photo copy stock. I hope you feel that this product meets that standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wish to extend my grateful appreciation to Frank Chadwick, Rich Banner and John Harshman for their support and assistance in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;6 - 50% True Photo Reduction Europa Maps, 2A - 4A - 6A - 1B - 3B - 5B&lt;br/&gt;1 - Soviet Rail Distance Chart&lt;br/&gt;1- Soviet Off Map Airbase Display&lt;br/&gt;1 - Soviet Air Distance Chart&lt;br/&gt;1 - Axis Rail Distance Chart&lt;br/&gt;1 - Axis Off Map Airbase Display&lt;br/&gt;1 - Axis Air Distance Chart&lt;br/&gt;1 - Airbase Counters Strip (card stock)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of The Europa Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
