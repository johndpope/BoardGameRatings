							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cards of Mars</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game for 2+ players. Theme is the John Carter of Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Victory: The first player to accumulate 75 Victory Points (VP) wins. The Deck: Players share a common deck. There are several card types: Heroes, Villains, Beasts, Enemies, Weapons, Plots, Events. All cards fall into one of two categories: Friend cards or Foe cards. All cards have a numerical 'Force' value.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players attempt to form eight card melds consisting of at least one Hero or Heroine &amp;ldquo;Friend Card&amp;rdquo;, one Plot &amp;ldquo;Foe Card&amp;rdquo;, and at least one Enemy or Villain &amp;ldquo;Foe Card.&amp;rdquo; Because the good guys always win, the total Force value of the Friends Cards must equal or exceed the Force value of the Foe Cards. The player scores Victory Points equal to the Force value of the Foe Cards played in the meld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
