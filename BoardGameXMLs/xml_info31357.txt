			<description>This is a A Question of Scruples based game but comes with 288 new moral dilemmas.&lt;br/&gt;Players will have to make each other questions. For each question you will have to choose the person you think will give the answer (yes/no) you have in your hand. If the answer is a match, he can discard that card, but if not he will have to draw another question card.&lt;br/&gt;Of course, all players get to vote if the answer is true or false.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all cards winds the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
