							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sorceress of Zoom</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Sorceress is coming! The Sorceress of Zoom!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sorceress of Zoom is the most powerful spellcaster on her homeworld. There are few sights that terrify populations more than her amazing cloud city appearing in the air above their homes -- for the sorceress is never denied what she wants, and others always pay the price. She is the deadliest of femme fatales, and she has returned from the shadows of history to join the line-up of NUELOW Games characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sorceress of Zoom was a quirky fantasy series that appeared in the pages of Weird Comics during 1940 and 1941. Featuring the weirdest of weird fantasy, each installment saw her bringing to bear powerful magic to ward off all comers in pursuit of selfish and often horrific goals. It's a great example of the &amp;quot;anything goes&amp;quot; nature of the early Golden Age of Comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to five classic tales of the Sorceress, The Sorceress of Zoom contains two new feats and a talent tree designed to bring the unique spellcasting system of the series to OGL Modern and other d20 System-based roleplaying games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
