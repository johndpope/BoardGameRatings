							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dexter&#039;s Laboratory: The Incredible Invention Vs Dee Dee</name>
									
			<description>Dexter is on a quest to complete his greatest work.  As soon as he can collect the six parts he needs, it will be a fine day for science!  On your turn, you roll the special game die and move your Dexter towards the center of the game board to collect the parts you need.  If you are feeling lucky, once you have picked up one part, you may want to continue and collect a second part before heading back to your lab...&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;But that can be a a daring decision!  When a player rolls Dee Dee, he or she decides whether to move their Dexter or to activate Dee Dee.  If they decide to let her loose (oh no!), they swing her around the pole and any Dexter she knocks over - even their own - has to give back whatever parts he is carrying and return him to his starting position &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to collect all six cards, and your contraption is complete....OOOH!...you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
