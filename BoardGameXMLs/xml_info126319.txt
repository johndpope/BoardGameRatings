							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Divine Alligator (D20 Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Divine Alligator is an old-style adventure for 7th level (scalable to 5-6th and 8-9th) characters brought to you with the usual high quality standard of &amp;Oslash;one Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two hundred years ago was the time of Raerciminar, a dragon furthering the agenda of Itzquizatl, a draconic deity of death and decay. His chief method was infusing as many creatures as possible with dragon blood. Leaving several dozen half-dragon children in his wake, Raerciminar retreated into his distant lair and slumbered into deep sleep, waiting for his children to reach maturity by themselves and instruct them later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed to challenge both combat-lovers and in-depth roleplayers. It is a combination of site-based and event-driven adventure types. There are a lot of monsters to fight and trinkets to gain, but complete success in The Divine Alligator requires good diplomatic skills and a deal of good judgment. Every effort was made to make the adventure generic enough to be pasted into most fantasy campaign settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
