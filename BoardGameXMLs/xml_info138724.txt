							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Xenoid: The Arcade-Style Solo Space-Shooter Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A new menace is threatening Earth and its inhabitants. Earthbound observers detected a huge armada of exotic, bionic spaceships, the Xenoids, headed towards our home planet. You are a veteran pilot piloting a heavily armed prototype fighter spacecraft, the &amp;quot;Exterminator&amp;quot;. Equipped with state of the art laser and shielding technology, your piloting skills and the &amp;quot;Exterminator&amp;quot; are the only way to stop the armada of invaders and save humankind from certain damnation. Will you be able to stop the Xenoid intruders?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card game for one player tries to emulate the gameplay of classic arcade-style top-down space shooters. You control a spaceship that starts with 3 Lives, 3 Shields and a Weapon with Power 1. You are facing an armada of enemy (Xenoid) Spacecraft which move downwards towards you while you try to destroy as many of them as possible by performing one out of 3 actions each turn: Move - Shoot - Charge (your Weapon).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game features 5 Waves (Levels) with enemies becoming stronger and more numerous as you advance through the stages. &lt;br/&gt;You collect Power Ups (such as Weapon or Shield Upgrades or additional Lives etc) which pop up at random when enemy crafts are destroyed. In between stages you can buy Power Ups by spending points you acccumulated during the Waves. Each destroyed enemy goes to the Score Pile and may be used to pay for Power Ups in between Waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is twofold: The primary goal is to survive all five Waves. When all your shields are depleted you lose one life, and when all lives are lost it means &amp;quot;Game Over&amp;quot;. The secondary goal is to strive for the highest possible score by destroying as many Xenoid ships as possible. Again you score points for every destroyed enemy spaceship. So in your first game you will set your initial high score which you can beat in consecutive games. Note that you even set a score if you don't beat the game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
