			<description>Who is the Salvan&amp;egrave;l?&lt;br/&gt;The Salvan&amp;egrave;l is a goblin that frequently appears in the legends of Trentino, in northern Italy. Until not many decades ago, in every valley you could find someone who said they had seen the Salvan&amp;egrave;l, even though actually encountering him was extremely unlikely.&lt;br/&gt;They described him as a small man, boyish-looking, and always with some red feature on him: a hat, clothes or hair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time the Salvan&amp;egrave;l, running to and fro, has left his magical tracks everywhere. Anyone who treads on them by mistake is bound to get lost - and after much wandering, finds himself back where he started. Now you are lost in the wood too!&lt;br/&gt;To get back home you must make three good moves to reconstruct a path that will take you out of the wood. But the goblin will also help you, if you meet him!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of every turn, the guide picks a colored card. This card has two effects:&lt;br/&gt;1-The Salvan&amp;egrave;l immediately moves toward the border indicated by the card, and if he meets a player... He immediately gains an extra turn!&lt;br/&gt;2-The player indicated by the card plays his turn... And if he meets the Salvan&amp;egrave;l... He plays again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every turn, players can use one of these moves:&lt;br/&gt;1-Spin:choose a tile and rotate it in any direction you like&lt;br/&gt;2-Puff of Wind: move one or more tiles of a horizontal or vertical line&lt;br/&gt;3-Jump: move your token from the tile where it is to another one next to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who jumps out of any tile on the side of his colour wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
