			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge is the first in a series of handheld ports of the successful NES games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is mostly the same as other entries in the franchise.  Players attempt to destroy 8 robot masters, then defeat Dr. Wily himself.  As each boss is destroyed, its special attack is gained for use against future enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version includes 4 bosses from the NES Mega Man 1 and 4 from Mega Man 2.  It begins the tradition in the handheld series of giving the player only 4 stages to choose from at the start, followed by an intermediate stage, then the next 4.  This design was picked up in later main series Mega Man games, starting with 7.  The other feature which got its start in this game is the inclusion of a new rival boss, Enker, not found in the originals.  Dr. Wily's Revenge is more abbreviated than most, since only the first 4 bosses have complete stages, but these are also new stage designs, not copies of the NES version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
