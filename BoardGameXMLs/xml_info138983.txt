			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sugar Rush Speedway is a cute kart racing game released in 2012 as part of Disney's promotion of &amp;quot;Wreck-It Ralph&amp;quot;, a film which ostensibly takes place inside this arcade game and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in an edible landscape made up of cakes and sweets with a catchy J-Pop soundtrack. The user selects a kart and it's driver which each have their own handling characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two game modes, Championship and Time Trial. Additional karts and tracks can be unlocked by playing the Championship mode and placing in the top three in a race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a similar vein to the Mario Kart series, boxes are strewn across the track. Driving over one of these provides the player with a power-up. These are also candy-themed with names such as the &amp;quot;Sweet-seeker&amp;quot; missile, or the &amp;quot;Cherry Bomb&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant difference from the Mario Kart games is that this is a strictly solo experience with the AI driving the other karts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
