			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining a monk&amp;rsquo;s single-mindedness and intensive physical&lt;br/&gt;devotion with a rogue&amp;rsquo;s guile, wanderlust, and opportunistic&lt;br/&gt;survival skills, and a bard&amp;rsquo;s panache, thespian flair for the dramatic, and impeccable sense of timing, Thief Acrobats marry the arts of thievery and gymnastic acrobatics to make their way in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gifted with the rarest natural ability, which they hone through years of practice, these lithe and cunning artists often find their skill set highly prized by adventuring companies. After all, a party member who can pocket gemstones while handspringing across a dragon&amp;rsquo;s back, whirling daggers as she soars through the air, land soundlessly and melt away into the shadowy recesses, and do it all with flair (and live to tell the tale) is likely to find her services greatly in demand-even if she can, at times, be a bit too eager to &amp;lsquo;borrow&amp;rsquo; others&amp;rsquo; possessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
