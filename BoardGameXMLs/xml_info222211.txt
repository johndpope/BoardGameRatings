							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon and his Marshals: The Peninsular War</name>
									
			<description>The first addition to Napoleon and his Marshals expands the series to include the wars in Spain and Portugal from 1805-1815, with scenarios for 1807-1814 and 1809-1814. The basic set (Napoleon and his Marshals) is required to play. The complete British army and navy for the basic game is added, along with the Spanish army and navy and the Portuguese army. A 20.75 x 16 inch map of Spain, Portugal, Southern France and the adjacent seas is included along with two 88-counter sheets of 0.6&amp;quot; square game counters, printed front and back. Scale is approximately 38 miles per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its parent game, this is a diceless combat system, based on our algorithm for battles in that period. The gameplay is identical to that of Napoleon and his Marshals, with some minor modifications for the scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are the same as for Napoleon and his Marshals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
