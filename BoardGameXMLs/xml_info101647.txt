			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of the new Brainworm Memorial hospital and has to construct room for waiting patients, diagnosis, autopsy and so on. Each room has to be staffed so employees are needed. Each employee has different skill sets and attributes. Nurses need big breasts to entertain the patients (and doctors) while they are waiting but also require other skills which can be trained. Male employees have different liver values and skills which determine how fast and accurate they work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a employee is good enough he can work on his own and doesn't need the player's help anymore. New staff calls for help all the time, so the first days are quite hectic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also possible to hire a bunch of thugs which then beat up some pedestrians and drag them into your hospital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a lot of erotic images (there is as good as no animation in this game) and has a very high learning curve. Even though the player has to deal with imaginary cases this game is more challenging and offers more than many other hospital sims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
