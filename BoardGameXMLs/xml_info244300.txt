			<description>&amp;quot;La b&amp;acirc;tarde&amp;quot; (the bastard one) is a french card game in the same mood as Tarot, coinche, belote, these kind of traditionnal card games.&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays one card, from the same color if possible, otherwise a trump, otherwise any card, and the one with the highest value wins the point. The originality is that you don't win by winning points, you win by announcing how many points you will win, and it can be 0 !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C/C of the beginning of the rulebook : &lt;br/&gt;The Bastard one is a thrilling and mysterious card game.&lt;br/&gt;Some  claim  that  a  primitive  version  originated  in  the  North  of India and arrived in Venice via Asia Minor, from where it spread through Europe. It is also told that it owes its name to the illegitimate  daughter  of  a  Syldavian  prince  who  introduced  to  his father&amp;rsquo;s court.&lt;br/&gt;Others  maintain  that  three  Portuguese  sailors  brought  it  back from much further afield. &lt;br/&gt;But nothing is less sure...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, there are no teams, it is every man for himself. &lt;br/&gt;3 to 8 players can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw  to  designate  the  dealer  (highest  card).  Next  round  the  dealer  shifts clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal the cards face down, one by one.&lt;br/&gt;A  &amp;ldquo;rubber&amp;rdquo;  is  a  set  of  games  made  up  of  several  &amp;ldquo;hands&amp;rdquo;  all  dealt  in  the same way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After  each  hand  is  dealt,  the  players  look  at  their  cards  and  announce in advance the number of &amp;ldquo;tricks&amp;rdquo; which they think they will win. This is called &amp;ldquo;bidding&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;In this game you never pass. Each player bids on each round. &lt;br/&gt;The  bidding  system  leads  all  the  players  to  agree  on  what  &amp;ldquo;suit&amp;rdquo;  is  the &amp;ldquo;trump&amp;rdquo;, if any. &lt;br/&gt;There  are  6  possibilities:  all  cards  are  trumps,  spades  are  trumps,  hearts are  trumps,  diamonds  are  trumps,  clubs  are  trumps  &amp;ndash;  or  there  are  no trumps.&lt;br/&gt;When playing with trumps the order of the cards is different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
