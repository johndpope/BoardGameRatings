			<description>Lost in the sea or hidden on the islands, many pirates have left their spoils there. Be smart, plan your route wisely and find their treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 3 tiles face up in front of them and on his turn must place one of his tile to keep the treasure map going however it must fit with the rest of the tiles already placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You gain 1 coin every time you place a tile and then you draw a new tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some tiles have special power:&lt;br/&gt;Treasure chest - allows you to gain 1 extra coin by number of tiles it touches when you place it&lt;br/&gt;Hurricane - allows you to switch between players (you included) as many tiles as your tile touches on the board.&lt;br/&gt;Parrot - allows you to became the captain. The captain can't get attacked and chooses in case of equality at end game who wins.&lt;br/&gt;Fight - allows you to steal from another player (except the captain) as many coins as your tile touches other tiles on the board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If during your turn you can't play one of your tiles, you can discard the last tile and so on by paying 1 coin for each tile you discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when there is no more tiles to draw after playing one. &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one with the most gold at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
