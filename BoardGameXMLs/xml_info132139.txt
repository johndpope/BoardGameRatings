							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Magic Kingdom After Bedtime</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Magic Kingdom After Bedtime is about children who stumble onto a magical land. There, they gain enough confidence to defeat both the threats to the land and the problems they face in the real world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Magic Kingdom After Bedtime is a game inspired by those books where a group of children find their way to a magical land that they must save. As in the best of those books, the events in the magical land allow them to learn things about themselves and grow more confident than they could have in the mundane world. The magical land is created as a group effort before play starts. This makes preparation a little more intensive, but sets a stage that everybody is happy with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
