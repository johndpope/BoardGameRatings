							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Good Fortune</name>
									
			<description>Good Fortune is a fast-paced, light tabletop game themed around life's lucky breaks. It is suitable for families, festive gatherings, newcomers to board games, and casual gamers.&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a modular board made up of tiles, which are arranged in a random combination. Players draw fortune cards with different combination of symbols, which they can choose to keep or swap for new ones. Based on the fortune cards in their hand, players take turns to place game tokens on the board and claim the fortunes on the corresponding cards. Most often, players have multiple board locations available and can choose their tactic based on the fortunes they most wish to claim and on the combinations that yield the highest number of points. The goal of the game is to collect the highest number of points by claiming as many fortunes with the player's lucky symbol as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
