			<description>From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game room is empty. It's as if no one had been there earlier. The glasses and plates are gone, the sports magazines are neatly arranged on the coffee table. The giant screen plasma TV is silent. It is spooky. What to do? you ask yourself. Search for them? Just wait and see if they come back? Scram out of there and forget the whole thing? That's when the screams begin-horrifying screams and loud angry shouts. As a powerful student athlete, every choice you make sets the course for your track career and your life. There are people who'd like to see you win, and people who'd do anything to keep you from it. And then there are people who believe that athletes should do anything to win- even if it means breaking the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
