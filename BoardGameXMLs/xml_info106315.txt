							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infinite Power Expandable Card Game Starter</name>
									
			<description>Infinite Power ECG is a comic book themed combat card game. Challenge your friend for a one on one battle or jump right into a huge multi-player slobberknocker! All of these things and more are possible with the Infinite Power Expandable card game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose an archetype or mix and match cards to create your own super. You will choose Attack and Defense Powers for your super as well as Enhancements to make those Powers more intense. There are also NOW! cards which allow you to break in and cause an immediate game effect. When you want to slow your opponents down, you can play Limitation cards on their Powers to hinder them or remove them completely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have dominated the competition and you're the only super left standing, you win! Knock them out or kill them, its up to you. Either way, the last one standing wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are currently 4 decks built around classic comic book archetypes; Blaster, Gadget, Powerhouse, &amp;amp; Psionic.&lt;br/&gt;The starter comes with two pre-constructed archetype decks; the heavy hitting Powerhouse and the all-around Blaster. More archetypes are in development all the time, this allows the Infinite Power world to keep growing and new combinations of cards to be combined to create new play experiences!&lt;br/&gt;These decks can also be mixed and matched to make a unique deck as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Types&lt;br/&gt;Attack cards combine damage and conditions to break down your opponent(s).&lt;br/&gt;Defense cards protect you from damage and effects as well as putting you into various states, such as Intangible and Invisible.&lt;br/&gt;Enhancement cards are attached to your Attacks &amp;amp; Defenses to enhance them.&lt;br/&gt;NOW! cards are instant effects that free you from conditions or change the flow of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Limitation cards are attached to Opponents' Attacks &amp;amp; Defenses to slow them down or give them difficult choices to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Custom decks are made of 60 cards, with no more than 3 copies of any one card and no more than 15 cards of any of the above types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you buy a deck, you get a full 60 cards (3 copies of 20 unique cards).&lt;br/&gt;We plan to release new decks regularly and we have some other card types we will add to the game as well as we continue to grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Components:&lt;br/&gt;1 eight-sided die&lt;br/&gt;16 Power Counters&lt;br/&gt;22 double sided Condition Cards&lt;br/&gt;2 Turn Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
