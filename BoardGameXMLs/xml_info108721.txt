			<description>Author's comment:&lt;br/&gt;The Sun Never Sets is a quasi-historical supernatural-conspiracy-espionage game set primarily in the nineteenth century and the fourteenth century BC, with stopovers at intervals throughout the intervening three millenia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a &amp;ldquo;24-Hour RPG&amp;rdquo;, meaning that it was designed in (more or less) one 24 hour period. I started typing at 7pm on Sunday April 1st 27, and finished at 9.5pm on Monday April 2nd. The idea had been kicking about in my head for a while before then, but I was in a tapas bar at the time, so I&amp;rsquo;m not counting it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because it was produced under an artificial time constraint, this game has not been playtested fully, or indeed at all. The core mechanics, however, are simple enough not to need more than minor tweaking. The Flashback mechanics are more complex, and would benefit from more work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
