			<description>&amp;ldquo;Small Battle on the Roof&amp;rdquo; is a board game designed for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players command their own cat fighters to eat up their opponent&amp;rsquo;s food. The game board shows a roof of some warehouse.  The roof tiles may be shattered when cats move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player may take maximum 2 actions in his/her turn. Players take a turn alternately. During his/her turn, the player&amp;rsquo;s option is basically movement, but a turn player can use a special power called &amp;ldquo;Cat Special.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was issued as a &amp;ldquo;demonstration version&amp;rdquo; at Essen 2012.
