			<description>&amp;quot;Nonsense - the hilarious game of big government spending&amp;quot; board game created by A. Berkeley Compton, approved by Loren Dunton and published by Fair-Games, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation: each player receives $76,960,300.00, separate 4 DEEDS from card decks, place &amp;quot;directive cards&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;white house clemency cards&amp;quot; in a single pile, face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play: low roller of dice shuffles &amp;quot;directive cards&amp;quot; deck, has player to the right cut the deck and then deals the first 12 cards face up around the field, starting at space 1. Dealer also places the next 6 cards from the deck face down near the playing field. These are bonus cards and are drawn from if the instructions on the directive card for that turn say to dra2 a bonus card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player to the right of dealer starts play and rolls dice to determine which numbered space to advance to and which corresponding &amp;quot;directive card&amp;quot; instructions are to be followed for that turn. Any directive card that says it is to be held by a player is removed from the playing field when the player lands on that space. Any player landing at a space with no directive card next to it does nothing more for that turn. After each person has played, an &amp;quot;administration&amp;quot; is completed, and a new &amp;quot;administration&amp;quot; starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of game: players roll dice, take cards, follow directions and compete to be the first to declare bankruptcy by spending all their money and earn the title &amp;quot;Certified deficit spender&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
