							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Golotha</name>
									
			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golotha is the principal settlement of the Kingdom of Rethem and the political heir to the infamous Theocracy of Tekhos. Strategically located at the mouth of the River Thard, the city was founded in the fourth century on ground reclaimed from a misty swamp. It is still plagued by morning fogs. Regional headquarters of the terrible Morgathian Church and its mysterious crypts, Golotha is a city of secrets and dark places. Its narrow streets are dangerous even during the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is a major expansion of the articles originally published in Cities of H&amp;acirc;rn and Son of Cities. It is much larger, contains many additional sites with interior plans and a new 2 page local map showing the surrounding areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
