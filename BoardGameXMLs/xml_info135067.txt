			<description>As 'Hamtaro' enters the Clubhouse, Boss is in need of help. He asks you for a name and once you give him it, he tells you that he needs all the ham-hams back at the Clubhouse. Before you are to go out and look for them, he teaches you four basic Ham-Chat words, and scribbles down some others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are then sent on your merry way in search of the hamsters. You are able to explore several locations in which two to three ham-hams are in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player (Hamtaro) is controlled by the D-pad, and holding down the B button allows the player to run. Pressing A will open a dialogue box with different Ham-chat words depending on context. For instance, standing next to a sunflower seed and selecting &amp;quot;hif-hif&amp;quot; will pick up the seed, while standing next to an NPC and selecting &amp;quot;Hamha&amp;quot; will open a dialogue with the character. Different options will yield different outcomes, rolling (Tack-Q) into NPCs will usually elicit a negative response. Objects in the world can be interacted with, like climbing trees and pulling drawers open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
