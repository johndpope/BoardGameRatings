							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War for Atlantis</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;One player takes the side of the Atlanteans. The other player takes command of the combined Armies of the Five Foes of Atlantis.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a hex map. The continent of Atlantism containing the main city of Atlantis, is at the center of the map, surrounded by water. A thin border of land around the outer edges of the map represents the homelands of the enemies: The Barbarians, Greeks, Egyptians, Africans, and Lemurians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each enemy has a unique set of forces. Units are rated for power and movement. Some units are amphibious, some cannot leave the water, and others may fly. Mage and Priest units have magic powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: The Atlanteans are victorious if they destroy their enemies completely. The Five Foes win if they destroy all the Atlanteans or a have a spellcaster cast the cataclysm spell in the Temple of Posideon. The Atlanteans win a minor victory if there is no winner after 20 turns.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
