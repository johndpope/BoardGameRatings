			<description>The game &amp;quot;Farbstrakt&amp;quot; was included in Spielbox 1/91 as part of the &amp;quot;Spiel im Heft/Game in the zine&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of 2 halves of 5x10 grids, which must be layed together so that at least 2 spaces connect the two halves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 100 spaces on the board are coloured in one of 5 different colours and show numbers from 0-9. 5 playing pieces in these 5 colours is the only material that is needed for this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a race between these 5 pieces. The players secretly write down a ranking list before the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can move any playing piece, and the distance a piece can move is determined by the numbers on the board, where all 5 pieces are standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the game is not the player who reaches the finish line with a playing piece first, but the one who has predicted the ranking of the race the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
