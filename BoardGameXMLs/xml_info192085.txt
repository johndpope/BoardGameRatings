							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Squeak, Squawk, Grunt, Whistle: the Animal Soundtrack Bingo Game</name>
									
			<description>Squeak, Squawk, Grunt, Whistle is a bingo derivative that teaches about wild animals and their sounds.  Each player gets a 3x3 board with pictures of various wild animals.  A cassette tape is played.  When players hear the sound of an animal on their card, they cover it with a marker.  The first player to cover all of his or her animals wins.  In order to make the game replayable, players may fast forward the tape to at random place to change the sequence of animal sounds. A list of the order of sounds is included so winners can be checked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other side of the tape identifies all the sounds so that players may learn to identify them before playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
