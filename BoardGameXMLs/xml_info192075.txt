							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlemind: A Game of Battle Strategy</name>
									
			<description>Battlemind is a medieval-themed battle strategy game in which two players, each with 10 character cards, try to capture/kill the other player's King. Inspired by the game from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels (HBO's Game of Thrones is based on this series), Battlemind combines the strategic elements of Chess, Stratego, and Blitzkrieg to create a an easy to learn but hard to master game with infinite replayability. This game is for anyone who loves strategy games - not just fans of the books!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes Battlemind special? Instead of being played like a typical card game (dealing/drawing), it is played more like a board game, with players setting up a &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; made of terrain cards and moving character cards across them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like chess, each character card has a certain number of spaces in which it can move. But that's where the similarities end. Each character has a strength value (1-8) which dictates whether it can capture/kill another character as well as certain advantages and disadvantages over other characters. From the lowly Rabble (rabble is like an angry mob) to the powerful Dragon, every unit has a purpose.  How you use them is up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, each terrain type can benefit or hinder your character. Use terrain to slow your enemy down, protect your fortress, and even hide from Dragons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, how you set up your terrain, arrange your army, and advance your units will determine whether you will be the victor or the vanquished. You'll laugh at your opponent when he places a crucial unit on his front line that you are able to capture easily, but will be crushed when that same placement allows him to capture your dragon on his first move in the next game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you create a defensive stronghold and make your advesary come to you?  Or will you storm the front lines in hopes of catching your opponent off guard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's your decision.  The fate of the Kingdom rests on your shoulders. Fight for honor.  Fight for glory.  But remember: in the game of Battlemind, every move can mean victory or crushing defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
