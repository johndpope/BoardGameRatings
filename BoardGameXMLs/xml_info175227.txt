			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 48 inch by 30 inch, floor plan of a set of Storage Rooms, with Hex, Square and No overlay, and a 360 degree view of the inside of one of the rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seems like a waste of time to watch dead cargo. It ain&amp;rsquo;t moving anywhere.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Last words of a storage bay security guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storage Bay is a six room map of a large storage bay suitable for use in space as part of a space ship or space station. It can also be used as a storage warehouse on a planet, asteroid, or moon&amp;rsquo;s surface. The product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of one of the storage rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storage Bay is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction. Its maze-like construction also supports a horror game with the sections slowly being sealed by a ship AI's security measure to prevent contamination from alien life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Cargo: A collector of biological materials contracted a mercenary group to kill creatures on a life world and bring them back to him. Most of the dead cargo is harmless since most dead creatures stay that way. However, one of the creatures that the mercenary group killed is able to regenerate with even a cell left of its body into a full copy of itself in five standard hours. During the initial trip back to the collector&amp;rsquo;s laboratory, everything goes as planned. But after five hours, security guards are slain and the ship&amp;rsquo;s AI starts sealing storage bay rooms where it detects living alien bio signatures. But these security measures aren&amp;rsquo;t enough to stop it from moving around the facility. The Player Characters play the mercenary group and have to find a way to kill the alien before it kills everyone on the ship including them. Since it can regenerate with even a single cell alive, they&amp;rsquo;ll need to find a way to completely destroy every cell or try and lure it out an airlock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
