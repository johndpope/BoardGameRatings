			<description>Subtitled 'A Guide to the War of 1812' this booklet covers the 3 year war between Britain and the infant United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The booklet contains historical background, tactics, uniforms, flags, and three sets of miniatures rules. In addition it has 10 land scenarios and 12 naval ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One set of miniatures rules is called Battle Scale (1 figure = 50 men), and the other Small Unit Scale (1 figure = 15 men). The third set of rules covers naval actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaders are handled extremely well in this game. Each leader is rated as one of Brilliant, Efficient, Plodding or Buffoon(!). Ordinary playing cards are used to determine a number of actions each leader may initiate. Cards used include Aces (one action), 2s and 3s (2 and 3 actions, of course) and Jokers (2 actions and reshuffle). A Buffoon's deck has only one &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; card in it, but four aces, while a Brilliant Leader's is the opposite. Thus a small, well-led force can run rings around a much larger, poorly-led one. In the land battles actions affect firing, movement and formation changes; in the naval game they affect firing only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick and fun, as well as being adaptable to other, similar periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
