							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron Tyrants</name>
									
			<description>A Miniatures Game of Massive Robotic Mayhem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Tyrants is a tabletop miniatures game of massive robotic combat. Each player will field a squad of tyrants, giant walking robots armed to the teeth with cannons, rockets, and lasers in an attempt to dominate the battlefield and crush his opponent under his metal heel. Sometimes, victory may mean simply being the last player with tyrants left standing, but a variety of scenarios are provided featuring a range of victory conditions so that every game is a completely different experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full campaign is also included. The campaign will have players fighting for one of three factions over control of Gateworld Atropos and the future of the Allyrian Sector.  Rules are included for the variety of environs on the gateworld such that the gateworld's weather and conditons bring the battlefield to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is d10-based and features several areas of resource management leading players to balance risks versus rewards with nearly every decision on the table. The key behind this is the Overload mechanic in which a tyrant may be pushed well beyond its normal capabilities but at great risk to both the machine and the pilot. Players also have a limited supply of Tactics Dice which are used both in determining initiative and in activating special abilities provided by unique commanders. Gameplay is filled with difficult decisions in which every choice has a consequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was intended to be played on a tabletop filled with terrain but hexmaps may also be used without issue. All game measurements are made from a 1-inch round base so units may be represented by any appropriate miniature. In the very near future we will be releasing printable miniatures for each tyrant in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game about tough choices. It's a game about resource management. Most importantly, it's a game about giant robots blasting the hell out of each other across the torn landscape of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
