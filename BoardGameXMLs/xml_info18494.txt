			<description>OCHO VAMPIROS is a strategic, double-sided card game based on the urban myth of border-crossing Mexican vampires (Vampiros). One side of each card represents a Street or City Park; the opposite side of each card represents a Room -- Bedroom, Art Gallery or Gymnasium are examples. This represents players&amp;rsquo; movement along dark city streets and into and out of unlocked buildings. Players DO NOT conceal their cards, and points are accumulated by playing &amp;quot;VAMPIRO&amp;quot; (vampire) cards atop the cards on an &amp;quot;In-Play&amp;quot; pile. Each time any player places a &amp;quot;DOOR&amp;quot; card on the In-Play Pile, all cards are &amp;quot;flipped,&amp;quot; revealing the cards&amp;rsquo; opposite side. Play is fast-paced. A good memory will benefit play. OCHO VAMPIROS is best as a strategy game when played with four or six players in teams of two, working in conjunction to accumulate points. Cards are art-quality and sold online and through art galleries Only one deck is required for play; however, experts add additional decks to increase strategy options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
