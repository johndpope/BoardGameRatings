			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Keep is an old stone tower located in the hills a few miles from Talrinel, in a wilderness area where few people go.  It was built by a spell-casting member of the aristocracy, but fell into ruin long ago&amp;mdash;legend has it, after the lord of the castle went into an unexplained rage and murdered his entire household.  It is now said to be haunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2nd - 3rd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
