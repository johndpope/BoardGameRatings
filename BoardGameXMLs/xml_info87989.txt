			<description>From PDF Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Web Enhancement for Song and Silence: A Guidebook to Bards and Rogues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The judicious use of bardic abilities can help an adventuring group in a variety of ways. Bardic knowledge can provide background information for an area or a situation, offer clues to a mystery, serve as a vehicle for the Dungeon Master (DM) to introduce new concepts, and even help the canny DM determine what areas of the campaign world interest players most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bardic music can bolster an adventuring party&amp;rsquo;s combat capabilities, counter spells, and pave the way for gathering information, conducting investigations, and a host of other noncombat situations. In addition, the bard&amp;rsquo;s normally high Charisma helps him make friends and gain new allies almost everywhere he goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your players aren&amp;rsquo;t accustomed to using bardic abilities to their fullest, it may help to send the characters on an adventure that offers several opportunities for using these talents. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short scenario that demonstrates how bardic abilities can enhance a group&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS web enhancement showcases bardic abilities (particularly bardic knowledge) and features a spymaster NPC, as well as several of the sample traps listed in Song and Silence: A Guidebook to Bards and Rogues. It is designed for four characters of 6th to 7th level. The party should include at least one bard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
