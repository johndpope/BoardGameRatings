			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the past that never was. OGL Ancients is a role-playing game set in a world long past, where Greek heroes do battle with hideous monsters and artificers work mechanical miracles, while priests petition the Gods for their divine intervention. Witches weave spells in secret glades under the full moon and the spirits of the dead really do revisit the living and wicked spectres lurk in the pestilent places of the earth. This is an environment that many will not have ventured into before. Instead of taverns, castles and dungeons, the setting is one of great temples, amphitheatres, pyramids and hanging gardens, where wise or corrupt kings rule over their sprawling empires and wars are fought for the hand of one beautiful queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set before the rise of the Roman Empire, OGL Ancients focuses on the two most influential civilisations of the ancient world, the Egyptians and the Greeks. Drawing upon historical depictions of weapons, armour, equipment and societal structure of other, more fantastical and mythical elements, such as the wrangling of the Gods and the emergence of colossal monsters in keeping with the strong fantasy of this heroic golden age of myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have ever wished to sail with Jason on the Argo, to dare the labyrinth in the footsteps of Theseus or to twist men's bodies into the shapes of swine like Circe; if you would besiege the white walls of Troy or fly amid the clouds on winged sandals. If you would learn the secrets buried in the hearts of the pyramids meet with the witches on lonely mountains then venture forth as something greater than the Iliad is born...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of OGL Ancients is one where true heroes are remembered forever and where a man favoured by the Gods can rise from the humblest of beginnings to command the world.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
