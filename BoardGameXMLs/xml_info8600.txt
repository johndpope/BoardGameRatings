			<description>Auf und Ab is essentially a trick-taking game. The players take turns playing cards on the table according to certain rules until eventually one of them gets the cards. In Auf und Ab, however, the most important thing is not to win tricks but to get rid of your cards as quickly as possible. Like some other such modern card games, you can also play more than one card at a time and may also get more than one opportunity to play per round. The sudden change of play between an UP and a DOWN round, however, can significantly affect the strength of your hand and gives the game its special flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
