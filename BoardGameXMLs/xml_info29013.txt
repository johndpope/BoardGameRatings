			<description>Rahala (Explorers)is a quiz board-game for the age of 15 and above. It covers the history of the Arab World from the 20th Century B.C. until the end of the 20th Century A.D.. The game divides this history into six eras, and the spirit of each historic era is captured thematically through its questions and graphical representation. Players use cards to ask each other History and Open Questions, and then use playing pieces to journey along paths of squares in a labyrinth.  Era tokens mark the completion of travel over a certain era. The objective is to amass Points of Knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through its History Questions, Rahala aims to highlight the multifaceted makeup of the Arab civilization. The questions comprise a mix of topics presented in a playful manner while revealing the widely spread geographic boundaries of the Arab World along with its people, religions, minorities, scientific discoveries,cultural milieus, and interaction with other civilizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the history element, the game includes Open Questions that allow for discussions among the players over highly challenging topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
