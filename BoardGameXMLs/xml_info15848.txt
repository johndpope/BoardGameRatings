			<description>Before the game starts each player gets four bet markers, one of each color (red, orange, purple and blue), Each pig is made up of eight pieces and these are all placed in the bank. &lt;br/&gt;When it's a players turn he spins the spinner on the game board. The game board consists of a purple field in the middle and 12 other fields around it. The 12 other fields are 6 orange, 3 blue and 3 red - all marked with a number from one to three. While the spinner spins all players put down a marker that match the color of the field they believe the spinner will stop on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players who guessed the right color receives from the bank one, two or three pieces of the pig - the number of pieces being determined by the number marked on the actual field the spinner stopped on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who first gets a whole pig, i.e. gets all 8 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
