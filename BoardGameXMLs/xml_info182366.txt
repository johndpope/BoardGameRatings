							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horoskop: Ein astrologisches Spiel</name>
									
			<description>This game is about astrology. The central game board shows an astrological solar system. The board is 12 sectors for the 12 star signs. There are 7 concentric rings (wire rings in their hollows), one for each celestial body. The rings are Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Each ring has a colored bead for the celestial body itself and red (favorable effect) and black (unfavorable effects).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has an individual board with 2 concentric circles. They show also the 12 star sign sectors, written at the edge of the big circle. In the inner circle the sectors are numbered with 1 to 12. This numbers are called houses, which represent astrological aspects like personality, &amp;quot;possession and wealth&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;adventure, erotic&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The inner circle has 5 concentric rings where special marker placed at the beginning on each field of the middle ring one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the begin of the game the inner circle is positioned by random (special dice rolling) and stays then till the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Also the position of the rings on the central board are random turned at the beginning as described in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player chooses a house (number) with as much red and colored beads in the equivalent sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dependent on the number each player has another star sector.&lt;br/&gt;Each round the sun ring is rotated by 1 (Counter clock) and for the other circles 2 dice are rolled. 1 dice shows which circle is rotated and the second die shows how much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many dice rolls are possible for the actual player is calculated out of the sum of red plus colored pearls minus black pearls in his star sign sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is allowed to roll the dice less than allowed.&lt;br/&gt;The players look at the Pearl of the actual moved circle in the sector relevant for them. If the pearl is red or colored he moves the marker on his board 1 ring to the edge otherwise (black) 1 ring to the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Ends after a preset sun moves (e.g. 1,5 rounds). The player who has most of his marks on the outer ring wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow to read the astrological result for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
