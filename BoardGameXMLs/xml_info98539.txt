			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil forces of Marania attacked the earth. The blue planet was not prepared for a cosmic raid and therefore had to surrender. All soldiers were taken as prisoners .... ALL THE SOLDIERS? Well of course they could not get hold of Captain Cosmose, Hero of Techmania and defeater of the evil Lord Caraz (remember the game TECH by Gainstar)... Captain Cosmose escaped and now they are on their way to a free world, just him and his best friend Sycho, the laser gun. Will they succeed, will they be able to save the world? It is all up to you. You have been chosen to be in control!!!!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Legion Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Smooth horizontal scrolling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4 long levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Digitised sound effects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     High quality graphics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
