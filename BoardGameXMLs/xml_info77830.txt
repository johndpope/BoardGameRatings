			<description>Star Trek: Conquest is a video game set in the Star Trek universe. The game features both turn-based strategy and real time strategy gameplay. It was developed by Scottish studio 4J Studios, which previously developed Star Trek: Encounters, and was published by Bethesda Softworks for the PlayStation 2 and Wii.&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the Star Trek: The Next Generation era, with players able to choose six groups and races: Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Breen, Cardassian and Dominion. These races are the main combatants of the Dominion War featured in Deep Space Nine...&lt;br/&gt;Star Trek: Conquest is played in turns. Each turn allows the player to purchase facilities or ships, construct Special Weapons or commission an Admiral. Fleets can move between friendly and attack enemy systems as well, but if players engage in combat, they must resolve it immediately.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to conquer the galaxy by eliminating all enemies by taking their Home World...&lt;br/&gt;Skirmish mode allows players to set-up battles without playing the campaign. Victory is achieved by destroying all of the opponent's ships. Some options will be unavailable until unlocked through the Campaign-mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star Trek: Conquest,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
