And guess what... they are after the same treasures as you. You must explore the islands, battle your opponents, and pilfer their ships and homes in an effort to become the wealthiest Pirate around. Only then will you get the respect you so rightly deserve.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equipment&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 differently colored opaque stashes of Icehouse pieces which will be used to create the Treasure Islands&lt;br/&gt;     1 additional stash of Icehouse pieces per player (each of a unique color)&lt;br/&gt;     1 postcard (or similarly sized object) per player which will be used as each players Home Islands&lt;br/&gt;     A few chits or markers of some sort to indicate damage on the ships&lt;br/&gt;     A flat (preferably unobstructed) playing area of any shape that is at least 30 inches in diameter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;Collect more then your share of the Treasure in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ice Pirates&lt;/i&gt; was entered in the Icehouse Game Design Competition of Autumn 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://icehousegames.com/contest/icedes-5/Ice_Pirates/IcePirates.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;complete rules&lt;/a&gt; are available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
