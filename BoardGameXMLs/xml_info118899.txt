							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ikki Tousen: Xross Impact</name>
									
			<description>This video game is based on the manga series Ikki Tousen (一騎当千 Ikkitōsen, lit. &amp;quot;Strength of a Thousand&amp;quot;), known in North America as Battle Vixens, written and illustrated by Yuji Shiozaki and based on the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The manga series revolves around an all-out turf war in the Kanto region of Japan where fighters known as Tōshi (闘士), meaning &amp;quot;fighting soldier,&amp;quot; from seven schools battle for supremacy. The story centers on Hakufu Sonsaku, a fighter who transfers to Nanyo Academy, one of the seven schools involved in the turf war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This third video game in the series is based on the Xtreme Xecutor anime, called Ikki Tousen: Xross Impact (一騎当千 XROSS IMPACT Ikkitōsen Kurosu Inpakuto). It features a new character named Ato along with the return of Ukitsu as a playable character, and Koudai Chinkyu, Yojo Bashoku, Kyocho, and Chutatsu Shibai are added as playable characters. The game adds a &amp;quot;Super Arts&amp;quot; bar, tag-team battles and combos, and the addition of the alternate striker system. The gameplay was also revamped to include an aerial pursuit rave and a Finishing Screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battle Vixens&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
