			<description>Collect the most impressive animals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Menagerie is a quick and fun card game for 2-4 players. Build the most impressive collection of animals while trying to not let your opponents take advantage of your moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Menagerie you collect cards to build animals and collect animals to build collections. But when you pick cards that you can't use, you may have to give them to another player. Menagerie is quick to learn, quick to play and more fun than a barrel of monkeys!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
