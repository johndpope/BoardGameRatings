			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic game of floating fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add rabbits to the floating figure to test Floatini's powers to their limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Great Floatini is famed throughout the world for his amazing magical powers.  Aided only by his son Teeny Floatini's small balloon, the Great Floatini is able to levitate his wife, Floatina, before your very eyes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once this amazing magical feat has been achieved it is your job to test the Great Floatini's powers to their limit by adding rabbit after rabbit to his wife's floating figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be careful -- one rabbit too many and not even The Great Floatini can cope!  The burden of one bunny too many will send the rabbits, Floatina and even Floatini's top hat crashing to the floor.  A disastrous end to a fabulous performance, that will result in the player responsible losing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
