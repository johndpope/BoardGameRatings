			<description>From the designer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sinyavino Offensive covers the &amp;quot;crossfire&amp;quot; offensive conducted by the Soviet forces in August, 1942. Crossfire, for it was a daring offensive from two opposite directions focused on a single objective: to free the isolated forces and people of Leningrad before the Germans conducted their own operation to seize the city! The bottleneck area held by German forces was no more than a few miles wide and defended by no more than three divisions. From the East, the Soviets would toss a total of 14 divisions and 100 tanks to smash the Nazi. From the West, across the Neva River, another 2-3 divisions and a tank brigade would conduct an amphibious assault. The battle would last over 30 days and desperate for both sides. At first, Red forces seriously broke through, forcing Hitler to cancel his own offensive to seize Leningrad and divert General Mainstein's forces to save the impending disaster. The battle was also the debut for Germany's new AFV, the Tiger tank!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 280 counters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 11 page rules&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 2 page Player aid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
