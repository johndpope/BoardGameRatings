			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Incredible discoveries of ancient, long-buried Star League records have uncovered dozens of BattleMech and vehicle designs thought lost to antiquity. Re-tooled for the 31st century, these blueprints have produced the latest and most effective weapons in the Inner Sphere's life-or-death struggle against the invading Clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058 provides illustrations, descriptions and game statistics for these classic units and for new Inner Sphere and Clan BattleMechs, including modular BattleMech designs featured in full color. Technical Readout: 3058 also offers a host of tanks, hovercraft, and other armored vehicles upgraded with the latest weapons and equipment.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this might appear similar to the Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade, the 3058 Upgrade is a companion book, not a replacement. This original book covers new Mechs and vehicles generated between 3056 and 3058; the 3058 Upgrade expands the detail on these mechs up to 3070, adds personality entries, many new Mechs, new sections on Battle Armour and generally provides new material for collectors and gamers. This entry doesn't create a precedent, as BGG already has entries for the Technical Readout: 3050 and the 3050 Upgrade, which are the same system of FASA original Tech Readout with expanded, upgraded companion volume issued as an Upgrade by Fanpro later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
