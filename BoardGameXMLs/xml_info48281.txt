			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An epic adventure includes the revised Desert of Desolation series plus totally new adventures within Raurin, a desert wilderness set in the fabulous Forgotten Realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep blue mists of the night swirl over the sands of Raurin, the incomparable Desert Of Dust. As the cool night air drains the heat from the sand, you and your friends huddle around your campfire, glancing nervously at the giant pyramid in the distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gradually, the winds change direction, bearing a thin streak of white mist toward you from the pyramid. It swirls and takes shape as a faceless man dressed in ancient robes and an ornate head-piece; moonlight shining through his ghostly body and robes, he lifts his arms toward the pyramid and speaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was magic that conveyed you all to Bralizar, and an ancient map that guided you through the pass in The Dustwall. But it was, after all, the tales that finally brought you to this place &amp;mdash; tales of endless wealth, of spirit-guarded pyramids, of crystalline obelisks, of gemstones with mysterious properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, as the haunted voice of the spectre before you begins his tale, you wonder if the treasure and the quest are worth the price . . . perhaps your very lives. Are you really the heroes of the prophecies, those who will overcome the foretold tests, and those for whom the treasure awaits? It is time to search your hearts before you venture further into the Desert of Desolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
