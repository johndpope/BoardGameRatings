							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Misari Tribesmen (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human are by far the most numerous and widespread of all the races on the Known Lands, having spread to every corner and manifesting in all different shapes, sizes, and cultures. Among the ranks of mankind, however, one group stands alone: the Misari tribesmen of the Misland Republics. Long believed to be descended from giants, the Misari arrived in the Known Lands from a distant archipelago centuries ago and have made their home in the deadliest jungles of the Mislands ever since, carving their existence from one of the most dangerous wildernesses known to exist, and that was before the Darkfall. Even in the northernmost corners of the mainland, the ferocity and the prowess of the Misari is well known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of the Aden Gazette presents the racial profile of the Misari Tribesmen, and all rules necessary to play one of these fierce, dauntless people in any Pathfinder campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
