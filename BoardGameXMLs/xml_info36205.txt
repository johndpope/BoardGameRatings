							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fairy Circle Ring</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;It is Spring Equinox in the Sylvan woods. The little people, also referred to as Fairies, or Fey have gathered to celebrate. After feasting, storytelling, gossiping, and singing they gather around the Fairy circle ring to play a game they call the Dance of Eights. The fairies dance in groups until they finally form a perfect circle of eight dancers. The winners get laurel leaves and an extra helping of Pixie dust on their elderberries.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to build a &amp;ldquo;ring&amp;rdquo;, or hand of eight cards, composed of a specified mix of dancers according to their gender, size, alignment, and Earth element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
