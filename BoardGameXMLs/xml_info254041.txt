			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cesspits, Cholera and Conflict takes place on the evening of September 7, 1854 at Vestry Hall in Soho, Greater London. You are a member of a special emergency response committee of the local Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor of St. James Parish, who have convened to respond to the deadly outbreak of Cholera that has claimed the lives of more than 500 parish residents over the preceding eight days. Historically, the outcome of this meeting was the decision to remove the pump handle from a contaminated neighborhood pump on Broad Street. This decision and the events leading up to it are considered a defining moment in the development of modern approaches to public health, epidemiology and municipal waste management. This role play is designed to highlight various aspects of the historical debate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
