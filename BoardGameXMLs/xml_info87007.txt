							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jhardwyn</name>
									
			<description>From Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fractured people, the jhardwyn are both much less and much more than other races. The jhardwyn are an amalgamation of myriad races, possessed of matchless potential. They have lost the cultural building abilities available to most races, forced to constantly wander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jhardwyn are the result of a cataclysmic fusion of a wide range of planar races. This event imbued the jhardwyn with a deep well of untapped potential, while consuming their civilization. So great is this power that the close proximity of jhardwyn to one another quickly consumes them. Even the countless worlds yearn for the power within the jhardwyn, consuming the essence of any jhardwyn who ceases to travel. Unable to plant the seeds of a new culture, the jhardwyn are perpetual travelers, forever visitors among other races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, the jhardwyn are an optimistic people, viewing their current misfortune as a step on the path to becoming something greater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
