							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Civil War Rules for an Army Level wargame with 2mm or 6mm miniatures</name>
									
			<description>ACW does not use a turn sequence. It has a &amp;ldquo;variable length bound&amp;rdquo; instead of fixed turns.&lt;br/&gt;ACW uses an order system. Each command -brigade, division and corps - operates under orders. Orders should contain reference to a ground feature or specific enemy force. They may not be conditional or contain the word &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;A Change of Situation (COS) may be enemy forces appear, you are fired upon, you receive a message etc. COS happen at every level, so a COS for a brigade is also a COS for every higher level formation. The rules list 13 kinds of COS and provide for each a set of possible responses. Responses include sending a message, taking defensive action, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Movement is simultaneous. There is no &amp;ldquo;movement phase.&amp;rdquo; Players simply begin acting on orders until a COS occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very interesting set of rules. There are major &amp;ldquo;gray areas&amp;rdquo; but I guess given the nature of the rules that is to be expected. They are clearly meant to be more of a skeleton. For example, they do not spell out if you remove strips or just track casualties on a roster. They refer to many events but do not spell out how they are to be handled - that is left up to the ruling of an umpire or to be worked out between the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are especially tempting for playing big battles in small spaces. At 22 cm to the mile, Gettysburg would fit on a 6x6 table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
