Each player has 12 game piece in his own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginin in each turn, each player places a stone from the reserve to any empty space on the board which is not adjacent (orthogonal) to a friendly stone. If a player cannot drop more stones, he must pass. This continues until all stones are placed on the board, or no more stones can be placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, in each turn, each player moves a stone to an empty adjacent (orthogonal) cell. If he is able to make 3 in a rows (not more or less) he may capture one enemy stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who capture all of his opponents stones wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yote is a traditional African capturing game in the Checkers family. It's played on a 5x6 board with 12 pieces per player and no standard setup, instead the players take turns placing their stones. Captures are made by jumping.
