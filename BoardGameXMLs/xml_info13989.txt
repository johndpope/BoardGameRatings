			<description>Mad About Movies! is a roll and move trivia game with a Hollywood movie theme. Players answer questions in five categories as they move around the game board, attempting to collect four film frames tokens and then return to the start position. The game has questions in the following categories: Directors, Who's Who, Quotes, In the Movies, and Reel Knowledge. Answering a &amp;quot;Directors&amp;quot; question gives a player a special card which will allow him to either jump directly to one of the film frame squares or get a second chance to answer a question during one of his turns.&lt;br/&gt;Mad About Movies! covers a wide range of movie trivia including films from the late 90s when it was published. Many questions provide optional multiple-choice answers to allow people with different levels of knowledge to play. The game is  played with 2-4 players or teams, with a recommended minimum age of 12 years.&lt;br/&gt;Mad About Movies! contains a game board, die, four player tokens, sixteen film frame markers, a box of cards containing over 1500 questions from more than 700 movies, and a Directors card divider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
