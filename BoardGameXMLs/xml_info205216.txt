			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pragmatist, skeptic, and atheist, the self-taught wizard Ezren often comes across as gruff and curmudgeonly, but his mastery of the arcane arts makes him a valued member of the Pathfinder Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each pre-generated character is presented at levels 1, 4, and 7.  Each sheet includes a standard statistics block, flavor text, and color illustration.  Sheets are intended to be double-sided print-and-play components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The item is provided in two download formats - a combined PDF with all levels, and three individual PDF documents for each level of the build.  The contents otherwise are identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
