							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alhambra: Designers&#039; Expansion – The Extensions</name>
									
			<description>The Alhambra's iconic buildings get extensions to make them even more valuable for players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this expansion, a new board and a new action players can take on their turn arw introduced. The board is separated into 4 areas each housing 3 randomly drawn extensions for the buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new action players can take is to go and build those extensions to increase the value of their already build buildings in their Alhambra. Each extension is individual to one building. In order to buy an extension from one of the areas of the new board the player has to pay with money cards depicted above each area. The value of the money card is hereby irrelevant, only the colors have to match. Once purchased the extension is placed on a corresponding building on the Alhambra. Each building can only hold one extension. During scoring each building with an extension counts as two buildings of that kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extensions alter the game play and strategy greatly and make for a whole new experience while playing Alhambra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 12 extension tiles and 1 extension board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
