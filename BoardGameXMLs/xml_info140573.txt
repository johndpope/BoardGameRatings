			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Two-Tiered, Skill-Based Magic System for the Pangenre RPG System!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pangenre RPG Magic&amp;trade; supplement adds supernatural rules for all of your role-playing scenarios. Whether you want to run an Open-Game style high-fantasy game, or a lower-keyed science-fiction game with psionic powers, Pangenre RPG Magic give you the content you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's In It?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A conversion and enhancement of the Open Game magic rules for use with the Pangenre RPG.&lt;br/&gt;     Follows the Pangenre RPG Core Rules model: No Classes. No Levels. No Hit Points.&lt;br/&gt;     No &amp;quot;spells per level&amp;quot; or similar restrictions. No pre-memorization of spells. All spell casting is spontaneous, allowing you to cast any spell you know when you need to cast it.&lt;br/&gt;     Spell casting is governed by a mana pool which drains more quickly with powerful spells than with less powerful ones. Very little bookkeeping required!&lt;br/&gt;     Most Open Game magic rules are accounted for, including metamagic, spellcraft, etc.&lt;br/&gt;     Divine Magic that is based more closely on concepts of what a particular divine entity would support, rather than allowing full access to nearly all divine spells for all divine spell casters.&lt;br/&gt;     Rebalanced concepts of wizards, clerics, and sorcerers in the high magic tier.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules and spells to allow necromancers to raise vast undead armies! (Presuming the angry villagers don't catch them first!)&lt;br/&gt;     Two tiers of magical power that can be used separately or together to model many different settings, from sword-and-sorcery to gothic horror to science-fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;     High Magic skills that include Arcane Magic, Divine Magic, Psionics, Alchemy, and other high-fantasy staples.&lt;br/&gt;     An alphabetically organized magic spell section to allow for easy tab-indexing of your rules notebooks.&lt;br/&gt;     Three example characters with supernatural abilities covering a science-fantasy psionic, a high-fantasy wizard, and a mixed-tier (high and low magic) druid archetype to show the flexibility of the system.&lt;br/&gt;     An enhanced character sheet for the Pangenre RPG System with an improved wounds box. Also includes a spell-caster's spell tracking sheet.&lt;br/&gt;     A placeholder chapter for creating single-use magic items until we release the Pangenre RPG Magic Workshop supplement in 2011, which will give logical and detailed rules for making many fantastic devices within the context of the Pangenre RPG Magic rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
