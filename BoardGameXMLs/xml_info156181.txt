							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Split Suit Playing Cards</name>
									
			<description>Split Suit Playing Cards add 4 suits to a normal deck of cards. Each card has two suits to add another level to popular games.  One suit on the top of the card (a traditional suit) and one suit on the bottom (the additional suit).  All the suits are either red or black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards have the traditional suits (Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds) and the traditional values (2 - 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace) and 2 Jokers. The additional suits are Cups, Crests, Swords, and Wheels. Those new suits are distributed over the traditional suits, so not all hearts are swords, and not all clubs are crests, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red suits are:  Hearts, Diamonds, Swords, and Cups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black suits are: Spades, Clubs, Crests, and Wheels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new game was created called &amp;quot;Follow Suit 42&amp;quot; and rules for existing games, like Poker and Spades, have been adapted to the new features of the deck.  The rules for &amp;quot;Follow Suit 42&amp;quot; and the changes to Poker are included with the deck, and are also available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
