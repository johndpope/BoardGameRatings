							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Netbook of Time</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this netbook is to help players and GMs understand the effects and possibilities of time in role-playing games. Most gamers ignore the issues of time in a campaign, unless they are on small-scale events (combat rounds) or specific long-term consequences (like ability adjustments due to character age). As such, our intent is to show you the many options possible when you introduce time-related effects into your game. These ideas are just that. They are not meant to take the importance of a Core Rulebook, but to allow your minds to open new vistas in your campaigns and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this book, there will be a number of new ideas presented. These ideas are meant to be useable in most campaigns, but we realize that information and ideas may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For instance, this is especially true with the gods, goddesses, and domains section, as typically each world has set gods and goddesses in place. Additionally, any major changes (such as those involving implementing the new classes, feats, and/or spells found below) will involve individual tweaking to fit the continuing enjoyment that is key to role-playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
