			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Down at the Docks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lifeblood of any port city, the waterfront is the place to go to get the latest news from distant realms and the first shipments of rare imports. Unfortunately, it's also a prime place for thieves, pirates, press gangs, sea monsters, and worse to lie in wait. A trip to the waterfront should never be dull, and now this iconic city locale comes roaring to life in one of Paizo Publishing's GameMastery Map Packs! This line of gaming accessories provides simple and elegant tools for the busy Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find 18 full-color 5 x 8-inch map tiles, stunningly crafted by cartographer Corey Macourek that can be combined to form an entire city waterfront&amp;mdash;or mix and match to make a dockside scene of your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards present several different waterfront elements, including:&lt;br/&gt;Wooden Piers&lt;br/&gt;Small Fishing Boats&lt;br/&gt;Large Boat&lt;br/&gt;Merchants' Boardwalk&lt;br/&gt;Urban Shorelines&lt;br/&gt;Lots of Hungry Seagulls&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, Map Pack: Waterfront can be combined with Flip-Mat: Waterfront Tavern in a number of different ways to create an even larger waterfront scene!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters shouldn't waste their time scribbling boats and piers every time the player characters head down to the docks. With GameMastery Map Pack: Waterfront, you'll always be ready with a place for shady merchant deals or surprise giant octopus attacks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with the industry's most popular roleplaying or tabletop miniature campaigns, and useable by experienced GMs and novices alike, this product fits perfectly into any Game Master's arsenal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good GMs can never have too many maps at their disposal, and Paizo's GameMastery Map Packs provide high-quality gridded maps for use with both RPGs and miniatures games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
