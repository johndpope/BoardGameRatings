							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return to Camp Death</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last summer&amp;rsquo;s massacre at Camp Clearwater rocked Barrow Pines, casting a pall over our sleepy town. Only when the inconclusive police investigation and media circus died down and we tried to put our lives back together did we realize our nightmare had just begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barrow Pines is full of secrets, and the deeper we dig into the mystery, the more questions we unearth. Those of us who have dared look have come to one inescapable conclusion: whatever killed all those people last year is still out there, and it will kill again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To stop the horror once and for all, we must return to where it all started. We must return to Camp Death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This special release playset is brought to you by James Gabrielsen as a sequel to his classic slasher movie playset Camp Death. For extra fun, play it back to back with the original!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
