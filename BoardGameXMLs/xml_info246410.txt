			<description>WarDice: AEON2 is a new and unique wargame. With a non-standard turn structure and fog of war command system, This game creates a realistic and playable representation of battle. If commanded correctly, troops could move quickly to where they are needed, unless the enemy starts firing at them! Actual tactical operations work in AEON2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AEON2 also lets you make your own armies from any figures out on the market.  Ask yourself these questions. Should you really know the exact weaponry and strength of the enemy? Should you be able to know the exact rolls he needs to make to be successful when attacking or defending? Should your units do exactly what you want them to do each time? Move to an exact spot? Shoot at the best time? Charge exactly when ordered? React when they are supposed to? Is it too predictable?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a realistic, but playable set of sci fi rules AEON2 is the rules set you have been looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AEON2 has a ton of great features.
