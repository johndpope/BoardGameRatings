							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Giant&#039;s Grave</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am the gods&amp;rsquo; anger,&amp;rdquo; Dagrum proclaims rising up from the Giant&amp;rsquo;s Grave. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t bode well that he&amp;rsquo;s imbued with the teachings of the ancients and able to work malevolent miracles. It&amp;rsquo;s not so good either that he speaks like a human and practices human ways. He never did have any positive potential, but the psychological studies a wizard did on him as a baby ogre gave him tools to fine tune his instinctual rage. Now Dagrum is living proof of the power of the ancient grave. Others, too, are being drawn there and are converging. A mummified magician is waiting for the key that will unlock the spell he&amp;rsquo;s working and a treasure hunter digging by the skull suddenly finds himself taken over by an ancient. All this power is a magnet for the Corruption. Could the second age be the last? Tactics. Strategy. And good luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
