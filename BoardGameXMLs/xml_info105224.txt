			<description>Taken from the front cover of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What started as an undead horde attack on the prospecting town of Merzell&amp;rsquo;s Fall quickly spiraled out of control and left the heroes hip deep in zombie gore. Directed by the hermit and undead hunter Caba Dell, the heroes went to investigate a clearing known as the Harvest Zone. There, they witnessed a disgusting harvest as brain-eating zombies flayed the flesh from zombies. Even worse, they extracted a pulsing egg-shaped object from the heads of the zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes pursued the foul creatures into a mine. After a harrowing ride on an out-of-control mine cart and an attack from the mysterious nebulim, the heroes find themselves on a precipice of unknown depth and destination. Can they descend into the pit and defeat the outsiders from the negative energy plane, or will they become a source of food for the nebulim&amp;rsquo;s bizarre feeding habits? This thrilling conclusion to Sidetrek Adventure Weekly 2: The Undead Chronicles is designed for four 6th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Sidetrek Adventure Weekly 2: The Undead Chronicles tosses our heroes into a zombie hot zone as all hell is about to bust loose. This volume can be cut up and used to spice up your regular campaign with some high octane encounters or linked together to play a larger, robust, rollercoaster ride of a mini campaign. Jump aboard Sidetrek Adventure Weekly tonight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
