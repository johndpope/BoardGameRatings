			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, set of cargo vehicles, and includes the VTT (Virtual Table top) files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The weapons are transferring out tonight. I want you to steal the weapons crates. But be careful, as their corporate security will be heavily armed, possibly with some of the very new weapon models I want you to steal. &amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DramaScape invites you to load up and take our electrocars out for a spin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrocars are vehicles used for transporting goods. This product includes two driving compartments, two empty trailers, and two loaded trailers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrocar is intended for use in modern or near-future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Hook for use with this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prototype weapons transfer: This adventure hook should take place at a warehouse, our Modern Warehouse or Repair Bay could be used for the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons are being transferred out of the map location in electrocars. The electrocars are defended by corporate security with sophisticated military-grade weapons. The group is hired to hit the electrocars and steal the weapon crates. Alternatively, the group could be the corporate security driving the electrocars and defending them from theft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The corporate security squad is armed with prototypes of the weapons being transferred, giving them an edge in any firefight. But both the corporate security squad and the mercenaries hired to hit the electrocars don&amp;rsquo;t want the weapons crates damaged, meaning accuracy is key. This means the corporate security squad is likely armed for precision such as with prototype laser rifles with new scopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
