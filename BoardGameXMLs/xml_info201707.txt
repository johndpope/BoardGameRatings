			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Dealer generates random maps with enemies, traps, and obstacles. Draw a card, roll a 20 sided die to see which position the new map section goes, and see if you've been surprised by the enemy. For both free drawing and 3D tiles, every card is different. There are literally billions of ways to lay out a map using these unique cards. Both decks can be combined to create massive dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For solitary, cooperative, and competitive play, Dungeon Dealer is a flexible game with a number of rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitary gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a.    Initially pulling a starting map card from the deck &lt;br/&gt;b.    hand drawing or placing three dimensional tiles in the shape of the map shown on the card&lt;br/&gt;c.    placing character within that drawn grid map&lt;br/&gt;d.    progressing from 1 inch square to 1 inch square within the perimeters of the tabletop roleplaying experience&lt;br/&gt;e.    drawing a new card once the player is on an unexplored/open edge of the map&lt;br/&gt;f.    rolling a 20 sided die to determine the north, east, south, or west orientation of that card &lt;br/&gt;g.    hand drawing or placing three dimensional tiles in the shape of the map shown on the new card&lt;br/&gt;h.    discarding that used card&lt;br/&gt;i.    reacting to the random placement of each asset on the card like enemies, obstacles, and traps&lt;br/&gt;j.    repeating these turns in a cycle as the map grows&lt;br/&gt;k.    ending game when all cards are drawn or all players perish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperative gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a.    Initially pulling a starting map card from the deck &lt;br/&gt;b.    hand drawing or placing three dimensional tiles in the shape of the map shown on the card&lt;br/&gt;c.    placing character or characters within that draw grid map&lt;br/&gt;d.    progressing from 1 inch square to 1 inch square within the perimeters of the tabletop roleplaying experience&lt;br/&gt;e.    drawing a new card once the player is on an unexplored/open edge of the map&lt;br/&gt;f.    rolling a 20 sided die to determine the north, east, south, or west orientation of that card &lt;br/&gt;g.    hand drawing or placing three dimensional tiles in the shape of the map shown on the new card&lt;br/&gt;h.    discarding that used card&lt;br/&gt;i.    reacting to the random placement of each asset on the card like enemies, obstacles, and traps&lt;br/&gt;j.    alternating these turns within a group of players until every player has had a turn&lt;br/&gt;k.    repeating these turns in a cycle as the map grows&lt;br/&gt;l.    ending game when all cards are drawn or all players perish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Competitive gameplay for 2-10 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a.    dealing out three cards to each player or team of players which they keep secret, no player or team of players can have more than three cards at a time&lt;br/&gt;b.    starting on opposite ends of a blank grid map that is either a dry erase board or paper, or on a tabletop for three dimensional tile placement&lt;br/&gt;c.    progressing from 1 inch square to 1 in square within the perimeters of the tabletop roleplaying experience&lt;br/&gt;d.    drawing a card from the player&amp;rsquo;s hand once the player is on an unexplored/open edge of the map&lt;br/&gt;e.    rolling a 20 sided die to determine the north, east, south, or west orientation of that card &lt;br/&gt;f.    hand drawing or placing three dimensional tiles in the shape of the map shown on the new card&lt;br/&gt;g.    discarding that used card&lt;br/&gt;h.    replacing used card with a new card from the deck&lt;br/&gt;i.    alternating these turns within a group of players until every player has had a turn&lt;br/&gt;j.    repeating these turns in a cycle as the map grows&lt;br/&gt;k.    trading in an unwanted card in the player&amp;rsquo;s hand for a new card from the deck when the player rolls a 20 with the 20 sided die when orienting the card&lt;br/&gt;l.    giving the unwanted card to a rival player&lt;br/&gt;m.    progressing through the map, avoiding obstacles and vanquishing enemies &lt;br/&gt;n.    linking up the map in the middle so that all players meet &lt;br/&gt;o.    battling each other to see which player or team wins &lt;br/&gt;p.    ending game when all but one player or team survives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowing that thousands of players have game components that require a game master to make playable, we wanted to create a system for randomly generating dungeons that does that work for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping Dungeon Dealer simple was very important to us. One of the best things about tabletop roleplaying is how DIY the culture is. It&amp;rsquo;s a community built on making and sharing. By keeping this deck simple, we&amp;rsquo;ve allowed it to be adaptable in countless preexisting systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
