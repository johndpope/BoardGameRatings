			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A top-down shoot'em up in which the player controls three robots exploring a complex. the robots can be merged together in special rooms in order to battle the level's boss. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You have control of three highly developed battle droids, You must use them to their full strengths to destroy the direct menace of the Aliens. To complete your mission you will need to join the three Hybrids together to form one superior and deadly unit. This can only be achieved in four cells which are to be found within the complex. When they are united they are automatically teleported to the cell of an Alien.&lt;br/&gt;Having successfully destroyed the Alien the three Hybrids are separately transported back to the complex. once more they must attempt to meet up and form together. Your mission is to achieve this four times and destroy each Alien in turn. The Aliens become progressively harder to destroy as they each absorb the life energy of a dying comrade.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
