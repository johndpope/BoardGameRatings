							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Battles: The Overloon Campaign</name>
									
			<description>Forgotten Battles is a low to moderate complexity game on the largest tank battle fought in The Netherlands during World War II. The Allied Market-Garden offensive in September ended in a frustrating loss and the Germans occupying a salient in the Allied lines east of Nijmegen. Seeking to destroy the German threat that was centered on the crucial crossroads town of Overloon, as well as possibly resuming the drive to the Rhine, the British 2nd Army launched a series of offensives that took place throughout the last week of September and the first three weeks of October. The battles that occurred were often fought in torrential rains and marked by heavy casualties on all sides. Can you do as well or better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
