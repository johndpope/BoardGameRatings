			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dungeon Magic&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Magic, known in Japan as Lightbringer (ライトブリンガー), is a 1994 arcade game by Taito Corporation Japan and it also included on Taito Legends 2. Unlike most medieval/fantasy beat 'em ups it featured an isometric viewing angle, some platforming (usually involving players stacking rocks or crates to climb on and jump to treasure chests), unusually large stylised sprites, and variable blood/gore settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, up to four players can choose four characters in four different occupations: a knight, a brawler, an archer and a wizard. Collecting treasure gave the characters experience points, and levelling up shortened the time it took a character to charge his/her super attack (by holding the attack button).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to treasure, items included food (which restored health) elemental upgrades to weapons (which made them stronger against specific opponents) various single-use thrown weapons (and a five-shot crossbow), shields that would automatically block enemy attacks for a short time, and refills for a player's &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; (basically a desperation move). Often, instead of items or treasure, a chest/barrel/etc. would contain a trap like &amp;quot;freezing smoke&amp;quot;, poison gas, lightning, or even traps that temporarily transformed the player into small animals who could move but not attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemies in the game were fairly standard for fantasy arcade games, including orcs, slimes, lizardmen, werewolves, carnivorous plants, harpies, and others. Bosses included demons, giant snakes, spider-women, and more. The game also featured numerous branching paths that presented different rooms, secret areas, and even different bosses, and had to be played through multiple times to see all of the rooms available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
