			<description>The cheese in Cheese is a foam block, with numerous cylindrical bits of it sliced and removable.  Players take turns flipping the cheese block, trying to get it to land in particular ways, but not such that the nibbled corner is up while the cheese is on its broad face!  If you are successful, you mark the success of your wager by removing bits from the block of cheese, which alters the way it flips through the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     landing on the broad face, mouse nibbles face-down, 1 point&lt;br/&gt;     landing on the long edge, 3 points&lt;br/&gt;     landing on the short end, 9 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each successful flip, rather than collecting your points, you can risk losing them by flipping again, in order to approach the goal more quickly.  The first person to 12 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
