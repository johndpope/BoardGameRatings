							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">V.Smile</name>
									
			<description>A V.Smile generally has an on and an off button on the console itself and two joystick ports, and a compartment for keeping the cartridges in addition to the cartridge slot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The buttons on the game system and controllers are large to accommodate small children's less developed manual dexterity. The default controller consists of an analog stick, four colored buttons, a large enter button, a button (dubbed the &amp;quot;Learning Zone&amp;quot; button) that immediately takes the player to a minigame section of the software, an Exit button (that either brings up an option to end the game or to keep playing, or to exit out of any menu that the player is in) and a Help button (which repeats the spoken instructions or hint provided by the game to the player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;V.Smile&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
