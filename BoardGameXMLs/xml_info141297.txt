							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Basketball Field</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large wall surrounding this city has long since been torn down and the resulting rubble was used to fill in the moat accompanying the wall. The area won this way was used to build two major roads routing traffic around all around the city and in between these roads enough room remained unused for a small park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roads, once major traffic routes have been partially replaced by modern highways and tunnels routing the city's traffic much more efficiently. The park though is as popular as ever. In some spots the meadows and trees have been replaced by modern sports facilities like this basketball field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surrounded by a high mesh fence and flanked by the trees of the park as well as the now rather quite roads this field is high in demand. Numerous teams from the neighborhood as well as nearby schools take their turns playing on the field. These teams are responsible for the fields maintenance as well, although this is not much of a chore. Only the waste bins next to the field have to be emptied regularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
