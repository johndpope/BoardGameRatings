							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mars Colony: 39 Dark Fringe Group Cards</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of Fringe Group Cards is an optional accessory to Mars Colony: 39 Dark. The deck contains 32 premium playing cards, each with a description of one real-life fringe protest group to help you create your fictional movement on Mars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 39 Dark, players begin the game by brainstorming about fringe political movements that they know about from their own personal experience or from watching the news. These political parties form the basis of the fictional 39 Dark movement on Mars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what if you&amp;rsquo;re not a news-junkie? That&amp;rsquo;s okay. The cards will fill in the blanks (literally!). Each card is the exact same size as the boxes on the Faction Map, which means you can plug them directly into your game prep with minimal fuss. The aim is to help you work through game prep with ease. Use the cards to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn about various fringe political action, extremist, and protest movements from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the game with a fresh mix of political groups by shuffling up the cards and dealing them out randomly. Each game will be unique, which means more re-playability for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
