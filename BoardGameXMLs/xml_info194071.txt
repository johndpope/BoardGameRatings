			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon takes a common spell and shows you ways to add excitement and useful options that can be added to the spell in question.  Each issue of Avalon Spell books will focus on a new spell, adding new version of the spell, different components that can be used to alter the way the spell works and even feats and new magical items linked to the spell in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month we have the Divine Channel Energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divine spellcasters constantly use their channel energy ability in battles, damaging their opponents and healing their allies. However, the very existence of channel foci (Pathfinder Companion: Adventurer's Armory) suggests there might be way more uses for this basic raw power. Essentially, as long as one is able to target a particular item with the channel energy ability, it is possible to use this ability for spell-triggering or item activation. This fact unsurprisingly brings into existence new types of spells and magic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
