			<description>Football (soccer) game based in the World Cup 1986 in Mexico with real players and real game results.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with cards using the &amp;quot;Rami&amp;quot; (card game) playing system. You have three missions on the game: Make the selection on the top eleven, make the symbols of the results (1-home victory; h-tie; 2-visiting victory) and finally make two ads with ten words each. The winner is the player who can first accomplish two of these goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
