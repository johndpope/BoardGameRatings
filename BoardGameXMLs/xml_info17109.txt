							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fall of Constantinople</name>
									
			<description>Fall of Constantinople was published in Panzerschreck Magazine #6 (Summer, 2001). The game consists of an 8.5 x 11 inch map, several dozen colorful but unmounted counters, and twelve pages of rules. The rules include many examples of play, several optional rules (among them two-player possibilities), and designer notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Fall of Constantinople is a solitaire game about the climatic battle, following weeks of assaults and bombardments, that occurred during the great siege of 1453. The gamer commands the Ottoman Turks, and the system plays the Byzantine Christian defenders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can YOU create the decisive breakthrough needed to overcome the wearied defenders of Constantinople? Or will your siege be lifted once and for all? Play Fall of Constantinople and find out for yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
