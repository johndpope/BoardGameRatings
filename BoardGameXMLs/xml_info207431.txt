							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Terniel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four factions struggle for the Book of Terniel, and in the middle of them: you! Choose a side or claim it for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of Terniel is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible adventure for 4-5 1st-level characters. Players will enjoy several different types of gameplay, including old-fashioned dungeon crawls, wide-open exploration, and plenty of opportunity for roleplaying, investigation, and diplomacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's what you get: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 226-page adventure that pits your players against goblins, undead, demons, giants, and more as they struggle to recover the stolen Book of Terniel. &lt;br/&gt;    A 35-page players guide that includes tips on making characters, new campaign traits, a new deity, an overview of the area where the adventure takes place, two new playable races, eight pregenerated characters, and four wanted posters. &lt;br/&gt;    A 4-page player handout, Walcott's Journal wherein they can take a stroll through the mind of a cultist to get a peek into the inner workings of the Kaj'Talel cult, one of the key factions in the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
