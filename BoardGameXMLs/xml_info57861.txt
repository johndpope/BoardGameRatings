							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Victorian Monstrosities</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The literature of the Victorian era has generated, refined, and fostered a great number of monstrosities that have endured to this very day. Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t heard of Count Dracula or Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s Monster? What of the Martian invasion or the exploits of the Invisible Man? And who could forget the ultimate in personality disorders in the form of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of lesser known but just as fearsome literary Victorian monstrosities. Count Dracula did not appear on the printed page until 1897; however, the Victorian vampire myth was alive and well in the forms of Lord Ruthven, Varney, and Carmilla. Other monstrosities in the same mould included Brunhilda and Lady Ducayne. Pharos had a different spin on the mummy, while the Great God Pan destroyed the lives of mortals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And all of these literary creations paled in comparison to the factual and all-too-human Victorian monstrosity, the anonymous and uncaught serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, as well as the urban legend of Spring-heeled Jack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most of the monstrosities collected herein are from the Imperial Age or the overall Victorian era, exceptions have been made where the author has felt that the monstrosity would fit in well within the context of an Imperial Age campaign. Also, while care has been made to ensure that each monstrosity adheres to its source material as closely as possible slight changes have been made for artistic license and compatibility with the core rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Victorian Monstrosities follow the standard monster format. Each entry has a brief section describing the nature and attributes of the monstrosity, followed by its stat block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
