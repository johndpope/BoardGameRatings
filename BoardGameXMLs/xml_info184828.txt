							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frozen Ship</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a Ship in Ice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we can reach those dinghies, we can drag them to the sea and get off this icy rock.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Stranded Survivor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frozen Ship is am exterior map of frozen tundra with a crashed three-mast sailing ship embedded in the ice in the east. The frozen ship has two dinghies on its upper deck on the starboard side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frozen Ship is intended for use in fantasy, modern, and post-apocalyptic games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stranded!:  The group has crash landed on an Arctic or Antarctic land mass after their modern icebreaker had a catastrophic accident that sunk the vessel with only the group as survivors (or a few other NPCs that managed to live if the play group is small). Their initial exploration of the surrounding area has found nothing nearby. Following the icy shore eastward they eventually come across an ancient sailing vessel that has been trapped in the ice for a long time. The survivors spot some old dinghies on the upper deck that might be seaworthy and give them a shot at getting off the frozen rock that may become their tomb. The ship itself might offer some shelter from the cold and icy winds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigating the ship, the group finds well preserved bodies of the ships&amp;rsquo; crew. They appear to have frozen to death. The ship&amp;rsquo;s crew could be Vikings, pirates, privateers, etc. As the group explores the area, they find time period appropriate weapons and armor such as axes or muskets (but the powder shot is virtually useless with all the ice and snow but makes a good club or bayonet with a knife).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group starts hearing cracking sounds. Investigation of previously explored rooms finds the bodies of the corpses missing. The longer the group remains inside the ship more and more shattering noises are heard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group might decide that now would be a good time to get those boats and get off the island. Unfortunately the group hears shuffling behind them as they flee the inside of the vessel. Zombies covered in ice and snow wielding axes or muskets as clubs chase the group up the sides of the ship, coveting the warmth of their bodies that was denied them as they froze to death. The group needs to get off this island and the dinghies might be their only chance. Making things more difficult is the tough terrain of ice and snow that slows the group down giving the ice zombies a chance to catch up and eat the group&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
