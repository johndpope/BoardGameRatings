			<description>Players are dealt cards depicting girls, ghosts, or fairies. On each turn, one player selects an opponent and plays a card face down to &amp;quot;visit&amp;quot; that opponent for Halloween, saying &amp;quot;Trick or Treat.&amp;quot; The opponent must decide whether to hand over a piece of candy or suffer a &amp;quot;trick.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; are different depending on the identity of the card. If the card is a girl, the opponent receives two pieces of candy. If the card is a ghost, the opponent must give two pieces of candy to the card's owner. If the card is a fairy, the opponent and the card's owner both must give up half their candy to the supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the opponent elects the &amp;quot;treat&amp;quot; option, the active player may request a second piece of candy...but if so, the opponent may choose to turn the played card back on its owner. The game ends when all cards have been played. The player(s) with the most candy wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
