			<description>From the game intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game recreates the divisional scale attack by a German Panzer division against a dug-in Russian Infantry division on the Eastern Front during the Second World War.&lt;br/&gt;As the German divisional commander you have the opportunity to use your tactical skill to produce the Blitzkrieg effect of the mechanised and highly mobile forces under your command. As the Russian commander you can demonstrate the dogged defensive ability of the forces under your command, and use your tactical skill to lay out a defence in depth that will wear down, and eventually stop the heavy assault power of the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WWII Supplements&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-W01 German Infanry (Eastern Front) &lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-W02 German Panzer Gren.
