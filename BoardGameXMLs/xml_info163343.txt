			<description>This game requires the following components from TKG ARENA: The Elemental Kings and is a standalone extension within the TKG ARENA family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STANDARD DECK (DECK):    1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elemental Cycle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of the elemental cycle is introduced into the game. This refers to the different relationships each element has with the others according to their dominance, opposition and weakness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire (Ashw) dominates over Earth (Ohif), opposes Air (Ukelele) and is weak against Water (Esbner).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water (Esbner) dominates over Fire (Ashw), opposes Earth (Ohif) and is weak against Air (Ukelele).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air (Ukelele) dominates over Water (Esbner), opposes Fire (Ashw) and is weak against Earth (Ohif).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth (Ohif) dominates over Air (Ukelele), opposes Water (Esbner) and is weak against Fire (Ashw).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this game scenario is to be the first to discard all your cards in your CURRENT HAND. The recommended numbers playing the game will be 2, 3, 4 and 6 who will be distributed with 18, 12, 9 and 6 cards respectively from a shuffled STANDARD DECK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of a common shuffled DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved. The starting player may lay down any 1 card from his/her hand into a common pool in front of all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each turn, each player may EITHER 1) play a card whose FACE VALUE is higher than the previous card; 2) play a card whose ELEMENT dominates the ELEMENT of the previous card; 3) pass and the turn goes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player plays a card whose ELEMENT dominates the ELEMENT of the previous card, each player MUST choose a card from his/her CURRENT HAND and pass it to the player on the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the situation when the game cannot go on as players can no longer put down cards due to the rules, the player with the least cards of the smallest number wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
