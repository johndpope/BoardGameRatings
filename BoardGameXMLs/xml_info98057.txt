							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Overlay: Fantasy Firearms</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing firearms into a fantasy setting requires more than just gunpowder used by Orcs and Elves. Draksmoke adds that fantasy element to the simple discovery that charcoal, sulfur and saltpeter go BOOM when you mix and ignite them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draksmoke is fantasy gunpowder. Made from the burning liquid dragons use to make their deadly flames, Draksmoke is a dragons breath weapon in powdered form. Few alchemists know the secret to producing true Draksmoke; and they guard it with their lives. Rich and powerful guilds have risen up around those that know the secrets. The Black Brotherhood, the Armigers and the Monopolist Consortium all trade in mundane gunpowder, powerful Draksmoke and newly-forged firearms; each pursuing their own ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make use of such a powerful substance, new weapons have been hammered out on the forges of the world. Only the finest steel tempered in the blood of dragons can withstand the power expended by Draksmoke. Naturally, new magicks have been conceived to protect warriors, kings, and knaves alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this Sourcebook: &lt;br/&gt;- Four new player species &lt;br/&gt;- 10 new monsters &lt;br/&gt;- 11 new spells &lt;br/&gt;- 2 new Clerical Domains &lt;br/&gt;- 30 new feats &lt;br/&gt;- Dozens of new weapons; &lt;br/&gt;(both mundane and magical) &lt;br/&gt;- and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to bring real firepower to your fantasy campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
