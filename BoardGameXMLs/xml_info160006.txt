							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forest: Monster Breeder</name>
									
			<description>Monster Breeder is a fast paced worker placement game with a bluffing element. This game is tiny (in its simplest form the game consists of 2 cards and a dollar's worth of pocket change).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each player takes on the role of one of over 30 different bosses. Each boss has its own unique combination of monsters that it can summon and/or spells that it can cast. In this game, all of the monsters are represented by coins. Pennies are the smallest monsters, nickels are bigger, dimes are bigger still, and quarters are the most powerful monsters that can be summoned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin the game, each player selects a boss card to use and takes 3 pennies as starting monsters. The game consists of 5 rounds. On each round, players will simultaneously place their coins. They can create new monster and/or cast spells by placing coins on their boss card. They can attack other players by placing coins face-up next to their boss card or defend by placing coins tails-up next to boss card. At the end of the 5th round, each player adds up the points for his/her monsters (pennies are worth 1 point each, bigger monsters are worth more). The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over 5 different modes of play. Some modes (free expansion rules) will accommodate 3, or 4 players. Free Print and Play version available!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
