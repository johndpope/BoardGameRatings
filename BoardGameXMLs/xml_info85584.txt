			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this latest stand-alone expansion you will find yourself in a situation where the world is about to move into a new revolutionary era: The Renaissance. You will witness a newlyfound, vigorous and free Middle Class striving for wealth, power as well as knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter this world having to make a choice among nine all-new different professions. Will you choose to be a sellsword, an innkeeper, a miner or a banker? Will you be tempted by the more traditional stonemason, miller or fruit grower? The extemporaneous juggler or the sinister grave digger may also catch your attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having a family and children who will pass your heritage into future generations continues to be highly important, as is your meddling in the political and/or religious matters of your community. It goes without telling that strengthening your business(es), personal abilities and financial prosperity will take you far in all those endeavors. Furthermore, the all new feature of Town Armory for storage of weapons and armor will give you the  opportunity to increase your reputation by joining battles as mercenary or officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New exciting maps and scenarios such as Transylvania, the Alps or the Rhineland promise you endless hours of high quality entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
