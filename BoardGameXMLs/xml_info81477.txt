			<description>Beavis and Butt-head in Virtual Stupidity is an adventure game based on the American animated television series created by Mike Judge, Beavis and Butt-head, that was developed and published by Viacom New Media. It was released on August 31, 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It featured vocals from the series' cast of voice actors, including Mike Judge. Besides the main game, four mini-games are featured, called Hock-A-Loogie, Court Chaos, Bug Justice and Air Guitar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main game plots the two main characters, Beavis and Butt-head, trying to get into Todd's gang. Over the course of the game, they have to complete tasks and explore areas in the fictional town of Highland, Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was originally released on the PC. A CD-i port of Virtual Stupidity was planned but was cancelled due to falling sales of the console. Also, a PlayStation port was made, but only in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Beavis and Butt-head in Virtual Stupidity&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
