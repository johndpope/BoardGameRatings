			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cupcake Scouts is a roleplaying game for two or more players. One player takes on the role of the Scoutmaster, the kindly spirit who sends the scouts to slay foul creatures and makes sure that they tuck in their shirts. Other players will take on the roles of cupcake scouts, girls who have joined a troop to make friends, learn how to bake, and drive the dark blight of chaos from this world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, you need this book, a few standard 6-sided dice, pencils, some index cards or paper, and an activate imagination. You should probably have some cupcakes or brownies, too, because those make everything better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
