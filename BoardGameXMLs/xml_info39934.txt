							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crit√®rium de Figueres</name>
									
			<description>A cycling criterium is a short bicycle race often run on closed-off city centre streets. Criteriums are traditionally associated with village fairs, when a bike race is another attraction. In Crit&amp;egrave;rium de Figueres the players race to be the first to complete one lap around the worldwide famous Rambla de Figueres. The fastest rider will be he who gets more help from the other players, but of course he will have been helping them in exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally produced for the &amp;quot;Pedalant Pel Tauler&amp;quot; cycling board games exhibition held at the Museu del Joguet de Catalunya (Figueres) in October 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
