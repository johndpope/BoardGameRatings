			<description>&amp;quot;Ace Mathician is a awesome new puzzle game in which the player needs to use math to reach the&lt;br/&gt;exit! The cool thing about Ace Mathician is that there are no wrong answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It turns math into a sandbox game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many math games, so what makes this one totally different?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other math games don&amp;rsquo;t really incorporate the math into the gameplay. Instead it splits into two parts. One is the game, the second is the math. For example, the player walks up to a door, the game prompts him with a math sum and he needs to answer correctly if he wants to open the door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player does not know the answer he is stuck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also does not really make math fun. Instead it&amp;rsquo;s more like a parent letting you play a videogame AFTER you make your homework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ace Mathician takes a complete different approach. It let&amp;rsquo;s the player create and shape with math!&lt;br/&gt;There are no right or wrong answers! On top of that it helps the player visualize the math, which works&lt;br/&gt;much better as a learning tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly math becomes as fun as drawing!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
