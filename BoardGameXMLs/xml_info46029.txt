							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">No Dice: The Core Book</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to a very different role playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Dice is not just a new role playing game, it's a new type of role playing game. This book contains everything you will need to run a No Dice game (except maybe a pack of playing cards, but you can do without one in a pinch). The advice in this book will guide you from the point where all you have is thin air right through to the point everyone's asking where to get hold of a copy of this awesome game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a Role Playing Game (AKA RPG) but if you're expecting wizards, goblins and trolls then you might be in for a surprise. This game is about whatever you want it to be about. It doesn't require swathes of free time as a satisfactory No Dice adventure could happen over an afternoon or an&lt;br/&gt;evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game will consist of a group of players and someone to chair the adventure, this person has the role of Host. If it is you Hosting a game then you will be in charge of introducing your players to new worlds, strange characters and dramatic situations. If No Dice was a board game the players would be the pieces and the Host would be everything else, the board, the chance cards, the fake money and, er, the dice, except there are no dice, remember?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
