			<description>Renaissance of Infantry Tactical Warfare 1250A.D. - 1550A.D.&lt;br/&gt;An Historical Simulation Game, the time is: afternoon, 25 October 1415.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RENAISSANCE OF INFANTRY (originally Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #22) (Tactical Warfare, 1250AD to 1550AD)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     20 different scenarios&lt;br/&gt;     Melee and Fire combat&lt;br/&gt;     Bonus PanzerBlitz mini-game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-fight the battles of Bannockburn, Crecy, Bicocca, Agincourt and many more. Renaissance of Infantry marks the beginning of a whole new line of games. The units in the game are composed of no more than 500 men. Each hex represents 100 meters and each turn represents approximately 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this historical period, the mounted &amp;quot;man-at-arms&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;knight in shining armor&amp;quot;) fell prey to the better organized and disciplined infantry. After eight hundred years of dominance, the armored horseman again became a second class warrior. The game shows how, and why, infantry lost their traditional dominance -- and how they regained it. There are 20 different games.  Each is a historical battle with its own order of battle, set-up and victory conditions.  Some of the units included in the game are: militia pikemen, crossbowmen, pikemen, arquebusiers, swordsmen, longbowmen and heavy cavalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
