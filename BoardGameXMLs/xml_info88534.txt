			<description>Pro Pinball: The Web is the first in a series of four pinball computer games developed by Cunning Development and produced by Empire Interactive, released between 1996 and 2000. It features one table, with the theme suggested by the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Web is notable for using graphics pre-rendered from an intricate 3D model. Consequently, the game had superior graphical capabilities to other popular pinball games of the time, while playing at full speed on PCs running MS-DOS or Windows. The Web supports screen resolutions up to 1024x768 with 32,768 colours, and features Red Book CD Audio tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pro Pinball: The Web,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
