			<description>The game is a third-person action game, with new combos becoming available to Deadpool as he progresses. Deadpool frequently breaks the fourth wall and verbally interacts with the player based on their skill and progress. For instance, in the options menu, he begins to tap the glass of the television set, before asking, &amp;ldquo;Hey, got any girls in there?&amp;rdquo; Deadpool has the opportunity to directly address the player, where he tells them to press a certain button to do certain commands. When presented with the right combination of platforms, he wearily suggests new moves, such as the novel idea of &amp;lsquo;wall jumping&amp;rsquo;. Deadpool also demonstrates some exaggerated acts of violence, for example yelling &amp;ldquo;No guts no glory&amp;rdquo; when hanging from his entrails, or shouting &amp;ldquo;Oh that's gonna leave a mark&amp;rdquo; when dismembering an enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat gameplay relies heavily on using the character&amp;rsquo;s trademark arsenal of swords and guns, as well as giving players the option to equip more irregular weapons such as sledgehammers. By default Deadpool is armed with both guns and swords, but he also has access to giant hammers, laser guns, and a range of other alternatives. Some attacks result in dismemberment or decapitations; body parts and bloodstains can be seen on the ground. There&amp;rsquo;s a short range teleportation move as well. Since Deadpool possesses an accelerated healing factor, he slowly falls apart as he sustains damage, and players will be presented with the choice either to reattach severed limbs or wait for them to regrow. The game also employs stealth attacks, in which close-up camera angles depict more severe damage against enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Deadpool (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
