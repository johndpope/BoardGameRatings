							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quest for Gaia</name>
									
			<description>Players lead one of five starter races in this 4X space opera, or create their own unique player made races, as they struggle for galactic control.  Explore new planets, campaign for political dominance, form binding covenants, and use the might of your fleet, all while searching the cosmos for Gaia, the homeworld of an ancient creator race that will tip the balance of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quest for Gaia offers limitless gameplay through technologies, discovery, player made agreements, and racial abilities!  Every game is guaranteed to offer unique and fresh challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a game of Quest for Gaia, players will undergo multi-phased rounds.  They will start by allocating the resources available to them from technology, planets, and government.  Next, players will draw 7 cards from a communal deck, voting for who will be the galactic Chancellor (first player).  Finally, starting with the first player, they will choose major actions - Explore, Campaign, Market, Covenant, Revolt, Research, Espionage, and War.  The chancellor position is valuable as each of these major actions can only be taken once per round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will also have a variety of smaller, &amp;quot;Minor Actions&amp;quot; to take - Move, Build, Upgrade, and Attack. These actions are very quick and players can upgrade planets to give themselves more actions or discover leaders to give themselves various Minor action options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are earned throughout this process and the first player to reach 24 is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
