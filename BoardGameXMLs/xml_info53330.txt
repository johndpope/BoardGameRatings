							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribebook: Bone Gnawers (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild in the Streets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call them tainted and they'll laugh at you. Call them worthless and they'll ignore you. Call them dogs and they'll leave you bleeding on the asphalt. The Bone Gnawers have been fighting to survive in the harsh realm of the city for millennia, and they're just about finished taking crap from everyone else. The lowest of Garou are ready to prove that social standing isn't everything - to survive on the streets of the World of Darkness, you need teeth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Wold Has His Day&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most dangerous of the urban werewolves get their due in the new Tribebook: Bone Gnawers. Inside you'll find the tricks of survival that have kept the Gnawers around for so long, as well as the nuances of their down-and-out society. Tribebook: Bone Gnawers contains more than twice as much information as the original - expanded history, current events, social conventions, hidden traditions, plenty of new Gifts, rites, fetishes and other rules, hints of things to come, and even more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
