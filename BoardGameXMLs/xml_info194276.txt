							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainous Archetypes Volume III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Good to Be Bad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sick of saving the world? Tired of being expected to leap at the chance to solve everyone&amp;rsquo;s petty problems? Have a thing for twirling mustaches and overly-elaborate deathtraps? Why not mix things up with a villainous character! At some point in their gaming career, everyone has considered playing an &amp;ldquo;evil campaign,&amp;rdquo; but with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game being devoted to goody-two-shoes heroes, it can sometimes be hard to find support. Want some evil options for your character? You&amp;rsquo;ve found them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new villainous archetypes for five different classes. Included are the dark tempter, a bard archetype that uses lust and passion to learn others&amp;rsquo; weakness and then exploit them, the black knight, a cavalier archetype specializing in fighting lightly-armored foes and flaunting the editcs of their orders, the perverter of souls, a medium archetype that can impose taboos on others and possess creatures in the event of their death, the blood shaman, a shaman archetype devoted to gory human sacrifices that can rip the still-beating hearts from their victims&amp;rsquo; chests with a sacrificial strike, and a collection of witch pacts, new abilities that grant flavorful bonuses and penalties for witches who take them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on an evil-themed campaign (such as Way of the Wicked, by Fire Mountain Games, or the first official Paizo adventure path made specifically for evil characters), or you just want an excuse to play an unrepentant, irredeemable villain, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for villainous NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
