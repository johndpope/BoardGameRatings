							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rugrats: Search for Reptar</name>
									
			<description>The plot features the main character of Rugrats, Tommy Pickles, who has lost his Reptar puzzle. The levels that players explore are based mostly on the cartoon's episodes, such as &amp;quot;Chuckie's Glasses&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ice Cream Mountain&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Touchdown Tommy&amp;quot;. These levels contain various pieces of the Reptar puzzle. It utilizes several of the voice actors from the cartoon to reprise their roles.[1] It is a 3D adventure game, requiring players to control several of the main characters in order to accomplish the goals. Some stages require players to keep an object away from Angelica, a regular antagonist of the cartoon, such as cookies or chocolate milk, while others require players to reach a goal or defeat a set number of enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugrats&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugrats&lt;/a&gt;:_Search_for_Reptar,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
