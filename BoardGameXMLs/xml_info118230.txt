			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is not a replacement for the Psionics Handbook! You&lt;br/&gt;need to own or have a copy of the Psionics Handbook in order to utilize the information in this book. This book is a collection of play-tested alternate rules, more powers, prestige classes, psionic items, monsters and other goodies for your games. Advice on using this new material is also included, as well as advice on using the existing material from the Psionics Handbook with these new rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special effort was given towards making the new rules and other information in this book compatible with other sources of psionics material. Even given this, many other sources should NOT be used. The most obvious of these are sources of other alternate rules, attempts to use the alternate rules in other products with those here will inevitably result in an unbalanced game. Other than this, do not use powers that are in the same &amp;ldquo;chain&amp;rdquo; as those that were removed from the power lists in this book. Prestige classes that advance in combat modes as a psychic warrior should be changed to grant one combat mode every four levels, while those that advance in combat modes as a psion should receive one combat mode every three levels. Other than these changes, individual GMs will need to make their own judgments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ease of use, this book is set in the same order and format as the original Psionics Handbook. It is hoped that this will make it easier for you to use in conjunction with that book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
