			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth volume in our new Mythic Monsters series, Mythic Monsters: Mounts brings you a full complement of amazing mounts for your heroes to tame, or to face bearing their greatest foes into battle. Fully TWENTY of your favorite  mounts are here, updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks. More than that, every noble steed has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic pony&amp;rsquo;s inexplicable survival to a mythic nightmare cauchemar&amp;rsquo;s death&amp;rsquo;s ride, from a the aerial aid of a mythic hippogriff to the unbridled glory of a mythic pegasus champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes mythic mounts of commonplace varieties like horses, camels, and riding dogs, as well as exotic mounts like the sleipnir, dragon horse, and triceratops, including advanced variants that take the basic creatures up to a whole new level, covering CRs from 1 to 15. In addition to these twenty mount stat blocks, Mythic Monsters: Mounts also includes mythic feats and path abilities geared toward mounted mythic characters and classes with mount-based abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
