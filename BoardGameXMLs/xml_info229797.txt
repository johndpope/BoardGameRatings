			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Payroll is a worker placement, resource management game that will test your ability to build a successful business. Compete with up to four players to win the public's approval and have the best reputation in the industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your company, hire employees, and delegate how they spend their time. Utilize their specific skills and find out who they work best with. Make your company more profitable as you continue to expand. Your choices will affect your company&amp;rsquo;s reputation and decide the outcome of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game you will be competing for actions on the main desk. You will have to balance how much time and money you invest to expand your business and increase your reputation. If you expand too quickly, you may not be able to pay your employees. If you focus too much on quick money, you may not reach your full potential. Finding the balance, knowing your competition, and a little luck will be the key to building your business empire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
