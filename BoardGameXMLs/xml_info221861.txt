							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dawn&#039;s Haven (The Cleansing Shrine)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends spoke of a &amp;ldquo;secretive&amp;rdquo; group of &amp;ldquo;Champions of good&amp;rdquo; (with members of all classes and races within their ranks) whom had sworn to chase evil in all its forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though welcome in any &amp;ldquo;good deity&amp;rdquo; temple, legends also spoke of a secret place ( only known to them, since it was said that gods were to decide &amp;ldquo;who and when&amp;rdquo; to show its location) where they could retire when seeking for a resting haven or a place for atonement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, something happened, some say a great evil found this place, others claim someone from within betrayed them. The case is, that the haven was lost... until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 5th - 6th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
