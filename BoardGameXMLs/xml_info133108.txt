			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Luck Would Have It is a role-playing game wherein everyday people are thrust into incredible situations. This document contains the core rules, as well as a story pack for your first game. The story pack included is entitled &amp;quot;Road Trip&amp;quot; and will be used to illustrate the game mechanics. Only the GM should read the section of the rules that includes the story pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a variety of Test Tables to determine the results of PC actions. Players roll a d10 when instructed, and the GM gives them the results. Players use Destiny Points to alter the die rolls in order to garner more positive results, but Destiny Points are limited. The Fate Track is used to record how many turns the players have had and once a specific number is reached the game goes &amp;quot;critical&amp;quot;, and the players must spend even more Destiny Points to alter a die roll. Destiny Points and the Critical Fate number would change from one Story Pack to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
