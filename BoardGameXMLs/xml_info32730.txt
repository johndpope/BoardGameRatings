							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scrabble: Pirates of the Caribbean Edition</name>
									
			<description>This is the same version of Scrabble you would find in any toy store, but this version includes round tiles, and a variant where you can prevent your opponent from taking her turn.  One tile is placed on a special space on the edge of the board, and if you can place a word using that tile, you can cause your opponent to lose a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
