			<description>Children's game, Ages 3 and up. Players take turns being animal trainer in a circus. The trainer closes his eyes, and the other players select one of the 8 different animals. This animal is in a bad mood today. Then the animal trainer opens his eyes and starts calling the animals into the ring, one by one. As soon as the trainer calls for the selected animal the other players yell &amp;quot;HALT&amp;quot; and the trainer's turn is over. For each animal that he succeeded in calling into the ring he scores one scoring stone. As soon as all 80 stones have been won, the player with the most stones wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
