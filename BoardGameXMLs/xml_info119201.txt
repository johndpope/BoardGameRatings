			<description>From the cassette inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of the last remaining Earthlings left alive after the last Great War. Information has come to your that the forces of the Death Star are amassing again to deliver the coup de grace to Earth. Self preservation and the belief in the liberty of mankind has forced you into a decision to find the Death Star and destroy it. Having made your way to the local launch pad and found a space ship ready for launch, you board. Unfortunately your knowledge of space ships is minimal. Following the logical course of switching on the engines, powering up and applying ignition, you barely have time to strap yourself in before the 'g' forces thrust you harder into your seat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History has told you that within the Universe there is a Crystal capable of destroying the Death Star. The search is on. Should you find the all powerful Crystal and locate the Death Star, your mission depends on implanting the Crystal and your personal survival depends upon the destruction of the guarding androids and negotiating the Maze of Total Blackness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
