			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buy These Cards and Go Nuts!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: What happens when a character runs out of health?&lt;br/&gt;A: He dies.&lt;br/&gt; Q: What happens when a character runs out of mental health?&lt;br/&gt;A: He becomes more interesting...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or at least, he should. Any decent roleplayer can manage to get himself shot, stabbed, torn apart, crushed or devoured by zombies, but it takes a lot more finesse to get yourself pushed off the edge into stark raving madness... plus it looks a lot cooler! Often overlooked but always entertaining, a hearty mental breakdown, random insanity, spontaneous pant-wetting or even a nice, simple fight-or-flight knee-jerk reaction can bring much needed spice and chaos to any gaming session. But how to work them in?! Well, fear not! (Or, rather, &amp;quot;fear a lot&amp;quot;.) Insanity Cards are here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the Crazy Begin...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of print-and-play cards consists of 36 full color, elegantly designed and delightfully disturbing cards, each one featuring a mental disorder, phobic quirk or other psychic trauma. When a Character runs out of Grip (or however your game determines the loss of all marbles) just whip out a random Insanity Card, slap it down on the Player and let the fun begin. Cards include severity, description and simple, flexible rules on how to apply the disorder. Designed for use with Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible Roleplaying Game, they can be easily adapted to any RPG. Cards are organized in four different levels of severity to cover the entire gamut of crazy:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
