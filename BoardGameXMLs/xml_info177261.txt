			<description>Planning a bank heist is hard. Pulling off a heist without a plan is even harder...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have an idea for an amazing heist. You know of a bank that is stocked with safe deposit boxes loaded with cash, and you have assembled a team of 13 faithful robbers to do the dirty work. As you settle down to craft the perfect plan for the heist, you find out that several other people are planning to hit the same bank. Naturally, you decide to throw caution to the wind and move forward with the heist, planning it as you go... What&amp;rsquo;s the worst that could happen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underprepared Heist Management is a fast-paced card game for 2-5 players. During the heist, players work with a limited pool of plans that they are dealt, managing their heist as best as they can by ordering their robbers to steal and terminate other robbers. Situations may arise that completely alter the flow of the heist in unexpected (and sometimes deadly) ways. After the heist, everyone tallies up their take, revealing the hidden contents of the safe deposit boxes they managed to grab during the heist. The manager with the highest haul is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
