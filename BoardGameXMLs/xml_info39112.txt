							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Prix Cribbage</name>
									
			<description>In Grand Prix Cribbage, players race each other around a twisting, turning, two-lane track using traditional Cribbage scoring methods.  Through strategic card play and and tactical pegging, each player attempts to avoid Collisions, Oil Spills and Spin Outs while trying to force his opponent into them.  By crossing over the inside lane before each turn in the track, a player can shorten the overall distance from 121 holes -- as in traditional Cribbage -- to 107 holes.  By taking advantage of the powerful &amp;quot;Slipstream&amp;quot;, a trailing player can change the face of a game in a single hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
