			<description>Cycling simulation by a small Dutch designer outfit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes charge of a team consisting of 1 captain and 3 helpers, or &amp;quot;water carriers&amp;quot;. Cyclist move around a 4 lane wide track, by slipstreaming and dice rolling. Bonus and penalty chance cards help or hinder the cyclists, and the player whose captain first crosses the finish line wins the game. Alternative scoring rules allow the simulation of a tour (de France) along more numerous stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Homas Tour, there are alternative routes to pick from (in this case a fast oval, a longer road-race, and an even longer mountain stage) and there are different road surfaces to deal with. But although movement is also a combination of dice rolling, demarrages and  slipstreaming, the mechanism used to resolve dice movement is very different from the usual roll-and-move. A player rolls 4 dice after obligatory slipstreaming, and the highest amount of team members that form a queue determine how many of these dice can be allocated to riders. Only the lowest numbers can be allocated, and you have to move the highest amount of riders that the dice will allow, making sequential positioning a crucial part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;deluxe&amp;quot; edition of this game came in a clear plastic tube with magnetic chits representing riders and a 3 color board printed on a ferro-foil mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
