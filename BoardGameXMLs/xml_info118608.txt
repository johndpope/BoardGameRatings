			<description>Hard Hitter Tennis, known in Japan as Magical Sports: Hard Hitter and in Europe as Centre Court: Hard Hitter Tennis, is a tennis video game.  The soundtrack includes the bonus track &amp;quot;Circus&amp;quot;.  A sequel was released in Japan and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the game plot, an International Hardhitters Tournament is underway in West Sussex, with Ben Clifford coming close to achieving the ultimate crown on a number of occasions, notably when Edgar played Duncan in the quarter finals. Recently however the spoils have been taken by James 'super serve' Southwood through primarilly playing with Laval (GER). Critics have attacked his serve and volley game as one dimensional. But he has proved himself time after time in a game of such skill and patience. Bonus characters include Edgar &amp;quot;The Mighty&amp;quot; and Duncan &amp;quot;The Finisher&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For gameplay, there are three different modes: Arcade mode, Exhibition &amp;amp; Training, Singles &amp;amp; Doubles, five different court surfaces (Hard, Clay, Carpet, Grass and Indoor), eight players (seven men &amp;amp; one woman, all ficitonal), and a mode to create your own tennis player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hard Hitter Tennis&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
