							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kai&#039;s Scoundrels</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each cast out from their own societies, Kai's Scoundrels have become a tightly-knit band of smugglers without peer, famed for the transport of illicit wares. The Scoundrels comprise:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;Killer&amp;quot; Kai (N female human magus 7/rogue 1) is the driven young human woman who leads the Scoundrels while dreaming of revenge against her perfidious uncle.&lt;br/&gt;    Marrowspitter (CN male gnoll druid 7) is the strangely motivated soul exiled by his people for his strange ways. He is now more than a little bit in love with Kai.&lt;br/&gt;    Marra Brandywine (NE female halfling summoner 7/ranger 1) is a decadent halfling determined to wring every last drop of pleasure from life. She lost her parents while young to a cruel, freak twist of fate.&lt;br/&gt;    Torn Tusk (NE male half-orc sorcerer [elemental fire]) was exiled from his tribe. This fiery, taciturn mercenary delights in immolating his enemies.&lt;br/&gt;    Mercutsio (CE male half-elf rogue 1/bard 7) is a gregarious, self-centred man scorned by both of his parents.&lt;br/&gt;    Dread &amp;ldquo;Captain&amp;rdquo; LeVar Perilous (CN male human wereshark rogue 3/fighter 4) is a quiet but supremely dangerous former pirate who has lost much of his mind to the curse of lycanthropy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kai's Scoundrels presents six fully detailed NPCs that can be used individually or as a group. Perfect as foils to law-abiding PCs, alternatively if your PCs need something illicit, and can find them, Kai's Scoundrels just may be able to help...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kai's Scoundrels is a Dual Format PDF. The product's ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
