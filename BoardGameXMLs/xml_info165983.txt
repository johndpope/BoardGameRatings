							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DCS: Bf 109 K-4 Kurf√ºrst</name>
									
			<description>Like previous DCS World titles, DCS: Bf 109 K-4 Kurf&amp;uuml;rst features a painstakingly reproduced model of the aircraft, including the external model, fully interactive cockpit, mechanical systems, and a Professional Flight Model (PFM). Along the lines of our DCS: P-51D Mustang and DCS: Fw 190 D-9 Dora titles, DCS: Bf 109K-4 Kurf&amp;uuml;rst places you behind the controls of a powerful, propeller-driven, piston engine combat aircraft. Designed long before &amp;ldquo;fly-by-wire&amp;rdquo; technology was available to assist the pilot in flight control or smart bombs and beyond visual range missiles were developed to engage targets with precision from afar, the Kurf&amp;uuml;rst is a personal and exhilarating challenge to master. Powerful and deadly, the last production model of the only single-engined German fighter to see service throughout World War II, the Kurf&amp;uuml;rst provides an exhilarating combat experience to its drivers, and a worthy challenge to all fans of DCS: P-51D Mustang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features of the DCS: Bf 109 K-4 Kurf&amp;uuml;rst:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unmatched flight physics that allow you to truly feel what it's like to fly this legend.&lt;br/&gt;    Highly detailed, six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) cockpit.&lt;br/&gt;    Interact with cockpit controls with your mouse.&lt;br/&gt;    Accurate Bf 109 K-4 model, squadron markings, and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed modelling the Bf 109 K-4 instruments, weapons, engine, radios, fuel, and electrical systems.&lt;br/&gt;    Fly along with fellow DCS: Fw 190 D-9 Doras as you battle DCS: P-51D Mustangs in single and multiplayer games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
