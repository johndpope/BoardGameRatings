			<description>Description:&lt;br/&gt;Players control the fate of several regions in the Alpine arc (Rh&amp;ocirc;ne-Alpes, Piedmont, the cantons of Uri and Tessin, Tyrol, South Tyrol, Carinthia and Slovenia). Each two of these regions are connected by the Alpine crossings of Mt. Cenis/Fr&amp;eacute;jus, the Gotthard, the Brenner Pass and Karawanken. At each round, traffic increases. Within ten rounds, regions must try to contain the consequences of traffic by taking actions in the fields of economy, tourism and the environment as well as by implementing measures for transport regulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most intact region at the end of round 10 - that is, the player who has obtained the highest scores in Environment, Economy and Tourism and therefore has managed to govern the traffic volume - is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Course of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over 10 rounds, in which the following three stages are repeated:&lt;br/&gt;1. Drawing of traffic and event cards and execution of tasks&lt;br/&gt;2. Investment of money&lt;br/&gt;3. Determination of consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regions can invest only the money they have collected. Players can decide to impact on Tourism, Economy or the Environment and move the corresponding game piece of one field per money invested.&lt;br/&gt;Also, they can play the action cards with traffic regulating measures. The prices for these actions are indicated on the corresponding cards. Some cards can only be played with other regions. &lt;br/&gt;Other cards affect the traffic in neighboring regions and therefore these players must find the right countermeasures to control this new &amp;quot;unwanted&amp;quot; traffic otherwise the situation get`s out of control and the environment is ruined loosing many points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
