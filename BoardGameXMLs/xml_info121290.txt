			<description>S.P.E.R.M.S. is a card game in which players play squads of commando sperm trying to battle and race each other to overcome Egg Defenses and be the first to reach the egg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt Position cards which indicate their respective progress towards the egg. On each player's turn, he must attack the player ahead of him, using a modified rock/paper/scissors combat system, that can result in players drawing cards, killing enemy soldiers, or switching positions with the other player. Players in first place instead &amp;quot;attack&amp;quot; an Egg Defenses deck, which functions in a push-your-luck fashion to either reward or punish the leader, and will eventually give up the winning egg card (several decoys must be uncovered first).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is full of puns, innuendoes, and adult humour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;128 cards. 4 pages of rules. 43 illustrations in full colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
