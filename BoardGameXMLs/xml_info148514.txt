			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I greet you, fellow sapients.  I am Professor Starymaple of the University of Zacania.  Our sister races of the Second Empire--and you Terrans in particularl--are a busy and curious lot.  The far corners of our Empire are filled with your commerce, your wars and your explorations.  Alas that we cannot pass our days, each in her own tree, in timeless contemplation! Yet, what is meat to the lnar is death to the Valhathan: each race has its destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus I am pleased to announce a new and expanded Terran edition of the first in the estimable Spacefarers Guide series: the Guide to Sector One.  Armed with the knowledge herein, you can trade with foresight among the Hundred Worlds of the Sector, treading softly where the bough is slender, and fleeing swiftly when the Nakle stoops; and so advance the day when we will walk, crawl, swim and levitate in peace.  May you learn something new every day.&lt;br/&gt;--Professor Starymaple&lt;br/&gt;University of Zacania&lt;br/&gt;4222&lt;br/&gt;preface to 2nd Terran Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
