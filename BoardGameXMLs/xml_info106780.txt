			<description>200 Steps to Freedom is an educational trivia game based on the American Revolution.  The game was published by American Way Games and &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; in 1776 (but published in 1977).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard has two different paths, either the 100 Days or the 100 People path.  At the start of the game, the players decide if they would like to play either the 100 Days or the 100 People path.  All player tokens are then placed at the start of this path.  Each player in turn will roll the die and move the number of spaces on the die.    The 100 Days path has 100 different dates on the spaces, while the 100 people has 100 different people listed on the path.  The player then must state one or more facts about the person or the date that they landed on, and if they are correct then they would get a point.  For example, if they land on December 14, 1782, the player would get a point if they state that The British pulled out of Charleston South Carolina.  Once all players finish the selected path then all of the player pawns are then placed back at the start for phase two, the Question phase.  The players then move around the track again, only this time when they land on a space they get to answer a multiple choice question from the book that corresponds to their space that they landed on.   Every correct answer gets one point.   Once all players cross the finish line of the question phase then the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
