			<description>The red deck contains five each of the numbers one through ten. The green deck contains 90 consecutive numbers from 11 to 100. Four green cards are randomly placed face-up in a row. Eight red cards are randomly placed face-up ---- four in a row above the row of green cards and four in a row below the row of green cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players simultaneously use the red numbers and up to four mathematical operations to form an equation that equals one of the green numbers. The red cards used in an equation are discarded; the player who formed the equation keeps the green card. The green card is replenished immediately. The red cards are replenished when no player can form an equation with the red cards that remain on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues either until a player's green card values equal an agreed-upon total or until a player acquires an agreed-upon number of green cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
