			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about love and sex for two players. It&amp;rsquo;s probably best played with someone who you know and trust at least a little, but that&amp;rsquo;s your call. There are two characters who now, in the present, have had long-term romantic relationship, lasting years. You will play them now, as well as in the past. Please play this game in a quiet room. It can take as little as fifteen minutes to play, or as much time as you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
