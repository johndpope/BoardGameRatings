			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TEAM OBJECTIVE: Your team has 60 seconds, in a continuing story, to tell an outrageously tall tale. You, or one of your team members, must &amp;quot;work in&amp;quot; one of the Fabrication Lines selected from your game and try to stump your opponents for points. When time is up, the opposing team may now score by guessing correctly: WHO said&lt;br/&gt;the line? and WHAT was the Fabrication line in your fabricated story. Some lines are real ZINGERS! Stump your opponents to earn DOUBLE POINTS with the ZINGER line. The team players with the most points are the winners, great fabricators and know Fabrication when they hear it!&lt;br/&gt; Let your imagination run wild! But, in team play, if you suddenly get a &amp;quot;brain cramp&amp;quot; you may pass &amp;quot;Pass the Buck&amp;quot; at any time to another team player to pick up where you left off.&lt;br/&gt; Contents: 100 Fabrication Line Cards,&lt;br/&gt;100 Story Starter Help Cards, 3 Pass the&lt;br/&gt;Buck Cards, 60 second sand timer,&lt;br/&gt;score pad, pencil and easy instructions.&lt;br/&gt; INDIVIDUAL PLAY OBJECTIVE: You have up to 60 seconds, in a continuing story, to tell an outrageously tall tale. You must &amp;quot;work in&amp;quot; the Fabrication Line selected from your game card and try to stump your opponents for points.

Stump your opponents to earn DOUBLE POINTS with the ZINGER line.
