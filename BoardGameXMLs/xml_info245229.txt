Driven by an insatiable hate and hunger that devours it from within, it can never rest. Where it walked, death was by its side, leaving nothing behind but scorched earth. But Kurivan&amp;rsquo;s raging power burned quickly and his reign of terror lasted only a few decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can it be an accident that Kurivan has reclaimed leadership of the Night now? Has it sensed an unknown weakness in the Order that it plans to exploit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
