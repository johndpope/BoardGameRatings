			<description>From the publisher's webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's February 1658, and the Second Northern War is in full swing. King Charles of Sweden is rampaging through Denmark, his enormous and unstoppable army preparing to execute a daring maneuver - crossing the sea ice between Funen and Zealand. If they succeed Copenhagen falls, but a rogue's gallery of Danish patriots, spies and knuckleheads might just have what it takes to sink the Swedes forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A freeform tabletop roleplaying game scenario for a GM and 1-5 players into weird surprises. Please note that the &amp;quot;scenario&amp;quot; part suggests that experience with live-action games is required and no instructions are provided for pacing, safety, and other common elements of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
