							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Epyx VCR Golf</name>
									
			<description>Epyx VCR Golf features 18 different holes from the world's most famed golf courses. Pinehurst, Jupiter Hills, Miami's Doral Country Club and other equally spectacular courses. Epyx VCR Golf tests the very soul of classic golf strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play against yourself, against an opponent or three opponents. You move the ball from tee to green deciding each shot along the way. There are three ways a player can make a stroke: You can select a club card which includes a predetermined shot distance. You can roll the dice once you hit the green. Or you can play the videocassette featuring real live action footage, courtesy of ABC Sports and the PGA of America. And all the pros are there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, of course, the hottest pro on the tour is somebody you're very familiar with, You. You're the one who decides everything. Beginning to feel the pressure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
