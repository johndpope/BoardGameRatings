			<description>A baseball game that concentrates on the pitcher/batter match up. Each pitcher has 6 types of pitches they can throw. The pitcher selects a pitch card and places the card face down (the batter will only know if it's a 'slow' or 'fast' pitch), and places the ball on a square representing the location of the ball. The batter choosing to let the ball pass (if he thinks it'll be a ball), to bunt, or swing. To swing, he places the bat over 4 locations where he thinks the ball may end up. The pitcher then reveals the pitch, and rolls a die to see how many spaces and what direction the pitch moves to determine the final location of the pitch. Curve balls will move a few spaces inwards, a sinker downwards, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the ball is hit, the batter rolls a die, and adds a bonus based on which of the 4 locations he covered the ball was thrown to (he may have a +4 to any pitch thrown to the upper right location, but no bonus for the other three squares, for example). For the most part, the higher the roll the better, and you get the results for the hit, such as double play, hit, double, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sixth in Grapac Japan's series of games under the label &amp;quot;Aeronaut&amp;quot;. They are meant to be very fast playing (around 15-30 minutes). They all come in a file-type holder, with the inside of the file being the game board, and all of the components attached to the ring binder in bags and pouches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
