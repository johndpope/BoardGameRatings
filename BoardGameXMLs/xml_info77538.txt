			<description>Gary Grigsby&amp;rsquo;s World At War: A World Divided&amp;trade; brings you to back to the dawn of the greatest and most terrible war the world has ever seen. The forces of the Axis, including Germany, Japan and Italy, face the might of France, Great Britain, the United States, China and the Soviet Union in the epic struggle of World War II. Starting with the blitzkrieg attack on Poland, the course of the war is determined by your actions as the leader of one or more major factions, opposed by human or computer players. A World Divided takes this conflict one step further, with a future what-if scenario that occurs right at the end of the war. Allowing players to go continuously from the end of their game into this new scenario, Russia&amp;rsquo;s land army powerhouse and consolidated position squares off against the Western Allies naval and air superiority, and who&amp;rsquo;s territory is massive, yet less easily defended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you play Gary Grigsby&amp;rsquo;s World At War: A World Divided&amp;trade;, the events of the war unfold around you through news reel reports covering both historical and hypothetical events, World at War features a variable set of historic events that will be unveiled dependant on how the war is going. As the United States, do you focus on Europe first or send more reinforcements to the Pacific, seeking an early defeat for Japan? As Germany, do you invade the Soviet Union in 1941 or prepare your forces to march into London? In Gary Grigsby&amp;rsquo;s World At War: A World Divided&amp;trade;, you have complete control over the production, research and military strategy for your side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: From the Company Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
