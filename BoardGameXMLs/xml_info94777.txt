							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lyranis</name>
									
			<description>From deity &amp;quot;Description:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lyranis is portrayed as a weatherbeaten, bearded young man, dressed in nondescript linen and leather, with a lyre at his side, a walking staff in his hand, and a longbow on his back . He is the patron of those who explore new lands and new ideas, regardless of whether these vistas are distant kingdoms, creative works of music and art, or images from dreams. Lyranis&amp;rsquo;s priests, the Wayfarers, endeavor to help others unleash their creativity and gain a fuller experience of the world around them .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lyranis&amp;rsquo;s home is Ansild ur&amp;rsquo;Sylvathi, an immense tree in the center of Avadaen. Ansildur&amp;rsquo;Sylvathi is a living palace, with rooms and corriders crafted with in the trunk and branches, though in such a way as to not harm the tree. When he is here (which is relatively rare), the Celestial Minstrel is attended by the spirits of his worshippers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
