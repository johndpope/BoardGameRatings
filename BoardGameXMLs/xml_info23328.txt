			<description>Another CCG from the mid-1990s that appeared in the wake of M:TG, but failed before it even got started.  This one was put out by Edward Beard Jr., an excellent artist who has done quite a bit of art for M:TG cards.  The set consisted of 90 cards, 30 in each category of Horror, Fantasy, and Science Fiction, plus autographed cards, &amp;quot;puzzle&amp;quot; cards, and chase cards were randomly thrown in for good measure.  The artwork is done entirely by Edward Beard Jr., so visually the cards were wonderful.  It consisted of very basic gameplay as the rules could be summed up in just a few paragraphs.  It didn't amount to much more than rolling a die, adding the die roll to the value of the card in battle and thus determining the winner.  Game enhancement cards could be used to sway the battle, but only a few were included in the base set.  A few promo enhancement cards could be found in game related magazines of the time.  Not much in the way of a game.  It was worth collecting, however, just to get a set of the cards for the art alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
