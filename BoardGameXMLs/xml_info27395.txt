			<description>Children's game where players are firemen.  Players roll the die and move their fireman, putting on pieces of equipment or taking them off as dictated by the space.  When you land on a fire space, an inertia fire engine is pushed, and it speeds around the board: if it stops next to you, the fireman gets to put on two items.  First dressed wins.  No thought required.  The pieces are pretty decent to look at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
