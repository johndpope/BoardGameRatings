			<description>When Dragons Fight is an operational level game on the hypothetical invasion of Taiwan by the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) circa 2003-2004. The simulation is based on the premise that the PRC opens with a massive missile attack and is able to use their economic and military leverage to keep America out of the conflict. With no foreign power intervening, the PRC must conquer the island within 15 days or the Republic of China (ROC) wins. The war itself is conventional and fast-paced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is of low-to-intermediate complexity. The system covers a wide spectrum of modern operational warfare, including rules for amphibious landings, air mobility, and land and air combat. Victory is determined for the PRC by seizing a significant portion of the island's population centers, which would render Taiwan's continued existence as an independent country economically and strategically impossible. The Taiwanese win through denial of Communist Victory Points or the capture of the landing beaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units portrayed are mainly brigades and divisions, ranging from about 5000-10,000 men, and some 50-250 armored fighting vehicles in the mechanized units. The game map covers the entire island of Formosa (also known as Taiwan) with terrain types limited to clear, beach, mountain, cities &amp;amp; large towns, rivers and highways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game scale:&lt;br/&gt;hex scale = 11 km per hex side to side &lt;br/&gt;time = one day per game turn &lt;br/&gt;strength = regiment/brigade/division sized units&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
