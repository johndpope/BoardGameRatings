							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Krasis</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the Survival of the Fittest, and that&amp;rsquo;s me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Krasis is a fancy name given to a mutant which constantly evolves into bigger and better versions of itself. However, rather than the mutants you see in shows such as X-Men, your abilities are not &amp;ldquo;superpowers&amp;rdquo; for lack of a better term. Instead, you are a hybrid of multiple creatures, all rolled into one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Krasis, you have all of the power of evolution at your fingertips. If you see a trait you like, you can take it. You can become stronger, faster, smarter, all by stealing from other species. You are only limited by what your body can handle. Evolve your skills at evolving, and you can even grant your allies a glimpse into the power to be obtained from the creatures around you. Now go, creation! Show them what you can be made of!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 18 page playbook containing over 20 moves, some gear, and a compendium class&lt;br/&gt;    A two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
