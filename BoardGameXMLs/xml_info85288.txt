							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Im Bann der Mumie</name>
									
			<description>Lost in the valley of the dead Pharao, you hunt for the treasures of the Eternally Cursed One. Noone ever succeeded to escape from the bane of the deadly mummy. Driven by greed, those who tried it, lie forgotten in the depths of this hell. Inexplicable terrors lie in wait here, hidden in the sand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can already feel, how the mummy's bane reaches for you&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;Will you escape from it?&lt;br/&gt;And can you prevent that others profit more than you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Im Bann der Mumie is a very thematic card game with a board game feel. Several players take on the roles of different characters (Archaeologist, Gangster, Okkultist and Agent) and do their damnedest to unearth as many of the buried treasures of the cursed Pharaoh as possible, to sell them to the highest bidder, and enjoy their profits. And the one who makes the biggest profit wins the game...&lt;br/&gt;But there is also the Mummy (a role taken on by another player) who tries to prevent the graverobbers from unearthing too many of the treasures. Or at least from taking the most valuable of items - the mummy's body itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
