			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is a third-person stealth-based video game of 2004, developed and published by Ubisoft Shanghai...Pandora Tomorrow is the second game in the Splinter Cell series endorsed by writer Tom Clancy. The game follows the covert activities of Sam Fisher, an agent working for a black-ops branch of the National Security Agency (NSA) called &amp;quot;Third Echelon&amp;quot;. The character, Sam Fisher, is voiced by Michael Ironside...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Pandora Tomorrow is largely unchanged from the original Splinter Cell. The game features some moderate graphical improvements, as well as minor gameplay changes such as the fact that health kits are no longer an inventory item, and the addition of a laser sight to Sam's pistol that allows the player to know exactly where the rounds will strike, even when moving around. Also, Sam can now open doors while carrying a body, shoot while hanging upside down, SWAT turn past doorways unnoticed, and perform a half split jump. The pistol laser was replaced with an OCP and the SWAT turn was removed in Chaos Theory, the next entry in the series. The Playstation 2 and Gamecube versions also feature an additional single player mission to compensate for the abridged gameplay compared to the PC and Xbox versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most significant gameplay change in Pandora Tomorrow is the addition of a multiplayer component to the series in an attempt to take advantage of the features and popularity of Xbox Live. Both the PlayStation 2 and PC versions of the game also come with multiplayer; however, the GameCube version does not. The game pits heavily armed Argus mercenaries against stealthy Shadownet spies. The spies are played from a third-person viewpoint and control similarly to the main game's singleplayer mode, although they have their own unique moves and equipment. The mercenaries are played from a first-person viewpoint, and control more similarly to traditional first-person shooter characters. Although mercenaries have superior firepower, spies have the ability to hide in darkness and ambush or sneak past mercenaries in a number of ways. The total number of players in each multiplayer game is limited to 4. After the release of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory which included a very similar multiplayer mode, Ubisoft took down their multiplayer server for this game due to &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; numbers of players...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
