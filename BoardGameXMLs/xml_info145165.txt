							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kiban Castle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kiban is the second largest settlement in the Kingdom of Kaldor and the principal seat of Clan Dariune, the Earls of Balim. Kiban was a small agricultural castle town not many years ago but is now an emerging center of trade, especially in weapons and jewelry from the dwarven Kingdom of Azadmere. Earl Troda Dariune is Kaldor's Chancellor of the Exchequer and a cousin of the king. He has powerful allies, including key clerics, as well as many enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kiban Castle article describes the settlement's history, government, religion, and economics, and provides details for some of the craftsmen and other locations. Includes full-color GM and player maps as well as complete floor plans for Caer Kiban, the earl's castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics release. Portions of this article were originally published in 1984 as part of the Kaldor Kingdom Module. The article has been upgraded with new color artwork and redrawn maps, as well as expanded descriptions of the town and castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
