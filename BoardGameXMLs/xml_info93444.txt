			<description>Panic Post - A Rollicking Party Game With No Upper Age Limit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panic Post is a party game originally dating from the 1930s.  Six small postboxes are placed in various locations around the playing space and six sets of cards corresponding to these postboxes are then mixed together face down.  Players take one card each and when play begins they rush to deliver it to the correct box.  When one card is delivered players come back for another.  This continues until the time is up, whereupon points are scored for correctly delivered cards.  The winner is the one with the most points at the end of a prearranged number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can also be played over a wider play area, even incorporating indoor/outdoor locations for the postboxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
