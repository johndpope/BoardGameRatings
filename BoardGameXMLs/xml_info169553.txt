			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REalM presents us Iris, a 17 year old girl who, after a harsh sensation of falling in her dreams, wakes up in her room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, something feels out of place, and she feels the need to get out of home. By doing so, Iris discovers that she has woken in a strange place, isolated, with only one tree, her house and a house very similar to hers. Inside she finds a being like her, but like a shadow. It tells her to find the &amp;quot;effects&amp;quot; hidden in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On her way out, Iris sees strange portals hanging from the tree. After touching one, she is transported to a new world, radically different from the one she was in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iris realizes that to know more of this world, she'll have to find the &amp;quot;effects&amp;quot; the shadow was talking about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REalM is a 2D side scroller where exploring and gaining new powers is key to returning home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An open world: Explore the world in any order you like, in the end all that matters is getting back home.&lt;br/&gt;     Gain special powers (Effects): Get new abilities from the inhabitants of this world to aid you in exploring and solving new puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;     Key focus on exploration: REalM is about exploring and solving puzzles. Iris can't fight, so you must rely on other means to stay alive and make it back home.&lt;br/&gt;     The devil is in the details: You'll find throughout REalM that everything has its meaning and that all is connected. The detail put in the art of the game is of uttermost importance.&lt;br/&gt;     A unique world: this bizarre world is unlike any other&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
