			<description>In Super Stocks three to four players compete to make the most money in stock market. The game takes about 90 minutes to complete. A 2009 Essen release, Super Stocks is an redevelopment of Fund Manager from year before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play has not radically changed from Fund Manager. Players move one pawn around on a one way board using numbered tokens from one to three. Only after all players have used all of their tokens they become available to be used again. This constitutes one round, while the game is played for six or eight rounds for three or four players. Each turn the active player has to carry out the action where the pawn lands. These actions inluce buying &amp;amp; selling stocks in four companies, drawing an event card, or one of four more special actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to Fund Manager in Super Stocks players have both more power to influence the stock prices and more tools to reduce randomness. There also is no need for pen &amp;amp; paper as Super Stocks comes with stock tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
