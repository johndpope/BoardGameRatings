			<description>This game is a fun and effective way for teachers and families to acquaint middle school aged children with water conservation.  The game targets grades six through nine (ages 11 and up) and allows for play within a classroom or at home with the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: Water is a precious resource that is essential to all living things, yet only 1% of the earth's water is drinkable. This is why it&amp;rsquo;s so important to conserve this resource.  Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to go through a day and not waste water in some way. In this game, you are a member of a household. Your goal is to navigate through a house and collect a water-saving device and a water-saving habit from each room without wasting all of your water.  You will be given 50 drops of water to start the game with, which should be enough, if you make the right decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to return to their Start space with at least one Device Card and one Habit Card from each room of the house, as well as at least one &amp;ldquo;drop in the bucket's remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game Board&lt;br/&gt;     Four game pieces (toilet, washing machine, sink, and hose)&lt;br/&gt;     Four buckets, one for each player to hold their water drops&lt;br/&gt;     Four sets of Habit Cards and four sets of Device Cards, one for each room&lt;br/&gt;     Four decks of Choose to Conserve Cards&lt;br/&gt;     One deck of Tip Cards&lt;br/&gt;     One six-sided die&lt;br/&gt;     Two hundred water drops&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
