			<description>In this first episode of the Danger! Danger! series, the players find themselves transported to a wild prehistoric fantasy land; where, as Cavefolk, they must explore the dinosaur infested jungle in order to secure their basic needs: food, water, and fire! Along the way,  players may secure victory points by earning Big Idea cards, Tool Bonus cards, Bone Artifact cards,and Cavefolk Retirement cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its core, the Danger! Danger! dice system is a four phase, press your luck dice engine that will have the players testing the limits of their good fortune! Here are the 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The player rolls the exploration dice. They may keep the roll and spend their dice to earn cards and/or token (thus ending their turn)...OR...&lt;br/&gt;2. The player may reroll any unwanted dice +1 Dinosaur dice&lt;br/&gt;3. The player may reroll any unwanted dice +2 Dinosaur dice&lt;br/&gt;4. The player may reroll any unwanted dice +3 Dinosaur dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each phase the player has two choices: spend the dice (and end their turn), or reroll any unwanted dice, however, each time a Dinosaur dice is added, the chance of busting grows ever greater!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns pressing their luck, round after round, until one of two primary decks are depleted. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game stands victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
