							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Penalty Pong</name>
									
			<description>In Penalty Pong, players split into two teams, each with the goal of humiliating the members of the other team by making them do embarassing tasks while avoiding such punishment themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you manage to throw or bounce your ball into an opponent's cup, that player must draw a penalty card and perform the task shown on it: call one player &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot;, sing &amp;quot;I'm a Little Teapot&amp;quot;, admit to a lie you've told to someone. Blank cards are included so that you can create your own penalties, penalties that you might end up suffering if you're not careful. Good times &amp;ndash; and a bit of after-game penance &amp;ndash; await!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
