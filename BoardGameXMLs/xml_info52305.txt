							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Algeroth: The Apostle of War – with the Heretic&#039;s Handbook</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Twas in the fiftieth and second year of the glorious reign of Cardinal Nathaniel Durand the First that he descended on Humanity from the blackness of the Void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And he struck the battlefield like lightning, horrifying in appearance and powerful in all his might.  Wielding a black sword thrice as long as any human, he cleft in two our beloved Cardinal Augustus, Prince of Venus and Lord of Love and Light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the ground shook as he spoke, with a voice like thunder, his words od doom and despair: &amp;quot;Behold you tiny children of Humankind, and shudder and tremble.  Because I am the Lord of the Dark Technology, and ye shall know me as Algeroth.  I am the Apostle of War and Destruction, and War I will make, and  Destruction I will create!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And ever since that day of unholy shedding of blood, Algeroth's armies of undeath march ever on, counting in their ranks the foulest of all living and unliving creatures ever created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALGEROTH is a campaign module and sourcebook focused on the armies and armories of the Lord of Dark Technology -  with detailed descriptions of vehicles, weapons, creatures, citadels, equipment, Nepharite intrigues, Necro-bionics, bio- and Necro-technology and more.  In the section called THE HERETIC'S HANDBOOK, you will find everything you need to know about Algeroth's &amp;quot;Secret Kohorts&amp;quot; - how to create a Heretic, Temple Backgrounds, 30 new Gifts of Algeroth's Dark Patterns, how to transform into a Necromutant, Centurion or even a Nepharite, how to acquire and use Necro-bionics, Bio-technology, and Necro-technology, how to avoid the Brotherhood and found a Temple of your own, how to create your own Relics and Artifacts, and also, if worst comes to worst, how to treat Degeneration and Stigmata.  Finally, there's also THE BLACK GATE, a ready-to-run, all-out action adventure with complete stats for Fury of the Clansmen and eight stunning floorplans depicting the Citadel of Nepharite Warlord Baalzacht.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
