			<description>The players set their playing pieces face down on the spaces of their color on the game board. Only the spaces with the number 10 are left free. When all pieces are set, the faces are revealed. Now the players have to move their pieces to get them on the spaces of the same number. Spaces of other colors can't be moved on. Neutral spaces can be used to block the opponents. The first player to get all his pieces on the right spaces wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
