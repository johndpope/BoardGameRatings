			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hold in your hands - or, more accurately, have displayed on your monitor - the public beta edition of the rules for the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. DCC RPG has been in &amp;quot;silent playtest&amp;quot; mode for well over a year. Now, after many months of preliminary testing, the rules are ready for a public stress test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enclosed file is not the complete text of DCC RPG; rather, it is an excerpt. This file has the rules that are most pertinent to starting a game and running a short campaign. The finished DCC RPG includes many more spells and monsters, rules for characters up to level 10, as well as a much more robust judge's section. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s a more well-rounded work in general. However, for &amp;quot;kicking the tires&amp;quot; and just testing out the core rules, you don't need the complete work. Everything you need for a test run is enclosed herein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember, the book you hold in front of you is only part of the finished whole. (Well, part of the still-to-be-finished whole - we are still transcribing the final manuscript!) You may find references to sections of the rules that are not included here. Don't worry; for now, you can ignore those references. They will be resolved in the final printed version. The final printed version will also include complete artwork and a final layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We strongly encourage you to provide feedback on this work! This document is not the final rules set for DCC RPG. DCC RPG has already changed, thanks to feedback from the hundreds of gamers who have stress-tested it over the last few years. We anticipate it will change again after this beta is reviewed and played by thousands of gamers. The game will change based on YOUR feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of changing rules, the author has been tweaking the playtest rules as the editor does his work. (In fact, I added this paragraph to the intro after Aeryn finished his edit - he hasn't seen it! Hope I don&amp;rsquo;t make any typos. - Joseph) The thief, cleric, and halfling classes were changed mid-edit. All the rules will continue to evolve based on YOUR feedback, but please be aware that our fearless editor isn't to blame if you find errors in this document - they're probably from the last-minute changes made as this living document continues to integrate playtest feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
