							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Andalusia</name>
									
			<description>Andalusia is a Chess variant played on an Alquerque board. Pieces move along lines on the board. It uses a slightly modified quadruple Alquerque board, with every other horizontal and vertical line removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Zillions of Games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King - a King can move one step along a line in any direction. Like Chinese Chess, it has the special power to threaten the enemy King across the board along an empty line. For this reason, it is not permitted to make a move that leaves the two Kings facing each other with nothing in between. Unlike Chinese Chess, the King is not restricted to a particular area of the board. So it can threaten the enemy King along any line and in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chariot - a Chariot can slide any number of spaces along a line in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldier - a Soldier can move one step along a line in any non-retreating direction. It can move two spaces from it's starting position, as long as it is not a capturing move. A Soldier promotes to a Chariot on the second to last rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
