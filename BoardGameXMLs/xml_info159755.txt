							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mountaintop Oracle</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a hard climb up the rubble covered slopes of this mountain seekers of enlightenment or just a few answers can lay their eyes upon the site of this oracle. At the very summit of the mountain lie what at a first glance seem to be the ruins of an ancient oracle. Only a second glance will reveal that all the stones of its floor and columns are actually in good repair and that the oracle hall is rather simply unfinished than in ruins. Some visitors might even wonder how its architects got the massive marble blocks of the structure up here. Even without such a burden the climb was certainly hard enough. At the very center of the unfinished structure stands a large brass brazier where petitioners visiting the oracle burn their sacrifices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
