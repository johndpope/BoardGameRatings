							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Glow of Death</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The martial arts are well practiced by the xenophobic Chi. They have turned their bodies into living weapons through rigorous discipline and training. But for some, there is an even higher state. For some, there is a power that can only be achieved by supreme dedication to the art. A student's master is dead, and that death demands vengeance. Will the student achieve the awesome power that is the Glow? Or will he fall in disgrace? The Glow of Death is an Exodus OPS campaign scenario recommended for 4 to 6 characters of 4th to 6th level and can be easily adapted to any post apocalyptic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
