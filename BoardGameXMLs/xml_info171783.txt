			<description>A game filled with colour that children win by being patient and not rushing to put all their tokens on the merry-go-round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 6 tokens representing children who want to go on the ride . The first player throws the color dice. There are two possible outcomes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    purple, the player places a &amp;quot;child&amp;quot; token in the purple box and can reroll.&lt;br/&gt;    other colors, e.g. blue: If the blue attraction is free, then the player can place a &amp;quot;child&amp;quot; token and may choose to reroll or pass. But if the blue attraction is busy, the player removes the token &amp;quot;child&amp;quot; of the ride and his turn is completed. The first player to place all his chips &amp;quot;child&amp;quot; on the ride wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
