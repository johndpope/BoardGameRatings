							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Angels and Demons: Battle for Humanity</name>
									
			<description>INTRODUCTION:&lt;br/&gt;In the small hamlet of Foix, stands a castle that has stood for centuries.  Little do the townsfolk know that they will shortly be part of an ongoing battle between two epic forces.  Angels and Demons, disguised in human form, have entered this once quiet haven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Demons raze the town, leaving a trail of devastation?  Will Angels draw out all that is good, leaving a barren landscape?  Or, do the townsfolk of this once peaceful town stand a chance to hold on to everything they hold dear?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;Angels and Demons is a party game for 6-25 players who each receive a role combination (character type and alignment) defining their faction.  Each night someone is eliminated from the game, and the town exiles another player during the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE:&lt;br/&gt;Keep alive until you eliminate opposing factions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Players each receive a character card (human, angel, or demon), and an alignment card (good or evil).  These combinations determine your role.  Each role is kept hidden, and players are eliminated during each of the day and night cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME ELEMENTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hidden roles&lt;br/&gt;     Multiple ways to win&lt;br/&gt;     Humans belong to families who are aware of each other&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
