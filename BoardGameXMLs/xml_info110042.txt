			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvest Moon: The Tale of Two Towns is the seventh Harvest Moon game released for Nintendo DS. This time the game world is made up of two rival towns seperated by a large mountain. At the start of the game, players have the choice of living in Bluebell, a town with a Western vibe and a focus on livestock, or Konohana, a Japanese town with a focus on crops. The player can swap between the towns later in the game, and each town has its own festivals and events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the farming, foraging and relationships that are the staple of Harvest Moon, a request system has been introduced where townfolk can ask the main character to gather items for them in return for rewards such as money, tools and house upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
