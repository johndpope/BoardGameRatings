			<description>[From the back of the box]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TOP SECRET&lt;br/&gt;Attention Special Agent 4125: Elvin Atombender Back in Power!&lt;br/&gt;It has been two short years since Elvin Atombender was vanquished. Your supreme efforts, 4125, helped prevent global domination and anarchy. But now, like a phoenix from the ashes, Elvin has rised once again. Reports from the country indicate that Elvin has established a new stronghold, the headquarters of which is a five tower complex.&lt;br/&gt;Early reports indicate the presence of guards, robots, mines and trap doors. Only one person has the vital ability to negotiate the maze of elevators; and the strength to outwit Elvin himself. So once again we must ask you to make the supreme sacrifice. We are aware that it is a mission from which there may be no return, but we have to put our trust in you, if global destruction is not to result. &lt;br/&gt;Your mission starts today.&lt;br/&gt;We wish you good luck and God's speed.&lt;br/&gt;I.M.A. Special Terrorist Unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
