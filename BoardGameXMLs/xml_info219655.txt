			<description>This is a traditional card game from the southern parts of Taiwan and Penghu County. The game uses 10 sets of 12 cards depicting the 12 Chinese zodiacs, namely the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt 11 cards each, with the banker dealt an extra card. The goal of the game is to form sets of 3, either in sequence or of the same zodiac. It is also possible to form a set of 12, i.e. all 12 zodiacs. The player who manages to go out first, i.e. 胡牌, receives a certain amount of chips from the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
