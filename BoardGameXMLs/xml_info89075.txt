			<description>The board is a square seperated by othogonal lines with 24 crossing points. The are pieces in three different colors. At the start you have to put 2 pieces of each color on the board, so that not two of the same color are adjacent. Each player gets 6 starting pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn you have to put a piece adjecent to one of the same color and then you have to move the adjacten same colored pieces. If there is a piece on the space you have to move to, this piece is beaten. You have to take on of the beaten pieces back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who got rid of all his pieces first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
