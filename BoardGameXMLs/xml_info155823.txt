							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fleet: Crab Meeples</name>
									
			<description>Part of Fleet: Arctic Bounty Kickstarter campaign. They will be available by other outlets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantity: 5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bay Card: During setup, place all five Crab Meeples near the center of the play area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Crab Meeple is caught by the first full boat of each different Standard license in the game. If more than one player completes the criteria in the same phase and round, tie is broken by first in turn order. When a boat reaches capacity and is the first of its type to do so, that player immediately receives a Crab Meeple and places it on the license matching that boat. The Crab Meeple cannot be lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Crab Meeples held at Game End are worth 4 VP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
