							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heavy Gear Player&#039;s Handbook</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;A Hunter races past you, its rapid-fire 20mm autocannon spitting metal death. As you watch in horror, your commanding officer's Black Mamba erupts into a ball of raging flame, composite armor and fuel ablaze in a bright fireball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Fall back! Fall back!&amp;quot; Hastily, you have taken command. Your cadre pulls back behind a rocky outcropping and regroups. Tracers streak by your temporary shelter like angry hornets -- you all know you can't stay here forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You crouch low and burst out of the rock's shadow, zipping, zooming and ducking on powered wheels like an oversized amored skater. A hail of shells explode on the ground around your Gear, but you sidestep every one of them. Unleashing the full power of your V-engine, you head back into the fire fight, emptying your shoulder-mounted 71mm rocket pod on an enemy heavy tank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And they told you this was just a routine patrol...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step into a whole new universe with Heavy Gear, the next generation of military science fiction game! This book features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A detailed world background along with extensive guidelines for campaigning on Terra Nova that can be used to jumpstart any campaign;&lt;br/&gt;Extensive guidelines and tips for adventuring in the human colony worlds of the 62nd century;&lt;br/&gt;Dual-stats for the powerful Silhouette CORE rule system, a highly acclaimed game engine that uses classic six-sided dice, and the widely popular d20-based rules placed under the Open Gaming License;&lt;br/&gt;And tons of military and civilian archetypes, weapons, equipment and vehicles!&lt;br/&gt;Requires the use of the Silhouette CORE rulebook(tm) published by Dream Pod 9, Inc., or a Roleplaying Game Core Book published by Wizards of the Coast(R), Inc.
