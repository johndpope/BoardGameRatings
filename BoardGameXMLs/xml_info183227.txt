			<description>I Remember: a Matching Game is part of the Crayola Games line. It is a new twist on the classic game Memory.  Like Memory, a collection of tiles is placed face-down.  In I Remember, a spinner is added and tiles are assigned to one of four categories (food, animals, toys or transportation).  The game can be played at three levels.  Level one is played with only one category of tiles, reducing the number to make matching easier. Game play is identical to Memory--players turn over two tiles trying to find a match.  If the tiles match, the player keeps them.  If not, they are replaced in the same positions and the next player plays.  When all tiles have been claimed, the player with the most tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In level two, players spin the spinner to determine which of four categories they must match.  The current player then turns over a single tile.  If it matches the category spun, the player keeps the tile.  If not, it is replaced in its original position.  The next player then attempts to match the same category.  Once a match is made, the next player spins to determine the new category and play continues.  When all tiles have been claimed, the player with the most tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level three is played in a similar way to level two, except after spinning players must find two tiles with matching pictures in the category spun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
