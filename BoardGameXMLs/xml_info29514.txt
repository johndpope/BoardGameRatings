							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bowl Game</name>
									
			<description>Due to its simple rules and ease of playing, &amp;quot;The Bowl Game&amp;quot; is a perfect party game for mixed groups of non-gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much like the parlor game &amp;quot;Celebrity&amp;quot;, players are broken into teams and given slips of paper.  Each player writes down a set number (usually 10) of 'things' on slips of paper.  These 'answers'  are folded up, placed into a bowl (or hat or cup, whatever you have handy), and the game begins.  Each player is  given 1 minute to draw slips of paper, one at a time, and try to get their teammates to guess the answer.  Much like Taboo, no charades (hand gestures) may be used, and no rhyming or &amp;quot;starts with&amp;quot; is allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; written can be anything that makes sense, and can be conveyed.  Expressions, quotes, famous people, things, etc.  As long as it's not nonsense, it's appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the timer goes off, the team gets one, and only one guess, as to what the last answer was.  The teammates must confer, and come up with a guess.  Usually there's a time limit to this.  If it's guessed correctly, it's a point, otherwise it's tossed back in the bowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bowl is then passed clockwise, and the next person gets a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continue until the bowl is empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
