			<description>Welcome world travelers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You goal is to visit all the countries listed on your special passport and return home. The game consists of a board representing thirty-six countries, passports, passport stamps, travel tickets, country cards, pawns, dice, and money. There are four travel tickets: plane, boat, train, and car. Tickets are purchased randomly and then used to travel around the board. Each country has certain forms of travel going to different countries. Moves must be mapped out to make sure you get the best use out of your tickets. Money is obtained by rolling the dice. Each roll means something different, just don't roll a seven or you'll have to draw a country card and have to visit that country as well before you can win. For each country you visit you get a stamp for your passport. Once all your countries have been stamped, head home to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a unique but very fun game. Great for a light evening of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
