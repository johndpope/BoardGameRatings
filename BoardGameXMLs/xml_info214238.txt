							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twin Spin</name>
									
			<description>This undated but likely 1930s British title is an odd combination of two unrelated games using a single mechanism. It consists of a metal spinning disk on top of a spinning arm with a white pointer and circle on one end and a red pointer on the other, all mounted in a yellow metal bowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game is a dog race. The spinning wheel is divided in six equal and color-coded segments with an illustration of a running dog in those colors. Each segment is divided into four unequal pieces marked with different payout odds (2-1, 4-1, 6-1 and 8-1). Players place bets on a separate betting mat divided into the six color boxes and spin the wheel. Where the pointer stops, that dog wins at the indicated odds and everyone else loses their bets. The player ending with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outside the dog segments, however, the wheel is divided into 32 segments, each with a single letter. Each letter of the alphabet appears once, except for the five vowels (which get 2 spaces each) and a final square marked &amp;quot;any letter&amp;quot;. The rules for this game are not clear absent the instructions, but a box illustration says that &amp;quot;Every correct word scores&amp;quot;, suggesting that players perhaps must come up with as many words as possible starting with the letter spun, or including both letters on the opposite ends of the pointer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
