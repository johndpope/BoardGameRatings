			<description>A challenging children's lotto game with a difference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the boards in this game shows one motif nine times.  Each differs only in minor detail.  At first glance, all motifs are so similar that a child is obliged to really scrutinize the details in order to match up pictures and cards.  There are six boards, of differing difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although billed as lotto, this game is more of a solo puzzle than a game, with the child attempting to match up their 9 cards, and then checking them with the transparent checking sheet.  One point is given for each correct card.  If playing with several players everyone stops when one player has finished, which brings in a competitive speed element to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
