			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swift Swords is a fantasy role playing game, this means that the players act out the roles of characters within the environment created by the Games Master (GM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I try to avoid tightly defined states of good and evil. Instead I have gone for Law and Chaos, these are more easily defined and thus easier to play with. Law and Chaos are ethical views in part and nearly everyone swings both ways at times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important aspects to a good role playing game is the environment. If you begin with a really interesting world environment for the players to exist in then they will be keen to play right from the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That environment can be small, like a ruined castle, or huge, such as an entire world. Normally the players only interact with a limited area of that environment at one time. To help people get started I will enclose a limited world environment, one that represents a section of a world - see Aquilonia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
