			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS: 4 Playing Boards, 36 Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY: Each player takes a playing board and the smaller cards are placed face down on the table. The youngest player starts by turning over one of the cards and matching it with one of the characters on his playing board. If he cannot, he leaves the card face upwards on the table. The next player may then take this card or selects another. Play continues; should a player turn over a card the he already has, play passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to cover all his characters on his playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOR OLDER CHILDREN: If a player picks up a card he does not need he replaces the card face downwards on the table. The other players then have to remember where that card was replaced if they need that particular character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
