			<description>Mystical Eddies is a trick-taking game for The Mystique Deck, in which the player who leads the trick must assume she won't win the trick, because a subsequent player determines the context of the card she leads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played either for a fixed number of rounds, or to a target score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When leading a trick, you can play any card you like; however, because the Mystique cards have three aspects (suit, number, color), the next player chooses which aspect to follow. Everyone else in the trick must follow the same aspect (or toss a card if unable, like most trick-taking games). If the second player's card followed two aspects, then the other players must follow both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses the following ranking:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     suit: suns &amp;gt; moons &amp;gt; arms &amp;gt; crowns&lt;br/&gt;     number: 5 &amp;gt; 4 &amp;gt; 3 &amp;gt; 2 &amp;gt; 1&lt;br/&gt;     color: yellow &amp;gt; red &amp;gt; blue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick winner is determined as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Following suit: Highest number; tie goes to highest color.&lt;br/&gt;     Following color: Highest suit; tie goes to highest number. &lt;br/&gt;     Following number: Highest color; tie goes to highest suit.&lt;br/&gt;     Following suit and color: Highest number.&lt;br/&gt;     Following suit and number: Highest color.&lt;br/&gt;     Following color and number: Highest suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should no one be able to follow a led card, the trick leader wins the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each trick won is worth 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Scoring Variant: Balance&lt;br/&gt;Each player earns points in three categories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tricks won following suit.&lt;br/&gt;     Tricks won following color.&lt;br/&gt;     Tricks won following number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player wins a trick, she earns one point in the appropriate category. If she won a trick that followed two aspects, she earns one point in each of those two categories! Your category with the lowest score is what counts toward winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
