			<description>Famicom Mukashibanashi Shin Onigashima (ふぁみこん昔話 新・鬼ヶ島?, lit. &amp;quot;Famicom Fairytales: New Onigashima&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Onigashima&amp;quot; literally meaning &amp;quot;Island of Oni&amp;quot;)), often simply referred to as Shin Onigashima (新・鬼ヶ島?, &amp;quot;New Onigashima&amp;quot;), is a video game title developed by Nintendo EAD and Pax Softnica and published by Nintendo. It was first released on two disk cards for the Family Computer Disk System. The first disk was released on September 4, 1987, while the second disk was released September 30, 1987. The driving force behind the series, Tatsuya Hishida of Nintendo EAD, was responsible for directing the game, creating the characters, and crafting the story line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, there was an elderly couple living in Nagakushi village, a small village located far up in the mountains. The couple had no children, until one day, they were entrusted with the care of an infant boy and girl, as prophesied in a dream. The years went by, and when the two children were 8 years old, there was a terrible occurrence in the western capital. An evil dragon suddenly appeared in the city, turning humans into Oni; devils that suck away the souls of other humans. The Oni advanced as far as Nagakushi village, stealing away the souls of the elderly couple. Fortunately the two children were left unharmed, and they set out on a quest to save their adopted parents, not realizing that this adventure would reveal the secret of their true origins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shin Onigashima&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
