			<description>Any number can play. All the 36 cards are dealt face down to the players. Each player keeps his cards, without looking at them, face down in front of him. The player on the left of the dealer starts the game by turning up his top card and placing it face up in the centre of the table.&lt;br/&gt;When a &amp;ldquo;PUT&amp;quot; card (marked with numbers 1,2 or 3) is turned up the next player has to put down the number of cards shown. If in doing so he turns up a &amp;ldquo;PUT&amp;quot; card, the next player has to put down the required number.&lt;br/&gt;Should no &amp;ldquo;PUT&amp;rdquo; card turn up in the cards laid down, the player who laid the &amp;ldquo;PUT&amp;rdquo; card takes all from the centre of the table.&lt;br/&gt;The player who gets all the cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
