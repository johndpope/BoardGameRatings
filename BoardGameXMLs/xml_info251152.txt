			<description>The board game Milujeme Slovensko (we love Slovakia) brings you fun and examines your knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are interesting tasks awaiting players in Slovakia. By buying a cave, a mine, a harbor, or cableways, you will become a great investor who, however, has to deal efficiently with his property and money to make his profit grow and create a reserve of money for the tasks that are awaiting him during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buying real estate will ensure you some revenue from your opponents. The &amp;quot;number plate&amp;quot; cards will check your knowledge of numberplates in all of Slovakia's districts. Those cards are also given spice to by a bit of bet and risk. Your knowledge and finances can as well be boosted through quiz questions about Slovakia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game teaches you to invest and reasonably deal with finance, expands your knowledge of the country, while offering you the opportunity to spend time with your family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
