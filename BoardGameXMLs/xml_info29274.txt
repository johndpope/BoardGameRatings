			<description>This is a simple sequence game with a challenge element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 104 cards each marked with a letter. There are 4 of each letter of the English alphabet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the center of the table, there are 4 stacks - 2 ascending from A-Z, and 2 descending from Z-A. A &amp;quot;Higher/Lower&amp;quot; marker is placed between the piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In front of each player, there are 2 stacks - a face down draw pile and a face up discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, all cards are dealt to players, so the only stacks with cards are the player draw piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards must be played onto the stacks in sequence - D on top of C if going &amp;quot;Higher&amp;quot;, C on top of D if going &amp;quot;Lower&amp;quot;. Cards may also be played onto another player's discard pile if it is 1 higher or lower than the top card. A player's turn ends when he draws a card that cannot be played anywhere - it is then placed in his own discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the person who gets rid of all their cards first (discard piles are recycled).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other players can challenge a move by shouting &amp;quot;Rubbish&amp;quot;. All players give 1 card to a validly challenged player, or to the challenger if wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To encourage a noisy game with lots of challenging, the rules suggested that players play quickly in order to make mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists solely of the marker, the cards and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules say that whilst any number of players is possible, it is best with 4-10 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
