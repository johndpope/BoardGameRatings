			<description>A game in which players vote their issues closer to the speaker of the house in order to increase their value before scoring. Players move issues by playing a copy from their hand to their constituency, or increase the constituency by polling and choosing an issue from the top 3 cards of the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to score the most over the course of 5 phases/hands. Each phase increases the number of things that are voted on by the players instead of being accomplished automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hand ends when enough cloture motions have accumulated to force the vote. At the end of the hand, players choose a scoring method and then move on to the next phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
