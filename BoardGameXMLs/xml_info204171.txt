			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two weeks ago, a company of thugs managed to intercept a wagon on its way to a wizard's keep, and to their surprise and delight discovered it chock-full of magic items.  Understandably, these bandits showed no restraint in bragging about their good fortune, and soon everyone in the area knew what had occurred.  This event disturbed the local governments the most, who had been aware of the mysterious and regular transports to the home of this reclusive wizard, Fasahd the Changer, but were never emboldened enough to ask about them.  Now their worst fears had been realized, and they are certain that this wizard was stockpiling magic weapons, with plans to arm the humanoid tribes around his home for conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed as a ZIP archive containing the adventure (DOC Format) and four image files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
