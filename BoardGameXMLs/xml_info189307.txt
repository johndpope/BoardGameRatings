							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SpongeBob Squarepants: Legend of the Lost Spatula</name>
									
			<description>As SpongeBob, the player embarks on an undersea quest to find the Flying Dutchman's Golden Spatula in order to become the ocean's greatest short-order cook. If SpongeBob gets hit, his clothing falls off. If SpongeBob is wearing a jacket power-up, he loses it when he is hit. If he takes a hit with no jacket, his pants fall off, leaving him to run around in his underwear. If his underwear falls off, he loses a life. Along the way, SpongeBob meets and interacts with many of the show's popular recurring characters like Mr. Krabs, Squidward Tentacles, Sandy Cheeks, and Patrick Star. The game uses elements of adventure and side-scrolling gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;SpongeBob SquarePants: Legend of the Lost Spatula&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
