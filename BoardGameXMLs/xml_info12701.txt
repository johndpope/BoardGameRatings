							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lewis Carroll&#039;s Chess Wordgame</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's brochure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This refreshingly different word game is based on a notation in Lewis Carroll's diaries. Martin Gardner, author of The Annotated Alice, has defined suitable rules. Move letters like chess queens to form words and score points. There's no capturing, and you can't sabotage your opponent's scoring row, though you can try to blockade the opponent's moves. The 22&amp;quot; red game cloth is printed in white to look like Alice's picnic tablecloth. A total of 110 letter tiles serve for this and several other games on the same board, plus solitaires. Entertaining for 1, 2 or more players, Ages 8 and up.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
