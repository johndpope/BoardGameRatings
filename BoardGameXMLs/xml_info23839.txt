							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boar Hunt: The Dark Ages</name>
									
			<description>Boar Hunt:The Dark Ages Game is a game that appears simple at first glance because there are only 9 spots on the board and 8 playing pieces which all remain on the board during the game after they've been placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boar Hunt has two teams of 3 Dark Ages &amp;quot;Hunters&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;Wild Boar&amp;quot;. One player plays the red set and the other plays the white set. The object of the game is to be the first player to capture their &amp;quot;Boar&amp;quot; between 2 of their &amp;quot;Hunters&amp;quot; either going across the board or along the outside circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 2 phases as in a 9-Mans Morris Game. The players take turns placing their Boars and Hunters on the board and if no one wins in the placement phase, the players take turns moving their pieces to capture their own Boar between their own Hunters while trying to block their opponent from winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though there have been countless games through the centuries which use a small format game board (Mu Torere and TicTacToe to name 2)but Boar Hunt is the first that uses 2 teams trying to achieve different but similar goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boar Hunt:The Dark Ages Game started out as a small game with a leather &amp;quot;Acorn&amp;quot; board with glass playing pieces packaged in an attractive wood box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deluxe version features a solid wood game board with nice details and the playing surface is burnt into the wood using the &amp;quot;pyrography&amp;quot; decorating technique. The playing pieces are hand finished castings of the original playing pieces which look like they were carved in the actual Dark Ages. The playing pieces have a nice heft to them and the game is quite attractive when set up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The size of the board (6&amp;quot;x9&amp;quot;x3/4&amp;quot; - 16cm x 23cm x 2cm)and the sculptural quality of the playing pieces will make this an attractive game to leave set up on your desk, coffee table or bookshelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
