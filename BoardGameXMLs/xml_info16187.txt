							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Power CARDZ Collectable Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Sub-titled: The Definitive Super-Powered Collectible Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With additional 'credits' to: Tim Parsons; Stephen Stegelin; Chris Riley; Dan Harbison; EDITOR-Chester Jacques; PUBLISHER-Gary Reed; PLAYTESTERS-Todd Wartman as well as the many others previously listed; and SKYVERSE.&lt;br/&gt;The LIST of 'artists' is as follows: Gary Barker, Leann Buckley, Andy Dimmitt, Jerry Foley, Gene Gonzales, Brad Gorby, Mark Hester, Don Hillsman, Quinton Hoover, Raff Ienco, Jake Jacobsen, Greg Land, Chris Leidenfrost, David Mack, Deon Nuckols, Sean Parsons, Willie Peppers, Steven Redinger, David Rowe, Kevin Sharpe, Brent Trammell, and Wayne Wong, as well some of the others already mentioned in the credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EACH Power CARDZ Starter Deck consists of 50-CARDs of 2-types: either Characters Cards OR Enhancement Cards and these have this denoted upon them, as well as a set of Rules for playing this. There is also a Power Scorecard sheet printed within this rules sheet, that needs to be enlarged and copied prior to gameplay. The Characters are also divided into HERO and VILLAIN Cards for simplicity's sake. Basically, you have 25-points for each Character, or object, and once these are exhausted, then that particular card is K.O.'d!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a means of obtaining a supplemental Power Scorecard, plus six Power Stones of various colors, as well as a checklist of the entire initial release-300 cards. These have a decidedly comic book look and feel in the components and gameplay, while being geared towards a generic approach for this so as not to impinge upon anyone's IP rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was really released twice with very different rules and many changes to the formatting of the cards.  The second release was based on input from Martin A. Stever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
