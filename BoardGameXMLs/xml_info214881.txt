			<description>Cat detectives have begun investigations to search for missing cats. Will they be able to bring missing cats safely?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed to be enjoyed by two players.&lt;br/&gt;Each player must be a cat-detective to find cats that have disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player mixes his own 15 tool cards to create a stack of cards, then draws 2 cards, puts them in front of him, draws one card into his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;combine 14 cat cards to create a stack of cards, then draw 3 cards and unfold them in the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, the player chooses one of the two cards you have unfolded or one card in your hand. Place the card in one of the cat cards in the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each cat card has the number of tools the cats want. As soon as the number is filled, the number of cards used by each detective is compared immediately. Follow detectives with high numbers of tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When putting down the card, you can not put it down with the same sum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The composition of the 15 tool cards is the same for each player, and once used, cards can not be reused until all cards are used. Take advantage of special cards, remember your opponent and my remaining cards, and use your cards to bring as many cats as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First of all, collect 5 kinds of cats or collect 2 pairs of 2 or more identical cat cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
