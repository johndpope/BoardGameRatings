			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;A basic set of skirmish-level miniatures rules for urban combat between street gangs, law enforcement, special forces, etc. Game scale is 1:1 with each figure representing individual fighters, vehicles, etc. Each turn equals 5 seconds of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; time and the ground scale is 1.5 centimeters equals 1 meter. These rules are intended for use with 28-30mm miniatures but could easily be adapted to smaller scales. Individual models are assigned individual skill levels (Streetwise, Brawling, Ranged Combat) and are given an allotment of Option Points to further customize each figure. Players equip each of their forces based on an Equipment Points system which allows them to add weapons, ammo, and miscellaneous equipment. Combat rules cover close combat, ranged, and special weapons such as RPGs and other heavy arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;'Street F.M.' is designed to represent small-scale conflict in a modern or near future urban environment. By employing scale models to represent the combatants and their surroundings it is possible to create clashes between street gangs, criminals, law enforcers and small military units. In fact any group entering urban combat, armed with everything from improvised weapons through to rocket launchers can be covered by the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
