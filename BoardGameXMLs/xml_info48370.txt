							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shrouded Agendas: The Purifiers</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shroud has changed the world in many ways, some profound, but others more subtle. This is the story of how the Shroud changed a man&amp;rsquo;s beliefs without changing his body. A man named Wilhelm ark-Trasser found himself on a quest that led him into the dark heart of the Shroudlands. There he faced the toughest challenge of all: remaining true to his principles in the face of adversity. The Shroud changed him, and he changed the world. Will the Shroud change you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages, you will find details about Wilhelm ark-Trasser and his group of missionaries, called the Purifying Horde. You&amp;rsquo;ll also encounter three new nonplayer characters, nine new monsters, a new disease called shroudrot, the bizarre device called the shroudmask, and six adventure ideas. All together, it&amp;rsquo;s enough material to launch a full mini-campaign suitable for heroic tier characters, plumbing the fundamental question: when do the ends no longer justify the means?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
