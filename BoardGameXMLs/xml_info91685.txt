			<description>Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed is a third-person shooter video game developed by Locomotive Games and published by THQ for the Wii video game console. It is the third Destroy All Humans! game to be released, and is a stand-alone spin off in the Destroy All Humans! series, set between the times of Destroy All Humans! 2, and the third installment, Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon. Originally, a PlayStation 2 version was to be released alongside the Wii, but was ultimately canceled because of budget cuts. A PlayStation Portable version was also canceled, due to &amp;quot;control issues&amp;quot; involved with translating the Wii version's controls to the port. It is the only game in the series to be released for the Wii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
