							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cowboys and Indie Bands</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather &amp;lsquo;round the campfire, ya&amp;rsquo;ll, and let me tell you a tale of this new band I&amp;rsquo;m sure you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of yet...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1880. The place; the untamed lawless lands of America&amp;rsquo;s west. These are hard times for folk, where the day&amp;rsquo;s work is grueling, thugs and bandits threaten the safety of families and mainstream sellouts pander to a docile society who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know inspirational music if it came up and slapped their chaps. The American federal government does its best to keep things calm, but their resources are simply stretched too thin to help out every small town and family farm in need. Well pardner, that&amp;rsquo;s where you and your friends come in. You&amp;rsquo;ve got that gung-ho spirit, able to handle stampedes, banditos and bored crowds in need of something new to listen to. All you need to tame the Wild West is some courage, some grit, a six shooter and a musical instrument you customized to play how you need it to play. Saddle up, hipster, and become the hero the people need!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
