			<description>Easter is approaching and Benny Bunny has his paws full. He is pleased with his job as the Easter Bunny, but he also needs a sharp mind. According to article IV of the Regulations stipulating the distribution of Easter eggs, there can never be two identical eggs is one basket. Can you help the Easter Bunny distribute the eggs properly?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all four of their eggs into Easter baskets first wins, but placement of the eggs is not random! Using a die, plays can move the bunny, distribute an egg, or gain a carrot which has special other uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
