			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copter has gone down in an illegal military operation in the far-eastern country of Seora. By the terms of the peace treaty that concluded an international war back in the 60's, none of the signatory foreign powers are allowed to perform military maneuvers of any kind in or near Seora. Which is the trouble. A crashed military copter and its captured crew would be absolute proof that military operations have continued to be conducted against Seora, despite all the denials to the contrary. The crew and military personnel need to be gotten out of the country before they can be paraded before the cameras. And only an independent force can do the job without attracting further international disgrace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
