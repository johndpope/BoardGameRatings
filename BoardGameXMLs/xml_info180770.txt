			<description>Make-a-Word Card Game is &amp;quot;a fun game of building words!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the box: &amp;quot;A fast-paced game of word building fun.  Words change quickly as players play a beginning sound card or a word family card.  The first person to play all his cards wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player is dealt a hand of five cards showing either a single letter as the start of a word or a two-letter combination as the end of a word.  The remaining cards are placed in a draw pile.  The first card of the draw pile is turned over, and the first player must then place a word start card before it if it is a word ending or an ending word if it is a starting card.  If the player cannot make a word, he or she must draw a card, and must then either play it if possible or end his/her turn.  Play then proceeds around the table, with each player trying to play either a starting or ending card on top of a card already showing in order to make a new word.  The first player to empty his or her hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
