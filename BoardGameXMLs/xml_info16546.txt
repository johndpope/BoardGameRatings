			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a special United Nations diplomat representing one of the five continents.  Out of the blue, a planetary hazard looms and only swift strategic action will avert it.  There are two races against time.  First you must use your cunning and tactical diplomacy to outwit your opponents.  In the meantime, however, the U.N. Special Envoy is following their course to save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must fly across the world in your specially commandeered aircraft, collecting and using solutions.  You may have to cooperate with other diplomats, who may also have their own hidden agendas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the U.N. Special Envoy moves towards their destination and it is out of your control.  Use your powers wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
