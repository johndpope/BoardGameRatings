							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cubopolis</name>
									
			<description>Cubopolis is a quick and fun game in which two to four crazy architects will try to build the city of Cubopolis on top of a big cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the current player places two little cubes (the &amp;quot;houses&amp;quot;) on two previously positioned sticks (the &amp;quot;roads&amp;quot;), and then a new stick on these little cubes. If the new stick protrudes out one side of the big cube more than any other stick, the player gets the matching territory tile, taking it from the table or stealing it from the current owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware: each construction will make the city even more unstable!&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player causes a collapse, his or her opponents gain one point for each terrritory tile they own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all the players have placed their sticks, and the player with more points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
