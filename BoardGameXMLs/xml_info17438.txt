			<description>Genesis 48 is an expansion to the Advanced Squad Leader game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game sleeve:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Genesis 48 tells the story of a war unlike any before or since. Kibbutzniks defending their homes, fighting alongside their wives. Homemade armored cars trundling into battle. Davidka mortar shells exploding with terrifying shrapnel--due to the soft metal used in the underground shops--with unexpectedly deadly results. The 1948 siege of Jerusalem. Numerous, well-equipped but poorly organized Arab armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's all here in Genesis 48 in a well-researched and extensive module presentation. Three sheets of color die-cut counters include 20 troop-types ranging from elite Israeli Palmach soldiers to Moslem Brotherhood conscripts. Israeli Molotov Tank Hunting Heroes. And more. You also receive numerous new vehicles, including 3 types of Israeli Homemade armored cars, Davidka and Parosh mortars, the Marmon Herrington IV, Jewish 'Sandwich Car' APC, and a variety of half-tracks up-armed with small turrets and a variety of armaments. You also receive a 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; historical map of Old Jerusalem, a color overlay of a kibbutz, three color card-stock play aids and a 32-page VARIANT rulebook full of vehicle and ordnance notes. All of this equipment is provided to use with the Jerusalem Campaign Game and the 15 well-tested scenarios provided.&amp;quot; (Ownership of ASL, Beyond Valor, Hollow Legions, and Croix de Guerre is necessary to play this game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second Edition - GENESIS II The Arab Israeli Wars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;GENESIS '48 2nd Edition aims to polish every rough edge of its predecessor, while adding value in the form of new counters and situations. Rules such as the &amp;quot;Molotov Tank Hunting Hero&amp;quot; and others have been streamlined. Squad types have been reduced appropriately and redundancy in rules addressing their use edited down. Scenarios continue to use mostly non-desert, daytime situations and are moderate to small in size and play on geomorphic boards. An all new Kibbutz geo board is provided and a separate JERUSALEM '48 historical map-based module is coming with a fully remastered map that utilizes larger hexes than its predecessor. Thus, GENESIS '48 2nd Edition is a 100% geomorphic board product with 16 exciting scenarios and a LARGE COLLECTION of 1000+ of new counters!  In keeping with the CH approach used in the Berlin and Omaha releases successfully, all you'll need to own is your ASLRB and a collection of marker counters. EVERYTHING YOU NEED in terms of color, die-cut counters is provided in GENESIS '48 2nd Edition! Punch it out and play, no more hunting through tray after tray of old counters to get into the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
