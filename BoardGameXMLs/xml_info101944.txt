							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Katringa</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System Book 1: Katringa is the first in a series of books from Spica Publishing that describes a complete planetary system and its society, and is designed to be usable in any science-fiction RPG. Katringa is a former corporate mining colony that is gradually being allowed more independence over time, although corruption still pervades the government. Conditions are harsh in the asteroid belt close to the system&amp;rsquo;s energetic primary star, but the riches are worth the risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System Book 1: Katringa includes:&lt;br/&gt;- A realistic planetary system, based on current astrophysical knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;- Details of the worlds in the system, including the mineral-rich Idowa Belt, the gas giants Accra and Yendi and their moons, and Olufemi and the Outer Asteroids.&lt;br/&gt;- A planetary map of Katringa showing major landmarks and settlements.&lt;br/&gt;- A full physical description of the planet Katringa, including a detailed breakdown of its geographical features and timekeeping system.&lt;br/&gt;- Katringa&amp;rsquo;s unique African-influenced society, history and government.&lt;br/&gt;- Important NPCs that may be encountered on Katringa, from all walks of life.&lt;br/&gt;- Adventure Seeds to occupy Player Characters while in the Katringa system.&lt;br/&gt;- Detailed asteroid mining rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
