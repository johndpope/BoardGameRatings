							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der Panzer-Ritter</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The boys in military intelligence have received some disturbing reports about another Nazi super-weapon. This one has a stranger parentage than usual. It&amp;rsquo;s a collaboration between the Nazi advanced robotics engineers and the cultists of the Thule Society.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The German defectors we&amp;rsquo;ve talked to tell us this collaboration is called the &amp;ldquo;Panzer-Ritter&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a massive Nazi battle robot, like you may have encountered before. However, instead of conventional power source, it&amp;rsquo;s allegedly fueled by black magic and it reportedly has both conventional and occult weaponry. Tomorrow night there will be a ceremony in which several Thule Society cultists will conduct a ritual and their soul, life energy (or whatever you want to call it) will power up this &amp;ldquo;Panzer-Ritter&amp;rdquo;. The defectors tell us that if you can stop the ritual from completing, you can keep this from happening. Which, it goes without saying, is much preferable to having to fight this monster once it powers up.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Whether or not you believe in this mumbo-jumbo is immaterial. The brass is worried enough by whatever this actually is that they want you to recon the area. So, your team is going to the village of Donnersburg immediately to investigate. Your orders are to interrupt the ritual and sabotage this war-machine they can activate it. Failing that, your orders are to destroy the Panzer-Ritter before it can be used against Allied forces and attempt to bring back prisoners that we can interrogate.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
