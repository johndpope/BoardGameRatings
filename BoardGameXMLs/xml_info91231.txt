			<description>Hurry Up! presents players with six dice-y challenges &amp;ndash; for example, collect three pairs, assemble a straight, roll all six dice for a sum of 20 or less &amp;ndash; that they must try to complete. You have only 30 seconds for each challenge, and if time runs out before you meet that round's winning condition, then you score nothing. If, on the other hand, you succeed, then you score both the points for that specific challenge (5-50 points) and the sum of the pips on the dice that you collected. After six rounds, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with five regular dice is one blue die, which is wild for some challenges and laden with restrictions in others. In the &amp;quot;dice sum to 20 or less&amp;quot; challenge, for example, the blue die must be a 6 and all the dice must be rolled together. Fail to get that 6 or break the 20 threshold, and you'll have to roll, roll, roll again...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
