							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der Dieb von Maradad</name>
									
			<description>4 families sell themselves mutually old treasures, antiques from their market tables for prizes, as high as possible.&lt;br/&gt;The buyer is willing to pay just a little, so the haggling starts. From time to time anything will be stolen, but noone  wants to have seen it. When you have luck you can trade with a partner. You foist a pretty worthless object on the other and get an expensive antique for it. Your partner hasn't known this though.&lt;br/&gt;This and much more makes &amp;quot;Der Dieb von Maradad&amp;quot; a unusually diversified game. Winner is the player who owns the most money after a certein time (=2 hours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
