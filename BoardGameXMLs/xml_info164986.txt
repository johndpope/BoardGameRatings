			<description>Murder has occurred, but clues are scarce. You must use your wits to discover the identity of the brutally disfigured corpse. From where was it displaced? And why were they killed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of memory, strategy, and deductive reasoning for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns revealing clues and trying to whittle down their evidence in order to deduce why, where, and who their crime was committed against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every set of clues the players can find give them special advantages and gains them points; however, the observant player who can summate the Mystery can gain extra points for victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
