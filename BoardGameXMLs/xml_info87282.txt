							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OZ: Dark &amp; Terrible Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Oz! An Oz where Witches with extraordinary magical abilities vie for power against a steamtech based Emerald City, lead by the Wizard himself. But who has the right to rule all of Oz? Does might make right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the familiar characters from the Land Oz are in Oz: Dark &amp;amp; Terrible, with one exception. The Scarecrow is an Anidum; a creature containing a person's soul that has been transplanted into a mannequin, while the witch responsible walks around in the Husk with all its memories. The Tin Woodsman is a retired member of the Wizard's &amp;quot;secret service&amp;quot;, the Tin Men, who ensure the citizens of the Emerald City remain loyal to their ruler and are willing to use whatever means necessary to achieve their goals. The Cowardly Lion is a disgraced exile from his rightful kingdom after his father betrayed the other Animals in a catastrophic battle against Blinkie, the former Wicked Witch of the South, who refuses to be like other Carnivores who eat the hearts of Humans to gain lycanthropic powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exception is Dorothy. She never went to Oz...yet. You play the role of an Outsider. Or, you can play a native of Oz, be he a mutated Munchkin, tribal Quadling, or even an Automaton, a sentient clockwork machine, among dozens of other possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oz: Dark &amp;amp; Terrible is based on the Land of Oz created by L. Frank Baum. But we have taken Oz in a direction never before seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
