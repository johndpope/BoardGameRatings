What is under the Big Top?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Top shows the interior of a giant traveling circus tent with a center ring viewed from front row and bleacher seating. The exterior of the tent shows the ropes attached to tent pegs outside that hold up the big top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Top is intended for use in modern, pulp, or Horror-themed games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cirque de Tromper is a Horror-themed Savage Worlds adventure for use with this map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cirque de Tromper: A traveling French circus named Cirque de Tromper touring the United States has gained an almost cult fame lately for putting on amazing shows. However, rumors persist of mysterious disappearances of audience members who attend the show. They go to watch the shows but do not return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group has gained a reputation for investigating strange phenomenon, which usually turns out to be hoaxes. Figuring out the trick to the show and why people are disappearing motivates them to act. But is it a hoax this time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
