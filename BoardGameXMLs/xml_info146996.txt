			<description>Trivia game in which the players have to answer questions about occidental culture: History, Literature, Art, Music, Philosophy and Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El Juego de la Cultura (The Game of Culture) contains a board, six pawns, a die and 600 cards with questions, answers and explanations. The boardgame is sold together with the book &amp;quot;La cultura: todo lo que hay que saber&amp;quot; (The Culture: Everything you need to know or Bildung: Alles was man wissen mu&amp;szlig; in the original Edition in German) by Dietrich Schwanitz. The original edition of both the game and the book is German.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very simple and old-fashioned &amp;quot;Roll&amp;amp;Move&amp;quot; trivia game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players roll the die, move the pawn and answer questions about occidental culture. The topic (History, Literature, Art, Music, Philosophy and Science) is determined by the color of the space that the pawn has moved on. The player has to choose between three possible answers. For example:&lt;br/&gt;- Who is the author of &amp;quot;The portrait of Dorian Gray&amp;quot;: (A) William Faulkner, (B) Charles Dickens or (C) Oscar Wilde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answer to the question can be found in the back of the card. There are a few spaces in the track with special rules, such as the player loses a turn (jail) or go back to Start (sarcophagus).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player that reaches the end of the track and responds correctly a question on a topic chosen by the other players wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answer to all the questions can be also found in the accompanying book &amp;quot;La cultura: todo lo que hay que saber&amp;quot; (The Culture: Everything you need to know or Bildung: Alles was man wissen mu&amp;szlig; in the original Edition in German) by Dietrich Schwanitz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
