			<description>Infected!&lt;br/&gt;A game for 2 to 6 players (4 to 6 recommended).&lt;br/&gt;Ages 14 and up&lt;br/&gt;A standard game should last 30-45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object &lt;br/&gt;The object of Infected!  is to make the other players sick.  The winner is the player that makes another player's Wellness drop below zero. &lt;br/&gt; Basic Concept &lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns attempting to make other players sick by playing Infection cards. Each player has the chance to fight off the Infection with his or her natural immunity (dice rolling). &lt;br/&gt;Mutations can also be played on an Infection to change the characteristics of the Infection (higher or lower resistance, extra side effects, etc.) The game is over when a player's Wellness Score reaches zero.  The player that played the infection that put that player's Wellness below zero is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
