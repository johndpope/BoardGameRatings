			<description>Lapsus Calumni 11: Van Housen Manor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's commentary:&lt;br/&gt;My friend Bryan and I have been working on this issue of Lapsus Calumni for a good while now. It started out as a map that I drew then I had the idea of collaborating with my good friend Bryan on a short adventure. I am really glad I did because he came up with some great ideas. Ones I would never have thought of...the main one being the use of fungus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Van Housen Manor is murder mystery where the PCs are hired by a relative to travel to a keep/manor out in the wilds after her uncle has not been heard from in two months. Lady Vorsheen has been in regular contact with her uncle over the years and knew him fairly well through the letters they exchanged. She is concerned how he has taken to his work as a means of dealing with the loss of his wife.In his last communications with her, his writing was different than before and presented an image of a deranged madman. Her last message to him was sent a month ago and she has not received a reply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short, 4 or so page adventure involving a bit of mystery and exploration using the Risus system and comes complete with a map. It could easily be used for another system with a few slight modifications. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
