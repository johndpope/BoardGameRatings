You can create your own schedules, just as you like it! Or why not go in Free Play mode, in one of the twelve different bus models?&lt;br/&gt;It is important that you respect and abide by the timetable and the highway code. Even on the highways and country roads, there is a speed limit! Keep an eye on the bustling city traffic. In addition to the scheduled trips, special trips can be handled by coach.

Ticket sales, vehicle maintenance, variable external displays, animated real-time displays in the cockpit and lots more, for an extra dose of realism.&lt;br/&gt;A major city, including the port, villages, highways and country roads await you. Enjoy the whole new freedom of driving a bus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 12 detailed bus models, including low floor buses, articulated buses, intercity buses, coaches and shuttle buses &lt;br/&gt;- Large game world with the city center, industrial, suburbs, suburban and motorway connections and changing times of day and weather conditions &lt;br/&gt;- Scheduled routes including, charter trips, free play mode and route editor &lt;br/&gt;- Fleet management: buy and sell buses, modify equipment, attach advertising imprints and more &lt;br/&gt;- Pure Realism: Drive a bus with bus-stop announcements, animated ticket sales and of course a strict timetable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
