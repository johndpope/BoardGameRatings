			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is designed to be an action/adventure module for &amp;quot;The Babylon Project&amp;quot; role playing system. It is short enough to be completed within one or two play sessions. The main thrust of the module is the capture and smuggling of two Na&amp;rsquo;ka&amp;rsquo;leen Feeders from their home world to Centauri Prime. This is both physically difficult and highly illegal. It requires a group that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Is available for hire for odd (and often illegal) jobs.&lt;br/&gt;     Has a reputation in the local &amp;quot;underworld&amp;quot; for successfully completing the aforementioned &amp;quot;odd jobs&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;     Is capable of self-defence, especially in ranged combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These points are important as they allow the adventure to run smoothly: a group of Diplomats from Minbar would have no  usiness being hired to smuggle Na&amp;rsquo;ka&amp;rsquo;leen Feeders onto Centauri Prime! As always with a module, it is important that you as the GM are completely familiar with the way this adventure operates. As such, you should read it from front to back at least twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
