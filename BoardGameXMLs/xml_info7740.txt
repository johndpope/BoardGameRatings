			<description>The game based on the spellbinding BBC dramatization of the novels of C.S. Lewis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An extremely light collecting game in which players race to complete their respective set of cards, which are small pieces of a picture that depicts a scene from the TV series. Each player has his or her own scene to collect, but competition is possible by placing cards to impede your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's main feature of note is the interlocking wheels - you roll the die and move one wheel, which in turn rotates the larger wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
