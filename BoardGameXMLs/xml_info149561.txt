							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nine Circles of Hell</name>
									
			<description>New souls have arrived in the Inferno, and it's up to you to guide them to their proper Circle of Hell so that they receive a just punishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nine circles of Hell, the first player to pick up and deliver three souls and return to Limbo wins the game. However, Hell is not an easy place to navigate. Portals leading to the nine Circles can be approached from either of two directions, and each approach teleports you to a different place on the board. To complicate things, when a player uses a portal, the portal spins around so that its approaches are now switched. To deliver your souls, you must puzzle out how to use the portals in your favor to get to where you want to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
