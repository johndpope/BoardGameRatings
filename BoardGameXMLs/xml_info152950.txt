			<description>A simple luck-based pirate-themed race game that requires some very basic map reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a characterful map of a sea with islands and coastlines. Each player takes a list of locations and moves his or her pirate between locations in the order that they appear on his or her list. However, after arriving at a location or being caught by a fellow pirate, a player must pick up a card which may force him or her wildly off course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to visit all of the locations on one's list in order is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
