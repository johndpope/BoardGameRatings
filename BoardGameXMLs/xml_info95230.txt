							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spacego</name>
									
			<description>Spacego is a science fiction wargame in the general mold of Space Hulk, although significantly less complex. A large alien ship is approaching Earth with unknown intentions. Two to four players are heroes who enter the ship with the objective of planting explosives to destroy it. Another player is the &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; of the ship who controls the aliens and tries to prevent the heroes from carrying out their mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes and aliens each have individual record boards to track their attributes, which can change during play. Much of the game revolves around tables of positive and negative events which get rolled on for various reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike in some similar games, in Spacego the hero players can attack each other as well as the aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
