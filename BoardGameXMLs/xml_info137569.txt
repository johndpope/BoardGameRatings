			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons Stalk the Forest!&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdoms of Legend: Encounters line of PDFs present a single well-built encounter for a GM to drop into any campaign. Each installment uses a specific location and offers three encounters at that site at three different challenge ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We do all of the detail work behind the scenes to generate the stats, calculate the CR, choose the treasure, etc: all of the stuff that can seem like the &amp;lsquo;doing your taxes' side of GM-ing. All you have to do is roll some dice and have some fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this episode, a group of green dragons has taken over the site of an old copper mine and stone quarry. Livestock, woodcutters, and miners have all gone missing recently and much of the forest wildlife has fled the area. The village needs brave heroes to deal with this dire threat soon, before it's too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
