							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ante Portas</name>
									
			<description>Ante Portas is a 2 player card game about the campaign of Hannibal against Rome. You have to use your cards to defeat your enemy. The game is assimetrical as the two player have different option for the use of the cards, so playing one or other side is a different playing experience. The game is card driven with a strong bluffing element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Every card has a Roman and a Carthagian part and the players can use only one part, but the card goes to the other player after use.&lt;br/&gt;Each card can be used as an Event, army or other special use depending on your side. Marching time for the Carthagians to move your army or morale/money for the Romans to keep your Empire together. Your choices will decide the faith of your Empire.&lt;br/&gt;It has only 20 Event cards so its very quick, but there is the possibility to deeper startegy and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
