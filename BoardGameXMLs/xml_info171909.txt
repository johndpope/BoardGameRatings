			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marionette Kingdom is a role selection game with a draft mechanism and limited random card drawing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a deck of 9 possible roles, each player gets 3 cards, chooses one and sends the other two to the player on their left, selects one of the ones he got, and discards the last. In clockwise turn order, the players then choose one of their taken roles to activate, gathering resources, buying buildings with special effects and/or worth victory points. The first player to 10 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marionette Kingdom is a follow-up to the game Greedy Kingdoms, and contains some aspects similar to Bruno Faidutti's Citadels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also contains rules for playing An honourable act, which is the Greedy Kingdom mechanism applied to the cards in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
