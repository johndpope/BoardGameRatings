							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 2 – Yakovlev Yak-1</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yakovlev Yak-1 was a Soviet fighter aircraft. It was extremely maneuverable, fast and well armed, and, just as importantly, it was easy to maintain and reliable. Some Soviet pilots considered it to be, in its tactical and technical characteristics, equal to the Messerschmitt Bf 109G. The Yak-1 was also employed by the elite all-female unit including the most famous fighter pilot woman of all times, Lydia Litvyak. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. This is not a complete game. You must own a WW2 Wings of Glory - Starter Set to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
