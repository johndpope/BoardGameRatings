							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1992 Trading Cards</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The 1992 set of AD&amp;amp;D trading cards contains 750 numbered cards. Each card has an image of a character, magic item or monster from a D&amp;amp;D world and the corresponding AD&amp;amp;D statistics on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards were sold in randomized foil packs of 16 cards, with &amp;quot;Set One&amp;quot; of the 1992 series drawing on cards from the first block of 360 cards and &amp;quot;Set Two&amp;quot; drawing on the second 360 cards. A further 30 cards were only available as special promotions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the year, a &amp;quot;Factory Set&amp;quot; was released which was a box containing all 750 cards in the set. These cards had a silver border to distinguish them from the gold-bordered cards in the foil packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
