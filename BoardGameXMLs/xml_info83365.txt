			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Plant, Grow, Reap the Rewards.&lt;br/&gt;After a lifetime wandering, a girl named Claire in the village of Shepherd's Crossing has convinced you to settle down.  With a little care, an untamed plot of land becomes a thriving farm with a wide variety of crops and animals.  Trade your products at the market for new crops, animals, and friends.  Go hunting wild beasts and defend your livestock.  Guard your home against storms, snow, and infestation.  Your farm is the hard of the town of Shepherd's Crossing.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
