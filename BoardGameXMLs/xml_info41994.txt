			<description>Battle of the Beanfield is a solitaire game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and its Nocturne Expansion.  The setting is June 1, 1985, when the Wiltshire police confronted the Peace Convoy who were attempting to stage the fourteenth Stonehenge Free Festival.  You are the driver of Bus 13, which has stalled in a nearby beanfield.  The bobbies are upon your brothers and sisters, and you must see how many you can save!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the Battle of the Beanfield occurred in a neighboring beanfield, you don't need the board or the trilithons - although having them set up nearby might help you picture the scene.  The eight pawns represent the bobbies, and each of them will have corralled eight random hippies.  Each will also have a random card in front of him.  Each round, you will reveal eight cards, one at a time, which you will generally try to place in front of a bobby according to certain rules that depend on the card in front of him.  The card you place will indicate which color of hippies you can free from that bobby's clutches.  In this fashion, you have seven rounds to liberate as many of your brothers and sisters as possible.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Battle of the Beanfield is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and the Nocturne Expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
