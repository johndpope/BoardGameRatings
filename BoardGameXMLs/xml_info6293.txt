							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hourai Card Game: Ganbare Athletics Meet</name>
									
			<description>A card game based off a high school athletics competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards with different values to the winner are used to represent different competitions, and you also have characters with different levels of athletic ability to use to try to win them. You can't reuse your athletes, so you'd like to use your best athlete for a high value competition, but then again, your opponents would want to do the same, and you may use your best athlete in hand for nothing because someone else has an even better one; whereas you could have used a lousy athlete in that case and while still would lose that competition, still have a very good athlete to use later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
