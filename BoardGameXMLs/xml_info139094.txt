							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death of the Prophet (Savage Worlds Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conspiracy theorist printing press was torched last night.  Police are investigating, and the neighbors want answers.  It's hard to tell who did it, and the police are most assuredly going to chalk it up to arson and close the investigation.  Afterall, it was just the Wellstone Prophet, and only whack-jobs read that rag anyway...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This freebie breaks tradition with the other Wellstone City Chronicles in a variety of ways.  It is a series of adventure hooks that all deal with the razing of the Wellstone Prophet.  Instead of forcing the adventure to use the PCs as tools for one of the crime syndicates, it gives them more options for investigating the torching.  Anything from Cryptozologists to Dirty Cops can be played in this adventure, and they all have an angle on why the Prophet was razed, or at least, why they care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is geared for 3 to 4 PCs but more or fewer could certainly be used.  It can be used in conjuction with the other Wellstone City Chronicles, and it can be used in any order with them.  The adventure inside is kept light and suggestions are given for the GM to take the adventure and run with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
