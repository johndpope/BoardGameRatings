			<description>Game found in the New Book of Games, circa 1950.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two, three or four players can take part. If only two or three are playing, they will select their startin points as they like from the four provided and noted in the left hand bottom corner of the board; if four are playing, all four will be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays from his starting point in the direction of Melbourne along the route indicated by the colour noted in the left-hand bottom corner of the board; thus, a player starting from London travels along the white line via St.John&amp;rsquo;s, Quito, Buenos Ayres (Note: this is not an error, this is how it is spelt in the rules), Cape Town, Lisbon, Cairo, Calcutta and Borneo, to Melbourne, which is the end point of the race for all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to throw a six begins the race, moving along his route as many bars as he had thrown points. If a throw takes him to an obstacle, he must move back, miss a number of throws, or wait for his next move till a six is thrown, according to the directions on the board in each case. If a lucky throw lands him on to &amp;ldquo;Following Winds&amp;rdquo;, he moves forward as indicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach Melbourne is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
