							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Popdoku</name>
									
			<description>Popdoku is played on a 9 by 9 Sudoku style board using 9 sets of 9 tiles each tile in a set has the same colour and number on it but each set is a different colour and number (1 to 9)from the others. The rest of the components consist of 4 tile racks, a timer,  a tile bag, a score pad and pencil and a rule book. The rule book contains a number finished Popdoku layouts together with the starting tile layout for each.&lt;br/&gt; One player becomes the &amp;quot;host&amp;quot; and they select one of the layouts and set up the board with the shown starting tile layout for it, typically 20 to 30 tiles.&lt;br/&gt; Each of the other players now draw 9 tiles to their rack. The timer is started and the first player then adds as many tiles to the layout as they like but as soon as they lay an incorrect tile their turn stops, that tile is returned to them and their turn is scored, being the total sum of the tile values that they have added. The player makes up their tile rack to 9 tiles again and the turn moves on. The earlier they get rid of all their tiles the larger the bonus they get (15, 10 5 and 0)&lt;br/&gt;A player may give up his turn to change the tiles on his rack with a random lot from the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
