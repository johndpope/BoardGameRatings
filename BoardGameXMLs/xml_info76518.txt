							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kudos: Rock Legend</name>
									
			<description>Official Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you want to be a Rock Star? Then this new rock band game from the makers of Kudos and Democracy is just for you... The game is part RPG, part life-sim, part Tycoon game. You are a struggling rock singer who puts together their own band, and tries to achieve fame and fortune, from humble beginnings as a starving garage-band. Pick your band-members, choose the band name, write the songs...play the gigs...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rock Legend is a turn-based game, in some ways similar to the gameplay of Kudos. Each turn of the game represents a single day, and it's up to you to decide how the band spends their time. Some of the activities you will need to spend time on include songwriting, rehearsals, auditions, publicity events, practicing individual instruments, and of course, recording your latest album.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
