			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short scenario is intended for a British group of OV investigators, although with some modifications can probably be amended to run anywhere. The scenario is designed as a quick single session investigation, although it can be augmented with extra scenes if required. The investigators actually have a &amp;ldquo;ticking clock&amp;rdquo; of the Countryside Alliance protest which is due to start in London the day after the players are called to investigate the ritual &amp;ndash; however the players aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of this until the end of the scenario, so feel free to change the timing and date, if the players are dragging their heels and obviously aren&amp;rsquo;t going to get there on time.&lt;br/&gt;Hours of darkness and daylight used in this scenario, assume that it is set around March. (3rd March if you want to follow the theme of 3s being a ritually significant number)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
