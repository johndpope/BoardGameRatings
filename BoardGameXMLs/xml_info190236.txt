			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are all crew members of the Dubrovnik, a giant and aging spaceship.  Characters are assigned to a special operations group that does whatever their superiors command--usually this involves traveling to a planetary surface to accomplish some task or gather some resource.  Characters have three sets of Characteristics, each Characteristic having three Attributes.  Characters purchase Attribute ranks from a point pool during character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as a three-page PDF; the third page is a striking and atypical character record sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
