			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collection of playbooks for the RPG Dungeon World will allow you to take on the role as mentally unsound, amoral monsters that will bring their dark talents to your adventuring party. These four classes bring a dark, grungy, gritty texture of depravity to your everyday group of heroes up and on the rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Abomination: Either through primitive science or cruel magics, you have be turned into a disfigured creature, who continues to deform and mutate as he explores the world. Eventually by the end of your journey, without any chance of a cure, you should be a shambling mountain of flesh and limbs. Embrace your new found malformed form and show other what good a few extra arms can do.&lt;br/&gt;     The Butcher: The Butcher, whether being portrayed as a professional killer looking for a job or a person who has too much free time on their hands and a yearning for murder, you play a psychopathic slasher who puts his homicide skill set to use by being part of adventuring party. I mean, adventures kill stuff all the time, don&amp;rsquo;t they? It&amp;rsquo;s just that you take it to a far more personal level of pleasure in ending the life of another.&lt;br/&gt;     The Eater of Dead: Wracked with a strange curse, you suffer from a macabre hunger that drives you to consume the dead flesh of sentient creatures. At first horror was the rational thought to such a disease of the soul, but eventually through giving in, you have discovered that having such a appalling diet mends your wounds and increases your prowess. However, feasting on such a disgusting meal isn&amp;rsquo;t without its drawbacks. For if you indulge too hastily in your graveyard banquet, you can lose yourself and turn into loathsome Ghoul, doomed to attack friends and foes alike.&lt;br/&gt;     The Unholy Warrior: A wandering and corrupt soul who beacons for the favours of evil spirits and demons to grant him boons on his quest.  Going through the world for self-gain, or in the service of a dark master, the Unholy Warrior leaves a trail of destruction in his wake as he punishes the innocent and the guilty alike. Do the work of vile gods and demons as you teach the world the meaning of fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
