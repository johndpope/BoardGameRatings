							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sergeants Repple-Depple 1</name>
									
			<description>From Lost Battalion Games Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repple Depple 1 brings a truckload of additional support for your war and includes a whole lot more battlefield, with two large maps and two small maps, 12 double-sided map sections in all.  Each map is puzzle-cut to lock the pieces together to help avoid an accidental shift which always seem to throw your squads into disarray.&lt;br/&gt; Lots of toys are great to have, and Repple Depple 1 loads the table with a wide range of vehicles and guns made famous on the Eastern Front.  From the PzKwI to the King Tiger, the Josef Stalin tank to those odd little Soviet airborne tankettes.  Almost every tank from the Eastern Front is waiting for you to strap in and start fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
