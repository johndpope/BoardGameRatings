			<description>World Grand Prix (ザ・サーキット?, &amp;quot;The Circuit&amp;quot;) is a 1986 Sega Master System video game that is based on the arcade game Pole Position. During the course of the game, the player uses a Formula One style car. He or she has to drive the car as quickly as possible while ﻿navigating through turns and other vehicles on the road. A formal scoring system is not used; players are not ranked by position unlike most racing games. This kind of timekeeping would not be used in a subsequent video game until the Nintendo Family Computer release of Taito Grand Prix: Eikou heno License the following year. From the 1970s Ferrari pictured in the main menu and the circuits used in the game, the game appears to be loosely based on 1970s Formula One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a third-person perspective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;World Grand Prix (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
