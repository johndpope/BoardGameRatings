							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ricochet Postcard</name>
									
			<description>This game is an homage to the great designer Alex Randolph. Basically, it is Ricochet Robots made with a postcard. A player throws a postcard at the center of a table, all the players try to figure out what is the minimum amount of overturn on its side the postcard must do to touch the edge of the table, the player that said the smallest number must check the claim. If he/she was right the player cuts the first border of the postcard (see the image) and keep it as a token of his/her points. Otherwise the player cuts the border and crumple it up as a negative point. the postcard is now more irregular and smaller, therefore is harder to guess right. If a player collect 2 crumpled up tokens is out of the game, the game end when everybody is eliminated or the card cannot be cut anymore (end of the dotted lines. The survived player in the first case or the player with the most stars in their token in the second case is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
