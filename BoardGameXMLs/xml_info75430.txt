							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wittstock</name>
									
			<description>Wittstock: Baner's wasted chance is the fifth game in the 30 years war series of print and play wargames by TCS Games. It is a small game for with a 22&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; playing map, 216 counters and six pages of rules.&lt;br/&gt;It uses a leader activation chit system for determining which units each player may move and have combat with in each phase, while for the rest the system is very simple and introductory, being a derivation of one of the better system of the Seventies (SPI's quadrigame system used for several quadrigames, like 30 years war): no ZOCs, presence of artillery units (fixed but they can be captured by the opponent), cavalry charges, dragoons, morale (added in this system, not present in the original), death of leaders, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Victory is based only on breaking the morale of the opponent army, through disruption and elimination of his units.&lt;br/&gt;Very good for adding more players to the wargamers community, as it is fast, cheap and easy to set up and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
