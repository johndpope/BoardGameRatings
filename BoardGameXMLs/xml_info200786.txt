			<description>Vulture Race is a simple game where players race around a track. On each player's turn, he rolls a die, and either moves his piece ahead that many spaces and distributes the same number of cards to other players, or takes that many cards and moves another player's piece forwards that many spaces. The game ends when someone crosses the finish line, or the cards run out. Only the first and second place players on the track are eligible to win, and the one with the most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
