			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;This fast moving card game has all the action of a real baseball game.  Players take turns at bat and in the field.  You can strike out, foul out, tag a runner at first, hit a home run, field a foul ball and more.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box also functions as a score keeping device by marking the score with the provided paperboard bats into slots at the proper numbers. The game is mostly dictated by the spinner and the cards are primarily the game board and status markers for the spinner results. The one exception is the fielding cards which will give variable results for base running after hits are spun. There is little to no decision making in the game as it is totally run by the spinner and fielding cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions are in English and French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
