							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Rule: Edge of War</name>
									
			<description>The Pocket Universe is entering an era of tension as power surges throughout the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Universal Rule: Edge of War introduces three new planet cards that integrate with the 4th X, exterminate. The Roza System is a protective pacifist planet, while Vianov has a very destructive Eater of Worlds ability. And in-between is Wovis, a sacrifice of a planet that destroys your own planets for great control over the battlefield. These three cards are shuffled in and three random cards are removed to mix up the Universal Rule game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion was born from strech goals during the KickStarter campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
