							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kelly Party Surprise</name>
									
			<description>It's Kelly's Birthday, but the presents have gotten all mixed up! Help Kelly match the presents to the friends who brought them. This game is part Memory and part set matching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 20 Friends Cards with the matching present shown in the corner; 20 Gifts for Kelly: 4 yellow stars, 4 pink hearts, 4 blue flowers and 4 purple squares with different gifts inside; 2 Kelly Cards; and instruction sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are dealt out evenly to players. If a player is dealt a Kelly card, she places it face up beside her and is dealt another card so that each player has the same number of Friends Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presents are turned upside down in the center. Players take turns turning over a present to see if it matches the present on one of the Friends cards she holds. If it does, she shows it to everyone along with the card and sets the two aside. If it does not, she shows the other players what is inside the present and turns it back over. If a player has a Kelly card, she can use it to turn over all the presents of one shape until she finds the present she is looking for. The Kelly card is then turned over and cannot be used again. The winner is the first to find all the presents matching their Friends cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second way to play is to turn the presents upside down in the center and put the rest of the cards in a draw pile. Player turns one card over and tries to find the matching present. If the present matches the player takes the Friends card &amp;amp; present and sets them aside and turns over the next card. If the present does not match, the next player gets to turn over a present and try to match the card, continuing until a player matches the present to the card. If a Kelly card is turned over, the player turns the next Friends card over and uses the Kelly card to help her turn over the presents until she finds a match. Winner is the player with the most matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
