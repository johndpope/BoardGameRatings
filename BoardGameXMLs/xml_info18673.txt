			<description>&amp;quot;A game of MONEY, POWER, and FUN For the OFFICALs and UNOFFICALS in and out fo the great state off TEXAS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dedicated to the FIGHTIN' and FUN LOVIN' members fo the TEXAS LEGISLATURE&amp;quot;  (direct quote from box cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A satirical game about collecting enough votes and cash to achieve office in Texas.  The bank in Sharpstown plays banker &amp;quot;under the table and from a brown bag,&amp;quot; while another player (the election judge from Duvall County) tracks the winning conditions.  The rule sheet is half a page long, and does not include any instructions other than setting up and winning the game.  However, it appears to be a simple &amp;quot;roll the dice, react to square landed on&amp;quot; game while the players tour a linear board (the only path is to follow the outline of the state) until they can get enough votes and cash to reach the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
