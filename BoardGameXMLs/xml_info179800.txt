			<description>Cork and Screw is a card game for 4-6 players. It has 288 cards total which includes Question, Answers and Challenge cards. It won't be for everyone. It is sexual, fun and ornery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game holds some similarities to games like Cards Against Humanity and Apples to Apples. The difference is in order to advance to the next level, the player must complete a challenge card and be judged by the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
