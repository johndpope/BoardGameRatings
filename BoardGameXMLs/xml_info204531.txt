							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mudded Manse (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden in the dismal, swampy depths of the Salt Mire, the Mudded Manse is a well-kept secret among the wealthy and powerful, who travel here to rest and receive treatments for various afflictions. Built around a pit of bubbling mud, reputed to have miraculous cure-all powers, the secluded manse is well worth the trouble of a visit if one is afflicted with a terrible disease. Thanks to the powerful clientele frequenting the manse, a secondary trade in political information has developed, as the comfortable atmosphere encourages visitors to loosen their tongues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Places of Power are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a flavoursome locale such as a remote temple, borderland fort or reclusive wizard&amp;rsquo;s demesne. Ready to be plugged into almost any home campaign, each instalment can be used as a waystop on the road to adventure, the home of a powerful NPC or even as a mini-adventure site in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
