			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each release for Crawthorne's Catalog of Creatures for the Pathfinder RPG presents a single, new creature for your Pathfinder RPG game, as presented by the famous and retired monster hunter and adventurer, Lord Crawthorne. Each release presents game stats for the new creature, as well as three adventure ideas to help insert them into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Imperial Land Griffon is essentially a wingless hippogriff, bred for use by grounded cavalry. Although there are some that have escaped to live and breed in the wild, most live in captivity to be trained to serve as war mounts or for scouting. Either is very dangerous and not to be underestimated simply because they cannot fly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
