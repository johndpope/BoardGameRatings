			<description>Children's card game that will help a little with their mental arithmetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four cards are placed face up. Each player gets 6 cards. On their turn a player may play a card with the same value as one of the cards in the four face-up cards. He then takes both cards and starts a pile of won cards. Alternatively, he may play a card from his hand that is the total of two or more face-up cards:&lt;br/&gt;Example. The four cards face up are 2, 3, 5, 7. The player uses an 8 card from his hand to take the 5 and the 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The face-up cards are replenished after every turn so that each player starts their turn with 4 cards in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players run out of cards in their hand, they are dealt six more cards each and the game proceeds as before. When there are not enough cards to complete a later deal, the game ends and the one with the most won cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
