			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close Assault is one of the earliest wargames for the PC.  The program came on a cassette tape.  It could be played on the TRS-80, Apple II, and Atari 800.  Because of the limits of memory and computing power, the game included a board, with hexes and counters, which allowed players to better keep track of the position of units on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is a simple man-to-man wargame, About as complex as Panzer Leader, but with no tanks, vehicles, or special weapons.  In head-to-head play, it is meant to be a double-blind game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game was also released on 5.25 inch floppy disk (Apple II, Atari 8-bit) and the single board included was an exact copy of one of the original boards from the AH board game Squad Leader.  The game was squad level however the computer determined individual casualties for each squad as combat was resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By National Micro Associates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
