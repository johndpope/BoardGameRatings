			<description>Prepare for a great journey into the Japan of myths and legends...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kigetsu is a semi-cooperative game which tells the story of the founding gods of Japan - the kami in ancient times. The action takes place into two different worlds: the celestial world, represented by a Taiji (Yin Yang); and the terrestrial world, represented by a map of Japan. The players represent kami and their mission is to give life to the earth. To achieve this, they will play counters, which represent vital energy (ki), in the two different worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can play one counter par turn, but they have cards which represent shintai, that is to say temporary incarnations. With them, they can gather and spread more energy into the world. Furthermore, at the end of the game, the most powerful kami wins, that is to say, the player who gained the biggest number of shintai - or cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By playing counters on the map of Japan, the players will spread the vital energy to the terrestrial world. Each city that is attained brings extra cards to the players and unlock new cards. The game actually finishes when the all the map of Japan is covered with counters. However, the players fail their mission if they finish the stack of cards before that point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By playing counters on the Yin Yang, the players enter the celestial world and challenge the dark powers, which may be helpful to restore the balance of power if counters are scarce. The Yin Yang is a secondary board inside the game box, which contains an ultraviolet lamp : when turned on, this lamp reveals the symbol of a moon on the counters, which was invisible before. The ki thus changes into kigetsu, &amp;quot;moon energy&amp;quot;, which allows to start a cosmic-scale battle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
