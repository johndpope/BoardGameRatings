			<description>From the Back of the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandy, the cuddly sea lion, is lost in the circus and your child is invited along! Together they can explore all the excitement, fun and adventure of the Big Top. They can romp with the clowns, get shot out of a cannon, disappear in a magician's hat, play with jugglers and much, much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandy's Circus Adventure introduces the first interactive cartoon ever. Your child designs his or her own story. Should Sandy visit the clowns or the animals? Play with the sea lions or see what's in the magician's hat? Let your child decide. With over 50 choices, Sandy's adventures are never the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No instructions or manuals are necessary. All the directions and controls are right on the screen. There's even an audio &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; mode to lend kids a hand. Rich digital sound along with full color animation provide a magical play time experience. A circus for the whole family, right in your living room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
