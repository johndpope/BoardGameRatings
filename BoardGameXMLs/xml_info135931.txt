			<description>Choose your gear. Balance your skills. Hone your strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BattleBrik: The Ultimate Warrior is a tactical miniatures board game that pushes the envelope of the LEGO Games line into new strategic territory. Influenced by Ninjago,  BrikWars, The Deadliest Warrior TV show, HeroScape, and other miniatures games, this game will allow you to finally find out who the Ultimate Warrior of your LEGO minfig collection is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base game comes with all the dice, tiles, cards, and basic warrior parts needed for 2 to 4 players to quickly start your battles. Players can also purchase &amp;quot;Warrior Packs&amp;quot; (similar to existing Ninjago blisters) or make custom warriors from their existing minifigures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players outfit their warrior with weapons and armor, build and balance their Skill &amp;amp; Gear dice, construct a Strategy deck of cards....then face off in the customizable arena!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key concept of the game is that different colored tiles represent different skills and body locations for the warrior.  Based on your warrior's balance of skills, his Skill dice will have a different number of tiles for each of the colors.   Likewise, the number and color of tiles on his Gear dice will depend on which armor and weapons you choose.  Finally, the experience of the warrior will help him hone his strategy by determining how many and which Strategy cards can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is fast and furious, with both tactical and strategic decisions. The goal of the game is to have your warrior be the last one standing in the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Basic game and an Advanced game are provided so it can be played by all ages and experience levels. Since it can be described as &amp;quot;easy to learn, but hard to master&amp;quot;, it will keep both the casual beginner and grizzled wargamer engaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
