			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Buck Plugs: Arson Wight, the first in the Buck Plug line from 4 Devils Studio. With Buck Plugs, our goal is to provide interesting, easy to learn, and above all &amp;ndash; fun add-on rules for your d20/OGL based games at a very low price (namely, one buck!). In Buck Plugs: Arson Wight, we introduce you to a new and terrifying form of undead. The Arson Wight haunts burnt out ruins, waiting for unlucky living beings to destroy with fire. Keep watching for upcoming Buck Plugs releases, and all the upcoming products from 4 Devils Studios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arson Wights are humanoids who perished in fires they themselves set, and who rise from death to continue their pyromaniacal ways. Their scorched bodies are unrecognizable to any who knew them in life, blackened bones twisted and flesh melted. Arson Wights almost always dwell in the ruins of buildings they have burned, frequently the scene of the fire in which they lost their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
