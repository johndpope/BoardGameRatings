			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colours of Magic: Orange Fifth Edition Update&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Spectrum Shift: Chromatic Arcana Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orange is the colour of Chaos, Disorder and Change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The power of Orange is in the ending, changing or manipulating of things. Those that master it can destroy, polymorph or change matter according to their whim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some few have the magical potential and right mindset (some might say wrong mindset) to draw power directly from the colour Orange. This ability usually ends up twisting them somewhat? if they were not already twisted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Class options, one for each of Cleric, Sorcerer and Wizard&lt;br/&gt;    a reclassification of one eleventh of the spells of the players handbook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
