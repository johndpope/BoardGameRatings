							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainous Pirates</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cruising the sea lanes in search of loot, captives and reputation corsairs&amp;rsquo; predations strike fear into the hearts of merchantmen and sailors alike. So often, though, the sea wolves themselves are little more than one-dimensional enemies that exist only to fall before the PCs&amp;rsquo; blades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villainous Pirates banishes this problem by presenting 30 Pirates of Note and nine Pirates of Renown ready for the time-crunched GM to quickly and easily insert into almost any campaign. Each pirate benefits from an extensive write-up including notes on their background, personality, mannerisms and distinguishing marks as well as a fully detailed stat block. Pirates of Renown also come with plot hooks making it easy to insert them into almost any campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pirates of Note are moderately famous pirates (CRs 3 &amp;ndash; 7) that could serve as a crew&amp;rsquo;s champion, first mate or even the captain of a small vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pirates of Renown are famed freebooters (CRs 9 -11) that captain their own vessel. Known for their seafaring skills, battle prowess and love of loot they make fearsome enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
