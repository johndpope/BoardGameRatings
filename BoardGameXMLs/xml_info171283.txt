			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also known as Super-spit in Wisconsin, Spit 2 in Texas, Rush in Missouri, and Spit 3 in Kentucky,[citation needed] California Spit is a fast paced shedding card game that has the added bonus of shuffling the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two players sit at opposite sides of a vertical playing surface. The dealer deals half of the cards to each player. The cards are held face down. Every round, each player plays four cards face up vertically in between both players and slightly closer to themselves. Once both players have done this, they look for two or more cards having the same number. When a player finds one, he places another card on top of the cards with that number until all of the cards with the common number are covered. In other words if there are three fours out then all three cards can get a new card on top of it. If a four is played on top of a four it is called a double, and the player may place a third card on top of it. This requires that players pay attention to the cards they are laying down on the pile. If a player runs out of cards then that player wins. When there are no more groups of cards remaining, each player scoops up the four piles directly in front of him or her and places them face down on the bottom of his or her deck. That round ends and the next begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some versions of the game, there is a move called &amp;quot;spitting&amp;quot; in which the player is allowed to spit on the other player to distract him/her. It is common that they call &amp;quot;doubles&amp;quot; to inform the other player what they did. ment for {21+ age} a longer period of time usually 3 hours is the min, and 4 is the max.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
