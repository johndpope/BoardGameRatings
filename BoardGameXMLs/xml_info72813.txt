							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadowrun (Genesis)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowrun for the Genesis was released 1 year after the SNES adaptation of the pen and paper RPG, but is an entirely different game set in the same universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the title, players take the role of Joshua and participate in a number of open-ended Shadowruns to gain money and karma. Combat is real time from an overhead perspective. The game also features an alternate combat system that players navigate when they enter the matrix, the difficulty of which differs based on the quality of the player's cyberdeck and the programs they have loaded onto it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
