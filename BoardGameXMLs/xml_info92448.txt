			<description>From &amp;quot;What is This Document?&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is an extension of the Burning Empires roleplaying game. It provides new lifepaths, traits and technology for inclusion in any Burning Empires game. If you wish to use this document in your game, discuss the options with your group and be sure to get their approval. The Hussars are not particularly powerful or anything of the sort, but it&amp;rsquo;s simply polite to discuss additonal rules with your group before including them in a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information in this document was written by a fan of the game, Sydney Freedberg. Sydney posted his ideas on our forums and Chris was so impressed, he asked me (Luke) if we could put together some illustrations of the Hussar recon sled. Who was I to say no?! So Sydney provided the fuel, Chris provided some kick ass sketches, and you get to benefit from the heat of the fire.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Luke, October, 2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
