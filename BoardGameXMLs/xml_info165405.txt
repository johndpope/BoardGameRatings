			<description>Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-standing educational 7 Wonders series keeps getting better and better! The fifth installment, 7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover, adds an entirely new game component, new Wonders and a new and exciting material &amp;ndash; Alien Energy! The goal is still to construct exciting new Wonders by swapping same-colored runes to make matches of three or more to the tune of exploding bonuses. Make enough matches before time runs out to fill your arsenal with power-ups and the materials needed to complete your Wonders before your very eyes! As you complete each gameboard, bricks, water, gems, landscape, and now &amp;ndash; Alien Energy! Excel and face bonus levels that take you deep below the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface to win materials like gold to adorn your Wonders! There is also, for the first time, a secondary game component to build a village! Mini-games rewards players with buildings and decorations to create their own village. Build all 7 Wonders and then unlock a magical 8th location, Nazca Valley! New gameplay and new Wonders await in Ancient Alien Makeover!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
