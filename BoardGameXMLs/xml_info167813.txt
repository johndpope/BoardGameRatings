			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elite Encounters Rulebook will be a single-edition book containing everything you will need to organise and play a roleplaying game in the setting of the Elite universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be available in a variety of formats, both electronic and hardcopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the final contents of the book have not yet been set in stone, the general content will be:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Generation Rules, including blank character sheets, ship stats and ship record sheets&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay Rules, including a single page (pullout) rules summary&lt;br/&gt;Miniatures Rules, including card model miniatures, measuring devices for movement and combat and card model 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;Background information on the Elite Universe&lt;br/&gt;Character and NPC Templates&lt;br/&gt;3 Sample Adventures, including pregenerated player characters, set in a region developed specifically for the RPG and featured in the computer game Elite: Dangerous!&lt;br/&gt;If we can fit any more content into the book then we will!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illustrations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book will be richly illustrated using the work of a variety of people. Frontier Developments PLC have made their catalogue of Elite: Dangerous concept art available and will allow the use of in-game footage from Alpha and Beta builds of the game prior to the full release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition Daftworks will be creating custom artwork and an independent artist will be providing illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed in Collaboration with Frontier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RPG will be developed in close association with Frontier Developments PLC, allowing the author unprecedented access to the resources of the computer game that forms the foundation for this book. The universe of Elite is broad and detailed and Frontier themselves are creating huge amounts of background and history for their new game - Daftworks have exclusive early access to this information as well as having a small part in providing background material and being involved with creating a &amp;quot;writer's bible&amp;quot; for the authors releasing books with Elite: Dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that we are on the front line for any background information that is developed, and as much of that as possible will be included in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to this collaboration we are hoping to add more rich content, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World Guide for selected gameplay area of space&lt;br/&gt;Map of the Core systems for each organisation&lt;br/&gt;Large-scale map of the galaxy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
