							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steal: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Steal is a fast-paced card game for 3 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One briefcase contains thousands of dollars; the other cases are empty. Players must steal cases from each other, hoping to be in possession of the case with the money by the time the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will put their best &amp;lsquo;Poker Face&amp;rsquo; to the test as they try to bluff their way to victory. Getting the money is relatively easy; keeping hold of it is the difficult part, especially if someone plays the dreaded &amp;lsquo;Switch&amp;rsquo; card!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
