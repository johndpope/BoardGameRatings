			<description>Kajko i Kokosz: Przygody Woj&amp;oacute;w is a third game in the series of Kajko and Kokosz adventures. In this game players try to collect as many treasures as they can and avoid fighting with brigands and other ruffians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game there are formed 10 stacks (differed by color and number) of cards (with treasures and brigands) in the middle of the table. Each player receives 2 or 3 characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On every player's turn the player has to choose one of the two following actions:&lt;br/&gt;1. She can take one card from one of the stacks and place it face up in front of her.&lt;br/&gt;2. She can send all previously gathered cards to the castle using one of her characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to gather as many cards as they can, but the more they have the more they fear to lose it all. What's more action 2 can be performed only 2 or 3 times per game (each character can be sent once). The players also try to remember in which stack the bad cards were taken, because every stack contains the same set of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all of the players have sent all their characters or when nobody has anything more to send and there are no cards to draw. The treasures has different values, which players count. The players who scored the most is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an advanced variant, which present the 10 bonus point card, which is given at the end of the game to the player who gathered most coins amongst his treasures. There is also a rule that when a player draws coin in the hand, she has to give it to another player and steal all coins from the chosen player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
