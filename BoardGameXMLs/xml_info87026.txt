			<description>User Summary: Submission for the Game Chef 2010 Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtitle: A Game about Human Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Forty brave men of Skin have been trained for a mission never attempted before. They will fly in the sky with some old bombers that have been kept in Skin for all this time, some B-25 Mitchell of the second world war, and they will bomb the main generator of The City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mission will almost surely mean death for all of the people that will take part in it. Their bodies will explode in thousands of pieces, will be vaporized, and nothing of them will remain so that someone will be able to celebrate a funeral, a last farewell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, they are right now flying to the core of the City. Through their memories, we will find out what makes them to take part in their last mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story created with this game will explore the weeks before the mission, while the characters were training. In these moments they all were near each other, so in every scene there will be a conflict between two of the characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
