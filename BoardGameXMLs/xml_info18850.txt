			<description>An adult oriented drinking game with cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pit Bissed takes a few favorite parlor games, blends them with traditional drinking rules and shakes them up with some riotous new cards to create the ultimate party game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pit Bissed is a great way to get to know your friends better, and an even greater way to quickly make new ones. The more times you play, the greater the game becomes, especially with the input and influences of new players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play Pit Bissed with friends all night long or just a couple of hands to warm up before other activities. Tell your friends to bring a few jokes and tricks so you are all ready to party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
