			<description>Loosely based on Chuck Barris' short-lived 1967 game show hosted by Bob Barker, each parent and child begins the game with a pawn on Start. The father reads a question aloud to one of the children and both write down their response. If the answers match, the father scores a card worth 25 points and he advances his pawn the number of spaces indicated on the card. If the answers do not match, the child&amp;rsquo;s pawn advances one space. The game continues with all players changing roles as questioner and responders. The winner is the player who scores 250 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three of the spaces of the gameboard are marked &amp;quot;toy store&amp;quot;. A player gets a chance card whenever landing here. Should a player land on the space indicated by the card held, that player is declared the winner immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by one family with the participants playing as individuals, or as a contest between families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
