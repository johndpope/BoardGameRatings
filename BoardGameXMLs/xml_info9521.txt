			<description>For 2 to 6 players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to move around the board (via dice roll), respond (as an individual or team) to category challenges when given a FIRST name, and be the first to the end.  Feels much like Pictionary and such, except if stumped by a category, you can always choose to roll and move BACKWARDS instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 major categories: Stars &amp;amp; Co., Musicians, History/News Makers, Fictional Characters, Athletes &amp;amp; Co., and Authors/Artists.  Draw a first name card, and name someone famous in that category, with that first name, within 30 seconds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well, there are 'nameoff' and 'namedrop' squares.  Nameoff is a back-and-forth all-play, until 30 seconds pass where neither team can name any more people; last accepted answer wins the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;Namedrop is solo challenge to name (dice roll) number of famous people with that first name within the time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever there is any question of validity (famous? first name matches? category fits? nickname or short form valid?), your OPPONENT(s) are the judge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
