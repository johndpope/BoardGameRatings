			<description>Select one of eleven unique playable gunslingers and seek revenge as a lone wolf or with up to eight other bandits in local and online co-op. Master the specialized controls of each character, collect gold from fallen foes to purchase upgrades, and imbibe a bit of liquid courage and unleash a tornado of lead across the dusty plains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the evil railroad baron Clayton Boon decided to build a track to Hell, he didn&amp;rsquo;t reckon on a crazed shaman raising a posse of embittered psychopaths from the dead to stop him. Now they&amp;rsquo;ll pursue him across the whole Wild West, fighting their way through hordes of bandits, bears, braves and boogeymen just to find Boon and repay their debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcade Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose between eleven different gunslingers each with their own unique control scheme and methods of attack to master. Some characters require the finesse of a gamepad while others are strictly bound to mouse controls to mount their offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Versus Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Square off against some of the most dangerous gunslingers this side of the Mississippi in the white-knuckled versus mode. Use each character's distinct advantage to cut down your opponent and use any item in the corral to gain the upper hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather a posse of up to nine other players in the chaotic online cooperative mode and battle across the wild plains for fame, glory, and bragging rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
