			<description>The fate of the solar system is at stake as several cosmic factions struggle for supremacy. As a commander of a star fleet, it is your duty to position your forces at the right time at the right planet and claim it for your faction. Beware, the strongest faction will claim the entire planet and there is no space for runners-up in the solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solar system consists of 12 planets, each of them surrounded by six grid points where battle stations may be placed. Some grid points border several planets, hence making their battle stations more powerful. You claim a planet if you have the most battle stations at the end of a round. You win if you claim 3/4/5 planets (5/4/3 players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round you compete for the next planet in order. You do so by playing cards representing either two forces (black) or one force (white). One black card may be played each turn together with none or one white card. The black cards must follow suit while the white cards may be played together with any suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you pass you take the tricks of all forces with a majority and places one battle station for each trick. Also, an early pass gives you an early pick of new cards from a drawing row. However, it makes the remaining tricks easier to get for the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the round ends, you claim the planet if you have the most battle stations around it. Also, any previous planets that were tied in previous rounds are reassessed to see if the majority has changed. (Remember that a battle station may reach more planets.) One of the tricks allows you to change the order of the planets to take advantage of well positioned battle stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
