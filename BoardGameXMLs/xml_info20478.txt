			<description>Each player throws the Dice, the highest scorer starts first. The person who starts to play shakes the Dice and moves his marble the number of cups shown on the Dice. The other players do the same in turn. Should one player land on the cup already occupied, that player must go back to the beginning and start again. The winner is the first person to occupy the centre cup by throwing the right number on the Dice. Sould the number be too great, he counts towards the middle and then counts backwards from the middle the extra number of cups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
