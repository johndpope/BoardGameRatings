			<description>This ca. 1940 football game consists of a thin cardboard field with a single fold and an attached metal spinner; three wooden tokens for marking downs, yards to be gained and quarter; a metal football on a stand; a cardboard 10-yard marker; a results sheet; and line-up and scoring sheets for individual games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose between 5 offensive plays (line plunge, end run, off tackle, trick play and forward pass). The spinner has numbers from 1-15, and each of these numbers has a result under each play. There also are results tables for punt, kick-off received, and run back of kicks and punts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The usual rules of football apply and highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
