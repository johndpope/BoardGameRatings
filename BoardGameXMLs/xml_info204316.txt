			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toughest Card Game Around&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Party Favorite Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MACHO... STRONG... COURAGEOUS...&lt;br/&gt;that's what it takes to turn the next card in this exciting, fun game of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher your score, the more MACHO it takes... Do you have it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any player starts the game by drawing and laying face up on the table one, or as many cards as he chooses, but he must draw at least one card. He may stop at any time. The points on each card are counted until the player stops, and are added to his score, unless he turns up a hog or a pig card during the draw. Hogs and Pigs can take away a player's points. Other MACHO cards can force a player to draw five cards with possibly devastating consequences. A game ends when a player scores 100 points or more. It's Press-Your-Luck-style gaming as you must choose carefully when deciding to draw the next card!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
