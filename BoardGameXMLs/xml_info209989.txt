			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years ago the witch priestess Segolia established a temple in the frontier town of Feluxia. In exchange for healing services to the town, Segolia only demanded the weekly sacrifice of orcs and other raiding humanoids. As the frontier has pushed further away from the town and the area has become more civilized, raids by monstrous type humanoids have become few and far in between. However, Segolia still demands her sacrifices, and some of the townsfolk have begun to disappear. The mayor has hired the PCs to investigate Segolia&amp;rsquo;s temple as he believes her to be behind the recent disappearances, but is fearful of confronting her himself or sending the town militia for fear of offending her if she is not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4th - 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
