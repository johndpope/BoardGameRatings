			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have your PCs ever entered a broad landscape where you didn't have anything planned? So you pulled out a random encounter table, rolled, and *blam* - combat! What if you had another tool in your arsenal to use in these situations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open Spaces products aim to answer that question or at least offer some guidance as you enter those wild, uncharted areas with your PCs. The next time the party chooses to go gallavanting across the world, you can use these supplements to suggest new encounters both for good and ill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this case, Open Spaces: Fields can be used when your party traipses across some farmer&amp;rsquo;s fields or some Lord&amp;rsquo;s demesne. You might let it go... or perhaps they'll run into:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bandits&lt;br/&gt;    A strange creature &lt;br/&gt;    Or just a group of farmers talking about how horrific the weather has been&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the Little Spaces series, Open Spaces offers a collection of tables along with some examples and a worksheet to help inspire you quickly. So pull out a few dice and see what's waiting in the fields for your PCs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
