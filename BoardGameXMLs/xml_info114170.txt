							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Word Game</name>
									
			<description>The Word Game is played by placing pennies on the board as each player spells words until one player wins. 24 pennies are needed to play. One player plays heads, the other plays tails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players flip a penny to start. Players spell words by covering each letter in the word being spelled. A consonant may only be played once unless it appears more than once in the word being played. Vowels may be played more than once, but only if your opponent's coin is showing. If playing a vowel previously played by your opponent, simply flip the coin over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player to make a word of two or more letters wins. Or, when all possible letters are played, the player with the most pennies wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
