			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the history of superhero comics, the concept of a multiverse has been used by numerous publishers to allow for characters to go on non-canon adventures, explore story options that would dramatically alter the primary narrative of the heroes and ask the question, &amp;ldquo;what if...?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superstring Multiverse is an attempt to recreate that freedom in your M&amp;amp;M tabletop game. Utilizing the characters from our Superhero Support line of products as a base starting point, we have decided to craft a vast and complicated multiverse of parallel worlds and infinite options to integrate into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the Superstring Multiverse core supplement we will explore basic ideas and theories on the operation of the Multiverse. We will also introduce a few new powers that facilitate travel between worlds and provide some guidelines on different ways to integrate characters from one world to another. Whether you would like to play a band of dimension- hopping heroes chasing down cosmic threats from reality to reality, or simply run the occasional one-shot session looking at your regular characters through the lens of another world, we&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superstring Multiverse includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New Powers and Extras for traveling to parallel worlds along the Superstring.&lt;br/&gt;    Eleven new character stat blocks, ready for inclusion in your M&amp;amp;M campaign.&lt;br/&gt;    Four alternate world descriptions with detailed rules for stories within those settings.&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed Origin Descriptors for all characters in previously published Superhero Support materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
