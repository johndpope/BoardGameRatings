			<description>Red State/ Blue State is a new family board game that has political overtones.  The goal is to win 270 electoral votes before your opponent so that you can send your candidate to the White House.  You do this by answering question about all things concerning the United States.  The game board features a map of the United States with the American flag superimposed over it and shows the states' boundaries.  Let's say that you grabbed a Georgia card.  You would place your token, either Daniel David Donkey- Democrat, or Edward Elephant-Republican, on Georgia and answer the question.  If you are correct, you win the electoral votes for Georgia.  Then, you would place a Georgia-shaped piece that is either red(Republican) or blue(Democrat) on Georgia to show that you won Georgia's electoral votes.  Your opponent would take a turn and you continue this until one of you reaches 270 electoral votes.  The questions range from American history to pop culture.  It's a fast-paced American trivia game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
