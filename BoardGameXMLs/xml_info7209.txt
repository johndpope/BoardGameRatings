			<description>Its time for a picnic.  With the food, the players also bring an assortment of fly swatters and bug spray to defend against the hordes of bugs sure to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player pulls a bug card from his hand, and passes it to the next player; who can either play another bug -- passing the larger horde on to his neighbor -- or defend his food with one of the aforementioned weapons.  If he fails to do this, he loses food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in two editions -- the standard which is comprised of 114 cards and 24 food tiles; and the deluxe, which features 138 wooden tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
