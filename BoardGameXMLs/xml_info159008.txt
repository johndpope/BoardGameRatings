			<description>A simple roll-and-move game the late 1960s. The idea of the game is to get to know the geography of Norway better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player are represented on a board (map of Norway) by a plastic car. The die is rolled, and the player move forward accordingly. Landing on a yellow or red field triggers an event for that player, either through a text on the board or a random card drawn from a deck, like: &amp;quot;By the Malang water falls you are fishing salmon. That takes some time. Roll a 3 to move again&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;You drive through a herd of goats. Pass one roll.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to drive through all of Norway wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
