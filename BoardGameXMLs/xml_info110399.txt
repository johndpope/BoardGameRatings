			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to my Nightmare is for any medevial fantasy world. A variety character classes of levels 3 - 7 are best suited for this mini-adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes are traveling a dusty country road and happen upon a village named Newburough. This tiny village has a big problem brewing in the town graveyard. The hilltop boneyard is shrouded in mists during the night and strange figures are seen walking on the edge of sight. Residents are afraid to venture into it and those who have are not seen again! Challenge your players to tackle this threat before the town and its residents are overwhelmed by undead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are taking a journey on a highway, you sometimes need a change of scenery: you need to take an exit and get off that road for awhile. Our new Exit 295 series gives a DM the opportunity to jump-start a lackluster playing session. Insert this into your campaign wherever and whenever you need a break from your regular campaign.  Playing time varies from 1 to 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
