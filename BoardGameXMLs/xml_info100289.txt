			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ajin Warrior is a new Hero for you to use in the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far to the east of mainland Arax lies a small island empire known as Napaj. Most people know very little of this place, and this is not just due to the long distances between the mainland and the empire; the people of Napaj are notoriously secretive, and foreigners are rarely allowed inside their borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not to say the people of Napaj never leave their lands and journey to the mainland though, for this does happen on occasion. Merchants visit the port cities, bringing exotic silks, spices and foods with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then there are the Ajin Warriors. These men and women belong to an organization even more secretive than normal Napaji society. So secretive, in fact, that they officially don;t even exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ajin Warriors are elite fighters who, it is said, practice mystical rites that allow them to perform super-human feats. Members of the order sometimes travel to the mainland as spies or emissaries, while at other times they are also seeking adventure or are on specific missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent times, since the beginning of the Age of Darkness and Nightmares, some Ajin Warriors have arrived on mainland Arax to help stem the tide of evil that is steadily growing and expanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
