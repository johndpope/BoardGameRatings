			<description>user description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a quick and funny stock market game. The dividend marker  shows the current dividends for the shares of the 4 traded companies. Each round these dividends get influenced by dice roles. This can even lead to a bankruptcy of a company and the loss of all shares for the players who have bought them. Furthermore there can also occur an external takeover if the majority of shareholders agree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a second board which shows the value of the shares. Each round the value gets determined by demand and supply for a share. The orders of the players take place simultanously and sectretly and are then resolved according to priority markers which the players can choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After ten rounds the game is over. Before the game ends players should try to sell their shares since only the amount of cash determines the winner of the game. However bonds have to be payed back before the money is counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;free translation of publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bull or Bear? In the B&amp;ouml;rsenspiel, developed with cooperation of german news channel n-tv, two to four players test if one of then have good luck with investments. The game goes around buying and selling of papers from 4 big companies. But the players must act carefully: those actions will have great influence over the price of the papers, the trends and the dividends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
