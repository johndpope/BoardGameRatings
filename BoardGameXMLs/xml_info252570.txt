			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I will tell you, Hafgrimm, that you and your grandsons and granddaughters shall be slain like mad dogs; their bodies will feed ravens and wolves. One night, we'll come with axes and torches and chase you out. And when your greathall is in flames, when your family is rotting in the fields, when your blood has saturated the peat, then things finally will be over between you and me. Until then there is only hatred between us.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blodh&amp;aelig;vn is the story of a merciless feud between two generations. The time is a mythical one between the Iron Age and the Viking Age; the scenario is about irreconcilable hatred. About habitual violence and men blind to honor. About blood ties  - and what comes between. And about the choices one must take when death comes calling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blodh&amp;aelig;vn is distributed as a ZIP archive containing seven PDF files - six 5-page print-and-play characters, and one 36-page scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
