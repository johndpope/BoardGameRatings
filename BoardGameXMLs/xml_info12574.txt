			<description>A drawing and guessing game similar to Pictionary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Being the first to reach the finish space with your pawn by drawing and guessing well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;The board shows two different courses to choose from. Each course consists of differently coloured spaces; some also have symbols printed on them. The cards contain words from 6 different categories, each category corresponding to a colour on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing an item from the category their pawn is currently on. All the other players try to guess what he/she is drawing. If the word is correctly guessed before either of the two sand timers runs out, both the drawer and the person who guessed correctly move their pawn two spaces. If the correct guess takes more time and the first timer has already run out, they both get to move one space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the active player is not allowed to speak, he/she may use a little chart printed in one of the corners of the board to mark how close the guesses are (smiling, neutral and unhappy smilie) or if a part of the word is missing (something is missing at the beginning/end of the word).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special spaces allow players to challenge other players, and on &amp;quot;x2&amp;quot; spaces you get double the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose pawn reaches the finish space first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
