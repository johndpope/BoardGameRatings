							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reality Show</name>
									
			<description>Reality Show is an nontraditional 'soft' psychological party game. The players carry out lot of activities. The basic system of the game can be divided in two parts: covering frame and the game tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Covering frame: is inspired by TV reality shows. Players represent imaginary persons who are part of an imaginary TV reality show. Their lives are filmed by cameras... In this frame players develop their identities while entering into the world of plots, strategies and psychology. After a certain time some players fall out (he/she can't try to gain the main award) and he/she continues as a 'passive' player (who is supposed to be noticeably active).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tasks of play: is a collection of cards with more than 60 tasks and the center of the game. Most tasks have a certain psychological background. But this psychological element is rather only an additional dimension of tasks and it isn't necessary for players to mark it. Players draw one task card in each round, they read a setting and a certain numbers of players will be able to register to the task. If the task is carried out he/she will get a number of votes (this number of supposed votes is chosen by each player himself/herself before carrying out the task). Players can carry out about 16 tasks in each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
