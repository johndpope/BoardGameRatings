			<description>The Zany Game of Food Trucks in the Fantasy Age&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the dawning of the Third Age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An age of great heroes. A time when adventurers from distant lands come together to seek amazing quests for fame, fortune, and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And those guys die. Most of them anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the survivors make it into the annals of legend for their magnificent deeds. The dead remains of those who failed are swept into a sack and left on the side of the trail, after everyone has gone through their pockets. And they die pretty nasty deaths, come to think of it. Sliced into bite-sized chunks from death traps, buried alive in catacombs until running out of air, and eaten by wild animals that go for the squishy parts of the anatomy first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All for the hope of getting a few gold pieces to squander at the local tavern. Hard earned. Quickly lost. And a heck of a lot of scarring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But for some, there is now a better way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, a safer way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, a different way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of food trucks. Here in the Fantasy Age. Gruel Truck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
