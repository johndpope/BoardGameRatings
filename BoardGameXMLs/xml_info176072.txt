							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Champions of Hara: Deluxe Supporter Pack</name>
									
			<description>The deluxe edition includes three new Champions, new 25-card &amp;quot;Chaos&amp;quot; deck to allow co-op play and other additional components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Hara has descended into chaos. As the Conflux begins, Hara&amp;rsquo;s primal sources of energy rage out of control, threatening to tear the world apart. In a last-ditch effort to save it, Hara&amp;rsquo;s stewards send a call throughout the universe, drawing on Champions&amp;mdash; individuals capable of containing this energy&amp;mdash; and offering the promise of untold glory. However, only one Champion can bring the world of Hara back into balance and earn its power for him or herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Champions of Hara, you&amp;rsquo;ll take control of one such individual. Journey across the shifting planes of Hara; forging fragile alliances, battling epic monsters, and facing off against friends and foes alike. As you do, you&amp;rsquo;ll unlock new powers and abilities to help you on your journey. But beware&amp;hellip; as the Conflux grows more intense, the monsters you face will get tougher, the world will get harsher, and the planes that make up Hara itself will shift. Do you have what it takes to stand up to the challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to become a Champion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;You are a Champion, and your mission is to contain Hara's three wayward energies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do so, you'll have to defeat monsters, close rifts, and explore the six shifting planes of Hara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you do, you will be rewarded with energy cubes which you can use to unlock the three Elemental Attunements, and gain new powers and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, you'll have to manage your hand, actions and a unique Energy Alignment system to get the most out of every turn and take on the toughest challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can, you'll be well on your way to containing all three elemental energies, and winning the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
