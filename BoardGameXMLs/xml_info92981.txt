							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King of Shreds and Patches</name>
									
			<description>January 14th&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear friend. My sojourn in parts foreign is at an ende. I am at lodgings in Southwark not far from the bridge at Stoney Street, come dine with me two days hence to ring in the newe year. I have not enjoyed amiable English companie for some long time and it would be refreshing to hear my mother tongue used in its proper manner again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your friend,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Croft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you receive this note from your old acquantence John Croft, you expect nothing but an evening of good food and drink and Croft's lecherous tales. Instead, you quickly find yourself plunged into a conspiracy of black magic that involves not only Croft but some of the most powerful and important men in London -- and possibly even someone else, someone much closer to your own heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King of Shreds and Patches is a novel-length work of interactive fiction. In it you will explore an historically accurate recreation of Elizabethan London, circa 1603, interact with some fascinating characters both historical and fictional, and (if you are clever and lucky) thwart an occult conspiracy that threatens to bring down the entire city -- or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
