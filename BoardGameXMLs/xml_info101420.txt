			<description>[This adding game is not to be confused with the trick-taking game, Ninety-Nine.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From David Parlett's Penguin Encyclopedia of Card Games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Said to be a Gypsy game. Deal three cards each and stack the rest face down. Play goes to the left, but may change. Each in turn plays a face up card to the table, announces the total value of all cards played so far, and draws a replacement from stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards count as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2, 5, 6, 7, 8: Face value&lt;br/&gt;Black Ace: Changes the total to 0-99, player's choice&lt;br/&gt;Red Ace: 2&lt;br/&gt;3, 4: 0&lt;br/&gt;9: Changes the total to 99&lt;br/&gt;10: -10&lt;br/&gt;Jack: 10 and reverse direction of play&lt;br/&gt;Queen, King: 10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The total may not exceed 99. The first player to be unable to play, loses a life. The first to lose three lives, loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
