			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the Blizzard War, the Convocation of Elementalists had many schools of magic. Many of the remote schools were destroyed during the conflict, the great secrets they held thought lost forever. Recently one establishment has been rediscovered, one which the Convocation would like explored and looted. For five centuries the school has lain untouched by the outside world, but it has not been completely ignored. Something lurks in the heart of the ancient school, something powerful, something which hungers....and it is not alone! Are the adventurers destined to survive their foray into the lost school of magic, or will they struggle to survive Against the Elements? A strange shadow has fallen over the normally quiet village of Rushton. The villagers have been acting strangely, with some disappearing for days at a time and a few families missing entirely! Behind these strange occurrences is an unearthly creature, part-human and part-spider. This creatures venom enslaves the weak minded and the it plans to enslave the whole of Rushton and beyond! Can the heroes defeat this malevolent evil? In Web of Deceit the heroes will be fully tested in this exciting adventure for Hellfrost! The village of Drayton is beset by plague. Seemingly abandoned by their healer, the villagers now turn to strangers for help. But there is more to the illness than appears, for the hand of the Norns is at work. Three centuries ago their laid down a prophecy to the lord of Drayton, a prophecy that spelled disaster for his descendants. That time has come, and death now stalks the mire around Drayton. The adventure is designed for Veteran characters. It contains all the monster stats, maps, and Figure Flats required for play. Triple Ace Games present Death in the Mire. A Hellfrost adventure for the award-winning Savage Worlds RPG. Through Edges and Glory rewards, Hellfrost allows the heroes to become leaders of men. The playground for such characters is not the &amp;quot;dungeon&amp;quot; environment, but the open battlefield. They lead companies to death or glory beneath fluttering banners, not skulk in dark shadows searching moldy corpses for a few coins. The call to arms has been issued, but are you ready to engage in the Clash of Steel? The Restless Dead contains four Mass Battles scenarios. Although designed as standalone events, the GM can easily work them into an existing campaign. Also included is an alternate set of rules for running very large-scale battles on the tabletop. Now the players can literally control the actions of their troops and watch the battle unfold before their eyes. More importantly, it allows characters to use many of their regular Edges and still play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
