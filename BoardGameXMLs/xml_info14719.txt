			<description>From the manual :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the game board you can see the witches&amp;rsquo; forest with the witch school in the corner. Little witches go there every day to practice their tricks. It takes a lot of practice to be a good witch! Today, all the little witches are allowed to practice their tricks in the forest.&lt;br/&gt;If they pass their witches&amp;rsquo; test, they will receive a delicious spider cake for their hard work.&lt;br/&gt;All of the important things a good witch needs are hidden under orange stones in the big fire where the witches dance. To pass the witches&amp;rsquo; test, you must know what is under each stone. But watch out! There is a wicked witch hiding somewhere. If you uncover her, you must go all the&lt;br/&gt;way back to the space behind the last player. Each of you junior witches should pay close attention during the game. The first student to reach one of the spider cakes wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game:&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a witch playing figure and places it on&lt;br/&gt;the witch school in the top left corner of the playing board. This is the starting space. In the witches&amp;rsquo; fire, you&lt;br/&gt;will see everything a good witch needs: a black cat, a raven, a toad, a book of spells, a bat, a magic wand, a magic hat, a broom and a cauldron.&lt;br/&gt;For about 15 seconds, the children should carefully look at&lt;br/&gt;the 10 stones in the witches&amp;rsquo; fire and try to remember where everything is located.&lt;br/&gt;Then the stones should be turned over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throw the dice and see what colour you rolled. The spaces in the witches&amp;rsquo; forest correspond to the colours on the dice. Move your witch to the next space of the same colour you rolled. Look at the picture on the space where you landed. Can you remember where the same picture is located&lt;br/&gt;under the orange stones? If you choose the right stone, your witch can stay on that space. If you choose the wrong stone, your witch must GO BACK.&lt;br/&gt;Return to the first space you come to that corresponds&lt;br/&gt;to the colour on the dice (at the beginning, simply return&lt;br/&gt;to the witch school). Don&amp;rsquo;t go back to the space you just&lt;br/&gt;came from!&lt;br/&gt;But watch out! If you accidentally turn over the wicked&lt;br/&gt;witch , you must go all the way back to the playing&lt;br/&gt;space behind the last witch (it does not matter what&lt;br/&gt;colour that space is).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
