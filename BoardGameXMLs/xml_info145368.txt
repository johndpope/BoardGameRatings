							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bug Planet</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not paid to survive; you&amp;rsquo;re paid to produce&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mysterious alien planet has been discovered and it is ripe with rare minerals, bizarre physics, and many opportunities for profit; Your corporate masters have sent you on a mission to gear up, start an outpost, and plunder these new resources. But great fortunes such as these always come with great risks, and in this case, it&amp;rsquo;s a massive population of giant insects that inhabit the world. Balance the terror of certain annihilation against the greedy desires of your corporate sponsors to ravage the land of its precious resources as quickly as you can. Time is short for those looking to out produce their competitors on the planet, because the never-ending hordes of terrestrial life don&amp;rsquo;t kill you, your boss just might.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bug Planet is a tower defence worker placement game where two-to-four players can vie against each other in an attempt to control the production of the planet's valuable resources. The game is broken down into a sequence of phases where:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.) Giant killer alien bugs are added outside of each player's outpost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.) Players take turns adding modules to their outpost (such as new weapons, housing, forcefields, and more, while also collecting resources such as minerals, electricity and export points using a worker placement system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.) Players take turns activating the modules in their outpost by spending the electricity they have collected this turn. This is mostly done to power up weapons and try to kill the bugs bearing down on them, but also players may mine additional minerals, perform scientific research or reduce the panic in their base (if they have the right modules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.) Come nightfall the bugs are on the move. Any bug that survived the day will get a chance to move closer to the player's outpost. The closer they get the more panic they inspire and the more damage they can possibly deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, once it becomes apparent panic has begun to set in at one or more of the competing outposts, your bosses will pull the plug on the whole operation (by way of orbital nuke, since it's the only way to be sure). Be the player who has best fulfilled your corporate mission objectives to be posthumously declared the winner, your spouse will be sent a tasteful plaque!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
