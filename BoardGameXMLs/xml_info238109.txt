			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghostbusters are called to investigate a burglary at the New York Public Library. The Library was staging an exhibition of some of the world's rarest books, including the Buggre All Thyse Bible and the mythical first edition of Alice's Adventures in Cleveland. However last night, someone broke in, attacked the security guard and stole one of the books. This book was the exceedingly rare 1577 John Dee edition of the Necronomicon . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghostbusters' services are called upon by the Owner, a Mr Ted Klein. He knows through bitter experience what damage the book can cause. You should see his pet dog. Oh I forgot, you can't. After fluffing the &amp;quot;Contact Pizza-Dude of the Outer Gods&amp;quot; spell, his dog Fifi now exists in the angles of time. - yes that's right. It&amp;rsquo;s a poodle of Tindalos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
