			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an adventurer and fortune seeker that has travelled all over Allansia. You have never committed a crime in your life. It seems ironic that you now find yourself in the infamous 'City of thieves', Port Blacksand and that you may have no other choice than to start stealing to survive. It is almost impossible to make an honest living in Port Blacksand, since it seems that everybody from the thieves down to the authorities themselves are corrupt. It also seems that everybody in Port Blacksand belongs to some kind clan or organization. If you are a thief and not a member of the Guild of Thieves, you are spat upon by other thieves and your very life could be in danger if you are caught stealing by a member of the Guild. It also seems as if there is some kind of an unholy alliance between the Guild and the authorities of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you arrived in Port Blacksand a few weeks ago, you thought that there would be many opportunities for making money. Your initial idea was to act as some kind of bounty hunter, but this was impossible since it is a criminal act in itself to track down criminals without a license and getting a license is almost impossible, since you need to be accepted into the 'Clan of Bounty Hunters'. If you brought in a known felon to the local authorities without belonging to the Clan, you may very well find yourself imprisoned. Luckily you found this out the easy way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You then tried to find honest work, with the idea to gather enough money to leave the city and try to make your fortune elsewhere. Nobody wanted to employ you, because of the fact that the city is crawling with thieves and special reference certificates if you are to be hired, since it guarantees your honesty. (Nobody wants to hire a thief!) You did manage to get the odd job here, with a gold coin or two for payment. You came to Port Blacksand with high hopes, but you have now been reduced to begging for food and gold coins at day and sleeping in the dark alleys at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you turn your misfortune around?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
