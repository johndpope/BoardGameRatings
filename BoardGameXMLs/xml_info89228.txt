			<description>This French cycling game for children was given as a bonus in april 1986 with the French Picsou magazine. It was the third and last of their cycling series (the other two being  Picsoutour and Pic-Etape). This time we have a free-style race. The best thing of this one is that the track is three-dimensional. As can be expected, landing on downhill squares is better than landing on uphill ones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
