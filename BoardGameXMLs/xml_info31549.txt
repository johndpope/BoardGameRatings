			<description>A big vacuum cleaner has sent lots of monsters in the cosmos. You must gather them in families in order to score points.&lt;br/&gt;During the game, cards are drawn to form two columns. The cards can have monsters on them, or various bonuses/penalties. During your turn you can choose to take a whole column in your hand, but you can only do that four times. You then must draw two new cards to extend the columns.&lt;br/&gt;The columns will grow during play until someone picks one up and starts a new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, you must arrange the cards you picked up in order to have majorities for each monster type. If you do you will score points, if you don't you will loose points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
