			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This title was the first to depart from the formula  and engine of the series. The traditional focus on story was removed in this game, and some character customization is possible, if only purely decorative. There are two player characters  from Portugal and Spain. Although the differences between them are mainly mechanical, the role-playing element was greatly reduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
