			<description>Backyard Football is a football video game released by Humongous Entertainment in 1999. The game was the third Humongous Sports game released by Humongous Entertainment, preceded by Backyard Soccer and Backyard Baseball. It is the first of all of the Backyard Sports series to consist of the Backyard kids and professional players as kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 types of gameplay available in Backyard football. The first one is a single game. A player picks the field they wish to play on, the weather type (those being sunny, where the players run very fast, rainy, in which the players run at a normal speed and the ball is very hard to throw, and snowy, where players are slow), the level of difficulty between easy, medium, or hard, and decide on whether they want the automatic or manual kick on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second type of gameplay is season mode. The player selects their coach name, settings, and team before the season and drafts all seven of their players before the CPU picks any for the rest of the computer controlle teams in the league.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third type of gameplay is online play. Backyard Football is the only game along with Backyard Baseball 2001 that offers online play with players across the globe. Online play is hosted through the Junior Sports Network, online play that is only available for Windows users, since the network system does not support Macintosh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Backyard Football (1999 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
