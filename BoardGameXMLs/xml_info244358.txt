			<description>The Great Dahlgaard&amp;rsquo;s spectacular contest for his legacy, the Trickerion Stone, has set Magoria off to a new Golden Age. Under the wise guidance of Dahlgaard&amp;rsquo;s Heir, the city has once again become a bustling, flourishing center of magic and illusion, with a new generation of aspiring young Magicians on the rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now, without the power of the Trickerion Stone, the Great Dahlgaard is dying. In his last will, he entrusted his Heir with a grandiose task: he donated his old manor to be restored as the Academy of Magoria, a center of the education and perfection of magic tricks and illusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heir issues a public call for contributors among Magoria&amp;rsquo;s aspiring Magicians: the Academy shall be restored as a common effort, but the most successful contributor&amp;rsquo;s name will be remembered forever as the Patron of Magoria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dahlgaard&amp;rsquo;s Academy expands the magical world and gameplay of Trickerion with a slew of exciting new features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new Location - the Academy: Join the common effort to renovate the Academy! Each Renovation action awards Fame proportionately to the Coins spent on it, and opens up new Classrooms and Practice Rooms, where Trick markers can be placed. Trick Markers in Practice Rooms increase the Tricks&amp;rsquo; Yields when they are performed, while the secrets of Tricks taught in the Classrooms will be passed on to the new generations - they can no longer be performed, but grant a useful passive yield each turn. The Academy is also a place to train your Proteg&amp;eacute;e, a new member of your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new Specialist - the Proteg&amp;eacute;e: Each Magician will now start with the Proteg&amp;eacute;e, a new type of specialist. The Proteg&amp;eacute;e is more than just a worker - they will accompany your Magician on their path to greatness, constantly developing in the process. By Visiting the Academy, Proteg&amp;eacute;es can acquire powerful new abilities that also increase their Action Points - and their salary as well! A fully developed Proteg&amp;eacute;e will have 3 Actions points, just like the Magician, with some very powerful abilities to boot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new quartet of Magicians: Magoria&amp;rsquo;s new Golden Age attracts aspiring young Magicians from all over the world, eager to prove themselves, and maybe one day become the Patron of Magoria. Each school of illusion (Mechanical, Optical, Escape, Spiritual) will receive a new, charismatic Magician, with their own personal backstory, powerful special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo Mode: The Corrupted Heir: This expansion will also feature a solo mode, with an elaborate story setting. Take a journey to a possible future Magoria, where Dahlgaard&amp;rsquo;s Heir couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the immense power of the Trickerion Stone, and dabbing into the supernatural has eclipsed their sanity. Magoria&amp;rsquo;s Golden is over - now the Heir controls it with an iron grip, and it falls to you to prove your superiority and remove him from power the only way the city knows - through magic and illusion. This solo mode features Dahlgaard&amp;rsquo;s Heir as a fully automated, intricate opponent with variable difficulty levels - a worthy foe to even the most seasoned Trickerion veterans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
