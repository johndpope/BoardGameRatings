							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guessit</name>
									
			<description>Guessit is a fast paced game played like charades.  Instead of acting, however, you give verbal and physical clues to your teammates, who are trying to guess the items you are describing before the time runs out.  There are 4 categories of play - Places, People, Objects, and Actions &amp;amp; Activities.  On your turn, you roll the dice to determine which category you get.  There are 7 items on each card and you get 1 point for each item your team correctly guesses.  The first team to 45 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
