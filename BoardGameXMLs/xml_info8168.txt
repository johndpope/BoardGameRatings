			<description>Each player has a board covered in tiles with numbers on. The players take it in turns to roll two dice. The player who didn't roll the dice has to turn over tiles on his board with a value up to or equal to the dice roll.  There are bonuses and penalties for some dice combinations, and for not spotting that you were entitled to a bonus. The game ends when one player has turned over all their tiles.  The rules recommend that you play two games (one match), with the winner being the player with the lowest score (total numbers on tiles unturned)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from Triggery version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triggery is a completely new game for all ages (from 8 upwards). It is played by ONE or TWO players, but it is just as exciting when played by 3 or 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Triggery you only have to be able to count up to 24. But make no mistake about it: to win you have to keep your eyes open, your thinking cap on ... and your wits about you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game? To turn face down all the tiles on your board as quickly - and in as few goes - as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is Triggery fun to play? It's a marvelous game. For one thing it has virtually limitless possibilities. For another, it's highly entertaining. But we are not going to spoil the fun by telling you why. Find out for yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
