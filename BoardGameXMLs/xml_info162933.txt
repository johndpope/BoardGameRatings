			<description>A set of simple, fast-play colonial wargames rules for fighting battles between British and Native armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast and furious battles, where the results were often in the balance right the way though until the end, and where the fortunes of one side or the over could literally change with the turn of a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main elements of the rules remain unchanged, and it is possible for two or more players to fight an interesting battle to a conclusion in under two hours on a 4 foot x 3 foot (120cm x 90cm) tabletop battlefield using approximately two hundred 15mm scale figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to fight larger battles using more figures and a larger battlefield, but the duration of the battle will increase, and in today&amp;rsquo;s busy world not everyone has the necessary time or space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules do incorporate several novel features. These include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The use of a standard pack of playing cards to determine the order in which units are able to move, fire, and take part in close combat;&lt;br/&gt;    The use of Special Event Cards that the players can use to gain extra movement, firepower, close combat effectiveness, or to rally troops that have failed a morale test and have fled from the battlefield;&lt;br/&gt;    The use of the Jokers to determine:&lt;br/&gt;        When players have to hand back any unused Special Event Cards.&lt;br/&gt;        When the battle will end.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
