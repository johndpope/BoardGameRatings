			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Are you ready for your 15 Minutes of Fame? &lt;br/&gt; Test your wit and stretch your imagination as creatively-crafted clues are combined to reveal famous secret identities! &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;When you have the spotlight, how will you reveal your secret identity? You've picked....Arnold Schwarzenegger! Your first challenger might ask, &amp;quot;If you were a food, what type of food would you be?&amp;quot; Your answer could be, &amp;quot;mussels&amp;quot;, or, &amp;quot;Weiner schnitzel&amp;quot;, or even, &amp;quot;protein drink.&amp;quot; The next question might be, &amp;quot;....what type of transportation would you be?&amp;quot; Your answer? How about, &amp;quot;a tank&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Hummer.&amp;quot; Your clues are limited only by your imagination!&lt;br/&gt; Little by little, clue by clue, other players begin to develop a sense of your identity. 15 Minutes of Fame isn't always easy, but it's always fun, sometimes outrageous, frequently challenging and quite surprising!&lt;br/&gt; It even includes a few customizable cards for personalized fun! Who knows where this will take you?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
