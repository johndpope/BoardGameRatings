			<description>New colonies need many things to survive... tools, food, raw materials, medicine, to name a few. Merchants and the ships they use to ply the stars are their salvation in many ways. You are one of those merchants. You are charged with ensuring that you are not only profitable, but you are keeping these new colonies alive and thriving in this backwater part of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also have competitors... others who wish to attract the attention of the Emperor by being the best. You must struggle to supply systems with goods at a profit. You must also struggle to gain influence through your trade in key systems that will attract future rewards from the Emperor himself. But options are limited... you don&amp;rsquo;t hear of deliveries when needed and your opponents do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are beset with a changing political landscape in this sector as colonies grow. Demand for certain goods shifts like sand. Danger and discovery await. Your network of informants and insiders provide you with information. As time passes, it becomes harder to trade safely as success attracts attention &amp;mdash; sometimes from unsavory characters. The finest merchants rise to this challenge, but they are ever-mindful of not making the Emperor jealous...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS is life in Right Ascension...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
