			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The peaceful village of Yamamura has had a good summer; the rice stores are full to bursting and even lord Honda looks pleased for once. So, as the momoji leaves turn to yellows and reds, the villagers gather for their annual autumn festival. Food stalls, games, gossip, the sweet sounds of koto and shamisen music, followed by colorful fireworks and dancing into the night. It will be a night to remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, for Constable Hideo there are always things to worry about; the many visitors and the ample supply of sake for one. Mix the two together and this night may not be so peaceful after all. And then there are the Inoue girls, Ame and Yuki. In a village where everyone knows your secrets, they still manage to keep the gossip fresh, and biting. Old Sanae remembers when she too was young and beautiful, while the appearance of an old love interest does nothing to shake the reminder that the past will always come back to haunt you. And it&amp;rsquo;s the past that most concerns Father Vicente, the Spaniard, who remembers the fervor he once had for his faith; if only he could recapture that passion, yet his heart grows colder as the nights do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And out in that darkness a malicious force moves, ready to strike a blow that will leave the village irreversibly scarred and in dire need of heroes to make their stand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure set in ancient, mythical Japan for 6 players and a GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
