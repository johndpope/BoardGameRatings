			<description>From the publiher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mad Dogs With Guns is a miniatures game set in the &amp;ldquo;Roaring Twenties&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;the wide-open era of Prohibition, Tommy Guns and concrete overshoes. It&amp;rsquo;s about mad-dog mobsters, crooked cops, and the kind of liquor that can send you blind for weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s about fast cars and faster women, paid-off politicians and basement breweries, private eyes and public enemies. But mostly it&amp;rsquo;s about men with silk suits, snap-brim fedoras and automatic weapons, quarrelling violently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;In this game, two to four gangs of mobsters fight against each other. Each figure is assign specific stats according to its category, such as Punk, Slugger or Enforcer. During the game, the order of action is determined by a deck of cards. Each gang is assigned a suit. All the cards from those suits are shuffled, and drawn one-by-one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a card is drawn, one member of the matching gang is allowed to take to actions, such as move, shoot, aim or recover. When a court card is drawn, all members of that gang are allowed to act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player does not want to perform an action, he can hold the card, and use it to interrupt another player later on in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
