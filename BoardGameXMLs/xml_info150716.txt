			<description>A card-game about the Zombie apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 30 card pairs each consisting of a human and his or her zombie version. While the cards can be used for playing a classic memo-game, it also offers three unique zombie-themed game modes of increasing complexity, which can be played seperately or as a campaign:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Outbreak: Like in the classic game, the goal is to find as many pairs as possible. However, when it's his or her turn, the player turns over cards for as long as the cards are of the same type (i.e. human or zombie). Only when a differing card type is upturned the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Survivor: Find as many human survivors as possible and keep them alive until the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Exodus: In the final mode the players have to guide their team of humans across zombie infested terrain, find more survivors and get out before the military nukes the entire area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
