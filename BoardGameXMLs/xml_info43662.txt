			<description>Volume II of the Doomstones Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Collects the two books Death Rock and Dwarf Wars previously published by Flame Publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Deep In the Yetzin Mountains lurk four crystals: hidden, lost, forgotten, but waiting. Forged many centuries ago by the Dwarfs, they were split up and concealed for a reason lost in the mysteries of the ages. Now, as strange forces move in the Yetzin Valley again, Orc warbands reform and civil war between Dwarfen factions threatens the area, a band of travellers must discover if they are the ones who it is prophesied will reunite the four Crystals... and why.&lt;br/&gt;Drawn first to the remote monastery of Eyrie, standing high on a pinnacle of rock above the Winter's Teeth Pass, the party must battle against time, obstinate monks and the Bloodaxe Alliance to follow a trail of clues laid centuries ago by the stronghold's mysterious architect, From there they will have to travel deep into a lost Dwarfen hold, Kadar-Gravning, where two rival factions are fighting to find the crown of the long-dead Dwarf-King Hargrim. Somewhere within the cavernous depths of the abandoned hold lies the last of the Crystals ~ and a terrible destiny awaiting those who might possess all four of the ancient artefacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for characters in their second or third careers, Doomstones: Wars and Death mixes investigation, exploration and combat to challenge the wits and skill of Warhammer FRP players. It is the second part of a three-part campaign, and can be played as a stand-alone adventure or as a sequel to Doomstones: Fire and Blood. This book includes pre-generated player characters, new monsters and magic, and twenty pages of hand-outs including two three-dimensional models.&lt;br/&gt;The adventures in this book were originally published by Flame Publications in two separate volumes: 'Death Rock' and 'Dwarf Wars'. Some parts have been revised, and new material has been added.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
