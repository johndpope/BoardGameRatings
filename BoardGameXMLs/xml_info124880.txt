			<description>Heute schon gek&amp;uuml;sst? is a co-operative game for 2 players (one couple).&lt;br/&gt;Players alternately draw cards. This card either show questions or tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it is a question card, one player secretly writes down the answer and the other one has to guess the right answer. The questions are about personal wishes, preferences, ideas, etc., for example &amp;quot;How many children do you want?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;If the answer is correct, the couple sores 3 points (move the pink token), otherwies the game scores 3 points (black heard moves).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it is a task card, the player has to guess how good he can do this task, for example &amp;quot;Massage your partners neck&amp;quot;, the player has to guess secretly who good he can do this. (good or verry good). Than he does the task and the other player rates the efforts. If the rating fits the guess, they score points (1 if it was good, 2 if it was verry good), otherwies the black heard moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as the pink token has reached the final space on the score track. The couples success is determinated by the position of the black heard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
