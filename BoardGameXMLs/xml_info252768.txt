							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uncanny Echo Issue 4: Present</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game does not teach you how to play Powered by the Apocalypse games. It assumes you have knowledge of the PbtA engine and leverages that information to create a pick-up-and-play, rules-lite one-shot experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue 4: Present&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue is more narrow in focus than others because it is based on a novel and movie, Bringing Out The Dead. This source material follows a burned-out nightshift paramedic who struggles with intense personal and spiritual trauma after too many years on the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find one playbook, the Medic; you&amp;rsquo;ll play someone experienced and trained in this field to the point where their job is habitual. They work with skill and precision but find that, more often than not, the outcome is not something in their purview.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because this subject matter is intense and beyond my expertise, this issue is not concerned with simulating the actual care of the people medics tend to in real life. Instead, we will focus on the peripheral lives of the protagonists and the city at night, much like in Bringing Out The Dead. This issue interrogates the city, what it is and what it feels, and the altogether different lives and events most people never experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A life distinct from the daytime hours and experiences of people not belonging to the machinations of evening and dawn&amp;mdash;when the surreal and bizarre feel possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
