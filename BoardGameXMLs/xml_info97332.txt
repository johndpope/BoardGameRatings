			<description>Publisher Introduction Game Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This comprehensive play aid includes all the rules, updated with current errata, diagrams and detailed examples of frequently asked questions, as well as all of the encounters for the popular Malifaux skirmish game in an easily referenced compact form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you willing to risk your soul for a chance at great wealth and power?  It's your only weapon in a world rife wtih monsters, necropunks, man-machine hybrids, gunslingers, and power-hungry politicos.  In Malifaux, you lead your crew in the battle for control of the Breach, a dark portal to a world of limitless magic.  Those who don't make it become monsters you must destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malifaux is a character-driven 32mm tabletop miniatures game.  Players lead groups, called Crews, in skirmish attacks against their opponents in the magical realm of Malifaux.  Players collect, build, and paint models representing the denizens of Malifaux and pit these Crews against one another.  Masters, powerful practitioners of magic, and those fighting them control these Crews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masters can manipulate the course of events in the world around them, and can change their own fates, through their control or theft of the powerful Soulstones in Malifaux.  A Crew conssists of a variety of fantastic and frightening beings, collectively known as Minions, who serve the Master as fodder in his or her machinations.  In addition, Henchmen can lead specialized Crews in their Master's absence, or serve their Master directly as a member of a Crew.  Masters and Henchmen are also supported by Totems, extension of their magical abilities which increase their spellcasting range and provide additional aid in an Encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How well a Crew carries out its leader's Strategy and Schemes determiens whether or not it will emerge victgorious in an Encounter with an enemy Crew.  Strategies represent the Crew's main path to victory, while Schemes are simpler alternate routes to achieve the leader's goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malifaxu players use decks of cards called Fate Decks to resolve game events such as attacking and spell casting.  Players can manipulate the cards they play to alter the Duel's outcome.  It takes a shrewd leader to effectively utilize a Crew's resources, ensuring he or she always has ready the cards needed to Cheat Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be Prepared to fight to the death because Malifaux is the end of the line!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
