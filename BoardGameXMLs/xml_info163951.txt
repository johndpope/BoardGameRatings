							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">KISS: Keep It Simple System</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KISS&amp;trade; is a skill-based roleplaying system, suitable for any genre. It is not designed to be a universal system, but it&amp;rsquo;s such a simple framework to hang stories and milieus on that it lends itself readily to fantasy, science fiction, horror or any other genre. The Pendulum Mechanic&amp;trade; is easy and intuitive. Though KISS&amp;trade; is skills based; only examples of skills are given. It&amp;rsquo;s up to each individual Keeper (gamemaster) to design a skills set for each particular milieu. Musical instrument repair might be radio repair in a horror setting, telegraph repair in steampunk or microcomputer repair in science fiction. Sets or specific skills are not actually required; skills may simply be resolved under the most appropriate stat. That radio repair skill could be resolved under the Mind or Agility stat, whichever the Keeper thought most appropriate. In fact, much in KISS&amp;trade; is left to the Keeper to detail offering possibly the widest creative latitude of any published roleplaying system. As such, it is of utmost importance that the Keeper remains consistent in his rulings. It is advised that the Keeper retains a small booklet of &amp;ldquo;house rules&amp;rdquo; to use in conjunction with KISS&amp;trade;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A list of spells, a list of monsters and this little booklet and you're ready to roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
