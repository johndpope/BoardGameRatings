			<description>Players will reinforce their knowledge of 11 explorers by matching 4 facts about each explorer. After playing the game several times, they should be able to match the explorer to at least 3 facts about him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Shuffle the deck and deal 4 cards, one at a time, face down, to each player. Place the remainder of the deck in the center of the table. There are 44 cards in the deck; 11 sets of 4 explorers. The object of the game is to collect the most &amp;quot;Explorer's Logs&amp;quot; consisting of a set of 4 cards for each explorer.&lt;br/&gt;2. The player at the dealer's left begins by calling on another player. That player is asked for a specific card that will help the caller complete an &amp;quot;Explorer's Log.&amp;quot; The cards are designed so that there is one fact at the top that's marked with an open diamond, and three facts at the bottom marked by closed circles. The fact at the top is &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; card, and the facts at the bottom are the cards you can ask for from the other players.&lt;br/&gt;3. If the player who has been called on has the card that was asked for, it must be given to the caller, and the caller continues asking for more cards. This continues until the caller asks someone for a card that they do not have. In this case, the player draws the top card frorn the deck and the turn passes to the next person on the left. If however, the caller draws the exact card that he asked for, his turn continues, and he keeps asking for cards.&lt;br/&gt;4. When a player gets all 4 cards from one of the explorers, he or she has a complete log, and the cards should be placed face down in a pile in front of the player. Play continues until all of the cards have been gathered into logs. The player with the most completed logs at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;44 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
