							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lumines Live!</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game follows the same gameplay mechanics as the earlier Lumines games and is very reminiscent of Tetris. The player is tasked with making sets of at least four similarly colored squares. The &amp;quot;time line&amp;quot; is constantly sweeping across the play field and it will remove any sets that the player has formed. The soundtrack changes depending on the size and number of matching sets the player has formed. There are several modes in this game: Challenge (story mode that presents the player with new skins/levels that are unlocked once beaten), Skin Edit Mode (detailed below), Vs. CPU (the player goes head-to-head against the CPU trying to clear their side of the board), Time Attack Mode (similar to Challenge but with times of 60, 180, 300, 600 seconds), Puzzle Mode (create the required pattern of blocks), and Mission Mode (the player is given certain pieces and a set number of moves to complete a task.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;LIVE!&amp;quot; edition in the series has added a few new features. It adds a multiplayer component in which you can compete either locally or online with two players. The &amp;quot;Skin Edit Mode&amp;quot; allows you to decide the order of what levels you play through based on the skins you have previously unlocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
