							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Church on Skull Hill</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a desolate region, avoided by most of the people, lies the Skull Hill, a place said to be haunted. On top of the hill, shaped like a human skull, lies a crumbling desecrated church. The place is eerie and gloom, and the cemetery surrounding the church makes the place even scarier. The eye sockets and the nose of the Skull Hill are actually entrances of caverns that lie beneath the hill. An abandoned farm, belonged to a daring man who tried to live in that haunted place, crumbles in ruin east of the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Church: The church crumbles in ruin but most of its furniture is still present among the fallen walls. A great main hall, flanked by shrines, leads to a blood-covered altar before a great statue of an unknown hellish creature. East and west, two alcoves show the shattered remains of two more dark statues. Beyond the altar, two rooms seem to have hosted living beings recently. In the westernmost one, the remains of a camp can be found, while in the easternmost a complete study has been built. Two spiral staircases lead to a balcony, overlooking the entire church. From the balcony is still possible to look outside the church, through the shattered gothic windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Catacombs: Beneath the church lie the catacombs. A dark, damp corridor littered with smashed and shattered coffins, hiding the remains of unknown people. Bones and bricks litter the floor of the catacombs, as they have been plundered many times. A crumbled wall connects the catacombs to the goblin caves beneath the hill. The main crypt of the catacombs lies untouched, protected by secret doors and undead guardians. The crypt is said to hold the remains of a high priest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Abandoned Farm: Someone, in a recent past, dared to live in this dread place. He or she hasn&amp;rsquo;t last long, because the farm now crumbles in ruin. An old well can be found within a fallen fence surrounding the farm. Shattered furniture can be found everywhere in the house, but no personal effect are visible. Maybe someone has left the place taking with him all his belongings. Through a trapdoor in the stable&amp;rsquo;s floor, the cellar can be reached. The big cellar&amp;rsquo;s ceiling is sustained by two rows of sturdy pillars. A secret door leads to a mysterious hidden section of the cellar. The purpose of this section is unknown. The bottom of the well can be reached through a trapped corridor and beyond a stalactites cave the goblins caves can be found.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
