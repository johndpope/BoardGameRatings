			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ReCoil presents a unique and complex setting and highly peculiar mechanics.  Players run Agents (characters) that attempt to salvage &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; from being altered or damaged by supernatural forces (Naughtwraiths and others).  Characters are not physical in nature, though they can enter into (&amp;quot;possess&amp;quot;) physical beings if needed.  Character creation is quite distinctive from a typical race/class/ability/skill system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reality can be damaged by either side of the war. The Agents and the Naughtwraiths both have the limited ability to shape and change reality to their will. They are capable of incredible feats of strength and dexterity, above and beyond what is humanly possible. They can edit reality to their will, causing items to appear or disappear at will. This power, most especially for the Agents fighting to preserve reality, has a price, however; It introduces Flux, instability of belief and reality, which can lead to localized collapse of reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
