			<description>This party game requires two teams of players, any number. This is somewhat similar to charades, but the player doing the impression must act and/or sound like the person or object being imitated, rather than creating words or parts of words, as in charades. There are cards in five categories &amp;ndash; Animals, Celebrities, Machines and Gadgets, Fictional Characters, and Pot Luck. Each card has five entries, which the player must imitate to make his team guess before the timer runs out. Example card for Fictional Characters: Popeye; Mr. Spock; Ed Norton; Lilith (from Cheers); and Alice (from The Brady Bunch). Example card for Machines and Gadgets: helmet; robot; CD player; Dust Buster; and Zamboni machine. Players may imitate noises and actions or say things that the person/character would say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
