							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mysteries of the Oracle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock the Mystery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oracles are more than just spontaneous divine casters who use Charisma instead of Wisdom. The oracle class taps into a cultural phenomenon that has fascinated mankind for thousands of years. From the ancient Greek oracles of Delphi to gypsy fortune tellers to modern-day psychics, humanity has long been enraptured by the idea of a mystic who receives insights directly from &amp;ldquo;the powers that be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: Mysteries of the Oracle endeavors to breathe new life into the oracle class, an often-overlooked class made available in the Pathfinder Advanced Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide. To do so, the book expands on the options an oracle&amp;rsquo;s player has, from new oracle curses (including a new approach at some older curses, in order to make them feel more curse-like), to five new oracle mysteries, and a number of new feats, several of which are designed to help make the new content in this book more easily available to existing characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the mystery of dreams to the mystery of the serpent or that of the sun and moon, whether you want an oracle who&amp;rsquo;s cursed with a wasting sickness, or just wish that curses like blind and haunted really felt like a curse (and wanted a benefit to go along with that more real drawback), if you have any interest in oracles, this is the book for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
