			<description>Object: Be the last person with the Zoo-Party-Winner card at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: One player is chosen to deal. The dealer shuffles the cards and deals out the deck, one card at a time. Players hold their cards in their hands. Each player separates the cards into pairs and places each set of pairs face up on the table. The player to the left of the dealer begins. They mix the remaining cards in their hand behind their back and then holds them face down to the player on their left. The Player on the left draws one card. If that card &amp;quot;pairs&amp;quot; with one of the remaining cards in their hand they may lay down the pair, then the player shuffles their remaining cards in hand behind their back and presents them face down to the player on their left. Play continues in the same way until only the Zoo-Party-Card remains. The Player with the Zoo-Party-Winner card left in hand is the winner. Players May bluff in an attempt to make other players draw a card other than the Zoo-Party-Winner card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
