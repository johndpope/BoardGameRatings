			<description>Newton the hamster is having fun on the beach with his friend Sookie when they discover a mysterious golden seed. As Sookie was holding this very shiny seed in her hands, suddenly a crazy eagle comes from nowhere and kidnaps her carrying her high into the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newton quickly gathers all of his courage and begins work on an improvised whirlybird made from a natural green-shoot and a tight belt. Then adding the final touches of an old-timer leather helmet and some flight goggles (just because it's stylish) he's now ready for action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly, Newton, fly! Go after your girl and get back your golden seed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newton spits the ammo he finds within the levels. He can stock various stuff in his jowls and spit it at his enemies. He is also capable of charging and releasing a special attack. Each type of ammo has a different special attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
