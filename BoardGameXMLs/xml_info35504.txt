			<description>In this roll and move game each player controls a team of three motorcycles that enter a race in intervals.  Once more than one team motorcycle is on the trail, players choose which one to move forward.  However, motorcycles cannot pass others on the same team. Along the trail motorcycles can encounter breakdowns, various natural barriers, pile-ups and shortcuts.  The first player to get all three motorcycles to the finish line wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;Game board&lt;br/&gt;Dice&lt;br/&gt;Four sets of three motorcycles (each a different color)&lt;br/&gt;Four color-coded breakdown counters (for tracking lost turns for each motorcycle)&lt;br/&gt;Deck of breakdown cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
