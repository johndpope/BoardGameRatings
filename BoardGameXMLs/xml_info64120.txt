							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swish</name>
									
			<description>Swish is a boardless strategy game in which players race to build the longest fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, swishbones are scattered across the table randomly.  In turn, players move their swishes by moving swishbones from the tail of their fish to its head.  If the fish ends its move on a swishbone, then the swishbone is added to the tail of the fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A move can be anything up to the complete length of the fish, so longer fishes have more movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strict fish building rules mean that players have to plan their routes carefully, or risk penalty points by giving their fish indigestion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specialised swishbones offer special attacking and defensive options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no free swishbones, and players score 1vp for each piece in their swish, less 1vp for each penalty point.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Swish is created for the Nestor minigames competition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/461867&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/461867&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
