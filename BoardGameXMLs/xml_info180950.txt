							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Great Battles: The Napoleonic Wars</name>
									
			<description>Great Battles is a miniatures wargame that is played on a hex grid,  it combines elements of board gaming and miniature wargaming in its rule mechanics. Movement and firing ranges as well as arcs of fire, front, flank and rear zones are all regulated by a hex grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn represents 30 minutes of real time and each hex is 250 yards across.  Each hex can only contain one combat unit though commanders can stack with other commanders and/or friendly units. Units of deployed artillery, infantry or cavalry are faced towards a hex spine and have 2 front, 2 flank and 2 rear hexes. Command stands, infantry in square and limbered artillery do not have facings and can be positioned anywhere within a hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
