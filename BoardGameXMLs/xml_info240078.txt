			<description>This game is similiar to Pictionary/Charades as players try to make their team gues what word they are trying to explane. The explaining is done either by drawing or by miming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game there is a stack of cards. Each card hase 4 words on them. The words are organized in different categories. Electricity (thus the name Electronary), marketing, work and free time.&lt;br/&gt;The game board also has different squers with the same traits. Teams move by rolling dice and the player in turn has to explane the word from the categorie thir pawn stops at. If the team ques the right word in 1,5 minutes they get to throw again and continue. If not the next team goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
