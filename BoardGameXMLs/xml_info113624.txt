			<description>True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Golf Links (ペブルビーチの波濤 Sturm wave of Peburu Bichi) is a Super Famicom golf-related video game that was originally released in 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This video game takes place at the prestigious Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, California.[3] Apart from being one of the longest-named games on the Super NES, this game is one of the few golf games ever released on this system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The golfing engine is very complex and it takes many button pushes on the game pad in order to deliver a single stroke. Graphically, this game is clear and quite colourful. Of course, the green wash of the course itself is the dominant colour, but the trees water and sand look good enough, although they are exceedingly simplified. The menus themselves are devoid of any character, but are eerily reminiscent of a Microsoft Windows 3.1 application. There is match play, stroke play, and even tournament mode. Anywhere from one to four players can play this game. This game is also on the Japanese computer NEC PC9801 with the name &amp;quot;Pebble Beach no Hatou&amp;quot;, which can explain the similarities to a Windows 3.1 game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Golf Links&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
