							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der Tiger und der BÃ¤r spielen Schnipp-Schnapp</name>
									
			<description>54 cards (27 x 2) are mixed and equally handed out. Every player searches his card deck and sorts out every pair (two cards with identical small pictures in the upper quarter of the card). After that the deck is placed upside down in front of him. The starting player shouts &amp;quot;Schnipp&amp;quot; and all players begin to reveal their cards, placing them in front of their decks. The first player who notices that a pair is revealed shouts &amp;quot;Schnapp&amp;quot; and wins both piles of the regarding players&amp;rsquo; decks. Then the &amp;quot;Schnapper&amp;quot; sorts out the included pair(s). If the shout howevers was incorrect, the regarding player loses all his revealed cards which are then placed in the middle of the table. These cards are now handled like cards from other players in front of their decks. The player with the most pair wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition contains illustrations by Janosch - famous german illustrator, author of children's books and novelist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
