							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Where In The World is Carmen Sandiego? Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Object: Track Carmen and her gang by correctly identifying well-known people, places, and things.&lt;br/&gt;Contains: 28 trivia cards, which can be reversed to make a puzzle of a world map.&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;1. The first player becomes the Reader, and takes a card from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;2. The player on the Reader's left chooses a number between 1 and 20, and the Reader reads that clue. The player guesses the secret identity, and receives the card if correct. If incorrect, the Reader reads another clue to the next player. Play continues in a clockwise direction until someone guesses the secret identity and wins the card.&lt;br/&gt;3. The player on the Reader's left becomes the next Reader, and selects a new card from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;4. The first player to collect five cards catches Carmen Sandiego and wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
