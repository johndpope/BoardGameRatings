							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS TT: LZ X-Ray</name>
									
			<description>LZ X-RAY is a labor of love of designer Jason Brown and we know that YOU too will love the way the system seamlessly moves forward in time, from the French Indochina War to the latter part of the conflict, aka the &amp;quot;Vietnam War&amp;quot;. The place is a remote swath of empty terrain in the Chu Pong Massif foothills. There's one problem...almost an entire NVA Battalion is streaming out of the foothills toward you and your men. It's November 1965 all over again and YOU are under fire on a 'Hot LZ' and there is only one way in and one way out...by air. New counters join the system in the form of multiple helicopter models, the 'Thumper Gunner', M60 machine-guns, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ATS LZ X-RAY you'll be brought in....and hopefully back out again in a series of scenarios that depict the action from initial landing to Hot LZ and then some. Moore, Plumley, and all the valiant soldiers depicted in the book and movie &amp;quot;We Were Soldiers Once&amp;quot; are there and back in action again, facing a determined enemy with one goal: overrun the LZ and the men of the 7th Air Cav. You'll find all the termite mounds you can handle, NVA Regulars, historical leader counters, and Hueys...Hueys...Hueys...in various models. All with DETAILED COLOR MILITARY ART used for the die-cut counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LZ X-RAY provides all the combat counters you need to play, just bring your own ATS marker counters, ATS rulebook and standard play aids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
