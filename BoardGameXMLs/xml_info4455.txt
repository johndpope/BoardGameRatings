							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Invasion: The Gettysburg Campaign June 24 â€“ July 3, 1863</name>
									
			<description>THE GREAT INVASION is a two player, division/corps level strategic game covering Lee's second invasion of the North in June/July 1863.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has alternate player moves, representing both the strategic moves and the tactical allocation of units during combat. As units take their losses their combat strength declines and they will become ineffective. &lt;br/&gt;The game is ten turns in length. Victory is determined by the Victory Option chosen by the CS player and victory points obtained by each player during the play of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game map depicts the theater of operations from Harper's Ferry to Harrisburg. The map is divided into into forty six areas to regulate movement. &lt;br/&gt;Combat also takes place within these areas. The map also depicts the terrain in the theater of operations including mountains, mountain passes, rivers and defensible terrain all of which affect movement and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing pieces represent Confederate infantry divisions, Union Infantry Corps and the Cavalry Brigades  of both sides. Artillery strengths are built into the infantry units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
