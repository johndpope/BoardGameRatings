							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trap Shot</name>
									
			<description>This is a dexterity game, where players attempt to flip coins (intended for pennies), but dimes and nickels work great as well.  The catapult mechanism is a little unique.  It is on the far side of the board and players maneouver the catapult by remote with string.  Then players flip the coins back towards them on the board trying to hit one of the nine scoring zones.  Different games are included, like high score, or first to hit all zones, etc.  This game has a nice wood construction with an approximately 24 inch wood board, built up score zones, and metal rails for the wood coin catapult to travel on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
