							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Six Tigers Cards</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Six Tigers&amp;quot; Cards (六虎牌) are traditional playing cards of the Hakka minority in China.  They are arranged into four ranked suits  with cards numbered from one to nine inclusive.  Extra joker-like cards are optionally attached; any given deck may have from 0 to 5 of these extras (of which only two ever appear to be used in any published sets of rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games played with these cards tend to be multi-trick games for three to four people; in these games when there's a fourth that person doesn't actively play but only deals and is active in the ensuing payouts.  The deal changes each round depending on who won the previous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most cards of this variety have only the characters for suit and number (in Hakka traditional form, not normal Chinese characters) although some larger, more elaborate decks may have illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
