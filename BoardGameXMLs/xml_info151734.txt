			<description>Bobi is a new fast paced and addictive game with one very simple goal, to get rid of all your cards before everyone else, because no one likes to lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play in large groups and take it in turn to try and fire through a round with the same colour, but watch out because if you&amp;rsquo;ve played the highest card and someone else doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that colour you may be in for a very unpleasant surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins with the roll of a dice to decide the starting colour and after that the player holding the 'Bobi' card of that colour starts the game.  Each player then takes it in turns to play a card of the same colour until each player has played one card to end the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next turn begins with the player who player the highest card on the last go and continues until players have no cards left in their hand.  However if you don't have a card of the current colour you can play any card you want and force the player who has played the current highest to pick up all the cards in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
