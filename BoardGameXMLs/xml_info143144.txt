			<description>A childrens reaction puzzle game modelled after the musical chairs game: The game contains puzzle pieces for 5 cakes, each consisting of 9 puzzle pieces numbered 1 to 8 (the 9th is the central piece without number). Also 5 dice and 4 wooden cake pieces. The puzzles are sorted. The wooden cake pieces are put into the middle of the table, but their number is one less than the number of players. The players each get a special die depicting five blank sides and one side with a cake. The players roll their dice simultaneously. When a cake is rolled the player yelles &amp;quot;cake&amp;quot;. All players immediately stop rolling and grab a wooden cake piece from the middle of the table. Who was able to manage to grab a piece gets a puzzle piece of his/her choice. The player who is missing out on a cake does not get a puzzle piece. The first player to complete his/her puzzle wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box back: The dice roll and the cake fight begins. Everybody grabs quickly but not everybody gets a piece. Only good reaction gets a sweet reward. Who is the first to have a whole cake wins the game. Cake fight - the lightning fast reaction game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
