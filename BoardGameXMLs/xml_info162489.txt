							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood for Bellridge / Feast of Freaks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do your characters got what it takes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step into a world of post-apocalyptic gonzo adventure and find out! Introducing the One Day Digs Double Feature. Starting off with a bang, our first quest is Blood for Bellridge, followed up after a short intermission by Feast of Freaks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for introductory games at conventions, game stores, and private home tables, One Day Digs are the brain child of author Brandon Goeringer and illustrated by Will McAusland. They are crafted to showcase a bit of The Mutant Epoch setting and flavor, introduce some creatures and relics, as well as offer an example of how the Outland System game mechanic works. For the most part, these adventures are for 4 to 6 new PCs of first rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood For Bellridge immerses the characters in the rescue of an old friend, and the survival of an emerging town site. Feast of Freaks tests the characters in the swamps as they investigate the disappearance of boat load of medical supplies and her crew. Both adventures are only a few pages long, with creature stats and a full color cover and map included with each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
