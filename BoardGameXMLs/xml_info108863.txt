			<description>So You Want to Teach is a card driven game for two to four players on the issues and events many beginning teachers must deal with in the course of becoming a professional educator. The game is meant to serve as an entertaining vehicle by which students and practitioners in education can discuss and evaluate issues, trends, as well as their individual motivations, in K-12 education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each &amp;ldquo;turn&amp;rdquo; players deal five cards and then take turns drawing a card from those that remain. The drawn card&amp;rsquo;s Event is revealed/ read aloud to the others after which players can bid for the event by playing cards from their deck. The winner of the bidding will then take procession of the card, adding it to their &amp;ldquo;Portfolio&amp;rdquo;. A card that is not claimed will go into the discard pile. Instead of drawing a card a player can also &amp;ldquo;Pass&amp;rdquo; and exchange any or all of the cards in their hand for new cards from the deck, or to &amp;ldquo;cash in&amp;rdquo; the point values of their cards to advance their &amp;ldquo;Epistemology, Axiology or Political&amp;rdquo; track markers. Players can also exchange cards in their deck for &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; cards that can be used for various game functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of each player is to acquire a portfolio of Challenge and Opportunity event cards, as well as a number of sufficient Axiology, Epistemology and Political points to pass the Praxis III (professional licensing) exam and win the game. It is possible for all, some or none of the players to win the game by the last turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you want to teach? Learn, discover, reflect, and enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphics by Bruce Yearian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;84 playing cards&lt;br/&gt;4 player aid sheets&lt;br/&gt;24 markers&lt;br/&gt;4 pages of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
