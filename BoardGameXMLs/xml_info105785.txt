			<description>Napoleon Senki (ナポレオン戦記, &amp;quot;Battles of Napoleon&amp;quot;) is a Family Computer strategy video game that allows the player to re-enact the Napoleonic Wars using a bird's-eye view. The game includes all the major nations involved in the Napoleonic Wars including Czarist Russia and Great Britain.&lt;br/&gt;The game commences with the earliest battles against the Holy Roman Empire to grab territory for the fledging French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars in the year 1796 (the French Revolutionary Wars would end in 1802). This land would now be considered Italian territory and the battle was equally important in Italian history as it was in French history. There are also battles in what would now considered to be the Arab Republic of Egypt against the Ottoman Empire along with various other conquests in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Napoleon Senki&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
