			<description>Each player in the game is a shopper at a Thrift Shop. The players are competing against each other to be the first shopper to save an amount of money predetermined by the group before play begins. An end goal of $25 is the normal amount for a 4 player, 30 minute game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You save money as a thrifty shopper by rolling the six (6) dice provided. Each side of each die has either a monetary amount ($1, $2, $3, $5 &amp;amp; $10) or a special character ($, a circular arrow, X or Gift Card) on it. Earning money is as simple as rolling the dice and matching like amounts. After any roll, you must add at least one die to the scoring pool (these are the dice you are attempting to match like amounts with). You may stop rolling to score the amount of money shown on the dice once you have at least four (4) like amounts in your scoring pool. You may continue to roll the remaining dice, if you choose. You may also attempt to roll for the straight. A straight is one of each of the five different dollar amounts on the dice. If a player manages to roll a straight without using any &amp;ldquo;Wild&amp;rdquo; faces, that player may then choose to score $7.00. Should you not be able to add a die to your scoring pool, or once you have scored, your turn ends and the turn passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
