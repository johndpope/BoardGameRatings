			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien life forms have been a core feature of science fiction since the genre was conceived. Since then the human mind has dreamed up countless speculations about what these creatures might look like and how they might interact with us.  Not only has science fiction inspired us to daydream about meeting beings from another planet, we have also created alien heroes to admire and emulate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Infinite Aliens book 1 is a resource for gamers who want to create custom aliens for use as player characters and adversaries within the Infinite Futures game system. This book has everything you need to bring unique alien races to life in your science fiction campaign. Any type of creature you can imagine can be brought to life is just a few simple steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Aliens serves as guide to provide gamers with all the tools they need to create their own alien races. The book has step-by-step instructions that explain how to make a balanced, ready to play race using the Infinite Futures rules. The creation guidelines found in this book can be easily imported into other game systems, allowing players and GMs the opportunity to introduce these novel beings into any science fiction universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
