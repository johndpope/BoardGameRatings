							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Antagon</name>
									
			<description>Simple, tile-based game for two players in which each person controls a row of tiles representing various groups of ants.  Once each player has created a row of 6 ant tiles, they begin drawing &amp;quot;event cards.&amp;quot;  Amongst the event cards are eggs, which can be assigned to groups of your ants.  Other event cards will make the players' ants fight (possibly losing the eggs they're carrying) or allow them to change their ant army, or even allow them to steal the other players' eggs.  Once all the events are drawn, the game ends and the player with the most eggs wins.  Antagon is one of Kidult Games' free, &amp;quot;print-n-play&amp;quot; games available on their website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
