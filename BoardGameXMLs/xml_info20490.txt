			<description>Command a colorful fleet in this dazzling game of pattern recognition. With 55 different races and two levels of exciting game play, Regatta is the ultimate single-player game for all ages. Pick a card, and place your crew in their boats and columns according to color and size of each boat, with the captain at the bow. Now, as fast as you can, rearrange your crew and boats to match the colors in each column-but never move the captain or sail a boat to another row. once all crew members are rearranged into solid color vertical columns, you've won the race. Includes 55 cards, 22 boats, 80 colorful crew members and an ocean-blue game board with built-in card holder and boat trays. Grades 1+ Ages 6+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
