			<description>Now an official Manhattan superhero, The Purple Patriot is still searching for his ticket to the big time. So when he learns of a siege at Wilson Chase bank, he realizes this is exactly the opportunity he&amp;rsquo;s been waiting for. Forced to battle his own prejudices as much as terrorists, he sets about finding out who is behind the attack. A careless mistake, however, leaves him at the mercy of a former-friend and leaves the entire USA in peril.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
