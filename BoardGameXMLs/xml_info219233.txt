			<description>From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;by Patrick Edmind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cataclysm - Pure shoot-em-up arcade action for the unexpanded VIC 20 and the CBM 64!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lunar city of Erriam is under fearsome bombardment from the saucers of the Jovian empire. You are the commander of the lone laser outpost, and your mission is - hold out as long as you can, or there can only be one outcome - CATACLYSM!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructions are contained within the program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enclosed cassette contains the unxpanded VIC version on one side, and the Commodore 64 version on the other. You will find two copies of the program on each side, so that you have a backup copy. Just choose the side with the version for your machine and load as normal. There is a short header program which gives you the instructions. Read through these, and at the end of the instructions the main program will load and run itself automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cataclysm must be played using a joystick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
