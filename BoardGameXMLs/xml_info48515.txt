			<description>&amp;quot;The new challenge in Chess&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plex is a variation of Chess that can be played with 2-6 people.  It's played on a hexagonal board (with hex-shaped spaces) with the pieces still moving in the same way as regular chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 2 and 3 player variations, the pieces are set up similar to a normal chess board, in that each player's pieces are in 2 rows.  In the 4-6 player variations, each player starts their pieces grouped together in a &amp;quot;corner&amp;quot; of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are basically the same as chess: pieces move the same, capture the same, win the same way.  The main difference is that players can team-up against each other now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
