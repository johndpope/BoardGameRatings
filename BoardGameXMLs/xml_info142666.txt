But there won't be any time to rest as Flash is going to rush off into adventure leaving everyone grinding their teeth and grunting out &amp;quot;Arghhhhh!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All characters have attributes designed to add excitement and twists into the story with sessions structured to follow the classic Saturday morning shows, including the cliff-hanger!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed for the PocketMod format, print the game on a single sheet of paper, make a single cut, and fold into a little booklet giving you an RPG in your pocket!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
