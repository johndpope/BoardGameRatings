							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Miners</name>
									
			<description>The market simulation game Space Miners uses a simple production economy as a crucible for player conflict through commodity harvesting, conversion, and speculation, with an ultimate goal of sustained luxury good production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Space Miners, players work to create a largely self-sustaining mining colony while competing for control over internal trade of food and energy and the ore used to fabricate mining equipment. By becoming self-sufficient, whether by diversifying production or bringing to bear a dependable purchasing power, players can broaden their focus to include the colony&amp;rsquo;s founding goal: mining spice. But becoming self-sufficient means either wasting time on expensive, inefficient diversification or manipulating the market better than at least some of your fellow colonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food, energy, and ore are necessary to the colony&amp;rsquo;s success, and they take their value from the constantly shifting planetary economy. Spice, on the other hand, is a valuable off-world commodity. By shifting infrastructure to spice production, players who maintain sufficient reserves of food and energy can hit it big on the off-world market, boosting the colony&amp;rsquo;s prestige and visibility. And the player who accumulates the largest share of the colony&amp;rsquo;s wealth has put himself or herself on a fast track to the colony governorship after the mother ship returns&amp;mdash;but only if the colony succeeds overall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
