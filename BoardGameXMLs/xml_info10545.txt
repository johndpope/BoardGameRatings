							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Southern Fast Freight Game</name>
									
			<description>The Southern Fast Freight Game lets players have a shot at assuming the roles of railroad tycoons, earning big money from shipping cargo across the south-eastern United States of America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players' train token can each carry up to 2 cargo (represented by the Freight cards, which have designated origins, destinations, and payoffs).  Their owners move them from station to station based on the result of a die roll.  A train must land exactly on a station to pick up or sell cargo there.  If a train lands on a green Fortune space, its owner draws a Fortune card and follows its instructions.  Players start off with $50,000 and can borrow only from other players if their finances run low.  They are out of the game if they run out of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all Freight cards have been delivered.  The winner is the player with the most money at that point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
