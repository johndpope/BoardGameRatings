			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you watched cartoons in the early 80s, chances are you caught a glimpse of those little blue characters known as the SMURFS. After taking a break in the 90s, they're back again with their own game for the PlayStation called SMURF RACER. While you always knew these guys were cute, you probably didn't know that they like to drive fast. You can choose from eight Smurf drivers, each with an arsenal of hilarious weapons to take out the competition. Racing on 11 distinct tracks, you'll speed your way through five cool Smurf environments that will challenge your driving skills while also making you laugh. If you're feeling particularly wacky, take on a friend in awesome two-player action. With SMURF RACER, it's &amp;quot;On your mark, get set, Smurf!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
