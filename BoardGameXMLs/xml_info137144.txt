			<description>From the back of the box: &amp;quot;On a turn, a player spins the spinner and moves his or her playing piece the number of spaces indicated.  If the space has a horse on it the player must answer a question chosen by the opposing player. If the player answers the question correctly he or she claims the horse shown on the space.  The player's turn is over after landing on a space with a horse on it whether or not he or she answered the question correctly.  If a player lands on a space with a horse on it and the opposing player has already claimed the horse shown, the player can take that horse away by answering the question correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 7 horses wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
