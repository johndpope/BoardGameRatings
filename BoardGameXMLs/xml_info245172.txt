			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list with 100 base items, as well as some alternatives, that could be found by players looting a garage, or vehicle repair shop, following an apocalypse, a zombie outbreak, or simply during an investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the items are potentially useful, either for repairing a needed vehicle, or as improvised weapons. Others are far less useful, and will do for simply filling up an empty area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example results are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;36. Gloves (Disposable plastic to strengthened work gloves)&lt;br/&gt;37. Grease Gun (Hand or air powered, for applying grease)&lt;br/&gt;38. Hand Cleaner (Tubs or pumped containers of cleaning solutions, such as hand wash and degreaser)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
