							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Raccoon is at the Candy Shoppe</name>
									
			<description>You are an international Spymaster for a global power during the Cold War. Uses your influence and espionage skills to sway the greatest spies in the world to your cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Raccoon, the greatest spy the Cold War has ever knewn, is up for grabs. As a overseer for one of the great superpowers try and recruit The Raccoon, and his fellow super-spies, to your cause. By peddling influence, sending agents on strategic missions and carefully timing your secret plots you can sway these critical soldiers in the shadows and declare victory without dropping a single bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Raccoon is at the Candy Shoppe challenges 3-6 players to deduce who is friend and who is foe. Use your table position to send your suspected enemies&amp;rsquo; agents into danger or to control the outcome of an assignment. Will your carefully laid traps eliminate a dangerous spy or will your most trusted resource double cross you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you will send a spy out to a hotspot in the Cold War. When they arrive all spymasters will secretly spend tokens to influence the spy toward their goal or to twist the outcome of the mission. After all available spies have been placed players take turns revealing the tokens at each location and choosing how the mission will resolve. If your ideology has the most spies on your side at the end of the game, you win the Cold War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
