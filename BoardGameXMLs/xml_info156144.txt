							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pizza Delivery Boy</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When three brothers mismanage their successful pizza restaurants and the businesses start to falter, the bank manager threatens to shut them down if they don't return to profitability. It's up to you, the new hire, to restore the ailing pizza parlors to their past magnificence. But the task won't be easy. Players earn money by making and delivering pizzas throughout three busy towns crawling with scoundrels and hazards like hungry dogs and oil slicks. Players can also unlock faster vehicles and earn extra cash on their days off by taking on various side missions, including street racing and cooking competitions. New hires who rake in the dough will rescue the family business and become a local hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
