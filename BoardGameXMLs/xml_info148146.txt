			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;InFlux is a 3rd person puzzle gme. The protagonist, a scifi looking ball, drops from the sky. After that, you're rolling around through beautiful landscapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these landscapes are glass and steel houses, which contain puzzles. It looks like the small real world hand held puzzles where you have to tilt and flip the puzzle to get the ball through. Besides rolling the ball, tilting entire structures and using things like fans, there's more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many puzzles you'll need your powers of attraction and repulsion to manipulate larger balls to their goals. Get the right balls in the right goals and the glass structure opens so you'll have an exit towards your next puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
