			<description>FOOLMANIA: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The cutthroat stock market game that teaches you nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Foolmania is the card game that rewards strategic play, creative thinking, backstabbing, and a little bit of good fortune. Your goal is to build a first-rate investment portfolio by acquiring great companies and avoiding lousy ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each turn, players buy from a group of available investments. Players may also play Jester cards, allowing them to change the mechanics of the game. Foolmania is simple and easy to learn, but the endless combinations of cards make Foolmania engaging, challenging, often laugh-out-loud funny, and highly re-playable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Are you the smartest, most creative, or perhaps the luckiest investor in your group? Play Foolmania and find out!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foolmania was published privately by The Motley Fool in 2001, and distributed as a gift to customers. Copies remain extant, and indeed, continue to be played with enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
