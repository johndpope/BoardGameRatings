			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aching for a two player game? Have a chess set just collecting dust in the house? Afraid to take on the house champion for fear of embarrassment? Then prepare to parry, charm and back stab your way through this strategically clever spin on chess. Beguile is an exciting add on to any standard chess set that will have you looking at strategy in a seedy and underhanded new light. Beguile is a game for 2 players. A standard chess set is required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw a hand of five cards from a shared deck of fifty cards. On their turn they may play a card from their hand to make a pawn move like a knight, raise a piece from the dead via Necromancy, give your opponent's pawns the plague, or perform many other actions to achieve victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
