			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Summary and Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elandr&amp;eacute; val&amp;rsquo;Assante, daughter of the Prelate of Coryan, invites the PCs to her father&amp;rsquo;s villa in Grand Coryan on a matter of some urgency and delicacy. When they arrive, they learn that Elandr&amp;eacute; is about to be engaged to Rurik val&amp;rsquo;Tensen, the son of Milandir&amp;rsquo;s Duke of Moratavia. She has no desire to marry a Milandisian, and cannot fathom why her father, Acastus, refuses to tell her his reasons for the betrothal. She would like the PCs to find out why this marriage has been arranged, and perhaps to find a way to prevent it, depending on what they learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the PCs&amp;rsquo; previous experiences, they may be presented as Elandr&amp;eacute;&amp;rsquo;s honored guests, or disguised as servants in her retinue. In either case, they will have opportunities to interact with many powerful figures from both Coryan and Milandir. However, they will not be able to learn much about the marriage until the betrothal is formally announced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
