			<description>The game is as simple and ingenious as a pyramid. It has simple rules. Each player has a small pyramid in his own color with four golden joker blocks stuck at the bottom. On his turn a player builds a block on the larger central pyramid. Blocks can be build on top of four other blocks as long as no other color has the majority in those four blocks. First player to build the top block wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;The rules contain four variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
