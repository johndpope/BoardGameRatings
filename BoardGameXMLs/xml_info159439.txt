			<description>This is a car race, so obviously the winner is the one who is the first to reach the finish line. The movement of the racing cars is determined by a die. Several segments of the race track have special rules, like the results of the die counting double or half. The Players get two different kinds of cards they may use during the race instead of rolling the die. The red spurt cards allow the car to advance from a space with a yellow arrow to the next space with a red tableau. The green attack cards allow a car to exchange it's positon with any one opponent on the throw of an even number. But beware: If the die shows an odd number, the car remains on it's position and doesn't advance at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
