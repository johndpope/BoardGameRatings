			<description>Crystal Warriors (アーリエル クリスタル伝説?, &amp;quot;Ariel: Legendary Crystal&amp;quot;) is a turn-based fantasy strategy video game for the Sega Game Gear handheld system. It was released by Sega in Japan in 1991 and North America in 1992. The animation was done by Kugatsuhime, a Japanese video game company. The gameplay of Crystal Warriors is similar to both the Shining Force and Fire Emblem series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player forms a party of up to nine units to fight in each level. The player starts on one side of the map and an enemy force of up to nine units occupies a castle on the opposite side. The player must defeat the enemy force or move a unit on to the enemy castle entrance to complete each level. Each level has terrain features which form bottlenecks or change the speed of units. The player controls specialized units belonging to a particular elemental group and most of the strategy revolves around the element of a given unit and its correct usage. Each element is weak to one and strong versus another in a rock-paper-scissors system. Fire elemental units are strong against wind elemental units, while wind units are strong against water, and in turn water units are strong against fire. Earth-based units have no particular strengths or weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player unit attacks an enemy unit or vice versa, a battle occurs. A battle consists of two rounds where the units can fight with melee weapons, spells or monsters. The attacking unit strikes first in each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crystal Warriors&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
