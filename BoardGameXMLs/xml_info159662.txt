			<description>Two players confront one another to construct the least high tower with 3D polyominoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players have a gameboard 3x3. In the center of the table, there are 29 3D polyominoes. Initially, each player chooses a polyomino. When both players have chosen a polyomino, they exchange. Everyone must now place the piece on his board. A polyomino must not exceed the gameboard. Then everyone chooses a new polyomino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When each player has placed 14 polyominoes, the game is over. The player whose tower is less high wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
