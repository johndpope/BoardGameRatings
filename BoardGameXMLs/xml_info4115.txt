			<description>The game consists of a playing board layout of a typical 18-hole championship golf course. A tee marker is moved along the course to indicate the number of strokes (rolls of the dice) a player has taken to &amp;quot;hole out.&amp;quot; Twenty-five chips are given to each player at the start of the game, and these are given up as a player fails to keep their ball on track, eventually being won by whoever has the low score for the game. Also included are 3 dice and a pad of golf scorecards. The score is kept for each player as in golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
