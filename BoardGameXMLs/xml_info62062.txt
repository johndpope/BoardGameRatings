							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Explorer</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruins of ancient mystery. Arcane wildernesses and grim shadowscapes that mimic the world. The endless horizon. Many adventurers visit these places and forge their own legends in unknown realms, but few feel as at home on the road as the explorer.&lt;br/&gt;     Explorers feel drawn to move against the grain of the world, discovering places it has forgotten and learning things unknown for centuries. Amazingly, these brave souls survive solely on their wit and martial talent. They are exhaustive in their research and exacting in their physical practices. Few explorers will go in search of a destination without learning all they can in advance, and none will go without the proper tools.&lt;br/&gt;     This guide provides those tools in abundance. Characters of other classes may find the multiclass feats herein useful, but most of the book is built specifically for the explorer (a martial controller).&lt;br/&gt;     So grab your pack, whip, and antivenom - the path to discovery awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
