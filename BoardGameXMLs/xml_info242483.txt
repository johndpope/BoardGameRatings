			<description>Noir is a &amp;lsquo;denouement&amp;rsquo; game for 3 &amp;ndash; 6 Detectives that lasts only a few minutes per round. The &amp;lsquo;denouement mechanic&amp;rsquo; is a special type of storytelling game, where the key elements of the stories events are determined by the game, then the players must weave them together in the most inventive of ways. &lt;br/&gt;In Noir the game&amp;rsquo;s Judge sets a Victim and a Killer. Then players must select a Means, Motive and Opportunity from cards in their hand. They then use these elements to tell the story of how the killer did the deed. Preferably this is delivered in the style of a Detective in the third act, revealing to the audience and assembled cast just how clever they were to figure it out. The stories are cross examined and picked for holes by the other players, before the Judge settles on the best, using whatever criteria they prefer.&lt;br/&gt;Noir is packed with a grim cast of Femme Fatales, gum shoe P.I.s, mean Mobsters and hardened Hit Men. The play throws up stories which are by turns dark, hilarious, inventive and always, always memorable. &lt;br/&gt;At the bitter end the best denouement of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
