			<description>This party game is similar to other UPL drawing games like Beetle and Gooffy, but is slightly more creative. Each player receives a sheet with 12 head-and-shoulder outlines in numbered squares. The game is intended to be played by partners at a table of four or six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a die. When either partner rolls a six, both are allowed to draw a nose on the first face on their cards. Thereafter, each player rolls only his own result, adding a hat on a 5, mouth on a 4, neckwear or an eyebrows on a 3, and an eye on a 2. The cards include 10 suggestions for hats, and say neckwear can be ties or bows for men and necklets or brooches for ladies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as one player completes a picture, he calls &amp;quot;Beauties&amp;quot; and players record a score for that round. Each feature is worth the same number of points as the die number required to draw it. When playing with multiple tables, the two highest scoring players move to the next table, and the lowest-scoring player rolls first in the next round. The game ends after a maximum of 12 rounds (when each card is filled up), and the winner is the player with the most total points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules note that winners are most likely at tables where the players cooperate in throwing the die as quickly as possible, which &amp;quot;we may add causes riotous laughter and excitement&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
