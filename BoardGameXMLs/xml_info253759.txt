			<description>The Queen of Hearts from Alice&amp;rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland is an aggressive monarch with a whimsical temper. She has a nasty inclination to utter her favorite words whenever subjects displease her; &amp;ldquo;Off with their heads!&amp;rdquo;  and just like that, she suddenly needs new Gardeners to decorate the royal garden&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your teammates have been appointed as the new royal gardeners! The job is a dangerous one. Keep the Queen happy while planting the royal garden and you will keep your job and your head. But the Queen of Hearts is whimsical. Indeed, whenever you decipher her floral preferences for the royal garden she changes them on a whim; almost as if she is itching to deliver her famous phrase. Stay one step ahead of the Queen as you fill the garden and your talent will go recognized across the land.  But make one small mistake and the last words you hear from her might be &amp;ldquo;Off with their heads!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt; Paint the Roses is a Cooperative Deduction game for 2-5 players. You will need to use strategy, logic and teamwork to win. On your turn you take one tile and put it in the garden to try and give your teammates information about your card and to get information about your teammate's cards. Correctly guess what is on the cards to advance. The Queen will be chasing after you, and if she passes you, she will take your heads along with her, but if you complete the garden you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
