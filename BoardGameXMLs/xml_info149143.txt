							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Pack 10: Attack From Mars and Genie</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack adds recreations of two pinball tables to Pinball Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack From Mars was released in 1995 by Bally and has an alien invasion theme. The playfield includes a moving flying saucer which must be shot down by the player, after destroying it's force field by hitting the three targets protecting it. The Martians are attacking five famous monuments around the world, including the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of Pisa and the Statue of Liberty. The overall goal is to complete six different objectives, to enable Rule the Universe mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genie was released in 1979 by Gottlieb and features a fantasy 'genie in the bottle' theme with terrific artwork. The table features five flippers on the playfield, including two in the top left which create a mini-playfield. As with many tables of this era, a key way of scoring points is to increase the Bonus and the Multiplier, which are scored when the ball drains. Gaining extra balls allows the Bonus to be scored more times, but on this table it is also possible to score the Bonus earlier by building the Bonus over a certain level and hitting the Kickout Hole in the top right corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
