			<description>Ganbare Goemon: Sarawareta Ebisumaru! (がんばれゴエモン さらわれたエビス丸?, &amp;quot;Persevere Goemon: Kidnapped Ebisumaru!&amp;quot;) is a Game Boy game and the first game in the series released in for a portable system in 1991. Gameplay is similar to Ganbare Goemon! Karakuri Dōchū which was released on the Famicom. Only Goemon is playable, and the game consists of him rescuing Ebisumaru; Sasuke and Yae do not make appearances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was originally only released in Japan. In 1997 Konami started releasing the Konami GB Collection, a collection of four older Konami games re-released with Super Game Boy color palette and borders added. Goemon was released in Volume 2 in Japan. In 2000 they were again updated for the Game Boy Color, translated, and released in Europe, for several games it was their first release outside of Japan. For the European release the order for the games was altered so what was Vol. 4 in Japan became Vol. 2, with the Japanese Vol. 2 and 3 becoming Vol. 3 and 4. For the European port the title screen was changed to Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon, and just &amp;quot;Starring Goemon&amp;quot; on the game select screen since the most recent Goemon games released in Europe were Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon and Goemon's Great Adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ganbare Goemon: Sarawareta Ebisumaru!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
