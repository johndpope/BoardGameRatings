			<description>In Facility, a small group of invaders breaks into a well-guarded facility - skulking in the shadows, sneaking up behind guards and taking them down silently, dragging the bodies out of sight - with the goal of stealing valuable corporate secrets, or assassinating the enemy strategist, or sabotaging top-secret industrial production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's the catch? You don't control the team breaking in, you control the guards. Although 'control' isn't quite the word; you watch as your team follows their patrol routes, then - via a hand of cards - interject with that casual glance over the shoulder or decision to switch direction at a critical moment, to catch the intruders... off-guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facility is a solo game that plays out as a cross between a deckbuilder and an AI-driven miniatures game. The player controls the actions of his guards by buying and playing cards from his deck, while the intruders follow a simple set of rules to sneak up behind the player's guards, knife them in the back and drag their bodies out of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
