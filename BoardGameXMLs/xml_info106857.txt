			<description>from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is this picture worth a thousand words?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indeed. It is worth a lot more than one thousand, in fact. For the vocabulary of &amp;lsquo;Word Flyer&amp;rsquo; numbers well over 2,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a formidable vocabulary for a game -&amp;ndash; or even for a person, when you think about it. But don&amp;rsquo;t let that frighten you. These words are easy and friendly. They zoom and fly. And there are birds to keep you company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick a word and match it with a zooming word. Simple? Yes, but then there are hazards. Clouds obscure the zooming words. Nonsense words try to confuse and tempt you. And as you get better, the game gets faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But take heart. In time, you will succeed. And when you do, we&amp;rsquo;ve arranged a very special surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A SPECIAL WORD TO PARENTS. Children don&amp;rsquo;t have to be able to read to be able to play &amp;lsquo;Word Flyer&amp;rsquo;. In fact, if a child is able to operate a computer joystick, he or she is probably old enough to enjoy this game. Lower levels teach children the alphabet. Upper levels teach more complex pattern and word recognition, spelling, vocabulary, and pre-reading skills. Moreover, we have seen &amp;lsquo;Word Flyer&amp;rsquo; prompt many children to use a dictionary for the first time, to learn about new and unfamiliar &amp;lsquo;flyers&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
