							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Schoolhouse on the Prairie</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a schoolhouse, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The only thing you&amp;rsquo;ll be learning today kids is violence! Seize them!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Schoolhouse on the Prairie map is a single large map of a prairie schoolhouse and its surrounding environs. This product includes a single 360-degree panoramic view from inside the middle of the schoolhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Schoolhouse on the Prairie map is intended for Western games. However, it would not be out of place in a Modern game in a more rural village. Probably no longer used, but could be preserved for historical reasons. This could also be used in a Horror game, with the schoolhouse being used to hold out against a horde of zombies with them grabbing the axe out of the stump to chop zombies, using the lumber to board up the windows to protect against zombie attacks, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teacher could a love interest of one of the Player Characters or one of the Player Character&amp;rsquo;s children could go to school here. One of the group&amp;rsquo;s enemies learns of this fact, and then goes to the school to kidnap their love interest or family. The group rushes to the school to rescue the teacher and kids, but they have to capture or kill the villains without hurting any innocent bystanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
