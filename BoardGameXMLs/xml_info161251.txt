			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you need a themed map now, with plenty of prompts to inspire adventure - ahead of time or at the table - look no further...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landscape: The Broken Road is a tool containing two versions of a detailed map: one of them pre-marked, the other blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first version is marked with six locations (bureau, basin, runs, dormitories, crescent and sanctum), each given a table of six possible encounters or discoveries. It is also marked with six access points and the page has six possible rumour seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second version has no lettering or numbering, to make it easier for you to adapt it to the circumstances in your world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each map can be used as it is, possibly in conjunction with 1:285 (6mm) scale miniatures, or redrawn as required in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tool is compatible with various genres and systems and suitable for use in roleplaying and beyond. It can be used as all or part of an adventure site, or the basis for one, as well as to inspire events at the site, even at the table in the course of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three pages are arranged for ease of use on screen or printed, each version occupying a single page. The tool includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     two versions of a detailed map - one of them pre-marked, the other blank&lt;br/&gt;     six marked locations - bureau, basin, runs, dormitories, crescent and sanctum&lt;br/&gt;     six tables, one per marked location, each with six encounters or discoveries&lt;br/&gt;     six possible rumour seeds relating to the map, for expansion or inspiration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tool can be used with Narrative: Abandoned Space, the map elements acting as a setting or structure for development. It can also be used in representing the kind of subterranean space suggested in World: Shale or a section of the tunnels running through the weird mountainous shore of Screeside, as featured in Abandoned Space and Events: Screeside â€“ The Gloaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
