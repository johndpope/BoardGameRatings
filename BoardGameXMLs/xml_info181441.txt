			<description>Litterateur is a card-drafting and word-building game for up to five players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For five rounds, players will draft cards into their hands and use these cards, along with three common cards, to produce a word. the player with the best word will get to choose any three cards in play to put into their score pile. The player in second place will get two cards and players in third and fourth place will get one card each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the sixth round, players will use these previously scored cards to produce a final word. The player with the best word in this final round wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, players must draft wisely at the beginning and end of each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
