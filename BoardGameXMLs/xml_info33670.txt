							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Compact Racing Game</name>
									
			<description>The game box contains two compact discs with 60 pre-recorded horse races with commentary by a featured horse racing English celebrity commentator. Also contained are a pack of 60 starting prices cards, a betting slips pad, scrip (in various denominations), a pack of race cards numbered from one to sixty and a results pad &amp;amp; pen.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to accumulate the most cash by placing &amp;amp; winning bets on six races. &lt;br/&gt;A player is selected as banker/bookmaker and hands each player (including him/herself) the same amount of starting cash.&lt;br/&gt;The first race commences with a starting price card from the relevant (shuffled) pack turned face up for all players to see. This will show each of eight individually named horses together with their starting prices for either a win or a place (second or third) as an odds expression. Each player is issued with a betting slip and now decides how to place bets given the information odds provided by the starting price card turned up. When all bets are placed, the banker collects the betting slips &amp;amp; cash from each player and turns up a card from the previously shuffled race number pack. This will indicate which audio track of the two compact discs will be played for this race (track 1-60). After a full audio commentary of the race is heard, the race commentator will announce the winning and second and third placed horses. The Bookmaker writes down the named horses on the game pad provided in order to facilitate paying out the winning players at odds shown on their betting slips. After all bets have been settled, the next race commences in a similar fashion.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the sixth race the player increasing his/her original capital by the most amount, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
