							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Italy (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)</name>
									
			<description>Another fanmade Italy map for Ticket to Ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a relief-like view of Italy, each city is indicated by a little flag of the country it is located in. &lt;br/&gt;The game works with 3-4 players but players use only 40 instead of the usual 45 waggons. It has been designed in a way that highly frequented cities (like Rome, Florence and Naples) are not used very often in the destination tickets. Therefore it is very probable that you have to go past through these cities but it's not very likely that players will score a huge amount of points directly from that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
