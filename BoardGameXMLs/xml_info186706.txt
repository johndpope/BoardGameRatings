			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA (Electronic Roleplaying Assistant) is the ultimate companion for Rolemaster campaigns. Using ERA players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ERA, you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. To create an interesting character, a good selection of race and profession is paramount. Rolemaster also provides background options to add more variety between characters. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample races, 2 professions and 3 background options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This feature package is the ultimate Shadow World addition for ERA RMC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It provides 68 RMC races, as presented in Shadow World Master Atlas. Each race impacts stat and resistance bonus, initial languages, number of background options available, and includes the complete detail of description and special characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick from any of 68 races (yes, sixty eight!). Fair skinned Linaeri elves, or sinister Dyari, stout Umli, the winged H&amp;iacute;razi and the reclusive D&amp;uacute;ranaki. Are you aiming for a character in a high-powered campaign, or a detailed NPC? Why not create a Storm Giant? Of course, you can always choose to create a K&amp;rsquo;ta&amp;rsquo;viiri, just ask your GM very nicely for permission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, any future Shadow World content developed for ERA RMC will be included in this same package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
