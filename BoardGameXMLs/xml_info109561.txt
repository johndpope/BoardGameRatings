			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the modern world, it is often more valuable to be famous than to actually be skilled at doing anything useful. People are more likely able to name the stars of a reality TV show than their own elected officials. They can list off the hottest celebrity nightclubs and restaurants more readily than they can the capitals of the States or even major nations around the globe. And those lucky few who have captured the public&amp;rsquo;s imagination can cash in on their notoriety in many ways&amp;mdash;getting free gifts and services, preferential treatment, and even immunity to some laws and regulations simply by flashing a smile and flaunting their fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building Blocks: Active Reputation features a set of optional rules that increase the variety of ways that a Reputation check can be used in the game, turning the stat from a passive measure of general awareness into a powerful engine of social influence. These will be most useful in campaigns where fame and public perception are important factors&amp;mdash;where the heroes or their adversaries rely on the support of the general populace or are can reasonably expect to influence people and situations merely through the power of their notoriety. Also featured are details on the organization Campbell Daniels Industries&amp;mdash;a highly successful real estate and construction firm that is most notable for the thrill-seeking, publicity-grabbing exploits of its owner, Campbell Daniels (for whom there is a fully fleshed-out NPC write-up).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
