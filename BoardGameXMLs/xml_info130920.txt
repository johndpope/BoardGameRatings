			<description>A game that owes something to Solitaire. The board is an equitateral triangle with parallel lines connecting each of the 55 holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three game versions are included. The first is for two or three players and starts with the board emptied of all it's pegs. Each player takes turns in adding a peg. If the peg completes a line, the player scores points. When the board is filled up, the winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game two starts with the board filled with pegs except the the hole in the middle of row seven. Each player takes turns to jump over a peg Solitaire-style and can continue jumping if there are more jumps available to him. The winner is the one with the most pegs once no more jumps are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third game is for one player who starts with the board full of pegs except for the one in the middle of row seven. The game is won if the player can take off every peg by jumping them and get down to just one peg left. For a harder game, that last peg must be in the hole which was vacant at the start (the one in the middle of row seven).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
