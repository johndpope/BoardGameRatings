			<description>In Anjos &amp;amp; Drag&amp;otilde;es two or four players control factions of bionic dragons and magic angels. Each player must first take down five protection shields to finally give a killing blow to the opponent and rule the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first brazilian edition has four factions, each one with 50 cards. A faction have four copies of 12 common cards and two copies of 1 evolution. You can play with them right out of the box or mix non-opposing factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use they cards as Generals, Allies or imediate effects. During a player's turn, he/she will put Generals in play to attack the opponent. The defender can use one of his Generals to block or put in play a new one from his hand. There are no mana or any type of resources to summon Generals: you can use all your cards in an attack, but remember that you will need defense later!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card have a General Strength and a Ally Strength. While some are strong when leading an army, others are better following orders. Also, some have special abilities when performing a specific role. A combat is resolved comparing total opposing Strengths. During an combat, the player with fewer strenght total is allowed to add allies to a General to revert the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards can also be discarded from hand to have an imediatte effect, which can change completely the result of a battle. Effects can vary widely, from keeping some nasty units out of battle, destroy allies, give extra attacks or protect valuable combatants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards used as shields, when destroyed, reinforce the owner's hand and can be played just after. Choosing wisely when forfeit a block, can give you precious resource to win the next battle and  become the new attacker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 13 distinct cards per deck, each play allows you a unique experience combining powers and imediate effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
