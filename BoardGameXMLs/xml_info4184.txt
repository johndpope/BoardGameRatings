							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gigantic</name>
									
			<description>Titanic was the ultimate chick flick. Gigantic is the ultimate spoof game! Guys, this is your chance for revenge. Your significant other made you watch the movie over and over again. Now you can play parody versions of any of the movie&amp;rsquo;s characters over and over again. Do your best to escape the sinking Gigantic...While preventing the other players from also escaping. This is a VERY cut-throat game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schmooze, threaten or beg your way onto a lifeboat and be sure to lock all of the stairwell doors behind you. It wouldn't hurt to take a gun with you either...People on deck make easy targets. Perhaps you prefer the less violent method of passing yourself off as a crew member while ordering everyone to &amp;quot;back away from the life boats&amp;quot; with your bullhorn as you bob in the relative safety of your own lifeboat? Whatever means you choose for survival, there's laughs aplenty in this new strategy board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
