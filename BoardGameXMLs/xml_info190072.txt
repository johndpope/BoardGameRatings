			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explorardor is a 2-6 person game that takes players on an adventure throughout a new city, with the goal of collecting as many fun memories as possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires players to think on their feet, make tradeoff decisions and use their strategy hats. The first to make 10 memories in this city of the world is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a strategy game that is accessible to the broader public - think more like &amp;quot;Ticket to Ride&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;Agricola&amp;quot;. Suitable for multiple ages and with a changeable board and 6 characters to choose from, the game is different every time. In order to make memories players have to roll custom dice for movement and making money, draw and play cards to decide which activity to go to and spend money to move additional spaces and/or do activities. On top of this players can use the cards in their hands to block other players, take more money from the bank and steal memories from others. But, beware of rolling the dreaded doom5day number which could could derail you or the whole game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
