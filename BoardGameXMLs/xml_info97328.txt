			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ONI BLOOD... ONI GAUNTLET&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fearless warrior youth Onimaru hears word that his home, Iga, is in grave danger. Like the wind, he rushes home. &amp;quot;Please let them be alive!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once inside his village, Onimaru comes face to face with a group of grotesque demon-like characters--Genma! What is this?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finall, Onimary is reunited with Iga's Ninja chief, Sandayu Momochi, and his sister, Oboro. The wise Sandayu tells the young warrior of the ongoing terror caused by the Genma King, Nobunaga Oda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then Sandayu reveals to Onimaru his ultimate destiny. A descendant of the mythical Oni Tribe, Onimaru must meet his destiny head on and fight the evil Genma armies. Sandayu bestows upon Onimaru the legendary Oni Gauntlet, a mystical glove with powers to aid him in his quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Onimaru bows his head. His fate is clear. He must go and fight the evil warlord and his hordes of Genma!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
