							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trioker</name>
									
			<description>The Trioker pieces are similar to the 24 mac-mahon triangles, except that the values are set at the corners instead of the sides. There is also a 25th special triangle, called Joker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two boards allowing two different kind of games : a pure abstract game for 2 players, and a bidding game for 2 to 3 players. Also included a set of puzzles to be solved for a single player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first sight, Trioker looks very much like Tri-Ominos, but in fact it is a much more complex game, with lots of logic involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
