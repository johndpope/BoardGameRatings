							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vergogne: The City of Romance</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vergogne, was once a small town on the east coast of Montaigne. Now, after the largely false claims of the local priest, it has become a place of pilgrimage for those who seek romance, and a booming business has flourished to support them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobles, duellists and adventurers all visit Vergogne in the hopes of finding love. But in this town it can be expensive, and danger still lurks behind the endless parties and soirees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement details the town , its people and festivals, including a wealth of places and NPCs you might transplant to your own setting in Th&amp;eacute;ah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also includes detail on running romantic plots and adding a little style and flair to your Heroes by using fashion as a deadly accessory to their blades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
