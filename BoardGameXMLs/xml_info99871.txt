			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the turn of the 20th century, the Springfield Armory was conducting tests on behalf of the United States Ordnance Department with the objective of commissioning a new, more powerful handgun for use in suppressing a rebellion in the Philippines. After evaluating contracts from several manufacturers, the armory had eliminated all but three contenders: two American companies (Colt and Savage), and a German manufacturer (Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken, also known as DWM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For its entry, DWM created an entirely new .45 caliber Luger that shared no parts with any of the company's other models. They kept two of the prototypes at home and supplied two to the Springfield Armory, who reportedly subjected one of the specimens to an exhaustive battery of tests, culminating in rigorous stress trials that ultimately destroyed the weapon.&lt;br/&gt;Satisfied, they kept the second aside and requested 200 more for field trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, DWM decided not to fill the order. They based the decision on their perception that, as a foreign competitor, their chance of winning the contract was insufficient to justify the expense of retooling their plant to produce such a large run. They abandoned the concept of a .45 caliber Luger and never produced another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
