			<description>Each player plays one of three alien races that have landed in a tiny Appalachian village. The object of the game is to kidnap as many humans as possible for &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; and get them back to the saucers. As a representative of a race of &amp;ldquo;visitors&amp;rdquo;, you want your group of aliens to get more victims back into the saucer than the others!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed as an introduction to miniatures gaming for new players, R&amp;amp;R uses the basic principles of miniature gaming in an easy to digest, simple form.  The alien figures move by a ruler (but can teleport over the entire board) and engage the human figures by appearing in front of them or making contact. A deck of reaction cards drive the human quarry without the need for a referee and generate much of the humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game premiered at PentaCon in 1998 as a non-threating, humor game for the non-grognard attendees.  It became a hit and was played there and at a few other regional conventions.  A PDF of the basic rules , the deck of reaction cards and a primer on making your own version were freely distributed.  A play-at-home version was offered in 2005 at PentaCon through the R&amp;amp;R/GuffeyConRevue booth.  The production version of the game came in a plastic clamshell containing cardstock figures and buildings. It also included a single  d6, d10, d12 and custom scatter die used for teleporting. In May 2011, a generous review of the game was offered in the Lost Game Safari column of the 'Knights of the Dinner Table' (issue 175) by Andy Miller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
