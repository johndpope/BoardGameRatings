			<description>Game from The Children's Book of Games, Puzzles and Pastimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSTRUCTIONS. You will require one counter, pencil and paper and a pack ot playing cards to consist only of the ace, 2, 3, 4, s. 6 of each suit. You will find it a most enjoyable game for two.&lt;br/&gt;1.    First choose your teams and write them down on a sheet of paper in score-card form.&lt;br/&gt;2.    Toss for innings. That is, cut the pack and the one with the highest card (the ace counts as one) chooses whether to bat or bowl.&lt;br/&gt;3.    The batting side places the counter on the starting square and the bowler proceeds to bowl the ball by taking off the top card in the pack.&lt;br/&gt;4.    The batsman moves the counter according to the number turned up by the bowler&amp;mdash; the ace counts as one&amp;mdash;and the score shown by the square on which the counter lands is put down on the score sheet for the first batsman. But remember that extras are not included in a batsman&amp;rsquo;s individual score but are added below the score to make the total.&lt;br/&gt;5.    The bowler bowls again and the score is now put down for the second batsman. The game continues thus&amp;mdash;bowling to the two opening batsmen alternately.&lt;br/&gt;6.    When a batsman is out, continue playing alternately with the man left and the next batsman.&lt;br/&gt;7.    Carry on round the board until the tenth wicket falls and the last man is then left &amp;ldquo;not out&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;8.    The other side then bats and scores as before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one with the highest total score is, of course, the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
