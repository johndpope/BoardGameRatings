							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghostbusters</name>
									
			<description>The RPG based upon the very popular Ghostbusters movie. The box contains a very light Training Manual for players, an Operations Manual for the GM. various maps and plans, Ghostbusters permits, damage waivers, id cards and badges, a bunch of d6 and a special Ghostbusters d6 and a couple of introduction sheets How To Play and Typical Ten Minutes Of Play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the material is written in a light joking style, with the Ghostbusters Venkman, Egon, Stantz and others chipping in with gags and tips. Players need to accumulate Brownie points as part of their missions. The GM's book has loads of hints on style and ideas for missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses WEG's d6 system, which basically involved rolling a lot of d6, comfortable for normal people, a shock for RPGers at the time. What, no d20?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arrival of this RPG was eagerly awaited and the news that West End Games (WEG) had beaten TSR to the license was significant in its day. WEG had developed their own d6 system, and their focus on using very simple rules helped them secure this coveted license and emerge as the only strong competitor to the mighty TSR. At the time, the Ghostbusters RPG was seen as proof that RPGs could be for anybody, contrary to the heavy anti-D&amp;amp;D propoganda of the 80s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
