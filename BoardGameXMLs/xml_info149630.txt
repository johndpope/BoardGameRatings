							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nights of the Crusades (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nights of the Crusades is a roleplaying game set in a land and time that is familiar on the surface, but within its cracks lie tales of alchemy, madness and violence. It is a world that could have happened and then been lost to barbarity and time. Players take on characters that can explore its lands and plunder them for wealth, glory or knowledge. The world is rife with dark cults, creatures that dwell in unseen places and bloodthirsty warriors. This is a time when anyone&amp;rsquo;s thoughts, from king to slave, are enough to condemn them to death and hell, and many are they that will line up to cheer the execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting of Nights of the Crusades is a mixture of the One Thousand and One Nights, the history surrounding the Crusades and both modern and ancient tales of terror. This is a Pathfinder Compatible adaptation that includes details of the setting, how to use the Pathfinder rules to run a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overhaul of Alignments: Attitudes evolve the Pathfinder Alignment system so that characters can hold the views of Fanatics, Belligerents, Skeptics, Egotists, Martyrs or Outcasts. In Nights of the Crusades, evil is truly in the eye of the beholder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New classes: The Caravan Merchant, an intrepid explorer that aids a group though a chest filled with exotic treasures; the Orator, who commands a small group of followers and inspires allies through intense speeches; and, the Scholar, a knowledge-seeker who walks the path of invention, lore, medicine or a combination of the three;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as 2 monsters and an adventure to launch you into the world of Nights of the Crusades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
