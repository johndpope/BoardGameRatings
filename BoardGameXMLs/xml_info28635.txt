			<description>Each player must try to move his four pieces across the board to the opposite side.  The winner is the first player to do so.  There is no &amp;quot;taking&amp;quot; or removing shapes from the board, and there must never be more than one piece on any square. Players have to match shape or color to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
