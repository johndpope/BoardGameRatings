			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an unfortunate autocorrect mistake, a mad scientist attempting to create elemental cats with 9 lives has instead created elemental cats with 9 limbs - and counting, as the cats are mutating more arms by the minute! Armed with their new elemental powers, the cats are now engaged in a fierce battle for dominance - and with the ability to absorb limbs from their fellow mutants, some dismemberment is bound to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reign supreme as the longest cat in Cat-A-Pillar, a 3-6 player card game about building long cats out of things like dragon wings, or shark fins, or...cherry blossoms? Use your special limbs to dismember your friends&amp;rsquo; cats, then add their limbs to your own body to become the longest (and best) cat on the table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players have the oppurrtunity to both draw from the deck and steal another player cat&amp;rsquo;s limb and add it to their own cat. Drawing from the deck can also get you powerful Catastrophe cards, which will help your cat become longer, faster. The first player to reach 9 limbs and shout &amp;ldquo;Cat-A-Pillar&amp;rdquo; wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
