Something tells me we ain&amp;rsquo;t in Vietnam anymore&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;Corporal Keith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PWYW Above Decks features fourteen different upper decks of ships including a Viking longship, two styles of airboats for use in the bayou, a river patrol boat, a modern gunboat, a steampunk-style gunboat with double-barreled cannon in the front on a swivel turret, a modern tugboat, a canoe, and six rowing boats of various styles and sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PWYW Above Decks is intended for use in fantasy, western, steampunk, and modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost in Time: While on a routine patrol along the Saigon River, a patrol boat is engulfed by a roiling mist. When the mist cleared, the crew of the patrol boat found themselves in unfamiliar territory, the thick jungle foliage replaced by sparse evergreens and grass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They spot a huge longship headed toward them. The longship is being carried forward by a combination of a square sail on a single mast and the determination of the ship&amp;rsquo;s rowers. Massive men wear heavy fur clothing and cloaks. They clench axes and round shields in anticipation of boarding the player characters&amp;rsquo; patrol boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters have superior modern guns with the benefit of fantastic range but if the Vikings can get close, they will massacre them in close quarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters have to defeat the Vikings and figure out a way to get back home. Turn around and go back through the mist with their patrol boat? Take over the long ship and go into the mist?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
