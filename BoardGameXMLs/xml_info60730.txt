							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curses!</name>
									
			<description>User Summary: Includes overview of curse across cultures, as well as new curse-based spells, classes, and feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this book is to serve as a supplement to d20 games. It provides new options and material for incorporating a greater use of curses into a d20 fantasy game. This book explains some of the background of the phenomenon of curses as well as a series of new spells, feats and prestige classes. Though primarily intended for the dungeon master (DM), this book can also be used by players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curses are magic spells placed upon people, locations or objects with the intent of causing harm. Curses have a long history that spans most cultures and time periods. The common thread in almost all is an intense desire to cause truly pernicious harm to an enemy. Enemies take many forms and occur on many levels; thus, the level of harm and intensity of the curse also vary quite considerably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
