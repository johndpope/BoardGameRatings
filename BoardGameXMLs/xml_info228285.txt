			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Clay, 1835 takes place at a critical juncture in the life of the Cherokee Nation and its relations with the United States. Georgia had been clamoring for the federal government to remove the Cherokee from its state ever since the 1802 Compact. In recent years, their demands have become more urgent, especially after the discovery of gold in the Cherokee Nation in 1829. The focus of the game is the Cherokee National Council meeting at Red Clay, Tennessee in October 1835, at which United States commissioners formally presented the Cherokee with terms for a removal treaty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
