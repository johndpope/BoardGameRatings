			<description>Monster hunt is a free, quick-paced card game in which you compete against other players trying to catch monsters that are on the loose using traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the target number of monsters trapped has won the game (If a player runs out of traps they have lost the game.)&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a total of 10 traps. These are represented by trap counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of cards which you can print yourself represents your search.Each time you draw a card you could encounter a monster to try and trap, or discover somewhere to explore or find something that will annoy your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In monster hunt you can play to win or play to make your opponent lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the game  has easy to follow rules and is aimed at children 8 and above although adults enjoy it just as much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full rules and cards to print are available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.auxlengames.co.uk/monster%20hunt.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.auxlengames.co.uk/monster%20hunt.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play are two players, a six sided dice and something to represent traps (coins or buttons).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
