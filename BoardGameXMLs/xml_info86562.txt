			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever think that tacking on specialist wizards to the wizard core class was kinda lame? Ever think that the specialists needed to be written up as their own distinct classes? Yeah, us too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enchanter is the fifth offering in The Core Specialist Wizard series. Each product of the series will present a different specialist as its own core, 20-level class, with distinctive abilities. Other related materials, including feats, two prestige classes tied to the core specialist class, and a small offering of related magic items, are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within The Enchanter you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The enchanter core class. These specialists wizards excel at manipulation and control.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for mundane hypnotism, using hypnosis through skill use and without magic or similar abilities.&lt;br/&gt;     The alpha warden prestige class. A master of beast and wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;     The enticer prestige class. Able to hypnotize and command with a glance or word.&lt;br/&gt;     9 new feats with a focus on the enchanter.&lt;br/&gt;     4 new magic items, the lover's arrow, bewitching stone, globe of trances, and thrall collar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
