							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Living Planet: Arboria</name>
									
			<description>Arboria brings its own novelties, and a strong theme! This expansion is fully compatible with the two previous ones: Aquarius and Industria!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arboria Expansion provides a new resource to exploit. Wood! But, as everything seems unusual on this planet, these trees are special&amp;hellip; The sap they contain can be sold a fortune back on Earth. Burnt in a stove, it is twice more efficient than best wood you could use! And finally, travel time to bring it back to Earth allows its optimal drying! Here a sixth way to make rich!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wood is a rare resource here. There will be less wood than the other resources. Cutting wood is pretty easy, sawmill produces wood on 2 die values. Watch out! Shortage and Market crash will occur more frequently&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woods are thick and vehicles can&amp;rsquo;t move in&amp;hellip; Furthermore, this wood is nearly impossible to extinguish when set on fire. A new cataclysm shows up: Forest Fires. Ferocious and brutal, they are only triggered in woods. Scientists didn&amp;rsquo;t find any solution to protect yourself from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arboria also includes two special buldings: Botanical Research Centers and Shipyards to be used respectively in combination with Industria and Aquarius Expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
