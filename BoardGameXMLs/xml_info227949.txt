			<description>From the Avalanche Press website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No intelligence reports had prepared the German Army for the new Soviet T-34/76 medium tank: a well-balanced vehicle with much better firepower, armor protection and mobility than anything in the German arsenal or even on German drawing boards. In December 1941, the Germany Army&amp;rsquo;s Weapons Bureau ordered two firms, MAN (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N&amp;uuml;rnberg) and Daimler-Benz, to produce designs for a new medium tank to out-perform the Soviet T34/76. A third firm, Skoda, was not invited to participate but submitted a design anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After initially selecting the Daimler-Benz tank and bestowing the name &amp;ldquo;Panther&amp;rdquo; on it, German leader Adolf Hitler later backtracked and ordered the MAN tank into production instead. The Daimler-Benz prototype, known as the VK3002, was shunted aside as was Skoda&amp;rsquo;s T25. The MAN Panther eventually became a formidable weapon, but initial production models suffered mechanical problems thanks to its rushed development. Either of the other two tanks would likely have been available sooner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant Panthers lets you try out these rejected tanks on the battlefields of Kursk, in South Flank and Burning Tigers. The Groundhog Day 2016 Golden Journal includes 24 new laser-cut, mounted pieces depicting these two tanks in both German Army and Waffen SS livery. It&amp;rsquo;s a good-looking set. Plus you get scenarios for their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
