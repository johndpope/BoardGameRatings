							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Things to Find in a Pet Store</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of items, with a base number of 100, as well as some alternatives, that could be found by players looting or investigating a pet shop, excluding live pets themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether or not any of the items are any use will depend on the creativity of the players. Some definitely have potential uses, other than their original ones; others, not so much. The list is weighted towards cat and dog items, but there are things for other creatures, including such as wild birds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example results are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;63. Heat Mat (Mains powered, a flat mat used to heat the floor of vivariums)&lt;br/&gt;64. Litter Tray (For use with cat litter)&lt;br/&gt;65. Live Reptile Food (Live food for feeding to reptiles, in boxes, such as crickets, locusts, hoppers, fruit flies, mealworms, morioworms and waxworms)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
