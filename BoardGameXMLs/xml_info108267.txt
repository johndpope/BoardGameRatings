			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&amp;rsquo;S RESOURCE by Julian Neale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, your PCs have emerged from the dungeon ready to spend their loot on all manner of magical equipment. Returning to town they ask &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s for sale in this town, anyway?&amp;rdquo; At that point, likely or not, the game grinds to a halt as the GM frantically generates what items are available for purchase or he simply says &amp;ldquo;anything up to the gp cap.&amp;rdquo; (After all, most GMs have better things to do with their prep time than generate what the PCs might want to buy on the off chance they return to town after a successful foray).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s For Sale, Anyway? II banishes these problems by providing 87 pre-generated, ready-to-use lists for the busy GM to immediately use in his campaign. Also included are eighty sellers the GM can use to roleplay the resultant negotiation and transaction or to provide adventure hooks. Buyers should be beware, however, for among the hundreds of magic items for sale lurk 41 cursed objects...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
