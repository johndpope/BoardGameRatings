			<description>Monopoly-style game that is more fun for anti-establishment rules and instructions than the gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to four players compete by making investments and by choosing one of five tax options each turn. Players choose a tax option (Innocent, Honest, Shady, Illegal, or Fraudulent) by taking the top card from the pile of their choice and putting it on top of their own stack. The more dubious the tax option, the greater the reward; however, it is the top card showing on your stack that will determine how you fare should a player call an audit on you. Choosing an &amp;quot;Innocent&amp;quot; card can offer sufficient advantage in an audit that you may choose to audit yourself, especially if your opponents have likewise followed this path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
