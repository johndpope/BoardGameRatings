			<description>Strategy Rummy is described as &amp;quot;a bet and bluff game.&amp;quot; This game was published as a follow-up to another MB game: Strategy Poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy Rummy is played using a vinyl table cloth, mini poker chips, and a special deck of cards (which includes six wild cards).

Place a meld or lay off cards onto the vinyl table cloth&lt;br/&gt;D. Ask for bets from opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players go out by playing all seven cards from the hand onto the vinyl cloth. The player with the most chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
