							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vordis Scourge, Volume III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Terrifying Merger of Cold Steel and Undead Flesh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vordis are a group of construct-like creatures that are part machine and part undead, preserved flesh. The vordis come in many shapes and sizes, and indeed, they are in many ways more of a culture or an organization than they are a race. Their numbers grow by harvesting the flesh of living creatures, which they incorporate into ever more strange and exotic designs The ultimate goal of the vordis is nothing less than to recreate all life in their own twisted, metallic image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents both mythic and non-mythic versions of two members of this terrifying race. The vordis brute (CRs 8 and 10) is the shock trooper of the vordis forces. A fearsome combatant with overwhelming power and a horrifying poison that transforms its victims into vordis, their only weakness is the breathing tube that sustains them. The vordis prospector (CRs 3 and 4) serves as airborne reconnaissance for the vordis. These monstrosities have humanoid torsos which hang upside down from large fleshy balloon-like sacs, which explode when punctured. Beyond these four monster stat-blocks, the book also contains a graft from each of these two types of vordis monstrosities, allowing players who harvest these parts to attach them to themselves in order to use the vordis&amp;rsquo;s greatest weapons against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
