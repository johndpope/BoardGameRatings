			<description>To win, you need to visit eight places (10 points each) and have the fewest demerits (-5 each).  Players begin and end at home and move on all rolls except doubles.  Doubles change the traffic light spaces in the city portion of the board from red to green (or vice versa).  Players cannot move through red lights.  If a player lands on a red space (not red light), he is in violation and has to roll to see if he will get a demerit or not.  If a player lands on the same space as another player he causes an accident.  Five demerits result in having the license revoked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
