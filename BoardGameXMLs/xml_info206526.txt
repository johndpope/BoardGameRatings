							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Onward, Wee Beenships</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Onward, Wee Beenships is a fantasy roleplaying game that does not use dice or luck. Players take control of hive-minds comprised of creatures called Beens, collectively referred to as Beenships. Onward, Wee Beenships borrows the quest format familiar to the fantasy genre&amp;mdash;but not a whole lot else&amp;mdash;and focuses on exploration and discovery. The themes herein are about adaptability, about being very small in a large and unknown world, and solving problems through personal growth and teamwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Onward, Wee Beenships can be played with about two to six players, plus a Gamemaster or GM. The GM does not control a Beenship, but instead describes the nature of the rest of the world. There are no dice or character sheets, but counters (especially stackable ones) are recommended for keeping track of one&amp;rsquo;s Beens. Without trackers, keep good notes on a piece of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
