							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City of Carse</name>
									
			<description>The City of Carse is a fully populated, predominantly human city designed to be compatible with any of the currently available fantasy role player games...  It is especially designed for optimum enjoyment when used with the Cities rules published by Abrams and Everson (Midkemia Press).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages ago the inhabitants of this area were invaded by the army of a baron from a now near-mythical kingdom of the east.  The Old Race, as the original inhabitants were called, resisted the newcomers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A people of the sea, given to fair hair, green, blue, and grey eyes, the Old Race found their simple life as fishers, hunters, and traders changed by the more vigorous newcomers.  Though resentful of the newcomers and their castle, they were slowly absorbed into the newly emerging city.  Upheaval in the kingdom a center later caused the Baron of Carse to be nearly forgotten, and it is now a completely independent state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carse, despite being forgotten by the kingdom, is a busy trading center on the coast of the Endless Sea.  Ever day ships from distant lands, flying strangely colored banners can be seen entering and leaving the harbor, bringing new trade goods and leaving with the products of the city.  This has provided the city with a cosmopolitan feel far in excess of its size and location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
