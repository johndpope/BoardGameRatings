			<description>A betting game made to emulate an 1800's style bar betting game where there would be no &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player rolls two dice.  They're placed to the side and their total is noted.  In clockwise order, players place bets as to whether their roll will be higher or lower than the first roll.  Maximum bet is the number of players in the current round.  Minimum bet is 1.  Then in clockwise order the players roll the die again.  If their total is higher than the original noted roll they take the &amp;quot;High&amp;quot; bets.  If their total is lower than the original noted role they take the &amp;quot;Low&amp;quot; bets.  On a roll that matches the original noted roll they take both piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When players tie for high and low they must split evenly leaving the remainder in the betting pools.  If a player or players roll a match then no &amp;quot;High&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Low&amp;quot; players win and all bets are divided equally among winners leaving remainders in their original betting pools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
