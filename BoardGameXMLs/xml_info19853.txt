			<description>Stock market game in which players try to grow an initial nest egg into a fortune. Each player begins with the same amount of money to invest in companies from 8 different economic sectors - utilities, insurance, banks, automobiles, manufacturing, oil, airlines, and electronics. Players take turns buying companies one at a time until no one can or wishes to buy any more. This is the only opportunity players have to invest their money. After all buying has ended, players take turns rolling dice and moving around a board. Upon landing on a space a player executes the action listed there. These include capital gains and losses, in which the player gains or loses money if he owns a company in the sector listed in the space. The more you paid for a company at the beginning of the game, you more you gain or lose when landing on these spaces. Some spaces result in the player drawing a random event &amp;quot;Broker&amp;quot; card; others pay dividends or direct the player to advance or retreat several spaces. The game ends when all players have made a single circuit of the board and land on the final space with an exact roll of the dice. The player with the most money at that time wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
