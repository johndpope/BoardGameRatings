			<description>Colony Wars: Vengeance is a space simulation video game for the PlayStation developed and released by Psygnosis in 1998, and sequel to the original Colony Wars,...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game retains the win-lose scenario styling of its predecessor, only now the player controls a pilot, Mertens, who has enlisted in the Colonial Navy. Finally united and breaking out of the Sol system, the Navy has gained a new leader, Kron, who has motivated the descendants of the abandoned Sol System Navy to the point that the Navy begins active combat operations against the League. Like the first game, there are several endings, with Mertens directly involved in all of them. As the Navy is struggling from the very beginning to fight the greater League of Free Worlds, all but one of the endings chronicles their failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another addition,..., was the ability to upgrade the abilities of one's ship. Completing one mission earned the player one tech point, which, when accumulated, could be used to upgrade thrust, shielding, afterburner, and the turning ability of the player's selected craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Colony Wars: Vengeance,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
