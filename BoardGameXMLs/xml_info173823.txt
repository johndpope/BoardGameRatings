			<description>A word game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn, a player draws a card which will have a letter on it. He can now move one of his pawns on to a coloured space if he can think of a word that begins with the letter on his card.&lt;br/&gt;On a purple space he must name an object.&lt;br/&gt;On a red space he must name an animal.&lt;br/&gt;On a blue space he must name a fruit or plant.&lt;br/&gt;On a white space he must name a boy or girl's name.&lt;br/&gt;If a correct answer is said, the player keeps the card.&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, both of a players' pawns will reach the middle of the board. Everybody now tries to make the longest word they can, using the letter cards they have collected during the game. The player with the longest word, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
