			<description>This curious little game depends on magnetism for its play mechanism. Each player gets 6 little balls (called Clickets) with magnets inside them. four of the balls are bi-colored, so you can tell which end is which. However, the remaining two are a uniform color, which means you can't really tell which end is north or south in terms of polarity. There's a nifty wooden board with a grid of 3X4 shallow depressions. The game is simplicity itself - take turns placing a Clicket. If you cause two or more Clickets to click, you have to take them back. The winner is the first player to get rid of all his Clickets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the packaging strip (also in Dutch and German):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play CLICK-CHEK&lt;br/&gt;In turns,  one CLICKET is placed on the board.&lt;br/&gt;The player that causes CLICKETS to click together has to take these CLICKETS back.&lt;br/&gt;The player who first is rid of all his CLICKETS is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
