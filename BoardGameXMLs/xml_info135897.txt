			<description>promo text from publisher:&lt;br/&gt;First there was light. But the time machine was already there. This album is a journey through four eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the beginning of time, when the world saw its light. Ancient, powerful cultures and what remained of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sun God, the Light of the World: the large churches have illuminated dark times &amp;ndash; or made them even darker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas lanterns shed their light on an era of mechanical marvels, of technicnological achievement and of the omnipresent steam that drives everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Days bring the world down into darkness, progress has turned against the people, survival is a relentless, grueling battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end there is this tantalizing light. And we succumb to its temptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tracklist:&lt;br/&gt;CD 1&lt;br/&gt;- Ancient Realms&lt;br/&gt;    Initially &amp;hellip; (4:14) But Then, Everything Turned Out Quite Differently&lt;br/&gt;    Creation Of The World (4:44)&lt;br/&gt;    Made From Scratch&lt;br/&gt;    Gods (3:17)&lt;br/&gt;    They Watch Over Us&lt;br/&gt;    The Great Temples (4:27)&lt;br/&gt;    Home Of Gods&lt;br/&gt;    Gory Rituals (2:06)&lt;br/&gt;    Don&amp;rsquo;t Enter The Circle&lt;br/&gt;    Age-Old Legends (4:14)&lt;br/&gt;    Listen To Your Forefathers&lt;br/&gt;    Ruins (3:59)&lt;br/&gt;    Legacies Of Great Cultures&lt;br/&gt;    Founder Of A Dynasty (3:12)&lt;br/&gt;    A King By His Own Hand&lt;br/&gt;    Foreign Signs (3:36) Obscure Messages From The Dawn Of Time&lt;br/&gt;    The Obelisk Awakes (5:35)&lt;br/&gt;    Solving The Riddle Of The Ancestors&lt;br/&gt;    Seekers Of Long-Forgotten Treasure (3:46) Returning From A Great Adventure&lt;br/&gt;- Empire Of Faith&lt;br/&gt;    Feast Of Sacrifice (2:40)&lt;br/&gt;    It&amp;rsquo;s That Time Of Year Again&lt;br/&gt;    Visions (3:00)&lt;br/&gt;    Talking, Floating Images&lt;br/&gt;    Cathedral (4:25)&lt;br/&gt;    Worshipping Higher Powers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crusade (5:02)&lt;br/&gt;    Our Means Justified&lt;br/&gt;    Temptation (3:56)&lt;br/&gt;    Straying From The Right Path&lt;br/&gt;    The Saints (5:09)&lt;br/&gt;    Powerful Allies At Your Side&lt;br/&gt;    Wrath Of The Gods (3:46)&lt;br/&gt;    Don&amp;rsquo;t Mess With The Wrong Guys&lt;br/&gt;    Prayer (4:01)&lt;br/&gt;    From The Bottom Of Our Hearts&lt;br/&gt;    Divine Miracle (3:56)&lt;br/&gt;    In God&amp;rsquo;s Presence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CD 2&lt;br/&gt;- Era Of Steam&lt;br/&gt;    Machine City (4:15)&lt;br/&gt;    Beauty Of The Industry&lt;br/&gt;    Under The Light Of Gas Lanterns (3:58) Big Plans, Modern Technology&lt;br/&gt;    The Mechanical Pony (3:15)&lt;br/&gt;    Wait Until You See The Automatic Bartender!&lt;br/&gt;    The Factory (4:08)&lt;br/&gt;    History Is Made Here&lt;br/&gt;    Steel Warriors (4:04)&lt;br/&gt;    These Fellows Will Secure My Success&lt;br/&gt;    Conqueror Of The World (4:17)&lt;br/&gt;    Soon, Very Soon, It Will All Be Mine!
