			<description>The &amp;quot;Roll&amp;quot; of the Missionary is a short Roll and Move game designed to help the player prepare for an LDS Mission. The players first get baptized as a member of the LDS Church through a series of die rolls. Once that is achieved, the players become missionaries and race to convert as many other people as possible along the track. The game ends with a shake-off to roll each unique symbol at the chapel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six dice sides are:&lt;br/&gt;Seek for Truth&lt;br/&gt;Pray&lt;br/&gt;Study the Scriptures&lt;br/&gt;Repent&lt;br/&gt;Warn Your Neighbor&lt;br/&gt;Being Baptized&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
