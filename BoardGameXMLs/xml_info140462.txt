			<description>&amp;quot;One against All&amp;quot; in English is a word game in which a player, in turn, plays against all others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player has 6 minutes to choose three secret words (maximum 10 letters per word), and gives a definition for these three words. The player draws half of the letter-cards for his opponents and gives information how many number of times this letter is present in the words etc. Player keeos other half of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the cards are drawn, the opponents have 6 minutes to find the words. For this, they can ask questions related to words, the player can only answer yes or no. Opponents can also ask if the letters kept by him during the draw are part of words.&lt;br/&gt;The player receives tokens for each question or request letters, and receives a bonus for word not found.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over several rounds. The final winner is the one who has the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
