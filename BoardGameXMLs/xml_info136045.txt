							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Drive: D-Masters Shot</name>
									
			<description>Dragon Drive was an aerial combat game, set primarily in large, outdoor arenas where players had to face several waves of enemies. With multi-directional dash and lock on abilities, the game has sometimes drawn comparisons to the Zone of the Enders series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also has a handful of rail shooter levels, drawing frequent comparisons to Sega's Panzer Dragoon series, but these comprise only a very small portion of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dragon Drive: D-Masters Shot&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
