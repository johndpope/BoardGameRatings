			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Chomagepoly is about :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game made and sold for the benefit of LIP strikers.&lt;br/&gt;This is the antithesis of the game &amp;quot;Monopoly&amp;quot;. A kind of goose game that represents the struggle of workers put to unemployment by their company. Players must unite against the opposition forces and fight together against the system: convince the population, put pressure on the government, resist the police, the bosses, and other forces. And find a job.&lt;br/&gt;The player must act for everyone's sake: it's a cooperation game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it is played and won:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a board (40 squares), &amp;quot;cards&amp;quot; (factory, luck, coordination, balance of power, solidarity), dices, 6 pieces. &lt;br/&gt;We start on the starting square then we advance by rolling the dice and we fall on other boxes (a bit like monopoly).&lt;br/&gt;You can play 3, 4, 5 or 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;Money is replaced by &amp;quot;power relations&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are not fighting against each other but together to save the companies started closure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary(French):&lt;br/&gt;Un jeu qui est l'inverse du monopoly et qui a &amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; &amp;eacute;dit&amp;eacute; par les travailleurs de LIP lors de gr&amp;egrave;ves en 1976.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
