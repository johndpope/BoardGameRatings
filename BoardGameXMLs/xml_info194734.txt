			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game have a Sect (somewhat like a nationality) that influences their Skills.  Characters have six Skills (Attributes): Calligraphy, Law, Numerology, Luxury, Renown, and Esteem.  These Skills have a value, or &amp;quot;Stat&amp;quot;, that can vary during play.  Each Skill is aligned with a Bonus, respectively Illumination, Righteousness, Insight, Leisure, Prowess, and Respect.  Characters then select Rituals and define Allies.  Action resolution involves rolling a dice pool and counting successes.  Most character actions are opposed by a named opponent called a Jinn, usually under game master control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game initially was published in a well-formatted HTML document on an off-forum site; to comply with the competition requirements, it was later &amp;quot;cut-and-pasted&amp;quot; into the text-only forum, losing much formatting and some clarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
