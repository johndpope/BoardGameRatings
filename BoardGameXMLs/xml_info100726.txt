							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zanshin</name>
									
			<description>Zanshin is a fast-paced bluff-based game about samurai fencing inspired by kendo and &amp;quot;Book of Five Rings&amp;quot;. This game is my attempt to focus gameplay on &amp;quot;learn your opponent&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;learn in-game tactics&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has same hand of skill, bluff and attack cards and five random Strike cards. Each round player try to spend less skill cards than his opponent in order to get advantage or catch an opponent on opposite strike. Players play their skill and bluff cards face down to form their intention for current round, than reacts on opponent's strikes and than ether evade or counterattack.&lt;br/&gt;Three player variant Twofaced Dragon allows player to recreate 2vs1 fight. This variant keeps almost all mechanic from main rules and all players starts with same sets of cards, so wining this fight is very thought challenge for Dragon. I tired to make this variant as close to real situations in kenjutsu as possible. There is no artificial benefits or constrains and every mechanic change justified by real aspect of that kind of fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
