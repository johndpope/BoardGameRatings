							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mage Codex</name>
									
			<description>The Mage Codex is a cutthroat game of aggressive deck-building and fluid combat set in a fantasy universe.  Your goal is to eliminate all other players by emptying their draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to defeat your opponents by eliminating their draw decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two primary stages to the game: Gather and Battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the gather stage, all players get a chance to draft the cards they want to use into their deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle stage is all about aggressive deck building, where all the card you want are either stolen from your enemy or you must sacrifice your own life to acquire them.  You will take turns to draw cards (possibly from your opponents sources), then play cards to attack opponents, steal their cards, and protect your own decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the last mage standing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
