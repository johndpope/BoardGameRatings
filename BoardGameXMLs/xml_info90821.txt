							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le Festival de Cannes</name>
									
			<description>Cannes Film Festival is a play by Jean-Rene Vernes. This is a deck of cards depicting scenes from movies (all won awards at Cannes), actresses and actors, as well as imaginary scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to achieve the best possible shows, to get a prize at the end of the Festival in May.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some interesting mechanisms to be faced. The value of the stars is given by each player from 1 to 20. The final value is the sum of the best and the worst rating. All cards are awarded to bids by a system quite original, I invite you to discover by reading the rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In endgame, three prizes are awarded: Best Performance, Best Screenplay, the Grand Prix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
