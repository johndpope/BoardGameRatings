			<description>A single card is distributed to each player.  The cards are numbered 1,2,3,... with ten cards more than there are players.  Players have three minutes to find a partner and put their cards on the score chart, which is numbered 100,95,90...  Each team's base score is divided by the difference between their cards.  For example, players with a base score of 90 and cards 41 and 45 would score 22.5 points.  The player with the smaller number in each pair gets a 5 point bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, first place gets 5 points, second place gets 4 points, etc.  At the end of five rounds the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several variants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Lying - players do not have to reveal their actual card numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Cheating - players can cancel a marriage if they find a better partner.  Players who are dumped receive a 5 point bonus on the round.  Emptied spaces on the score track are not refilled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) The Big Trick - play the game with two different groups.  With one group, describe the game mathematically.  With the other, describe it romantically.  Compare the differences in behavior of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love and Marriage was created for a middle school teacher who was looking for a good interactive classroom game on the subject of love and marriage.  It was included in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
