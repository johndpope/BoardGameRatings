			<description>(from box back)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you've ever read the newspaper or a magazine, listened to the radio or watched TV, you're sure to be a winner in Headline Deadline, the game where a little general knowledge goes a long way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's an outrageous game of strategy and insanity as headlines are read out loud and your teammates start yelling out related facts at a furious pace. But the seconds are flying by as you try to write down as many facts as your hand allows - all within a 30 second DEADLINE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, no! Time's up and the correct matches have to be tallied before you can move along the track, rolling and racing towards the finish. But was that your sweetheart's fact you forgot to write down? Geez! You'll never hear the end of it!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
