			<description>The first edition of HellRail was quite different from (and in most respects inferior to) subsequent editions.  The easiest way to describe the first edition is to contrast it with the more widely known second and third (p)e(r)ditions, as only thirty (30) copies of the first edition were printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most significant differences is that the cards each have only one use in first edition, and so are divided into types:  Circle cards, Rail cards, Passenger cards, and Damnations (one-use special powers).  All cards are shuffled together at the start of the game, so the Circles are not laid out to begin as they are in later editions.  The board is formed throughout the game by placing Rail and Circle cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another big difference is the fact that Circle cards have no special powers in first edition.  Special game effects are only available to players fortunate enough to draw the Damnation cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     80 cards, Bridge-size (rectangular), full-color fronts, black &amp;amp; white backs, many miscut&lt;br/&gt;     4 engine tokens, cold-cast resin (poorly cast, as no vacuum table was used), unpainted (so all are white, distinguishable only by shape... spider, serpent, demon, and skull)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    HellRail (Second Perdition)&lt;br/&gt;    HellRail: Third Perdition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
