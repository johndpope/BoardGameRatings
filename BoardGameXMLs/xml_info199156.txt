			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have never read a game book quite like this one! Written by a practicing medical doctor, Insults &amp;amp; Injuries presents real world illnesses in Pathfinder game terms. Why afflict characters with &amp;ldquo;filth fever&amp;rdquo; when you can give them rabies, the black plague, or the flu?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this sourcebook, you will find dozens of sicknesses that your players already know and fear in a format that allows them to be easily and realistically brought into your games. You will also find expanded rules for more effective non-magical healing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This detailed book is divided into an introduction, 14 chapters, and six appendices and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for more than 50 diseases and disorders, their game effects, and how they can be treated by both mundane and magical means.&lt;br/&gt;     A chapter on the effects of alcohol, drugs, and poisons.&lt;br/&gt;     A chapter on mental illnesses and their game effects.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for adjudicating surgical procedures.&lt;br/&gt;     Four new prestige classes dedicated to nonmagical healing, the Alienist, Apothecary, Chirurgeon, and Physician.&lt;br/&gt;     Special rules on the effects of illnesses upon non-Humans like Drow, Dwarves, Elves, Giants, Goblins, and Orcs.&lt;br/&gt;     New spells, equipment, and feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this book, you and your players will never look at diseases the same way again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
