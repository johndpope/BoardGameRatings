							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ready Check: Guild Smashers</name>
									
			<description>Inspired by fast paced tabletop games and chock-full of jokes, references, and stereotypes that anyone who has ever played a massively multiplayer online game can appreciate, Ready Check is a card based game where players take over the role of leading their guild to become the biggest, baddest, and most popular guild in their realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ready Check boasts very simple and streamlined game mechanics.  Your job is to recruit gamers to your guild and use them to raid dungeons. Dungeons are worth victory points and the first player to 20 VPs is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists of two phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Guild Management Phase is where gamers (those found lurking the Forums eagerly awaiting to join your guild) are recruited to your guild and loot is added to your Guild Stash (your collection of the most epic bounty and claimed dungeons).&lt;br/&gt;     The Dungeon Phase is where the raiding happens. Loot cards and victory points are earned by successfully raiding Dungeons. Harder dungeons offer more VPs and, of course, a better shot at getting that epic loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can download a complete copy of the rules and free-to-play Print-n-Play from our web page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
