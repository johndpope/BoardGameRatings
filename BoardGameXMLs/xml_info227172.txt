							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neues Deutches Flaggen-Spiel</name>
									
			<description>This is a dice-throwing gambling game with a fairly elaborate board. The board consists of a 100-space track divided into three areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outer ring consists of 26 squares around the edge of the board, each showing the flag of a German royal realm, princedom, grand duchy or duchy, as well as those of the free cities Lubeck, Bremen and Hamburg and the (recently conquered) territory of Alsace-Lorraine. The second ring consists of small squares numbered 27-82 in a variety of colors including light and dark blue, red, green, yellow and white. The final ring is a circle numbered 83-99 which sits at the center of the board flanked on either side by soldiers on horseback and above and below by the rules. The 100 space is a coat of arms in the middle of the circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each start with the same amount of money and put an agreed sum into the pot. They take turns rolling a single die to move along the track. Players need to know the ranks of the various flags: they receive 3 marks from the pot when landing on a royal or duchy space, but must put 3 marks into the pot when landing on a princedom or grand duchy. The free city squares have no effect. Landing on the same space as another player also has no effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on Alsace-Lorraine (12) or on the squares 30, 40, 50, 60 or 70 means going back to square 1 and starting over. A player who runs out of money is no longer allowed to play. Whoever gets to the 100 space first collects the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
