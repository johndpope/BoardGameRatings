			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Ancient Evil has overtaken a once holy shrine. Thus, a sleepy mountain hamlet becomes a focal point for mysterious disappearances and even stranger legends of what lurks beneath the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would any group of adventurous souls dare to probe the facts that lie behind the myths, or seek to right ancient wrongs, rescue secreted artifacts, or . . . even attempt to exterminate the source of evil itself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is no quest for the weak of spirit or strength. Beyond the cellars of Mitra's Fist lie strong allies and strange enemies, undead and undying, each seeking to involve the unwary in a titanic battle of good against evil, which can only end in destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riches, Power, Glory and Death!  All are in Dark Tower&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most popular adventures produced by Judges Guild, Dark Tower was the first-ever officially licensed Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons module from any company other than TSR.
