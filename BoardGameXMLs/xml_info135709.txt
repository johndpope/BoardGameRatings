			<description>From the Introduction of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not long ago, I wrote a game called Elegia. The purpose of this game was to marry together two very different kinds of role-playing game: the old-school tabletop RPG and the eight-bit video game console RPG. Console (and computer) RPGs were, of course, based on these earlier tabletop games. Nevertheless, the console games that we played in our youth have a certain ineffable quality not easily described or recreated. Hence Elegia, a tabletop RPG designed to feel like the first fantasy RPG you might have experienced on your Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, or Commodore Amiga&amp;hellip; rose-colored nostalgia and all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retro Phaze is a revision of Elegia, a new edition of the game with more than just the title getting a facelift. Excessive play-testing of the original game revealed its weakness, its imbalances, and its warts&amp;mdash;those clunky little bits of inelegance which could use some smoothing over to make the game play better at the table. The upshot: Retro Phaze is not a thought experiment or an exercise in armchair RPG design. It is meant to be played. In the hands of a group that knows well and wants to embrace the tropes, modes, and clich&amp;eacute;s so lovingly reproduced here, it&amp;rsquo;s fun. You&amp;rsquo;ll find no false modesty here: when done right, this game is really fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
