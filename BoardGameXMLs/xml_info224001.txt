			<description>Wargames rules to simulate naval warfare on the Great Lakes in the War of 1812.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast play rules for Napoleonic period naval warfare - which Napoleon had nothing to do with!  While Britain and France fought a bitter war to decide the future of Europe, across the Atlantic another war was being fought, borne of American ambition and British disdain.  On the long wilderness border between the United States and British North America, hardy frontiersmen and colonial militia hacked fleets out of the virgin forest, fleets to contest the Great Lakes, fleets to decide the future of a continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Includes the historical background to the war.&lt;br/&gt;    A description of the main campaigns on all three main theatres.&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed rulebook and ready ref sheet.&lt;br/&gt;    Examples of play.&lt;br/&gt;    Ship cards for all warships known to have been active in the conflict (Note these are also sold separately, but this full rules set includes all ship detail sheets).&lt;br/&gt;    Bonus scenario: the battle of Put-in-bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
