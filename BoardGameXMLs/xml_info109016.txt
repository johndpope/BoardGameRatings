							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little England</name>
									
			<description>The Kingdom is united no more! Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have risen up to invade their historical oppressor! 2-4 players take the role of the four countries as they carve up England for their own glory.&lt;br/&gt;Primarily card-driven, players will play attack cards to cities of different strengths (including bluff cards) to wrestle control of the cities away from their opponents. However if more than two countries turn up for a fight, politics and alliances intervene as players make simple deals with those in the battle.&lt;br/&gt;Every time a city is captured, the final points value of the city drops. After five rounds of play the country with the most control points is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;Little England is a free print and play game requiring only five pages for the game (four double-sided) and one double-sided sheet for the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
