			<description>Math training game. The game consists of 60 cards with numbers from 1 to 12, 36 task cards and 12 special cards. &lt;br/&gt;The number cards are shuffled and each player receives 5 of them. Another card is flipped open and placed on the table. Four task cards are openly laid out; they contain the operations +1, -1, *2, or /2. The active player can now place a card on the open card that fulfills one of these operations. On a 6, for example, a 5, a 7, a 3 or a 12 can be placed. This card is the base card for the next player. A player who has no matching card draws a new card. The goal is to be the first player to get rid of one's cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other variants of the base game, the number of mathematical operations is increased in the course of the game, several operations can be combined, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an additional game with the same materials, players add cards on a pile, announcing the sum of the cards played. Whenever a player reaches a sum that can be divided by 5, he/she can take all the cards, unless the next player can also reach that task (in which case the latter takes all the cards, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
