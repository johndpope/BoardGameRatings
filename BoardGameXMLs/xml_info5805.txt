			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hustler will call out a word. Everyone else has to slam a letter down on the table that's in that word. You don't have a letter in the word? Grab any letter as quickly as you can. If you're last to play, you might get a penalty. Grab a wrong letter, though, and you suffer a bigger penalty!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Show off your vocabulary, laugh at your friends. Yaddy-Yadda' is a word game in a class all its own. A game takes about 20 minutes and comes with everything you need to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules to other games that use the cards are available at the website too:  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.blacknwhitegames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.blacknwhitegames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
