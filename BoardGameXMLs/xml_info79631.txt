			<description>From the US Manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes Things Can Be Too Quiet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2015.  Hunger, war and crime have been erased from the face of the Earth.  Machines do all the work.  Computers do all the tinking.  Peace reigns over the land.  And yet the youth  of this &amp;quot;Paradise on Earth&amp;quot; are bored.  Until...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sound of thunder!  A breath of fire.  A thousand horsepower rumbles onto the starting line.  A new game is born.  A game of man and machine.  A game where speed doesn't always win, and where skill, strategy, luck and eve firepower can make the difference.  This is a race against yourself.  This is a race against others.  This is the race they've come to call... Moto Roader!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
