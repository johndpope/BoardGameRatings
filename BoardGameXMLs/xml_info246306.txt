							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Paul Pry</name>
									
			<description>This is a mid-19th century party game subtitled I Hope I Don't Intrude, and takes its name from the popular comedy play Paul Pry, which premiered in 1825.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a deck of 13 cards. Once card has the instructions, and list of 12 questions labelled A through L. Each letter corresponds to an answer card with possible responses numbered from 1 through 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player has custody of the cards, and reads a question. The remaining players in turn pick a number from 1 to 15, and the player with the cards then reads off the corresponding answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance, to question L (&amp;quot;What most occupies your thoughts?&amp;quot;), potential answers range from &amp;quot;The fashions&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;My dinner&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;My own virtues&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;In building air castles&amp;quot;. Presumably the answer generating the most laughs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
