			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;Deathwatch&lt;br/&gt;Honour the Chapter&lt;br/&gt;An unprecedented gathering of the Emperor's Finest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ten millennia, Space Marines from a thousand chapters have fought and died in the name of the Emperor of Man. Stand beside your Battle-Brothers and wield your wrath against the enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a Battle-Brother from on of over twenty Space Marine Chapters, including the stalwart Crimson Fists, the noble Blood Ravens, and the mysterious Legion of the Damned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wield powerful relics of your chapter and unleash the power of ancient artefacts to smite your foes.&lt;br/&gt;Bear them with righteousness that your deeds might be remembered beside those of age past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore ancient alliances and bitter rivalries as you make war on the enemies of man throughout the Jericho Reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your place among the legends of the Adeptus Astartes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy of the Deathwatch Core Rulebook is needed to use this supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Today we face those who betrayed our predecessors. Today we bring death to those who turned from the light of the Emperor and broke faith with their brothers. Today we bring honour to those who came before us as we lay low these traitors! For Vilamus! For Guilliman! For the Emperor!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;      &amp;ndash;Brother-Captain Haeron of the Marines Errant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The brethren of the Deathwatch are the champions of humanity, the elite of the elite, and the very best the thousand and more Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes can produce. But while many Battle-Brothers are drawn from the most well known Chapters&amp;mdash;the Blood Angels, the Space Wolves, the Ultramarines, and others of the First Founding&amp;mdash;still more hail from lesser known bodies, the Successors of the great Legions. Some of these Chapters are every bit as famous as their celebrated progenitors, while others are all but unheralded. Nevertheless, all are heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Honour the Chapter provides a wealth of options for players interested in characters drawn from Chapters created during the Second or subsequent Foundings. This comprehensive tome contains new character creation rules, a wealth of relics unique to each Chapter, and plenty of guidance and adventure seeds for Game Masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
