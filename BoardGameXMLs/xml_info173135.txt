			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hero Without A Name&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a brand-new mythic path for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: The Stranger! Folklore and legend is replete with tales of mysterious nomads, the last survivors of a fallen land or a dying race. They keep to themselves, hiding behind masks or aliases to avoid those who hunt them, or because they simply wish to be left alone. Strangers are often antiheros who play by their own rules and have little patience for working within organized structures of authority. They are men and women without a country or a home to call their own; whatever home they had, even if it still exists, has grown apart from them as they have grown apart from it. Most strangers live without allegiance except to their own code, and may be marked as heretics to their faith or traitors to their native land or people. They may be thinkers and thieves, philosophers and philanderers, some seeking the wisdom of the ancients to be found at the ends of the earth, others just looking for a fray. A stranger can work well with others and can form lasting bonds of friendship and alliance, but in their hearts they will always be free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Path of the Stranger includes advice on creating a concept for your mythic wanderer and suggested builds, but the heart of this product is over 60 mythic path abilities tailored specifically for the stranger's particular blend of sullen secrecy and simmering need for revenge. Whether your stranger is a charming smuggler or the last of his line, a flamboyant masquerader or a spirit of vengeance, you'll find all manner of abilities designed to keep him or her alive, like apparent demise and cling to life, while putting his enemies six feet under, like an eye for an eye, harrier, and roaring rampage of revenge. Your stranger can make her way in the world with a wink and a smile with skeptical eye, streetwise seeker, and flag of convenience, but she will be as ready with a devastating quip as a lethal thrust with carve your initials, nothing to say, and use your own words against you! Whether your stranger is a scruffy high plains drifter or a globe-trotting explorer who never stays put but brings a worldly detachment to everything he does, the Path of the Stranger brings you a wealth of rules to make your heroes as mysterious as they are mythic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
