			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Combination advertisment/news app/account manager for Firefly Online and two minigames. The minigames require paying a one-time fee. Payment on one platform unlocks it on all platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minigame 1: Navigation&lt;br/&gt;Quickly find three bodies in the 'Verse. The &amp;quot;Practice level&amp;quot; is always available, and has no timer. The daily and weekly are once per, and are timed; finding the bodies in the allotted time earns reward crates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minigame 2: Card Collection&lt;br/&gt;Collect sets of virtual collector cards to unlock goodies which will be available in Firefly Online. Cards can be purchased with in-app purchases as well as by playing the navigation minigame, by reading news blurbs, using the app to go check the facebook and twitter feeds, and reading the description text for each world in the navigation area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
