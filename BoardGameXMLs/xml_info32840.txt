			<description>The gameboard is made of molded plastic and consists of raised islands connected by a series of raised paths. Some paths allow two-way traffic; other only allow one-way traffic. Players choose to be either hunters or fugitives. The object for the fugitives is to make their way across the gameboard. The hunters are trying to capture the fugitives before they make their objective. In turn, the players advance one of their pawns the number of spaces generated by a Traka (q.v.), an electronic number generator that comes packaged with the game,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
