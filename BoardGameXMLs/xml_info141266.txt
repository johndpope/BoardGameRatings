			<description>Ransack is a cut-throat board game for two players. Ransack is about two thieves, The Wolf and The Scorpion, who have challenged each other to a thieves' duel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players must race to be the first to loot 11 coins from the dungeon. This is easier said than done, though, since your fate rests on the fickle nature of coin tosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns navigating through a dungeon that is built using tiles drawn from a central pile. Combat, events and deciding whose turn it is are all handled using coin flips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rule variants include a gambling / drinking versions. Due to the inclusion of these rules in the rule book the minimum age is set at 18.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
