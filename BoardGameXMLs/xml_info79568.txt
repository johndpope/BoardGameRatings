			<description>Journey to Black Fire Pass was an adventure used at a Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay preview event. It is now available as a free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunnar Thundrik could feel unkind eyes on him, watching his company&amp;rsquo;s every move. But he told himself to press on, letting the famous stubbornness of dwarfs renounce his misgivings. He had to find Belkrum, and he would not rest until his brother&amp;rsquo;s secret was safe in his own hands. Together with his dwarf companions, he ventured further into the gloom of Black Fire Pass, heedless of the goblin rider that watched from above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the free PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Adventure Synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;Recently, Belkrum Thundrik left Karak Azgaraz and ventured into&lt;br/&gt;Black Fire Pass. He carried with him a mighty weapon meant to aid&lt;br/&gt;his dwarf kin in their war against the greenskins. However, word&lt;br/&gt;of his arrival never reached his home of Karak Azgaraz, nor did&lt;br/&gt;Belkrum Thundrik return.&lt;br/&gt;Growing restless, Belkrum&amp;rsquo;s brothers Gunnar and Thord set out&lt;br/&gt;to discover their brother&amp;rsquo;s fate. Employing the skills of a miner or&lt;br/&gt;a hunter (or both, since the chance of encountering some Orcs is&lt;br/&gt;relatively appealing to Dwarfs), the Thundrik brothers embark on a&lt;br/&gt;dangerous journey to Black Fire Pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is an introduction to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, as well as a preview for&lt;br/&gt;an exciting upcoming product. Used with the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Core Set, this&lt;br/&gt;booklet provides a Game Master with all the information needed to introduce his players&lt;br/&gt;to the Old World and the game.&lt;br/&gt;Featuring four pre-generated characters, an all-new career, and an exciting adventure,&lt;br/&gt;Journey to Black Fire Pass lets players dive right into the grim and perilous world of&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
