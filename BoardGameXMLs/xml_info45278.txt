			<description>From the book&lt;br/&gt;Build a world of crumbling glory. Never describe a thing unblemished, except as struggle keeps it so. Never describe a man irredeemable, except as he refuses redemption. Never describe a thing irrecoverable, except as it is utterly destroyed as the characters watch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name your NPCs, always, and speak in their moods and gestures and voices. Act them. Act when it is appropriate; press your advantage when you have it, and seize opportunities when the players give them. Do these things: separate, capture, corner. Push a confrontation, announce trouble offscreen, warn of trouble that comes. Hurt, steal, overcharge. Have consequences catch up with them, press a decision, offer opportunities with or without sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t strike arbitrarily. Let your NPCs act in stages, let them develop their plans. Take your time. Escalate appropriately. Only lock the characters down if they give you a golden opportunity or allow your maneuvers to come together without interference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
