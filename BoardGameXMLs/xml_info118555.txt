			<description>A cricket card game, probably from the fifties because Trever Bailey is pictured on the box. He was a England Test Match player in that era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take two of the four 'Out' cards out of the deck and shuffle the rest. The cards dealt into four piles, all face down. Take one of these piles out of play and use the other three shuffled together. To decide the outcome of each delivery, turn over the top card and follow its instructions. Most of the time it will be a number of runs scored but it could say 'Out' or other options. If four wickets have fallen, add another 'Out' card into the remaining cards and shuffle them again. If 6 wickets fall, add the other 'Out' card. These rules both indicate that later batsmen are easier to get out by the bowler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two innings are played and the one with the best score, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
