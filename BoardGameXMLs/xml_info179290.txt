			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perched hard against steep cliffs and protected on the landward side by an earth ditch and berm, the small fishing village of Sea Bitch is a windy place. Founded fifteen years ago by the all-female crew of the eponymous pirate vessel, its inhabitants are famed for the trained eagles they use to hunt the seabirds nestling in the nearby cliffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Bitch is known all along the coast as a place of shelter for women of all races fleeing from brutish, bullying husbands. But now the village is under threat&amp;ndash;a warlike tribe of orcs have taken up residence in an ancient fortress in the nearby woods and Sea Bitch&amp;rsquo;s spiritual leader, the druid and ex-pirate Allindra Squallweather, has been spreading rumours of lost orcish treasure in the hopes of attracting fearless adventurers to the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
