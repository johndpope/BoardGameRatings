			<description>Sixth entry in the English Civil War series, features three different battles, Lansdown, Roundway Down and Cheriton, each with a separate map (in a A4 sheet) and a total of around 150 counters.&lt;br/&gt;These are fast and furious battles, with very few counters and a mechanic (chit drawing for the activation of leaders) that is very good both for solitaire than competitive play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available as direct download (then print &amp;amp; play) through Wargamedownloads.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The English Civil War battle of Lansdowne (or Lansdown) was fought on July 5, 1643, near Bath. Although the Royalists under Lord Hopton forced the Parliamentarians under Sir William Waller to retreat from their hilltop position, they suffered so many casualties themselves and were left so disordered and short of ammunition that an injured Hopton was forced to retire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Roundway Down was fought on July 13, 1643, during the English Civil War. A Royalist cavalry force under Lord Wilmot won a crushing victory over the Parliamentarians under Sir William Waller who were besieging Devizes in central Wiltshire, which was defended by Lord Hopton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Cheriton was an important Parliamentarian victory in the English Civil War. It took place on March 29, 1644 and resulted in the defeat of a Royalist army, which threw King Charles I onto the defensive for the remainder of the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;6 Page Rules&lt;br/&gt;3 8.5x11&amp;quot; Maps&lt;br/&gt;1 Player Aid&lt;br/&gt;159 Counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
