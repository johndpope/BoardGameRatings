			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full Graphics and Realism&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graphics of this game are excellent and show the bricks exactly as they appear in a normal game. The usual Dominoes rules apply, the game can be played against the computer or the computer can be made to play itself. Each player is given 7 bricks, the player, of course cannot see those held by the computer, although there is a facility for &amp;quot;peeking&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be stressed that the computer cannot see your bricks, hence it is unable to cheat! As play progresses, the bricks are laid end to end, automatically turning corners as the end of the screen is met. If you cannot lay a brick you pass (called &amp;quot;knocking&amp;quot;) and the winner is the one who lays all his bricks first. The computer play has quite a bit of built-in skill but it is quite possible to beat it if you play a good game. We have found this game quite addictive - probably because the games do not take long and the activity is fast and furious - highly recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
