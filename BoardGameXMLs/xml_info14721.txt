			<description>from publishers web site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Politics is a board game for 2-6 players Ages 8 and up. Politics is a game that allows you to enjoy the highs and lows of a political career from Mayor to President. Politics is simple to learn. You do not need to know or like politics to play, enjoy and win the game. Unlike real politicians, if you have a bad run in your political career, you can just play again. The more you play Politics, the deeper your levels of strategy and interactive play develop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
