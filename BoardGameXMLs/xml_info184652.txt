			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diceless! is a narrative based roleplaying game that can be played anytime, anywhere, with no preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are created by defining a list of Characteristics, that are simple narrative tags.  Characteristics may be things like Demographics (name, gender, age, race), Traits (intelligence, dexterity), Backgrounds (where you've been, what you've done), or Abilities (things you've learned how to do).  Characteristics are not given numeric scores but whenever an action is attempted that requires resolution you will add up how many Traits can help you with the task and subtract out any Traits that would hinder you.  This will give you a raw score that can be compared against a target number established by the GM to determine whether or not the character can perform the task successfully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also begin with 13 Luck Points which are represented by some physical object, such as pebbles or beads.  An any action, a player may spend one or two Luck Points (discarding the objects) to gain adds to the action score.  When starting a new adventure, characters gain 2 Luck Points and also gain 2 Luck Points every hour of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, after each adventure remaining Luck Points may be spent to buy additional Traits, Backgrounds, or Abilities.  It is permissible to gain the same Characteristic two or three times (assuming this would be logical), increasing performance.  Characteristics may not be lost unless the GM allows it through a narrative event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tasks will have a difficulty established by the GM, from 0 (everyday tasks) to 10 (slay a dragon, cure cancer).  Usually these will fall into the 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 array.  Actions against another person will have a target difficulty established by their characteristics.  Combat follows the same resolution process.  Wounds are abstracted (but surprisingly lethal).  Note that equipment (weapons, armor) can be used during combat as Characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
