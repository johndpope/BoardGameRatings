			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forged by Envy - Tempered by Malice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the century that has passed since settling into the eastern continent of Lannithir, the four kingdoms of men have seen their share of struggle and conflict.  Through their continued growth and expansion they have discovered many ancient ruins of a time long past.  It was within one such set of these ruins that an expedition of explorers from Kazdim uncovered, and released, an unspeakable horror.  A dread so unimaginable the ancients themselves imprisoned it over a thousand years ago.  This evil has a name... Necrath, The Ice Duke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the decade and a half that has passed since this wicked scourge was loosed upon the land, strange, dark, and violent events have taken place.  Sinister books and scrolls of vile evil and black magic have been discovered, and have twisted the minds of those foolish enough to read them.  Raiding parties of wittershin have set out from the mountains to wreak havoc and destruction upon men.  These assaults were followed by a full scale war led by the mighty race of rephaim, from whom the conflict was so named, the War of the Giants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been seven years since the War of the Giants ended, and the nations of men have slowly been recovering from their staggering losses.  A keep has been constructed to maintain vigil over the mountain pass, should the enemy ever decide to rear its ugly head again.  All would appear to be calm, for now. But appearances are deceiving, for deep within the mountains that same evil so recently released is stirring yet again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illfrost: Bondage represents the first step into the Illfrost Adventure Path, which will ultimately span 30 levels.  This adventure is designed for five 1st-Level PCs, and will quickly introduce them to this unique and harsh campaign setting by starting them off as slaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illfrost: Bondage is a 4th Edition compatible Heroic First Level Adventure Path Module from Illusionary Press that will have your players chilled to the bone, not only by its brutal environment, but also by its perilous challenges and unimaginable horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illfrost: Bondage is based in the world of Illfrost created by Don Pritchett, but easily adaptable to your own campaign setting. Cartography by Jonathan Roberts. Artwork by Chris Quilliams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Illfrost campaign setting is a vast world whose frozen reaches will truly test your players as they face new monsters, struggle to survive in an unforgiving climate, and face a dread so malevolent that it will leave them shivering in their fur-lined boots and eagerly coming back for more...if they survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge your players.  Challenge your game.  Challenge yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
