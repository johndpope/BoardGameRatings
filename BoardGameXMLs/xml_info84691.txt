							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Franko The Crazy Revenge!</name>
									
			<description>The story of this game revolves around years 1987-1989 during the political changes in Poland (from communism to capitalism) in Polish city Szczecin. Main character's friend - Alex - was attacked by some random bald guy and knocked out, when Franko decided to strike the guy back, guy's &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; appeared and kicked the s**t out of him...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus begun holy quest of walking through the not-so-pretty block of flats districts of Polish city and killing everything that moves (including all popular sub-cultures of the '80s, judo fighters, as well as police, MO and ZOMO officers). You can choose one of two available characters: Franko or Alex (even though according to game story the latter got killed - slight mishap) that differ in strengst and fighting style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 major bosses at the end of each stage, between stages you move by driving Fiat126p (the car called &amp;quot;Maluch&amp;quot; - the icon of Polish pop-culture of that time). Story of the game reveals some smuggling affairs (Szczecin is a harbour-city) as well as the events of political transformation as the game goes by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User Summary and Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Franko The Crazy Revenge!,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
