							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BioShock Infinite: The Siege of Columbia â€“ Handyman Figure</name>
									
			<description>Bioshock Infinite: The Siege of Columbia &amp;ndash; Handyman Figure is an extra handyman for the founder player. It was released in the Ultimate Songbird Edition and Collector's Edition of the video game. Initially, this figure had no rules associated with it, but the publisher has since instituted the following rule:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founders may have up to four Handymen on the board at the same time. Whenever the founder player has four Handymen on the board, the Vox Populi player has the following ability: &amp;quot;Once per round you may discard an action card from your hand to search your discard pile for a card of your choice, show it to the other player, and place it into your hand. You may not search your discard pile for the Airship card.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
