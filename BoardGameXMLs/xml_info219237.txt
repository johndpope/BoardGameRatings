			<description>From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;Earth's peaceful scientific patrol is marooned deep in space on a hostile planet, only one person can save it. You must guide your hightly manouverable Multi Terrain Amphibious Armouered patrol wagon across the roughest terrain of the planet Zon. Control it's movements as it leaps and jumps across craters and over the obstacles. Disintigrate the boulders in front with your somewhat primitive PM22 ballistic laser.&lt;br/&gt;Beware of the Helichargas above, shoot them down if you can, but their movements are unpredictable and their missiles are deadly. Be extremely careful as the falling missiles can create craters in the ground ahead, you will have to jump over them If you survuve that ordeal you will have to fight off the attacks of the Lasa Slamma Tanks and dodge the Narzon Heatseekers as they approach you from the front and rear respectively. You probably won't believe us at first, but we assure you that every opstacle is passable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
