			<description>Enemy Engaged 2 is the sequel to Enemy Engaged: Comanche vs Hokum. It was released on May 25, 2007. Though the sequel was improved in some ways compared to the first game, it has been highly criticized for its lack of new features. Many improvements were already implemented in the modded version of the first game. Some commentators also felt it was not ready for release considering the large amount of bugs it contained. The biggest improvement can be seen in the graphics of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Enemy Engaged 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
