			<description>Hydlide is a video game developed by T&amp;amp;E Soft. It was originally released for the NEC PC-6001 and NEC PC-8801 computer in 1985, in Japan only; an MSX release came the following year. A Family Computer version was first released under the name Hydlide Special on March 18, 1986 in Japan; three years later, in June 1989, that version saw a North American release by FCI, its title having been returned to simply Hydlide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is notable for being one of the first ever console role-playing games. The graphics appear to have been influenced by the blockbuster computer RPG of the time, Ultima III, though Hydlide had very different gameplay and ultimately failed to capture the same attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features quick save and load options, which can be done at any moment of the game. However, the game uses passwords as the primary back-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydlide is also infamously known for its repetitive music, which bears similarity to John Williams' Indiana Jones theme. For the Family Computer (NES) version this repetition is understandable, since it is one of the only two RPG/Adventure games made for the Family Computer without bankswitched memory, and the other, Enix's adventure game PORTOPIA Renzoku Satsujin Jiken, has no music at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hydlide&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
