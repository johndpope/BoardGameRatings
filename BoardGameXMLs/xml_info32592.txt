			<description>The first player to nab 25 bananas is the winner&amp;mdash;but the only way to earn bananas is to predict in advance how many of the yellow fruits you'll be able to get by the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Summary from Boardgame News)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a poker-like game where players must make a contract in order to earn points.  Schmidt Spiele have arbitrarily laid over this a jungle theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw and discard cards in order to achieve particular sets, using their hand cards and a one-card flop.  Some of these combinations are comparative&amp;mdash;highest and lowest total of card face value around the table&amp;mdash;but in order to earn points from them the players must predict the exact number they will earn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
