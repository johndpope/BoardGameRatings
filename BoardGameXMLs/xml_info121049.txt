							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Un week-end a Paris</name>
									
			<description>The game board shows a map of Paris. Players roll a die and move through the city, trying to reach the famous sites (especially those two whose cards they drew at the beginning and which are marked). Additionally, taxis, buses and the tube can be used to get around more quickly, but they have to be paid for in travel chips. When a player reaches a site, s/he is asked a question. If answering correctly, the site card can be discarded and a new travel chip is drawn. When reaching an unmarked site, they can earn a new site card (if that belongs to someone else, it can be &amp;quot;stolen&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;When a player can reach both sites they drew at the beginning and gain two more site cards and return to their starting location, s/he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions come in two difficulty levels, as the game is designed for language learning. So the difficulty does not refer to the knowledge needed to answer the question, but to the French speaking ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
