			<description>The Nobles is a fast-paced medieval fighting game where you take turns hacking and slashing at each other to see who can strike the killing blow first.  Every single strike there's a chance to lose your head, adding a suspenseful life-threatening urgency to every move!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple.  Like in the classic black knight fight scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, each player fights until they lose all their limbs, or lose their head.  Play cards to fight and confuse your opponent.  Roll the dice to charge and retreat.  And draw from the bag o' death to see what body part gets cut off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nobles can be played with two players in a one-on-one duel, or with three to four players in a free-for-all death match, or played with teams (2-on-2 or even 3-on-1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a mix of strategy and luck, games can average around 20-30 minutes, or can be over in as little as 60 seconds.  We've played a lot of games and only once witnessed a killing blow in the first turn, but boy was it satisfying.  Boom... head shot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
