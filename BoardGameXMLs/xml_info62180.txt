			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Say Goodbye to Rogue Prestige Classes Forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you wish you could play a rogue and switch out his Sneak Attack damage for something else? Or maybe you would like to drop the rogue's Trapfinding and focus on your combat skills? Perhaps you would prefer a rogue with the Poison Use, Death Attack, and Spell Casting abilities? Or maybe you would like to play an assassin with more special attacks and no spells, or a bard with Sneak Attack instead of Bardic Knowledge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Knave is a new core class for fantasy d20 games that uses an innovative progression system, similar to the d20 modern talent tree system. This advancement system allows for ultimate customization of your character beginning at 1st level. Choose from over 140 different abilities like Wounding Strike, Legend Lore, Derision, and many others to create the roguish hero of your dreams. With the vast array of options available in this supplement, you can craft an assassin, a sleuth, an adventurer, a conman, a storyteller, or any other concept you might have. A bard without spells, a bounty hunter with Crippling Strike, a street urchin with Artful Dodge, a spell-weilding highwayman with Knockout Punch; all these and more are possible with the options presented in this supplement. Become a deadly master of precision fighting with abilities like Tactical Strike and Reach Around. Flee from your enemies with abilities like Increased Movement, and Leaps and Bounds. These and more than 140 other innovative and well balanced special abilities are available in this supplement to help you craft any roguish character concept you might have without ever taking a prestige class again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start Customizing Your Rogue at 1st Level With the Knave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement comes in two formats. The onscreen version fully embraces the advantages of electronic publishing and features plenty of color, artwork, internal and external hyper-links, and other features to facilitate onscreen viewing. A printable version of these rules is also included in the download. The printable version has no artwork or fancy layout design. It is raw text in 12 point font, designed to be merciful on your ink cartridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
