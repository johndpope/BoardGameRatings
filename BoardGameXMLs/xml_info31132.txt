			<description>A French 1930s game, of which there were four versions. The first version only had 6 riders (one per team, no rules for team racing). Later versions had twelve riders (two per team). The cheaper versions had cardboard riders, the &amp;quot;deluxe&amp;quot; version had metal riders.  Veldiv, short for V&amp;eacute;lodrome d'Hiver (winter velodrome), was a very popular cycling track in Paris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
