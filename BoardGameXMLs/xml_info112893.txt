			<description>Title means in English: &amp;quot;We play government!&amp;quot;, game was released in 1952.&lt;br/&gt;It was far ahead of its time and with an outstanding equipment.&lt;br/&gt;It was a two-part-game played on both sides of the gameboard:&lt;br/&gt;The first part was a roll-and-move game, but it had many twists to change the later part of the game. &lt;br/&gt;This second part was played on the backside of the board, on a chess-like pattern, divided in 3 color-coded zones.&lt;br/&gt;Not only that the first part decided which chess-figures you had to play with, no, the figures could be equipped with different heads, depending on which party-side you participated.&lt;br/&gt;Winner was the first party to fill 3 squares at the end of the board.&lt;br/&gt;As you would believe, the color-coded zones played a prominent role in moving and capturing, the rules were really interesting, but an awful lot to learn.&lt;br/&gt;Fascinating stuff from the early German post-war era...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
