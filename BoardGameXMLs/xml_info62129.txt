			<description>Op en neer (Up and down) is a childrens game. The purpose in the game is to try and finish the shopping tour in the department store as the first one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve this you need your player to get in and out of the elevator at the right floors for you to pick up the items on your shopping list. The elevator moves up or down depending on the spinning of an arrow. The player who spun the arrow may decide which number of floors the elevator will move (always to possibillities) and in which direction (up or down). On the gameboard are two elevators, connected by a small rope and when one elevator goes up, the other one will go down, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
