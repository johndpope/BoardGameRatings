			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colours of Magic: Chrome Fifth Edition Update&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Spectrum Shift: Chromatic Arcana Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chrome is not one colour, but rather is a sheen or refraction effect; a rainbow of brightness that might dance at the corner of ones eye, or leap suddenly into view when least expected. Chrome is meta-colour; it shows how the effects of a universe in which spectrum magic manifests upon the very fundamental aspects of the self. It is the colour of alignments and alignment magic, but also the colour that supersedes all the others and yet binds them all together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Class options, one for each of Cleric (Apparitionist), Sorcerer (Skytouched) and Wizard (ArcMage)&lt;br/&gt;    a reclassification of one eleventh of the spells of the players handbook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
