			<description>Cybermythica: Loom of Fate is a strategy game set in the world of Cybermythica, a universe which is a kind of a hybrid between mythology and cyberpunk. Each player will lead one of four Megapolis Kronos Megacorps with varying abilities and starting units. The Goal standing before them is as bright as the glare of the Titan Helios &amp;ndash; to do everything to make the thread of their lives the leading one in the history woven by the Loom of Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This task won`t be easy when you live in Megapolis Kronos, a place ravaged by incessant conflict between two Conglomerates - Logos controlled by Zeus and Elysium controlled by his brother Hades. It&amp;rsquo;s really like being between Scylla and Charybdis. The question is: whose side are you on, which strategy will you choose? Will you support the most influential of all G.O.D.S., Almighty Zeus, or maybe the Lord of the Dead, Hades? Or perhaps you will remain neutral in this conflict? Will you be able to convince Aristoi - best of the best of the residents of Megapolis Kronos - to give you their support? Will you be able to win the hearts of Megapolis&amp;rsquo;s citizens? Maybe the path to achieve the goal goes through taking the control over Megapolis&amp;rsquo;s sectors? Or maybe you will go down in history as the one who has tamed the powerful Ephemeris from the depths of Ether, and the memory about you will last forever? One goal, many roads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into Cycles (turns) during which players will perform actions using the resources they control &amp;ndash; like Aristoi, Assets, special Techne cards, support and Ambrosia tokens. They will try to take control of Megapolis Kronos Sectors to get more support to fulfill contracts for large conglomerates (Logos and Elysium). Visit the special places to get Techne cards, recruit Aristoi, acquire Assets and even tame the powerful Ephemeris. Fight the other players in duels or carry out assaults against other players&amp;rsquo; HQs. The purpose of these actions is to gain prestige in the eyes of the residents of Megapolis Kronos. The game ends when the fate token on the Loom of Fate reaches level 11 or higher and players will receive History points for all they have done during the game. The player with the highest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
