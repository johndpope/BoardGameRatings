			<description>This dutch game is about creating factions in a government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially a list of program points need to be filled in. The game starts with picking 7 tiles (from 150 available). These tiles represent persons in the government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By placing at least 2 adjecent tiles (they are numbered from A1 to J15, thus a total of 10 * 15 = 150) a faction appears.  If a faction is adjecent to another faction the smallest faction is absorbed. Voting is then performed. &lt;br/&gt;Depending on the size of the factions a program point is selected or cancelled, so the player with the biggest factions has more chance for succeeding his points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By getting cards extra points can be gained, same for each placed tile to an owned faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
