							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Team Yankee: Charlie&#039;s Chieftains â€“ British Armored Squadron</name>
									
			<description>Contains five plastic Chieftain Main Battle Tanks, two plastic two Lynx helicopters, six resin tank commander figures, eight rare-earth magnets, two decal sheets, six unit cards and one printed cardboard Artillery &amp;amp; Salvo template.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C Squadron, 17th/21st Lancers, and the Irish Guardsmen supporting them made their last-minute preparations, each man checking his weapons one more time and going through the little rituals that had become talismans against violent death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After days of hard fighting, they were worn and frayed, no longer so eager to test themselves in battle. Their expressions were grim and hard. The coming battle was not going to be easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
