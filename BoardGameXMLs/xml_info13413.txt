							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Mash Destiny Diary Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a fortune telling game for girls. One player acts as the Future Finder, and the other is the Mash Girl. The Future Finder draws cards from the category decks and places them in the pockets of the Destiny Diary. She then reads each card and writes down 3 potential answers (gag answers are encouraged). The Mash girl then gives her own answer that is also written down. For example, for the category &amp;quot;Type of Car&amp;quot; the Future Finder chooses: Porsche, ice cream truck, and school bus. Then the Mash Girl adds her choice, a BMW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Future Finder then begins drawing a spiral pattern in the &amp;quot;Spiral Zone&amp;quot; of the Diary until the Mash Girl says &amp;quot;STOP!&amp;quot; The Future Finder then draws a horizontal line through the spiral and counts the number of times that the spiral intersects the line. She then uses this number to count down the list of items and crosses off the answer she lands on. She repeats this until only one answer is left. Finally she reads the remaining answers in each category revealing the Mash Girls future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
