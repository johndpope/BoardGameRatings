							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oppressive Taxes and Tariffs Volume 1</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the dawn of established governments various ruling bodies have sought out one means after another of drawing money from citizens and passing travelers alike. While nations, kingdoms, and communities that we create in our role playing fantasy worlds are purely the basis of our own leisure fiction there is no reason that we cannot have a bit of fun of our own when it comes to oppressing the financial gains of the adventurer and the villager alike. Oppressing Taxes And Tariffs, Volume 1 contains over thirty different ways to bleed that extra bit of coinage out of those who are already struggling to get by in your fantasy realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
