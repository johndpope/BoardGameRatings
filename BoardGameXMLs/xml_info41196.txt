							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flax Wild Animals</name>
									
			<description>This game has 32 cards, each one representing a wild animal, with its name, a photograph, its habitat on a world map, and its value in 5 attributes: Size, Max Speed, Weight, Lifespan, and Danger Lever (the latter from 1 to 10).  There is also a card that just says &amp;quot;Flax&amp;quot;.  And, two rules cards, and a title card that advertises the other versions: Flax Dinosaurs, and Flax Creatures of the Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flax basic game is War-like.  All the cards are dealt out, and everyone looks at their top card.  The leading player picks one attribute and reads it out loud (&amp;quot;Okapi, Max Speed 35 mph&amp;quot;.)  Everyone lays their card down and the card with the highest value in that attribute takes the lot; they go to the bottom of the winner's pile and he leads to the next trick.  The &amp;quot;Flax&amp;quot; card wins any trick but only may be used once.  The ultimate winner is the one who gets all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game, players may look at their whole hand.  The leader chooses a card and a category, and only players who can beat it play to the middle.  The one who takes the trick leads next; but the game is won by the player who gets rid of all their cards first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
