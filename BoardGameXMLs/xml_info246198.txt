			<description>In post-World War II Germany the scramble is on to mete out the fate to the Reich's most brilliant -and infamous- technical minds. Play as the Americans or Soviets racing to assemble the superior scientific team.  Or you can play as the Nakam vigilante group hunting down the worst perpetrators of the war. Lastly, you can play as an ODESSA Network operative trying to smuggle high value German officers to safety in South America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take simultaneous turns in a frenetic division of characters that have a range of values, special powers, and bestow  infamy tokens. That infamy has to be carefully managed as it can be important information that boost your score, but too much much infamy will tank your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
