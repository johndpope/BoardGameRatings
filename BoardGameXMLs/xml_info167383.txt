							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure</name>
									
			<description>Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure was a videogame written by Robert Clardy and released by Synergistic Software in 1980. It was created for the Apple II platform and is considered one of the first microcomputer-based role-playing video games. The title was intentionally misspelled; Apventure is a reference to the Apple computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A forerunner of Akalabeth and Ultima, Odyssey was a multi-part adventure game that placed the player in the role of the leader of an army who sets out to vanquish an evil wizard. Elements of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons can be found within the game, which combines elements of two earlier games written by Clardy: Dungeon Campaign and Wilderness Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features several major sections. Except for the endgame section, the game play is presented in a top-down map format with limited animation and sound effects.&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
