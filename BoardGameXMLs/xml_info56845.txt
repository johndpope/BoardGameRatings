							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The 13th Year</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 13th Year is a game set in an alternate reality. Hitler never died and actually developed his own atomic weapons. Not only that, but he used them on the world in an insane attempt to claim victory over his enemies. The survivors just want to survive, the military want to finish a war because they have no other purpose left in life. It is set in 1952; 13 years after the beginning of the Second World War, in a period when decimated governments are trying to claw their way back to power and old enemies resurface once again. Armies are on the move and the war continues, the sides pretty much carrying on from where they&amp;rsquo;d left off in 1945. It&amp;rsquo;s the Second World War set against a post-atomic holocaust wasteland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these rules I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to keep it as crazy-mutant free as possible, but if you want to do that kind of game then be my guest - the SKETCH system is more than capable of taking any extras you want to throw at it. You can even ignore the setting and use the rules for a Second World War game, there&amp;rsquo;s no problem there either. What I&amp;rsquo;m presenting to you here is a fully playable game but it is open to additions and ideas of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s being assumed that you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded this game already knowing all about roleplaying games - as such, there is no &amp;lsquo;how to roleplay&amp;rsquo; section in this game. SKETCH games are designed for fast, last minute games for existing RPG groups, so apologies if you have downloaded this with the intention of getting started in the hobby. There are plenty of resources on the internet explaining the hobby of tabletop roleplaying games so you should be able to get all the information you need from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
