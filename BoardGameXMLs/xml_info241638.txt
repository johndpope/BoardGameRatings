			<description>Pusher Kings is a funny, two-player card game that has you struggling to maintain control of the drug market in your town! This game is not a deck builder, so both players will be playing from a pre-set deck. Each player gets a hand of seven cards (with at least one &amp;quot;pusher&amp;quot; card in their hand) before the game starts. You must flip cards to use them, only using specific cards for your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few different card types; Pushers, Henchmen, and Actions. Pushers sell the drugs and can be used once per turn. Once you flip the card over in order to use them you gain money that can only be spent during that turn. Once the turn is over, the money disappears. Pushers cannot attack, defend, or take damage and only one can be used per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henchman have different costs, abilities, and attributes. They are used to gain power in the town and can be attacked. Henchman also cost a fair amount of money each, so you will need to be able to pay them to use them in your turn. The first turn you draw a henchman, you have to have them flipped, so they cannot be played right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action cards are not flipped but instead discarded. There are only two of each action card in the deck, so you need to play them wisely. Each action is immediate and costs resources to play. These can be used to harm player&amp;rsquo;s henchmen or the player themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 10 health points (the player themselves who holds the cards) so once they have been harmed enough to reach zero health points, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pusher Kings has some really awesome artwork drawn on the cards! This card game does not have deck building aspects, so it is an easy game to pick up and play with your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
