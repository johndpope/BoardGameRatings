			<description>Combines memorization, bluffing, economics and combat. Crimson Sands is set in an ancient fantasy world where giant lizards and large flightless birds are used to transport guards and goods between four cities separated by a hostile desert.  The birds are fast, but cannot carry much.   The lizards are slow, but can carry a great deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must balance trade goods, guards, and water if their caravans are to reach the other side alive.  The game includes miniatures of the beasts that carry the tiles representing these guards, goods and the tiles representing raider opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides limited water, the principle danger in the desert is the raiders and their dread leader, the self-styled Raider Queen.   At the conclusion of their turn a player must draw an encounter card, view it secretly, and then decide where to place it on the game board.   Players can choose ever longer routes to avoid encounter cards or risk the hazard to take a direct route to their goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the raiders are encountered, battle will ensue.   The other players control the raiders in these fast-paced contests.   The defending player must decide how to best ward off attacks and get as many elements of the caravan to safety as possible.   The raiders have to decide whether to intercept and make off with individual beasts or try to eliminate all the guards and capture the entire caravan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
