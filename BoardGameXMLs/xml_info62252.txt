			<description>[from the back cover]&lt;br/&gt;Are you an adventurer?&lt;br/&gt;So are you brave enough to fight the undead army, delving deeper in unknown dungeons hoping to find treasure, fame and glory? I may have a task for you.&lt;br/&gt;There are perils ahead, and your survival is not assured, but I promise the rewards are more than enough. Face your own Dark Fate, adventurer, and discover a land of struggle where a common man may one day become a true hero!&lt;br/&gt;The book you hold is a testament to the epic worlds of adventure. In these pages you&amp;rsquo;ll learn the Dark Fate of a land that is recovering from the death of the Goddess of Magic, where mystical and fantastic creatures no longer live alongside the mortals&amp;mdash;trying to survive the ravaging undead creatures of the dreadful Necropolis is not only a matter of hope, but also of luck.&lt;br/&gt;So grab your pen and paper, be ready to roll your dice, and discover the world of Dark Fate!&lt;br/&gt;This roleplaying game is a Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry&amp;trade; Campaign Setting (but may be used with other retroclones too!), and also contains some variant rules specially designed to enhance your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
