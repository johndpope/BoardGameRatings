			<description>This game was published in spielbox 1992 #2.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board with 61 hexagonal fields and each player starts with 31 pawns of different colors (e. g., white and black). Alternatively, each player places pawns on a still free field on the board. A player may indefinitely continue to place pawns on free fields which are neighbors of at least three of his own pieces. When it isn&amp;rsquo;t more possible, it is the turn of his opponent. The game ends after a player has placed his last pawn. This player is the winner and receives an amount of points corresponding to the opponent&amp;rsquo;s remaining pawns. There is a game variant, in which a player can choose between placing a pawn as described above or, alternatively, placing the next pawn on a distant field, preventing its occupation by a opponent&amp;rsquo;s pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
