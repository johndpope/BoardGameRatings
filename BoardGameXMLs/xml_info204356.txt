			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RPG Adventures scenario is a D&amp;amp;D 5th Edition Tier 1 scenario for characters of 1st-2nd level. Players can use their own characters, or the pre-generated ones presented with the Basic Rules . This scenario is designed to play in a 4-6 hour block of time &amp;ndash; for use during an evening of gaming, during the slot at a convention, or an afternoon at your local hobby store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster in a Swamp takes place in a small farming community (population: 75 &amp;ndash; 100, with another 10 &amp;ndash; 15 farming families within 20 miles) that borders a north-south river with an adjacent low-lying swamp. This area is also home to tribes of kobolds and goblin, though this can be substituted with other low-level creatures (1-2 hit dice) to better fit within a DM&amp;rsquo;s campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
