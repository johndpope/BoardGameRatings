			<description>Each player draws two cards at a time from the deck. If they match his suit, he may place them on the board. If they do not match his suit, he discards them. He continues his turn until he cannot play a card to the board. If a Dragon card is drawn, he may continue his turn, even if the dragon is not in his suit. If he draws a Karate card, he can place it on his Karate spot or call 'Karate,' and place it on another player's cards, and force that person to discard all his cards from the board. First player to fill his cards on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
