			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mugful of Mayhem is a new and lengthy HackMaster adventure featuring a variety of challenges designed for four to six 6th to 8th level player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is set on the southern border of the great Kalamaran Empire abutting the tumultuous lands of Tarisato. In the border city of Balelido, the PCs rescue a young but enterprising merchant. Impressed with their adroitness at quickly extricating him from a precarious situation, he hires them to tend to a couple of tasks the harried businessman wishes completed. A simple and lucrative freelance job &amp;ndash; what could go wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all Kenzer and Company products, Mugful of Mayhem was designed with you in mind. The PDF is designed for traditional use on a PC and is presented in landscape mode for optimal viewing on modern widescreen laptops or displays. You may choose to print it out on your own but it is optimized for tablet use with internal hyperlinks that allow you to tap on a map and jump right to the description or to follow other internal references direct to the relevant page! We prepare all the details so you can spend less time flipping pages (real or virtually) and more time gaming. Gamemastering has never been so easy or so much fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
