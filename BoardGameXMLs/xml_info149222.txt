			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Dragon's Master&amp;quot; is a short delve (5 encounters) for a group of of 5th-6th level characters, compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skeebo led a hard life. Small even by kobold standards, he was constantly mocked by the others in his clan and tormented by their leader: a black dragon named Pyraxis. Not strong enough to be useful as a soldier and not smart enough to be a mage, he was forced to do all the menial tasks that the rest of the Ashen Kobolds didn't feel like doing. And if he resisted or refused to do what he was told, he risked getting eaten by Pyraxis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, while wandering about the Ashen Swamp, Skeebo made an astonishing discovery: an artifact of unprecedented power that was seemingly discarded in the muck. After donning the artifact, everything changed; he no longer was he the puny kobold that everyone picked on... It was the chance he was looking for to show the others what he was capable of, and show the other kobolds, the humans in the nearby village of Haven, and especially that big, dumb dragon who the &amp;quot;supreme kobold&amp;quot; really was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is a conversion of the delve originally designed for Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition. It was first released in January 2012, but in February 2013 we realized that we did a lot of things wrong with the original version (it was our first Pathfinder product... we were new at it then). So we rebuilt the adventure - redesigning the monsters, converting the stat blocks to a more commonly accepted Pathfinder-like format, adjusting DCs and other values, and tweaking a few things here and there - and re-released it in February of 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
