							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Let Them Laugh at Fate</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third in a trilogy (of more than three books, as is traditional), Let them Laugh at Fate is part of an extended campaign that has moved from the Bight of Benin through the breakaway Republic of Biafra, against the Islamic Republic of Nigeria and is now moving northwards and eastwards into Cameroon and Chad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventures are not for the faint of heart &amp;ndash; the adventures take place in what can only be described as the Third World &amp;ndash; Chad is easily what can be called a &amp;lsquo;third world ****hole&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip; exotic, in other words. City based intrigue in N&amp;rsquo;Djamena, a commando campaign against a Sudanese invasion punctuated by a pitched battle to stop them dead &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, your mission is backed by the Western Alliance (mainly the US, and through the auspices of the CIA) &amp;ndash; so the PCs will not have to worry too much about these things. They&amp;rsquo;ll just have to remember that the playbook the other side(s) are using are very different from what they might expect in more established parts of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thrust of the book is set as the rebellion by the Republic of Biafra, the south eastern part of Nigeria around the oil rich Niger river delta has entered an intermediate stage in its struggle against the rump Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Caliphate puppet-state, the Islamic Republic of Nigeria. As war begins to engulf Europe and the Far East, it also begins to spread into central africa &amp;ndash; and the PCs find themselves sent to shore up things in the exotic Republic of Chad, threatened by Libyan-Egyptian and Sudanese Caliphate forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are part of the struggle to make sure that the Caliphate fails and Chad remains free &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
