			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A FREE web enhancement for Strategists &amp;amp; Tacticians: The Definitive Guide to Clever Warriors that brings you the Tin Man prestige class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As widespread and sought-after as magic can be, there are those who feel mortals lose that which separates them from magical beasts when they dabble in it. Oft-cited examples of the negative consequences of mixing blood and magic are adventurers with numerous magic prosthetics. Called Tin Men regardless of gender or the nature of their prosthetics, these reconstructed mortals are said to be charmed by their own limbs. Prosthetics are controlled by tapping a mortal mind with magic similar to that which animates clockworks and constructs. Tap too often and the magic can start to flow in both directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether through magical influence or an adaptation to their new circumstances, over time Tin Men develop similarities to mindless automatons. They shrug off painful blows. They build up new immunities. They continue to move when asleep, unconscious, or dying. Despite being victims of circumstance, Tin Men are not given sympathy from the public at large. The clanking of their steps, the clicks as they move, the scrapping sounds they make manipulating common objects all remind others of their own fragility. Many see only the metal and clay parts and the magic forgery, neglecting the mortal heart and mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
