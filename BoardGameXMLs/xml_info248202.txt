							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Just 1 More Cat</name>
									
			<description>This is a cat-themed card game with a lot of luck and a lot of directed spite.  It has two decks -- one with action effects and one with cat photos, each with a cute description and a point value.  Players draw and use actions to collect cats worth the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just 1 More Cat is an all ages card and dice game where the champion of the game adopts the most cast.  Players adopt cats from the cat herd, then trade, steal, and adopt more (you guessed it) cats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for cat fights and Catmaggedon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
