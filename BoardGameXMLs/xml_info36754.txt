							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spin the Bottle</name>
									
			<description>Players sit around the vinyl play mat on which rests a spinner in the shape of a bottle.  Spinning the bottle determines who will be the active player's partner.  A card is then taken from the Stunt Deck and the active player and partner must complete the stunt in under 2 minutes.  If they do so, each earn a number of points as indicated on their stunt card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example stunts are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With your and your partner back to back, cross arms and hold hands.  Turn to face each other without letting go of their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perform a dramatic reading of the phone book for two minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course a good number of stunts involve kissing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
