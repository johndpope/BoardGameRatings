							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Who Wants to be a Celestial Heir</name>
									
			<description>From the company's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Climbing to the Celestial Kingdom is as fun as one, two, three in this challenging board game. The board folds out into three-dimensional steps with progression marked in circles on each level.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The goal is for each player to answer enough gospel questions to progress to the top. Three &amp;quot;Helping Hands&amp;quot; are available along the way. Here is an exciting new gospel-oriented adventure for the entire family!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also additional card sets available from the publisher for the Book of Mormon and the New Testament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
