			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble in Doomspire is designed for a party of 4-6 PCs of 7th-9th level and of non-evil alignment, a good balance of character classes is advised. It takes place in the eastern part of Nether Mountains and Arn forest, in the Silver Marches region of the Western Heartlands in Faer&amp;ucirc;n, using the the Forgotten Realms setting. The module can be run in any mountainous region, where hobgoblins are numerous. All encounters can easily be modified to suit larger or smaller parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An aranea queen egg is in the PCs' possession. A ghost aranea queen asked the PCs to rescue a tribe of aranea held captive and enslaved by a brutal hobgoblin clan called Blood of Morueme. The clan lives in a fortified village called Doomspire. The PCs need to find a way to enter the village, find the future queen and persuade the shapeshifting Aranea to flee. The PCs not only need to be courageous and heroic, but also clever and even devious. Will they manage to save the Aranea?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
