			<description>Go Go Dragons! is a dragon racing gaming designed to encourage participation and social interaction, promote observation and turn taking and introduce probability and chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Go Go Dragons 2-4 players select a coloured dragon and take it in turns flipping over randomised coloured discs. When a disc is revealed the dragon matching the colour of the disc is moved forward one space. Once the dragon in last place reaches the discs on the board the disc is turned over and the matching coloured dragon is moved back one space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first dragon to cross the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
