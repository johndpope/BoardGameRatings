			<description>LEONA&amp;rsquo;s Tricky Adventures is inspired by a clever puzzle game mechanic which was briefly explored in the very early 90s but sadly faded from prominence shortly after. The basic task is to match two increasingly complex patterns using increasingly complex mechanics. While it can&amp;rsquo;t be directly compared to any contemporary game the mental skills required by the puzzles put them somewhere in between &amp;quot;Picross&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bejeweled&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; and in our humble opinion they can easily stand up against those games. LEONA&amp;rsquo;s Tricky Adventures is filled with hundreds of puzzles which provide many hours of fun gameplay - but unlike most puzzle games: No, it does not stop there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We thought deeply about the frustrations that can arise in a puzzle game and took great care to make sure the game does not grind to a halt when a puzzle cannot be solved. All puzzles are embedded in a big and complex overworld full of exploration and humorous citizens constructed entirely using beautifully hand-drawn pixel graphics. Exploration and puzzle-solving is intertwined in clever and varied ways - finding out is part of the created new fun. The complexity of the overworld lies comfortably somewhere in between the overworld of &amp;quot;Super Mario World&amp;quot; and that of &amp;quot;A Link to the Past&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
