							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainous Archetypes Volume I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Good to Be Bad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sick of saving the world? Tired of being expected to leap at the chance to solve everyone&amp;rsquo;s petty problems? Have a thing for twirling mustaches and overly-elaborate deathtraps? Why not mix things up with a villainous character! At some point in their gaming career, everyone has considered playing an &amp;ldquo;evil campaign,&amp;rdquo; but with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game being devoted to goody-two-shoes heroes, it can sometimes be hard to find support. Want some evil options for your character? You&amp;rsquo;ve found them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new villainous archetypes for five different classes. Included are the grim experimenter, an alchemist archetype whose experimental mutagens can be used on others, and who excels at brewing poisons, the cutthroat mercenary, a pragmatic fighter archetype that focuses on demoralizing its foes with grisly displays, the divine scourge, an archetype for intolerant paladins intent on punishing even the slightest of misdeeds, the manhunter, a ranger archetype that specializes in hunting sentient creatures for sport, and the mad wizard, a wizard archetype for wizards whose powerful obsessions lead to great magical power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as Way of the Wicked, by Fire Mountain Games, or the first official Paizo adventure path made specifically for evil characters), or you just want an excuse to play an unrepentant, irredeemable villain, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for villainous NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
