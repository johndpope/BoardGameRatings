Dark and treacherous powers joined together to spread evil over the land and to banish the prince from the principality and the thoughts of the people.Then because of an unsuccessful spell from the despicable lords the prince was banished to another dimension, but not from the memory and hearts of the people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some years later, through the opening of a portal between dimensions by a good hearted magician, the prince was able to return to his principality. The task then was to drive out the evil lords from power and to allow peace and order to return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bitter fight against the powers of evil is now imminent...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
