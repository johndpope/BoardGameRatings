			<description>Based on the theory of restoring houses quickly, and for profit, the game of flipping out combines worker placement mechanics with the unpredictable nature of the business of flipping houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was conceived in 2007, and it will debut in the 2011 Solitaire Game Design contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player will have effort which they may expand over the course of a calender month. The core game will have:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available on BGG in June 2011:&lt;br/&gt;2 house boards&lt;br/&gt;2 player boards&lt;br/&gt;5 project decks &lt;br/&gt;1 buyer deck&lt;br/&gt;1 rule book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be provided by the player:&lt;br/&gt;1 pawn&lt;br/&gt;12 &amp;quot;effort&amp;quot; markers (cubes)&lt;br/&gt;6 additional markers (for skills and value)&lt;br/&gt;1 monthly calender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game will be to successfully sell the house by the end of the month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general course of play will be to assign effort blocks, resolve effects of placement, and advance a calender day. At the end of the month (or when 4 projects are complete), the player will consult they buyer deck to see if they can successfully sell the house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many cards will provide &amp;quot;curve-balls&amp;quot; that will usually be up to the player to resolve with careful planning. Rich in theme, a player will note that every cause and effect represents actual events experienced by the designer in his career as a home builder (and owner).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
