			<description>Advertising game for a German candy company. Players move their trucks over the board, picking up fruit. Range is determined by a die; another die determines which fruit will be placed on the plantation fields. When two trucks meet, the arriving player can redistribute the load. There are also random event cards which frequently change the current balance. The player who gets most fruit into his or her base is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
