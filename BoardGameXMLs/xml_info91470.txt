Randomly pick who will play white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player alternates turns moving one of their pieces until one player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces have two types of moves, a slide or a jump:&lt;br/&gt;A slide move consist of moving a piece vertically (towards the inside of the outer track or towards the outside) or horizontally (to a space of a larger or smaller number) an unlimited number of spaces until it lands on a desired empty space. A piece may slide through multiple empty spaces but NOT an occupied space. A piece also may not land on the same space it started its turn on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A jump move consists of a piece jumping over a single piece of either player, vertically or horizontally and landing on an empty space. A jump is like a slide, except the jumping piece is sliding through an occupied space. A piece may not jump over more than one piece.&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all 6 of his pieces into one orthogonally connected contiguous group of pieces (vertically and/or horizontally adjacent) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
