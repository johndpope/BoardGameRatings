							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Siege of Kenilworth Castle (1266)</name>
									
			<description>A classroom game for six groups of history students, grades 6 to 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Siege of Kenilworth Castle was the longest in English history. The attackers tried everything to take the castle using a variety of siege weapons, including Trebuchets and siege towers. Their attacks focused on the north wall, which was judged to be the weakest part of the defenses. The defenders used the lake to bring in supplies, so the attackers built rafts and barges to stop them. They also tried to attack the castle by crossing the lake on barges. Finally, after nine months, disease and hunger forced the garrison to surrender.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The simulation is a matrix game, and for the most part follows the standard matrix game rules . . . Divide the students into six groups and assign them one of the commanders in the order of battle. It's a good idea to include a good student on each team. The simulation can be played in one period (one hour or less).&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The siege will end when the attackers can capture the Norman Keep, the defenders can successfully argue that the siege is lifted or abandoned, or one side successfully argues for a peace settlement.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
