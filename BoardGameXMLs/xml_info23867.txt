			<description>An instructional card game meant to teach players the names, history, functions, and associations of characters and locations in classical mythology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 76 different cards, which each tell the story of a different mythological figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included is a pronunciation card, a 2-sided instruction card, and a 4 pages &amp;quot;background&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;the compiler&amp;quot;: Laura Wheaton Abbot Cooke, Chicago, Ill., March 1884.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect the cards into &amp;quot;books&amp;quot; (melds). The one who collects the greatest number of books wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A book is composed of five specific cards (i.e. Jupiter - the number 1 card- +Saturn + Neptune + Rhea + Ceres). A typical card from the deck shows the name of a god, a small illustration of the god, the names of the four other gods which form a book, and (the largest section) a History, which is not used in game play. Note that the cards are in black and white, so the books lack the modern convenience of color-matching borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also a couple of &amp;quot;location&amp;quot; cards which have special effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
