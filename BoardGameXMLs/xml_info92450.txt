			<description>Gray Matter, the adventuer penned by legendary game author Jane Jensen, masterfully combines the supernatural with the nightmarish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since losing his wife in a terrible accident several years ago, neurobiologist Dr. David Styles has become a recluse, rarely leaving his English manor, Dread Hill House. One day, mentalist Samantha Everett appears unexpectedly on his doorstep - just when Styles is on the lookout for a new assistant. Sam gets the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her first task is to find six volunteers from Oxford Unviersity to take part in one of Dr. Styles' experiments. The experiment begins harmlessly enough, but a series of inexplicable incidents is soon set in motion, while Styles is haunted by his beloved dead wife. It's now up to Sam to solve the mysteries of Dread Hill House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
