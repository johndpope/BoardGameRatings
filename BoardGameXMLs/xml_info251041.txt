			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Arises&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve always known you were special. You heard it in whispers when you were alone as a child; you felt it each time people applauded your deeds and lingered on your name. It came as no surprise that there were those who hunted you. Everyone always fears and loathes their betters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon is a limited edition playbook for Urban Shadows, an urban fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which mortals and monsters vie for control of a modern-day city. Vampires, faeries, hunters, and wizards fight to carve out a piece of the streets and skyscrapers, ready to make deals with all those who have something to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playbook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A unique character Archetype for The Dragon, a new member of Wild who seeks to reclaim their birthright while their enemies (The Ordo Draconis) hunt them to extinction&lt;br/&gt;    A separate document for players on playing The Dragon, including detailed explanations of the Dragon's moves and mechanics&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed instructions for running a campaign using The Dragon for the Master of Ceremonies, the player who portrays the political machination of the powers-that-be&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
