			<description>DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;Chess has been around for hundreds of years as a pure strategy game. Try your hand at THREE chess expansions to challenge you even further. Play one, two, or all three at the same time! Mix and match however you'd like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE:&lt;br/&gt;Checkmate your opponent's king, just like normal chess&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;CHESS N LADDERS:&lt;br/&gt;Add ladders to the chess board to create additional movement and attack vectors. Let the carnage commence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QUANTUM CHESS:&lt;br/&gt;Brings the 4th dimension to the chess game. Move chess pieces temporarily off the board as they travel in time and then return to wreak havoc on the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOMBER PAWN:&lt;br/&gt;Pawns have always been the lowly piece, but no more! Push your pawn forward, and watch them explode your enemies. Don't let it backfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
