							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunt for the Ragnarok</name>
									
			<description>Hunt for the Ragnarok is a hidden movement board game for 2-5 players in which one player takes the role of the last heir of a fallen galactic empire fleeing for his life and title aboard the freighter Ragnarok while the rebellious nobles houses pursue.&lt;br/&gt;The desperate and damaged Ragnarok must cross the vast reaches of space - avoiding other inhabited worlds and using stealth and deception to avoid capture. The other players, acting as ships of the rebellious nobles, search for the Ragnarok - each seeking to be the first to find the heir and strengthen their own claim to the title before one of the others can do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ragnarok has limited resources and moves slowly. It must rely on deception, misdirection and stealth to avoid the ships of the opposing players.&lt;br/&gt;The Hunters ships have more options for movement, but find tracking the Ragnarok to be the challenge. As they move, they scan space around them and receive data back from the Ragnarok player in the form of cards.&lt;br/&gt;Each Hunter only receives the data derived from their own ship sensors. Since they are working primarily for their own victory and not the collective victory of the Hunters.&lt;br/&gt;Hunters also have access to a once per game power which is derived from a list initially communally available, but each power is removed from the game as it is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ragnarok wins the game if he can cross a large portion of the board and reach his destination planet. &lt;br/&gt;The Hunter who finds Ragnarok wins the game and claims title to the throne of the empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a variable board set-up, specific scenario set-ups, advanced and optional rules and play formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunt for the Ragnarok finished second in the 2012 KublaCon Game Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
