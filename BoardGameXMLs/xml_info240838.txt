							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seven Voyages of Zylarthen Supplement 1: Book of Spells</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book of Spells, the first supplement for SEVEN VOYAGES of ZYLARTHEN, increases the number of spells in the ZYLARTHEN catalog from 150 to 296. Part of the idea was to continue the process of &amp;ldquo;re-imagining&amp;rdquo; the original fantasy adventure game through the midpoint of its fourth year, at least for spells. We also somewhat redefined the ZYLARTHEN Witch and High Priest classes. Both now have unique lists of spells&amp;mdash;or &amp;ldquo;powers&amp;rdquo; in the case of High Priests&amp;mdash;the majority of them being new to the universe of ZYLARTHEN as well as the original fantasy adventure game. We feel that the Witch spells make Witches more Witch-like, and the High Priest powers make High Priests more . . . perhaps alien is the right word. Spells and powers are listed in alphabetical order. All are fully compatible with ZYLARTHEN as first presented. Revised rules for movement and time, tables for age and aging, item saving throws and increased player-character weapon damage have also been provided. Happy Casting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
