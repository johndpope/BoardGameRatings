							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Echoes of the Lost Empire</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, mankind hid in remote towns and cities scattered about the kingdom, erecting huge walls in order to protect themselves from the Monsters that lurk on the other sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Monsters are the modern descendants of those once created by the ancient sorcerers known as maji. The maji dreamed of combining magic with common beasts to create a weapon that would make their rivals shrink in its shadow. They tried, and they failed; their binding ritual was weak and they could not control the Monsters that they had created&amp;mdash;the MajiMonsters that rule the lands to this day. The maji withered and mankind retreated to their scattered, walled towns, leaving the Old Empire to fall to ruin. All that is left to it is an overgrown morass and collection of dilapidated buildings that make up the Wildlands, the present home of the much-feared Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many, a life behind walls was all they had ever known. Travel between settlements was rare and dangerous, and those who attempted it were either incredibly brave or foolish. In those days, the only certain thing was fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But today is a new day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been nearly two decades since Zarasul the Renewer proclaimed himself Emperor. For nearly two decades, bold men and women have taken strides at reclaiming what was lost. For nearly two decades, mankind has been afforded a new hope. Today is a day in the Age of Binders, and each new day the New Empire grows stronger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, MajiMonsters are as much allies as foes. Some of the deepest bonds are forged between man and Monster. But something villainous is still at play. Something old and awful has survived to disrupt this balance. Though fallen to ruin centuries ago, echoes of the lost empire still persist to threaten mankind&amp;rsquo;s recent progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And where villains loom, heroes must arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
