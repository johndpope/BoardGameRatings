			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you've agreed to run a game today and you have not had time to even think about an adventure. Don't freak out. We have you covered. This document is all that you need. Run this adventure. It will be over in one session. Then you can get back to your own evil machinations next session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word has it that the stage station northwest of town has been ransacked and everyone there was killed. According to the newspapers, marauding Indians are responsible. No one has done anything about it. This is life on the frontier. Civilization has not yet come this far west. There is no official police force or military to look into the matter. So everyone shrugs and goes on trying to survive themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now an eastern lawyer has gotten off the 3 p.m. stage. Apparently the man who owned the stage station had some money squared away. The lawyer needs to look at his last will and testament to see who inherits. The problem is that the will is still out there in the safe at the stage station. Only a fool would go out there with the Indians on the warpath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this adventure is set in the Boot Hell campaign setting, it can easily be used in any sort of Western steampunk or horror roleplaying game. It uses 5th Edition SRD rules as a default.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
