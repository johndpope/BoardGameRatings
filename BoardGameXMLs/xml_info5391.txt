			<description>The object of the game is to get rid of all your marbles first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get rid of their marbles by dropping them into the chutes on top of the tomahawks without letting more marbles fall off of them. This is very tricky to do because when you place a marble on one tomahawk, the weight of the marble pushes that tomahawk down while pushing the opposite tomahawk up and there are openings along the edges of the chutes which allow some marbles to fall back out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game requires some weight distribution reasoning and deduction and it is not as simple as it looks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
