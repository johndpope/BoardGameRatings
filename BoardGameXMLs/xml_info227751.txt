			<description>No Sweets for Santa is a family game that can be played on three different levels for increasing difficulty.  At level one, it is similar to the game memory.  At level two, cards are taken into your hand and played similarly to Go Fish.  At level three, card powers are used to add a special twist to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
