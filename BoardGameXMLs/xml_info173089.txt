			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clockwork Girl is a story roleplaying game about the slow winding-down of the land of toys after the clockmaker disappears. Gathering together a group of random toys, the Clockwork Girl sets out to find the clockmaker, only to stop working shortly after. The characters are the remaining toys trying to find the clockmaker, before their energy runs out. Will they make it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
