							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pinky Piggys Quartett</name>
									
			<description>Despite the name, this is not a standard Quartett game. There are 40 cards in 9 sets of four plus 4 Jokers. It is a simple children's game. Each player has a hand of 4 cards and must draw one from the undealt stack. If a set of four is acquired, it is laid down in front of the player. A Joker can be any card. If a Joker is in a displayed set, a player drawing the actual card may substitute it and add the taken Joker to his or her hand. When all the sets are collected, the one with the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is made by the famous chocolate maker, Ferrero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
