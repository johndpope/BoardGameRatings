			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended to be easy to &amp;ldquo;get to the good part,&amp;rdquo; so that a Game Master, once he has read the rules, should be able to start a first game with players in just a few minutes. The Game Master can pass out the pre-generated characters, use one of the sample adventures, and go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow the veteran player to model virtually any power that can be thought of. The gameencourages expert players to &amp;quot;think outside the box,&amp;quot; and create new powers of their own for their characters. Veteran game masters also receive advice on how to create campaign worlds of their own devices, with detailed guidelines for constructing a vivid past, present, and future for the campaign that players can interact with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play should proceed quickly and reflect the action and adventure of the four-color comic genre. The Game Master won't have to waste time looking up hits and misses and wandering encounters on charts. Players won't need to waste time counting pips on dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the sample adventure &amp;quot;Homecoming Apocalypse!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
