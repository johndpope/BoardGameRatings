			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Supplement for The Widening Gyre, A Savage Steampunk Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Pietre Verde, a charming Alpine town! But this little town is anything but ordinary. In fact, it is the most marvelous wonder of engineering ever conceived and built! Come explore its streets and squares, meet its charming residents, and wonder at the miracle of its very existence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Schwartzstadt, a picturesque town in the heart of Europe! But despite its rural charms, under its normal-seeming streets and byways lurks a dark, murderous secret. Can you survive the terror that possesses the heart of the Dark Town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigate a pair of unique and legendary steam-powered artifacts and learn their deepest secrets. This PDF contains two new amazing gadgets for a Savage Worlds steampunk game, plus characters and adventure seeds to fuel your imagination! Although written for Savage Worlds and The Widening Gyre, these amazing wonders are easy to port over into any system or setting that you can imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Franco-Prussian War of 1862-1870, marauding armies overran many small towns and villages. In order to protect themselves, one town came upon a novel solution. Instead of trying to defend itself (a losing proposition to be certain), it would use the age-old solution: run away from danger. Using the latest technology and supported by several brilliant Savants, they put legs on their town, making it mobile. Soon, other towns followed the first one&amp;rsquo;s lead and now there are many walking towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walking towns are slow and ponderous and make a tremendous amount of noise, but they are simply amazing to witness. In the years since the wars, many of them have settled down in fertile areas, never to move again unless danger looms. Others have become something like gypsy towns, packing up and moving on every few months. Legend says that there are walking ghost-towns as well; mechanized villages which roam during fog-shrouded nights, or silhouetted by the flickering lighting during terrible thunderstorms. Much like the legendary Flying Dutchman of the high seas, these haunted places are seen as an evil omen, bringing bad luck wherever they are seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
