			<description>Welcome to &amp;quot;Table Talk&amp;quot;. The Greeks had a word for it, Deipnosophy, from the words Deipnon - dinner, and Sophist - wise man, which when combined mean Skilled in Dining and Table Talk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stimulating and fun to play, this gourmet After-Dinner Game combines Luck, Skill &amp;amp; Team Strategy to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-(from the box cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Table Talk&amp;quot; is a food-related trivia game. Each team receives a &amp;quot;Menu&amp;quot; of 600 questions and answers, and appoints a &amp;quot;Chef&amp;quot; (team captain) to ask the questions of the opposing team, operate the timer, record the score, etc. Each chef, in turn, will ask successive players on the opposing team a question: if the team confers (answering &amp;quot;Table d'h&amp;ocirc;te&amp;quot;) and answer correctly, they score a point; however, if the player asked chooses to answer without conferring with his teammates (&amp;quot;&amp;Agrave; la carte&amp;quot;), a correct answer scores 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each page of the Menu provides questions in the following categories, in order: Starters; Main Course; Side Dishes; Desserts, Savouries &amp;amp; Cheese Board; Wine List; and Culinary Trivia - &amp;quot;Table Talk&amp;quot;. Questions must be asked in the order they appear in the Menu: players do not have a choice of the category of the question. Note: A number of culinary anecdotes (&amp;quot;Jokers&amp;quot;) have been randomly inserted in place of a question; a player who receives a Joker scores a point without having to answer a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is recommended for 4-12 players, split into two teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 Menus, each containing 600 questions (1200 total) and the rules&lt;br/&gt;     2 coloured page clips - one for each Menu - to mark the current question&lt;br/&gt;     2 score indicators&lt;br/&gt;     2 score indicator stands&lt;br/&gt;     Egg timer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-(user summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
