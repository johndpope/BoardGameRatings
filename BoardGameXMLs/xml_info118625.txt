			<description>Product Description from the Publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long Rifle is the black powder period immersion game centered on the French and Indian War. Your role is to gain fame and fortune while leading a small band of men through encounters and adventures. You will gain fortune by hunting and trapping wild animals and fame based on your exploits and success. During your adventures you will meet friends and confront enemies. You start out independent not taking sides in the conflict but staying that way may be a challenge. &lt;br/&gt;Long Rifle is compatible with Muskets and Mohawks, the unit based game of the French and Indian War. When combined think of them as the movie, Last of the Mohicans. For the large battle in the field where the Indians ambush the British you would use Muskets and Mohawks. For the smaller actions such as the ending of the movie Long Rifle is perfect. Both sets may be used for the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and any other period that used black powder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An immersion game is one where the players take the role of individual characters trying to gain experience and rewards that will allow them to grow in abilities. Although immersion games share some common elements with Role-Playing Games (RPGs) there is a dramatic difference. The difference between immersion games and Role-Playing Games is that in an immersion game you have a combat system that can be used alone to recreate small skirmishes in a realistic manner. Think the Last of the Mohicans movie or the Sharpe's Rifles television series covering the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
