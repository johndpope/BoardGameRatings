							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragons of Aihrde: Leech Wyrms</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second book in the Dragons of Aihrde series, Leech Wyrms brings a whole new wave of monstrous nightmares to the gaming table. Leech wyrms are foul dragons whose habits are more reminiscent of the undead, than the fire breathing habits of the greater dragons of legend and lore. With vampiric lust they haunt quiet dungeons and forgotten pathways, waiting for a warm, ichorous meal to come within their grasp. Whether through hollow fangs or barbed tongues they drain the blood of their victims. From the brutally violent Maegle Wyrm that grinds its prey to pulp or the far gentler Iris Dragon that paralyzes and feeds upon its victim for days, these dragons are creatures from our uncertain nightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each dragon entry is accompanied by a short one piece adventure for a total of 8 short adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the Wierling, a new racial class for play or NPC. The weirlings, or Dragon Riders, are the last of the Aathuk that carry the desires of their ancestors. These are the curious few who take to the skies and travel the world or beyond.  They are rare, but bold and brave adventurers. Wealth and power do not generally motivate the weirling; rather they yearn to be free, and to follow the paths laid down, but abandoned by their ancestors. Anything that removes them from the opulent silk laden beds and perfumed dormitories of their people draws their attention. The weirling longs to drink from the cup of life, and to suffer its indignities as well as its triumphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also revealed are the peculiar origins of kobolds and their binding with the Talmut dragons. Meet the dragons and the Bone Guard that ride them. Expand your campaign to the heavens and bring kobolds to the table like never before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the covers of Leech Wyrms are 8 new dragons, more dragon specific magic items, campaign information and more. Also included within is the new racial class, the Wierling: the Dragons Riders; and the Peculiar Tale of the Kobold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons of Aihrde: Leech Wyrms is not campaign specific, but integrates easily with any ongoing home brew campaign. Each entry comes complete with a separate heading for &amp;quot;The Creature in Aihrde&amp;quot; that can be used or discarded as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
