			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The king of a fantasy kingdom seeks your expertise to clear out hordes of foul monsters and evil creatures that are wandering around the land. You in turn, enjoy the services of three different classes of capable heroes: fighters who specialize in melee combat, rangers who shoot from a distance and mages who cast spells. You must direct adventuring parties of these heroes to various parts of the kingdom where they will autonomously hunt out any monsters they encounter. You must also provide the buildings, weapons, spells and equipment these heroes require as they gain experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It goes without saying that hiring heroes and developing your base both cost money. You make money in the form of &amp;quot;reward&amp;quot; for each monster your heroes kill. Be advised though... The morale of your heroes will start to deteriorate if you fail to provide them with the goods and services they require, and may thus start to leave you.  &lt;br/&gt; The game features four massive worlds and twelve story driven missions in which you, the hardcore strategist, will delightfully discover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great selection of upgradeable buildings such as Weapon Shops, Armories, Outposts, Inns and Taverns, Carnivals and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 70 weapons, pieces of armor and spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 80 unique monsters and characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complex economic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real time animated battles and amazing special effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Medieval Conquest, medieval fantasy and economic strategy nicely blend into a delightful outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
