			<description>Jetan, or Martian Chess, is a two-player abstract game played on a 10-by-10 board.  Each side has a set of twenty pieces of varying types, with each type having its own set of movement options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is unlike traditional Chess in a few important respects: &lt;br/&gt;All pieces in Jetan have limited movement (i.e. the Chief moves three spaces in any direction or combination of directions).&lt;br/&gt;One piece on each side (the Princess) cannot capture other pieces.&lt;br/&gt;The conditions for a win or a draw (described below) are unusual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is won when a player places any of his pieces on the same square with his opponent's Princess, or when a Chief takes a Chief. It is drawn when a Chief is taken by any opposing piece other than the opposing Chief; or when both sides have been reduced to three pieces, or less, of equal value, and the game is not terminated in the following ten moves...&amp;quot; -- from Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel &amp;quot;The Chessmen of Mars&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
