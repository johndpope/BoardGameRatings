			<description>&amp;quot;Tournament of Legends (previously known as Gladiator A.D.) is a fighting video game developed by High Voltage Software for the Wii console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tournament of Legends has ten playable characters based on Graeco-Roman mythology. The gameplay is described as a hybrid between traditional fighting games and the alternative puzzle-based gameplay of Punch Out!!. Players gesture using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to initiate horizontal and vertical attacks. Button inputs will allow the character to dodge, block, charge and use special attacks. To win a match, the player must defeat the opponent three times in two 90 second rounds. Breaks will be allowed for fighters to regenerate armor and health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will feature offline split-screen multiplayer. It has been confirmed that there will be no online multiplayer.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tournament of Legends&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
