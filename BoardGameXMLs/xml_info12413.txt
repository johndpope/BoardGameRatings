			<description>The object of the game is to begin play at the start position as a married person, traveling around the board in an effort to be the remaining player still married. Beginning at &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot;, the players move their token along the Honeymoon Trail and around the board according to the throw of the dice. When a player lands on a space, he follows the instructions printed on that space. &amp;quot;Draw Fate Card&amp;quot; spaces give the person playing a draw from the top of the deck. On each Fate card are instructions to be followed leaving the player to receive whatever Fate has to offer. In traveling around the board, there are four Divorce Steps. They must be landed on in order of their number before they are valid. As a player lands upon each Divorce Step in order, he receives a plastic chip to signify that he now has that Divorce step. Once a player receives all four Divorce steps, he loses the game. Play will continue until only one player remains who does not have all four Divorce steps. Once a player has all four Divorce steps, he is considered divorced and can no longer play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
