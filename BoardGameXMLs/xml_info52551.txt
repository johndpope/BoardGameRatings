							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Living Caves 2000:  The Original Kobold Midnight Masacre!</name>
									
			<description>Every once in a while and enormous group of people gets together with one goal in mind. . . to play Kobolds Ate My Baby! (NO ONE was more surprised than us to learn about this!) Unfortunately since the manuscript to Kobolds Ate My Baby! Large Scale Combat and Fondu! was lost during conversion to 3rd edition, the proper forum for such large numbers of Koblolds to gather and do battle was never available. To save ourselves form the tedious task of writing such a boring book again, we decided that it would be more fun to have large groups of Kobolds compete for the honor of being the Most Deadly!, having the Fullest Belly!, and just plain survival. Living Caves 2000! contains all you need (besides from papers, pens, dice, friends, tables, chairs, and a large auditorium) to run a Living Caves! Kobolds Ate My Baby! tournement. On the off chance that you don't have an army of friends ready to play, it can also be used as a campaign or even single adventures in a standard game of KAMB 3E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find 3 officially sanctioned KAMB 3E Living Caves! adventures, Tournement Rules, advice for Uber-Mayors, and conversion rules for using theis product with Kobolds generated using the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; Koboldes Ate My Baby Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
