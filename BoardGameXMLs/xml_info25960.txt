							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El Juego de los Ciclistas</name>
									
			<description>This Spanish cycling game has beautiful luxurious miniatures cyclists made out of lead (15 of them, 3 for each player). There are also 12 pieces that form the board (either an oval or another track that can be assembled with the pieces). When the oval is formed it measures 90x60cms. The rules are relatively simple. Each player rolls dice for his cyclists, cyclist who are in the wheel of another cyclist may follow without rolling a die, each time a cyclist stays in the slipstream he wins a chip. The maximum number of chips a player can win is 5. These chips can be used at any time to alter the result of a dice roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 different editions of this game that circulate around, the difference is in the colors of the cyclist's jerseys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
