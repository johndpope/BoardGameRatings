			<description>A classic Stock Market Board Game that provides players with the same opportunities and risks. The players no longer need to depend on luck to win the game but rather on their intellectual prowess.  The game includes 3 stocks, each having 6 quarterly earning cards and 3 quarterly dividend cards. &lt;br/&gt; The game starts with disclosure of each stock's 3 quarterly earning cards and 1 quarterly dividend cards. Therefore, during the game the players need to sum up the three quarterly earnings and calculate the probabilities of the fourth quarterly earning in order to estimate this year's annual earning, and further the year-end target prices. With comparisons of the current stock prices, the players can conclude if the stock is over-valued or under-valued.  There are also day-to-day return-on-equities and risks due to the fluctuation of each stock. The game provides players the opportunities to play as day-traders or long-run investors, or both. This game teaches players the portfolio management skills and how to make correct strategic investment decisions on the stock market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
