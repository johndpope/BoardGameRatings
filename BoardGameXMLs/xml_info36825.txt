			<description>Digi-Quate is a game invented by a lecturer from the National University of Singapore. Players draw 10 tokens or tiles with numbers or mathematical operators on them and try to form equations on a square grid playing board. Subsequent play intersects with already played tiles, crossword-style. Covering special squares on the board gives bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
