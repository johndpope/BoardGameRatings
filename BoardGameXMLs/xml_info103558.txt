			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire ProWrestling G was the second game in the Fire Pro Wrestling series to be released for the PlayStation. It was the first traditional Fire Pro game to be released for the system (the first game was Iron Slam '96, a 3D version of the series).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the return of the Fire Pro series to its 2D roots on the PlayStation console. The game again featured an Edit Mode, as well as a number of other modes that are traditionally found in the game (Tag Match, Cage Match, Hardcore Matches, MMA style matches, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything that makes a Fire Pro Wrestling game a Fire Pro Wrestling game can be found in this version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
