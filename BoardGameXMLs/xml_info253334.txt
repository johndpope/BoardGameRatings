							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiananmen Square: The Unknown Protester</name>
									
			<description>The game recreates the events of June 5, 1989. Players take the role of either the Chinese Government controlling a column of Type 59 main battle tanks advancing along Chang&amp;rsquo;an Avenue in Beijing, or a lone Chinese student holding two shopping bags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game last ten turns. If the tanks get past the Protester the Government player wins. If the Government has not won by the end of the tenth turn, the Protester player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players should consider switching sides and playing again. Regardless of the outcome players are encouraged to discuss the historical significance of the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game made in the USA - Definitely not printed in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tiananmen Square&amp;rdquo; is a product of Feb30 Games, a game design group (not a publisher) made up of Ref Tom Green and David Helber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This constitutes the Print-n-Play version. Feb30 Games hereby gives you permission to print a FREE single copy of the 3-up image. Keep one copy of the game for yourself and distribute the other two copies to friends. We hope to offer a deluxe boxed version of the game someday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: If after reading the rules you are confused how the Government player might win, see &amp;quot;Government victory&amp;quot; in the Forums (strategy) section below on this page.
