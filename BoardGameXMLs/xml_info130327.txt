			<description>Franklin is the worse lab assistant EVER! Of course HE would be hit by lightning! How are you suppose to fire someone when he's just been fried!?!? The first step is putting him back together, and quickly too - you're going to need that lightning to restart the bone-head once you sew him back together... You did go to med-school right? Pre-med? Took home-ec? Oh no this isn't good at all... Man, did he just get hit AGAIN? Come on everyone, quickly now....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with that bone-headed lab assistant Frankie laying on the ground. The storm is raging and you're racing to put him back together before it passes. On your turn, pick a symbol, pick a partner to work with you, and roll your bones! If your combined roll shows the right combination, you have successfully mended one of Frankie's parts. Yay! If you don't, the storm keeps coming and the lightning rains down! But be careful, if more lightning hits Frankie before you're ready, some of your hard work will come undone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are your fellow scientists and co-workers missing in action? Well then it's up to you to fix Frankie all by yourself - roll all of the bones and with just a pinch of luck, you alone can put him back together!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frankie is a co-operative game with all of the players working together against the storm tracker (timer). Win the game by successfully repairing all of Frankie's parts before the storm passes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
