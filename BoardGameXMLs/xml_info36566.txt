			<description>Bitva (in English &amp;quot;Battle&amp;quot;) is a light abstract wargame, played on a hex grid. This game is playable either as a 2-player or a 4-player game in two variations - an easier game with less options or more difficult (in a manner) with more options and restrictions on movement/opponent elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You basically roll two 6-sided dice and them can jump with one of your soldiers from the field numbered on either the first/second die to a field numbered on the second/first die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: you roll 2 and 6 and therefore you can jump from 2 to 6 or from 6 to 2 (you are not allowed to jump 2 to another 2 or 6 to another 6) if your soldier stands in a formation (2 soldiers on adjacent hexes). If you land on a square with your opponent, you eliminate him from the board. If your soldier stands as a single unit, he can only jump onto an adjacent hex (providing appropriate numbers have been rolled).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also one general per side which can jump on any appropriately numbered hex even if he does not stand in a formation. He also has 2 (or just 1 in case of 4 players) &amp;quot;Home hexes&amp;quot; where no soldier can attack him unless all other soldiers of the general's side are dead already.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the enemy general is removed from game, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game there is an inner area which is used for elimination. The outer area is a no-fighting zone (cover).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
