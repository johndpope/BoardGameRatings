			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the three planets of the Magna 6 system you have set up a modest research facility. Nothing too extreme. Just a few personnel, a Galaxy-class space station and the most powerful weapons development facility the Universe has ever known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now you have a problem. The regular daily contact schedule on the sub-space station network with Magna 6 has gone a bit quiet. Well, silent actually.
