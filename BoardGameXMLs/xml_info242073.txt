							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galactic Expedition 5: Uranus â€“ World of Ice</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A freezing place with nights of -200&amp;deg; F.  Bring along Thermasuits, as well as some Laars with which to battle the Grungik, a 12-foot tall relative of Big Foot, fond of human flesh.  Uranus also has a secret inner labyrinth with tropical flora and fauna.  However, the King of the Ice Planet, Norion may have his own idea about your trespassing.  Without proper clothing, weapons and supplies, your stay here may be very exciting and very short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique release consists of seven separate but &amp;quot;linked&amp;quot; games, each sold separately.  The &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; game (Galactic Expedition 1: From Earth to Moon) presents the first scenario and supports links to the other six games (including this one).  The expansion games, upon completion, unlock another stage in the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base game is required to run this expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
