			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Top2Bottom is the first gay game of its kind - created for the gays, by the gays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is just as outrageous &amp;amp; dirty as you and your friends... maybe even dirtier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As simple to play as spotting a closeted republican, one player draws a pink card and reads it aloud, and each remaining player chooses one fierce white card to answer. To come out on top be the first player to pull out with six pink cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[No straights were harmed in the making of the game.]&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is identical to the Apples to Apples / Cards Against Humanity style of party game. One player each round is a judge, and reads a question or fill-in-the-blank statement for which all other players must play a card to answer. The judge then picks the winning submission, typically the funniest, raunchiest or most outrageous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
