							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Behemoth Corruption</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunger, a primal need to eat in order to stave off death by starvation. It is something experienced by every living creature. However, in some the hunger grows unchecked, driving a creature to consume more than they need. These unfortunates are cursed to become Behemoths, doomed to gorge themselves upon anything.... or anyone in their vicinity. They transform into obese blobs of giant unnatural flesh, consuming anything that crosses their path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that the Behemoth corruption is one of seven corruptions, each tied to a different deadly sin. The Behemoth corruption is connected to the sin of Gluttony, but other similar corruptions also exist. It is believed these seven corruptions are the handiwork of powerful demon lords, seeking to spread their particular sin to the mortal world by using this corruption to create powerful lieutenants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
