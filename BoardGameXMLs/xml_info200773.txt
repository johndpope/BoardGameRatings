			<description>Keeping Up With The Joneses is a light, fast paced, print and play card game, with an ever changing goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The top card of the Goal deck is turned face up for all players to see; this representing The Joneses latest purchase and the current object of desire for the players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn players either play a card (or a sequence of cards) from their hand, or they draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to collect a set of cards which matches the current Goal card. You will then score the value of the item purchased, and a new Goal card is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However cards can be played to steal cards from other players, switch cards, force players to discard cards and even change the current Goal for a new one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they year ends (the deck runs out) the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;Keeping Up With The Joneses won&amp;rsquo;t be easy&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
