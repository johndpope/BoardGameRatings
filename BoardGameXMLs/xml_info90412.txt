							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Scorpion Syndicate</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two rival Mobs suddenly begin to work together -- are they taking orders from the Scorpion Syndicate? And who is the dreaded Scorpion Lady?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adamant Entertainment is proud to present the second chapter in our first Serial Adventure, Crimson Emperor. Part of the Thrilling Tales line of pulp products for modern D20, the Serial Adventure is a five-part extended campaign, written by Walt Ciechanowski, and intended for a group of 1 to 3 player-characters of 9th through 11th level. The five weekly chapters of the Crimson Emperor can be played as parts of a larger story arc, or as stand-alone adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City has always been dominated by two rival mobs. At times, the rivalry between the Duffy and Marciano gangs has gotten bloody. Without warning, however, these two deadly enemies begin to work together. Who is behind this new Syndicate, and why do the orders seem to be coming from Chinatown?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
