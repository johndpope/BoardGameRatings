			<description>The game has 43 &amp;quot;squares&amp;quot; - in fact, these are about beermat sized tiles which can be laid out on the floor in any order desired, as long as they form a &amp;quot;road&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The players have large goose figurines with which they move along that path. Certain fields determine that a player has to skip a turn, move forward or gets cooked (eliminated). The first player to reach the last tile is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
