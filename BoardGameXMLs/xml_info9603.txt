			<description>The Emergency Game pits players against each other in a race to be the fastest to complete emergency calls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are drawn from an emergency deck which directs players to certain areas of the board. By use of a numbered spinner, players attempt to make it to the emergency spot and return to their home location. Stop signs and single land roads may limit movement at times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hospital card may also be drawn from the card pile which forces a player to proceed to the hospital prior to completing a mission. If a player holds more than one hospital card, this may be passed to another player if landing on the same space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete 3 missions is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
