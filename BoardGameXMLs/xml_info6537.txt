			<description>(Please note: there is no publication date on this game.  The date entered above is an estimate.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple tennis game.  It comes with a board, a cardboard &amp;amp;quot;ball&amp;amp;quot; token, a deck of movement cards, and a deck of action cards for each player.  Each action card deck contains a result for a serve and a volley (e.g. &amp;amp;quot;Ace on serve, Smash to Crosscourt on Volleys&amp;amp;quot;).  Movement cards specify places on the court with the occasional special action, such as &amp;amp;quot;Slipped/Fell&amp;amp;quot;.  Players start with a hand of cards and must play movement cards facedown before the opponent&amp;amp;#039;s action card is revealed.  If the player&amp;amp;#039;s movement card took them to the appropriate spot on the board to return the shot, then they get to play an action card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
