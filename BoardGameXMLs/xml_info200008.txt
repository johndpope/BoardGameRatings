			<description>Nuna Aranway is a board game for 2-4 people where each player controls an 'ayllu' (quechua for 'family') of the ancient Andes, in the context of the Chav&amp;iacute;n culture. The ayllu of a player is represented by tokens, which are his or her character tokens (players start with three tokens, and then add one additional mid-game token).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 10 rounds, which stage the four seasons of one year: spring, summer, autumn and winter. In each round, players designate one action for each character token of his or her ayllu. The actions available for a character of a given ayllu are indicated in the general board (a board shared by all players) and in its player's personal board (a board for that ayllu only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the actions decided by each player, an 'ayllu' obtains enough food for each season, plays the cards in its player's hand -which develop technologies and new ideas-, and specializes artisans, warriors or holy priests of Wari, the god-demon of Chav&amp;iacute;n. Players may attack one another, or even force the others into hunger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the four seasons of the game end, the player with the highest &amp;quot;Development Score&amp;quot; wins. This score is increased by cultural, spiritual and military development of each ayllu, and is decreased due to hunger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
