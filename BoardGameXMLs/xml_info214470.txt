			<description>From the company website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Near Cape Bon, Tunisia, 22 April 1943: During mid-April, a series of Allied attacks were launched against the Axis positions in the hills of Tunisia. The US 2nd Corps (now commanded by General Omar Bradley) attacked Hill 609 in &amp;ldquo;Mousetrap Valley&amp;quot;, with the objective of advancing to Mateur. The British 5th Corps attacked &amp;ldquo;Longstop Hill&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Peter&amp;rsquo;s Corner&amp;rdquo; and the British 9th Corps attacks between Boubellat and Bou Arada. Part of Operation Vulcan, the final Allied offensive to clear Axis forces from Tunisia, particularly the Cape Bon area, saw the Hermann Goering Division sitting astride positions at &amp;lsquo;Cactus Farm&amp;rsquo;. The elite German paratroop formation would be challenged by the British 4th &amp;lsquo;Mixed&amp;rsquo; Division, an infantry unit reconstituted after Dunkirk as an infantry division incorporating a brigade of tanks. As the unit&amp;rsquo;s Churchills approached the farm, their supporting infantry was shot to pieces. The tanks continued the advance without infantry support and were then attacked in close combat by enemy soldiers. Twelve Churchills were knocked out and the attack was abruptly halted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TOBRUK 2016 EXPANSION 6: TUNISIA II includes 8 scenarios in color format, a selection of new AFV counters in the new colorway, including AEC I, Churchill I, Churchill III, Tiger I, Pzkw IIIL, Pzkw IIIn, Bishop, and more -- including new camo schemes! Each new AFV type also includes a new, matching AFV Card in the TOBRUK 2016 format and Tiger I turrets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
