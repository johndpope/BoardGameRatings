							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lovecraft&#039;s Revenge</name>
									
			<description>Lovecraft's Revenge is a tabletop game by Two Hour Wargames that plunges you into the world created by horror writer HP Lovecraft. It's about persons who dug a little too deep, driven mad by knowledge never meant for mortal minds. It's about places with thoughts and souls of their own. And it's about things whose very existence cackles at the laws of nature. These creatures defy accurate description, view people as mere insects, and can drive you out of your mind (sometimes literally) simply by standing before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played by any number of players; either solo, same side, or head to head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lovecraft's Revenge, players control one or more characters in an rpg-like Lovecraftian adventure. Each adventure has a goal and the goal is attained by collecting clues and managing to survive the ordeal with mind and body intact. The game unfolds through a number of scenes at various general locations. Each location will likely have some kind of encounter. Some encounters will surely be of a combat nature, but others might involve solving puzzles or interacting with npc's within the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
