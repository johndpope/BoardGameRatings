			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CANIS MYSTERIUM is an adventure scenario for the Call of Cthulhu&amp;trade; roleplaying system designed to be played in one or more gaming sessions. This scenario is suitable as an introduction to a new campaign or can easily be worked into an established storyline. As written, this adventure is set in and near Arkham of October of 1930, making Chaosium&amp;rsquo;s H.P. LOVECRAFT'S ARKHAM supplement particularly helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;The Werewolf of Coldwater Falls&amp;quot;, the investigators are called upon to research the strange psychology behind a man exhibiting canine behaviors, discovered with the shinbone of a missing girl dangling from his maw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several scenario seeds are offered to keepers who wish to expand and continue the events of this gaming adventure, perhaps giving birth to a brand new campaign or providing handy subplot sessions to pre-existing campaigns. If new characters are created for this scenario we suggest Arkham, Massachusetts as home, and ties to Miskatonic University (particularly the Psychology department) are encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
