			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartomancers are a special kind of spellcaster. They may look like wizards, bards or charlatans, but their magical abilities are unique: they can channel mystic powers through what seems to be an ordinary deck of playing cards. Every card they draw is a spell ready to use. As their casting style doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow them to prepare long-term strategies, they tend to be unpredictable and very good at improvising in difficult situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their allies may find them a bit erratic at some moments and unhelpful at others, but the truth is that they are formidable spellcasters more often than not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartomancers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Have a d8 Hit Dice&lt;br/&gt;    Have randomized spell access with cards&lt;br/&gt;    May learn up to 9th level spells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
