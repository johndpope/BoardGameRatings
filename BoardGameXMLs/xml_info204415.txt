			<description>From the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays out in a series of scenes. In each scene, the involved players declare what their intentions of their factions or characters from it are and then bid on controlling the narrative outcome. These scenes will have narrative repercussions, most of which will be written on the cards as they are played out. Likewise, things that happen in earlier scenes should influence the outcome of future scenes - despite the rigid turn structure, the story continues across the entire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires two packs of standard French playing cards.  The cards are defaced during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
