			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Taking Strategy to the Next Power&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cube Squared is an exciting two player strategy game. The object of the game is to be the first player to get a complete set of cubes and cylinders, in each of the six colors, off the board and onto their twelve &amp;quot;Home Spots&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a classic 2-Player, Abstract Strategy Game where each player is trying to be the first to get a complete set of rainbow colored cubes and cylinders past the square marked with a &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; and off onto their side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game is new and exciting because every game starts with an empty board and players take turns placing one piece at a time anywhere they want on the board except for the two &amp;quot;Home Squares&amp;quot; that have a &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; on them near each end of the board. It doesn't matter if they place a cube or a cylinder or even which color it is because no one player &amp;quot;owns&amp;quot; any piece until it is safely off of the board and onto one of their &amp;quot;home spots&amp;quot; on their side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement rules are pretty short and simple with the key fact being that if there are two pieces of a particular color and shape on the board, those pieces can move either once or twice and once they are&lt;br/&gt;down to one piece, they can only move once. The other main rule is that you MUST get your cube of a color off the board before you get the matching cylinder off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to jump other pieces and move either type of piece, the fact that no one &amp;quot;owns&amp;quot; pieces until they remove them from the board makes for a depth of strategy seen in very few games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you add the fact that there is no set starting position for the playing pieces, you will soon see that this game is almost &amp;quot;Bottomless&amp;quot; which gives it the ability to be studied and played for years, if not decades before anyone will ever figure out if there is an optimal setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
