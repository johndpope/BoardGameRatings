			<description>MetRum is a rummy-style card game where the cards are London Tube stations. The aim of the game is to collect melds (sets) of stations either on the same line or all on different lines. The first player to play 5 melds and go out by having no cards left in their hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of the cards are connection stations (stations on multiple lines) and single-line stations. There are also ghost stations (representing stations no longer in use) and driver cards which are wild and can count as any station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever you play a meld, you can either swap a card or take a card from an opponent's hand depending on the type and number of melds played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
