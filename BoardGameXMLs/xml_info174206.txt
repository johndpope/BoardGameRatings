			<description>In Pirates &amp;amp; Privateers, Players take on the roles of Merchant Ship Captains in search of riches, plunder &amp;amp; adventure during the Golden Age of Piracy (1660-1720). In order to profit and survive in the dangerous occupation as a Ship&amp;rsquo;s Captain, they must use their skills and wiles, as well as, their fighting abilities. Player Captains may enter service with a Nation&amp;rsquo;s Government as a Privateer, charged with capturing and sinking enemy ships and plundering enemy towns. Of course, one man&amp;rsquo;s Privateer is another man&amp;rsquo;s Pirate. If you engage in any hostile acts against a Nation&amp;rsquo;s Ships or Towns, you will be considered a Pirate to that Nation and will be pursued until brought to justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ojective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of Pirates &amp;amp; Privateers is for the Players to accumulate the most Gold after 12 Rounds. For a longer game play 16 Rounds; for a shorter game, play 8 Rounds. If your Player Captain is killed you may create another one and start with half the Gold (round down) of your previous Captain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;Pirates &amp;amp; Privateers features many colorful counters of ships, pirates, officers, crew, and native forces. The game includes rules for Trading and Commerce, Special Missions, Naval and Land Combat, Port Raiding, Buried Treasure and Duels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
