			<description>The board consists of a three dimensional mountain with 4 sides made out of cardboard. Each player receives a colored pawn in the form of a photo camera and a mountain climber in the same color. The players have to climb to the summit of the mountain, passing animals that live on the mountain and they have to halt at each spot where there is an animal to take a photograph of them in their natural habitat. When they reach the mountain top they have to descend on the other side, the player who reaches the ground first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
