			<description>from Game Cabinet rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unroll the game board and place 5 of the smaller white stones on the center space of the teepee on the board, one stone in each of the five segments of the circle. Place the 6 Indians tokens on the START space on the outside track on the board. The remainder of the white stones should be placed in a convenient location off the board. Use all 6 moccasin cards with Indian names and sufficient POW WOW cards so that two cards can be dealt to each player. Shuffle the moccasin and POW WOW cards and deal 2 face down to each player. Players should conceal their hands. The POW WOW cards have no value in the game but can be traded among players as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the holder of the moccasin card with the Indian that matches the color of the Indian token that leaves the last space on the track at the outside of the board (indicated by the two poles side by side).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
