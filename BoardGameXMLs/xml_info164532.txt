							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goblin Toboggan</name>
									
			<description>A &amp;lsquo;take-that&amp;rsquo; fantasy themed, tile-laying, route-building, downhill avalanche racing game, featuring a deck of mischief cards that allow 2-6 players to manipulate the board for their benefit and their opponents&amp;rsquo; demise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players add a new row to the track, rotating each tile they play to their own advantage. Once the tiles are placed the movement phase begins. Players utilize the effects of their mischief cards to give themselves an edge and humiliate their opponents to stay in the lead and outrun the avalanche, which rushes down the mountain destroying tiles and goblin toboggans in its wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
