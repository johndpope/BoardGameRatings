			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Germany, Spain, or perhaps the outsider, Costa Rica? In Fu&amp;szlig;ball-Fieber, each player chooses a team and tries to lead it through the group stage of the World Cup. Through the use of action cards, a player can both control the game play of his own matches and cause trouble in games between other players. This promises exciting duels that never turn out the same way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses one of the 32 teams from the 2014 World Cup, and leads it through the group phase of the World Cup. With the help of action/reaction cards, each player can try to control the result of his own matches, and also cause trouble for the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And for those players who manage to qualify, a knock-out phase with quarter-finals, semi-finals and the great final awaits them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to manage a hand of cards to maximize their result over the 3 group matches. Each card can be played on any team: his own, his opponent, but also any team from the other matches. For the knock-out phase, players get a new hand for those 3 new matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner ? There can be only one: the last team standing, winner of the final and WORLD CHAMPION.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
