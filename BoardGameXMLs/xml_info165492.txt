							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Majority: Complete Edition</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the assembly of darkness! The Majority is a Japanese card game to form strong political factions and gain the most money! The Majority Complete Edition combines two games previously available only in Japan, The Majority and The Majority 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Majority:&lt;br/&gt;The Majority is playable with 3 or 4 players. In a 4 player game, the game is played in teams of 2, forming a 2 versus 2 game. In this game, each player will be playing a card from his or her hand to form political parties. Cards have different special abilities as well as strengths in the political party. Players will be using these cards to form a strong and powerful party. However, in this game, having the strongest party won't make you the most money. Instead, being the second most powerful party will grant you more money! Remember though, that getting some money is always better than getting nothing. You must carefully coordinate your plays with your partner so that you and your partner will end up with the most and second most powerful party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a 3 player game, the game is played almost identically. However, you will not have a partner, so it will be a 3 person free for all. You will need to play cleverly to ensure that you will end up with more money than your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Majority 2:&lt;br/&gt;The Majority 2 is playable only with 2 players. In this game, a player's goal is to create more political factions with higher authorities than his or her opponent. Board members are the various residents of the pandemonium, including Witches, Demons, Dragons, Angels, and Reapers. These inhumane creatures are equipped with exciting and powerful special abilities that can aid their factions or hinder their opponents. The game has a very unique card drafting mechanics where the hand of cards are shared between the player and their opponent. Therefore, player must carefully decide when and which politicians to hire for their factions, as those left behind may comeback as a member of the opposition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
