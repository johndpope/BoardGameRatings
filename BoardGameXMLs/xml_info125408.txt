			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally begun as a project for the New Jersey Renaissance Fair and Kingdom to produce a children&amp;rsquo;s book about pirates, it soon became clear to me that both this book and its sister guide, A Squire's Guide to All Things Knightly, had possible use as a roleplaying aid to players of the discussed professions. This realization propelled me to revamp and extend the original work to make it more adult in level and comprehensive in scope. To add a further degree of usefulness to this project, I now pen this appendix to provide specific roleplaying advice and generic systemless quick sheets to help organize your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This appendix has been compiled separate of the original The Cabin Boy's Pocket Pirate Hand Book for ease of reference. Rather than having you comb the original work for gray sidebars, I put them all here in one spot. Alsom the original work was designed to look as if it was written by a pirate and as such it may be used on its own as a handout or prop at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
