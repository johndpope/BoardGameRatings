							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classic Gold Pop Trivia</name>
									
			<description>Pop trivia card game in a tin box. There is six categories of questions: 60's, 70's, 80's, Brit pop, Soul and Songs &amp;amp; Song writers. There is also one deck of questions with thematic picture. And last there is score sheet, pen and die. There is 2100 standard questions and 300 pictured questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question master rolls the die and ask question corresponding to the number rolled. If player in turn answers correctly he/she gets a mark to that category. If the answer is wrong he/she gets nothing. In both cases he/she will be the next question master. Game goes on until one player has marked all categories. The player with most marks wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what we do with the pictured cards? If question master rolls a six and player answers right, then he/she may request additional picture card question. Question master then asks all six questions on that card. Player gets extra points (number of right answer -2). He/she adds/subtracts the amount from category he/she already has marks. So category 6 (Songs &amp;amp; Song writers) seems to be more substantial than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
