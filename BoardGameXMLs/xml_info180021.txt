			<description>This is a deduction through conversation game. Exercise your vivid imagination and infer the thing that comes into your opponent&amp;rsquo;s mind by using the sense of touch. &lt;br/&gt;Due to the nature of the game, the visually impaired people can enjoy and play, too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;//story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times, when the mammoths and dinosaurs walked the land, or perhaps even before that, there was a civilization called &amp;ldquo;Dattakamo&amp;rdquo;. Its people excelled at making things out of clay, of which they made many: from what they found at the bottom of the ocean, to what they saw in the beyond the galaxy; from flowers and animals around them, to things from the imaginary future.  They treasured what they had made, and lived happily. One day, however, a volcano suddenly erupted and the civilization perished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time flew by, and now in the present, the works of the &amp;ldquo;Dattakamo&amp;rdquo; people have been excavated and brought into the Academy. What are they? Some of the artifacts are broken; others, with strange and bizarre shapes. All of them were treasures of the &amp;ldquo;Dattakamo&amp;rdquo; people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Academy, a renowned professor and his students sit around these artifacts. The professor wonders what the pieces are, while his students discuss his ideas earnestly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;// Game Progress&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this game is that the students guess right what the professor imagines. The students ask the professor three questions, one at a time, during their turns. This is called the &amp;ldquo;discussion&amp;rdquo;, and a discussion has 3 rounds.  The professor has to answer correctly these questions. During this phase, students can freely touch the piece as many times as they want.&lt;br/&gt;If a student manages to make a correct guess, he gets the piece from the professor.&lt;br/&gt;When all the players have finished playing the role of the professor, the game ends and the player who acquires the most artifacts is the greatest professor ? and wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
