			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve loved Crimson Skies ever since I saw the box on the table at FASA&amp;rsquo;s booth during Gen Con. I scratched together every supplement and guard them jealously. I still play the original PC game when I have time to myself. I own every set of the WizKids CMG version. These rules initially started out as a bridge between that faster version and the original boxed version. The board game is fun but it&amp;rsquo;s not light by any stretch of the imagination. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted a Crimson Skies RPG to be released but it seems like that&amp;rsquo;s not in the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I first read through Savage Worlds I thought to myself. &amp;quot;Finally I can run my Crimson Skies RPG!&amp;quot; the rules were light, the tone was pulpy, and the combat lived up to its slogan of &amp;quot;Fast! Furious! Fun!&amp;quot; I discovered &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.savageheroes.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.savageheroes.com&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to do a more comprehensive conversion than the one originally found there. To play this game you will need the Savage Worlds Core Rules available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.peginc.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.peginc.com&lt;/a&gt;. The Savage Worlds Adventure Deck is also recommended for that extra pulpy flavor. Many of the Edges and Hindrances were adapted from the fine game available for this system also available at the website. I also encourage you to track down any Crimson Skies memorabilia that you can. The main box set has rules to create planes that you can then convert to this system. Other books have planes that can be converted as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
