							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boom &#039;n Bust</name>
									
			<description>From the rulebook:  Boom 'n Bust is a Financial Markets Game that is not only challenging and competitive but educational to those not familiar with the various financial markets. A glossary is provided to define and explain terminology commonly used in those markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning at the Start position, advances around the board are determined by a throw of the dice. The landing position determines the players action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While &amp;quot;there's a lot going on&amp;quot; in the game, understanding the basics comes rapidly as play progresses. Skill in trading, and the selection, timing and amount of share purchases are major factors in playing Boom 'n Bust successfully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
