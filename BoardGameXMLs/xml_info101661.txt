							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snowman Meltdown</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Players move &amp;quot;snowmen&amp;quot; (stacks of Icehouse), around a 4x4 board made of Piecepack tiles. The tiles specify the directions and distances the snowmen may travel. When players land on a tile containing opposing snowmen, they must melt one down or mug one. If the mugger&amp;rsquo;s victim capitulates, the mugger receives a coin that he can use to alter his movement or defend himself with a force field; otherwise, the victim is melted down one piece. Some tiles act as traps; if all your pieces are trapped, they melt, one by one. The winner is the last player with any snowmen left on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
