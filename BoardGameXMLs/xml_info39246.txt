							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Full On World Soccer</name>
									
			<description>The object of 'Full On World Soccer (i.e. football) is to score more goals than your opponent. To do this, you move your eleven players (coloured discs representing one of 32 countries) around the board to control the ball. Each turn the player in possession of the ball rolls three six-sided dice (including one directional die) and moves the ball accordingly. The aim is to move the ball into the goal or to another one of the players on the same team to retain possession. The game ends at the end of the allotted time. Two 30 minute halves are suggested in the rules, however any length game could be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
