			<description>Blurb from Purple Duck Games store:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Purple Storeroom is a series of tightly-focused supplements that cover topics that do not fit into our larger offerings. They are the pieces that just don't fit anywhere else or they are the little things we work on to take a break from bigger projects like Purple Mountain, Legendary Treasures, or Lands of Porphyra. They have been stored here for safe keeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of arbakampsi was invented by the zendiqi people of the Patchwork Planet of Porphyra, in the lean decades after their total defeat in the New Gods Wars. It simulates the tribulations of that seesaw conflict, of seizing territory, gambling on a hunch- and taking chances that may or may not pan out. That there is a small advantage to one of the players is an accepted part of Porphyran life- nothing ever proceeds on an equal basis; to assume so is ignorant naivety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arbakampsi is a boardgame common to the Lands of Porphyra. In addition to the game itself the product contains three arbakampsi related feats, three magic items, and information on the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
