			<description>Down in the Hole &amp;quot;The Wire Hack&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mouse Guard hack for slow burn police-style investigative roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Will you let the system make choices for you, or will you make your own choices?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Chris Kubasik&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preface&lt;br/&gt;These considerations are very much inspired by the superb TV series The Wire. But it's only inspiration, I'm not interested in replaying The Wire or simulating a Wire storyline or season when playing this game. I'm selective and have chosen to focus on the police as the protagonists and thus the player characters. But that's just me and I'm sure there are many other ways of drawing inspiration from The Wire into your story gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main things about The Wire is that a case investigation lasts a whole season, where the detectives gather evidence bit by bit over a long period of time. The Burning (whatever) system of eating away at a disposition suits this incredibly well, so I guess Burning Empires would be just as good a fit for this, but MG is more refined, more honed, simply: better. What I would like to nick from BE is the phase disposition - in this game that will tell us how well, and if, the case has been solved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a copy of the Mouse Guard Roleplaying Game to use this hack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
