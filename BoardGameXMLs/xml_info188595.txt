							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cicero&#039;s Apple Bite Contest</name>
									
			<description>This game was published in Bugs Bunny's Trick 'n' Treat Halloween Fun #3 in 1955 by Dell. Cicero is Porky Pig's nephew. This is basically a board game version of the traditional party game where players try to bite an apple hanging from a string. The players race to be the first to finish &amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; their apples. Each player gets an illustration of an apple which is cut into 11 pieces. They then take turns drawing chits from a box; when the chit shows an apple, the player can remove a piece of their apple. If the chit shows a jack o'lantern, they've missed the apple and the game-play goes back to the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
