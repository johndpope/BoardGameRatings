			<description>Back cover blurb:&lt;br/&gt;There are rumors of an ancient shrine in the hills just outside of Broken Bow, a shrine that holds potent and dangerous secrets. Will you be able to unlock the mysteries hidden away in the hills, or will you fall victim to the evil that has settled there? Find out as you play through the Shrine of Olikulese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Written by Bryan Meadows with illustrations by Carolyn Meadows and a map by myself, this is CMG's first delve into the world of Fate Accelerated Edition (FAE) and adventure! This short adventure is a great introduction to the world of FAE and the excellent game system that it is.
