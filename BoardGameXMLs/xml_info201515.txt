			<description>The game consists of double-sided letter tiles and a bag. Each turn, the players draw four letters out of the bag and try to form a word. However, a word with four letters counts no points, unless it contains an &amp;quot;exotic&amp;quot; letter (marked with a . after the letter, as in the title of the game). But if you manage to form a very short word, you can keep tiles for use in later rounds. Each letter beyond the fourth in a word counts one additional point. &lt;br/&gt;After a certain number of rounds (depending on the number of players), each used exotic letter and each letter beyond the fourth in word counts a point, each unused letter tile means minus one point. The player with most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
