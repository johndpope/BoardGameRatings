							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City of Gold</name>
									
			<description>A spin-and-move race game for 2-4 players with a man on foot, a man on horseback, a man in a car, and finally a man in an airplane. All four compete to be the first to reach the City of Gold. The man on horse moves 2x as fast as the man on foot. The car moves 3x as fast and the airplane 4x as fast as the man on foot. The airplane has the longest distance to travel while the man on foot has the shortest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in many race games, two players cannot occupy the same space at the same time. The person spinning knocks the occupant back to start. Blue spaces on the board are &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; spaces where the occupant cannot be dislodged. The player spinning returns to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the airplane must hit the red #4 by the exact number to enter the City of Gold. Likewise, the car must hit the red #3, the horse the red #2. and the man on foot the red #1. Only then may the player progress to the finish. The first player reaching the finish is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
