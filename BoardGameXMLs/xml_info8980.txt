			<description>&amp;quot;Take command of a whaling ship as she sails through the icy waters off Greenland during the 1820's. Your ship will encounter fog and icebergs in the search for whales. When whales are sighted, lower away your whaleboats in pursuit. It's dangerous work for the men in the whaleboat - the whale is elusive and it can destroy your whaleboat if you're not careful - or lucky! A 'Nantucket Sleighride' can carry your whaleboat away - it could be lost with all hands. But if you do capture a whale, the valuable oil will be stored aboard your ship, contributing to a successful voyage.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
