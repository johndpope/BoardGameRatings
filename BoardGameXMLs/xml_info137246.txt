			<description>'Balletjes in de soep' is a playful introduction to preliminary count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a 'soup bowl'-card and tries to correct some soup balls on his soup bowl to collect. Preschoolers from 3 to 5 years are as playfully introduced with the numbers from 1 to 5 and the corresponding numerical images. Moreover, they also learn to play together and wait their turn ... an introduction to a real board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game balls in the soup are all targets / goals for numbers of knowledge in young children are discussed. The box contains various game modes, both for the youngest to the other children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
