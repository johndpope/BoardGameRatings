			<description>Quadrant is a boardgame that was included in Gameplay No. 4, May, 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a connection game in that each player is trying to build a continuous line of occupied points from one end of the board to the other. Players are limited in their placement by a roll of four dice, which are used to generate coordinates. Four example, a roll of 1,2,3,5 could be used as: 1+2=3 and 3+5=8, to generate x=3 and y=8 or x=8 and y=3. Or 2+3=5 and 1+5=6 for x-y of 5,6 or 6,5 and so on. If a player tries to occupy a previously occupied space, there is a challenge which is resolved with a 2-die roll-off with the higher roll winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a grid board and 52 markers per side, all on light cardstock that needs to be cut out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
