							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced Class: Sorcerer â€“ Aberrant Blood</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some sorcerers are blessed with a draconic heritage. Others wield the ambivalent force of chaotic wild magic. If only you were as lucky as these. Your blood runs a sickly purple-black with the presence of an aberration. Perhaps a tentacled fiend was one of your parents or further ancestors; or maybe you were experimented upon as a newborn by deranged and devious minds from the forces of the farthest realm. In any case, this cursed inheritance grants you the ability to wield powerful arcane powers . . . but is it worth having such a twisted form, such as to be nigh unrecognizable from others of your race?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next title from the Advanced Class line is the 'Aberrant Blood' installment for the sorcerer. While some gain their power from innate bonds to chaos magic, or draconic heritage, the aberrant blood sorcerer has the unfortunate presence of Far Realm corruption in his ancestry. Grow tentacles, open gibbering mouths all across your body, and grow beholder stalk eyes with this new sorcerer class feature and its powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
