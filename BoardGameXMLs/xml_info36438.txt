							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pizza Pie Maker</name>
									
			<description>A pizza making card game for children which uses a print-and-play card deck. The cards name parts and ingredients used to make a pizza.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored by playing card combos which make a complete pizza. The basic combo, worth three points, consists of a crust card, sauce card, and cheese card. Each additional topping adds one point, and some ingredients give bonus points. In addition, there are three named combinations which score bonus points: Everything Pizza, Meatsa Pizza, and Veggie Pizza.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player goes to draw a card and there are none left. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
