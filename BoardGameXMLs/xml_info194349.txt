			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have three Attributes: Rebellion, Suburbia, and Self-Hatred.  Respectively associated with these three Attributes are three archetypal actions: act out, accept normality, and hurt yourself.  Each Attribute has an associated dice pool which grows during play.  Players attempt to balance the number of dice in each pool so their character grows up &amp;quot;normally&amp;quot;.  Play proceeds in rounds, with each round representing one year in the life of the teenage characters.  Play begins at 13 years of age and ends after seven rounds, on the 19th birthday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
