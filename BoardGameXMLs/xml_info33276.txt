							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trice</name>
									
			<description>Trice is a game for 3 players that uses Icehouse pieces and a small, triangular gameboard. This game also uses dice. A set of 3 four-sided dice is recommended; however, if these are unavailable, the game can also be played with a pair of regular six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to occupy all of the spaces on the board that contain a specific mystic symbol. The 3 symbols are the sun, the moon, and the star. For each of these symbols, there are 5 spaces on the board that must be occupied in order to win. Two of these spaces contain only the one symbol, two are shared with one other symbol (these are called Bi-Spaces), and the final space contains all 3 symbols. (This space is the center space on the board, and it is called the Tri-Space.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete rules are available at Wunderland.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
