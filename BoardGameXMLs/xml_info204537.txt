			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Resurgence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About two centuries ago, Earth verged on total collapse. Clouds of pollution smothered every major city, rising oceans threatened to burst coastal defenses, crops were failing, and people were starving. Left with no alternative, world leaders collaborated on a last-ditch effort to save humankind: the Exodus. It was a grandiose plan involving several waves of evacuations, with the end goal of colonizing distant planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Exodus promised survival for everyone. It was an escape from a decaying planet. It was hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a lie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only a choice few ever made it to the stars. For those left behind, generations have passed; a new society has emerged from the ashes of the collapse that followed. Recovery is slow and painful. Few grand cities remain, and even fewer great leaders. There is no centralized structure. The powerful fight over the scraps of the old world, while the weak struggle just to make it through another day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wreck Age, you can play a strictly pen and paper RPG, take your painted miniatures to battle on the tabletop, or play a unique hybrid of the two systems. Take control of a crew of your choosing, picking from the nomadic Drifters, the pragmatic Stakers, the tech zealots known as the Reclaimers, or the vampyric Stitchers among a cast of others; you may even choose to venture off into the Wilds without the support of an organized faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
