			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule book includes eight pages of text rules and sixteen pages of printable color cards (usually 8 cards per page).  As noted in the introductory material the card art often is taken from copyrighted sources or is fairly primitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is driven by the card pack and no GM is needed.  Each player selects a Hero and a Creature card to play.  The players select a single Quest card to share.  The remaining cards are shuffled into the pack and each player is dealt five cards.  Players equip their characters with Item and Enhancement cards from their hand and play World cards collectively to create the adventure map.  Play proceeds with the lead player acting as GM in narration of events.  In general, play follows the World Card directions to create the adventure which builds toward Quest completion.  Draws and counter-draws may occur on each players hand in a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various rules cover combat, healing, question completion, and card stacking.  When characters advance in power (e.g., &amp;quot;gain a level&amp;quot;, so to speak) they do so by adding a Hero or Enhancement card to their existing build.  An alternative rule set allows for a dedicated GM who arbitrates the game (though in most respects will not have much to do by comparison to a standard roleplaying GM position).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
