							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Epic: Warlords</name>
									
			<description>Epic: Warlords is a strategy wargame of a vast scope, dealing with the rise and fall of civilizations over hundreds of years, and the terrible battles and wars between the races of Elves, Goblins, Dwarves, and Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epic: Warlords depicts an epic war between the ancient races of Man, Elves, Goblins and others for the domination of the world. The game takes place over the course of centuries or even millennia. But it is at the scale where even within this lengthy time frame, individual heroes and individual actions can leave an impact certain to give birth to legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game involves many campaigns, all of indefinite length, within a larger round that involves the growth of populations and cities. And although armies may be large, individuals stand out due to leadership, artifacts, and miracles. At points in the game, you may wonder, 'just how did one hero defeat 3 units of my armies?' But use as reference - rather than the real world - the myths of Hercules, Odysseus, and King Arthur, or the fantasy stories 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Conan the Barbarian' (at the end of which Conan and a friend kill about 50 mounted enemy knights).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.darkshadowgames.com/Epic_Registration/register.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.darkshadowgames.com/Epic_Registration/register.ht...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;(Click &amp;quot;Download EPIC.ZIP&amp;quot; for rules and bits)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
