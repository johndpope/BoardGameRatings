			<description>Masterpieces - The Family game created by children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Masterpieces players attempt to guess what young children have drawn.&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 560 cards. The face of each card displays a framed drawing - the vast majority of the drawings have been drawn by children under the age of eight. The reverse shows the value of the drawing, the answer, name and age of the artist. A small quantity of the cards are &amp;quot;Forgeries&amp;quot; which have been drawn by famous adults.&lt;br/&gt;The first player (or team) to collect &amp;pound;100,000,000 worth of &amp;quot;Masterpieces&amp;quot; (by correctly identifying the subject of the drawings) wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
