			<description>Vampire: The Eternal Struggle 10th Anniversary was a special card set for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle that was published by White Wolf. Rather than preconstructed starter decks or booster packs, the set instead consisted of two preconstructed factory sets of 100 cards each. The set consists almost entirely of reprints of cards that were originally published by Wizards of the Coast (mainly crypt cards from the core Jyhad/V:TES set) that had not yet been reprinted by White Wolf and had thus been out of print for the better part of a decade. Only ten new cards were produced for 10th Anniversary, and all ten were included in each of the two sets. The rest of the cards in each set are unique, meaning that each set included 90 different reprinted cards (or 180 different cards in total between the two) in addition to the ten new cards that came with both sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbol: Foil &amp;quot;10&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Code: Tenth&lt;br/&gt;Total Cards: 190&lt;br/&gt;New Cards: 10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
