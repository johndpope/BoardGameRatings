			<description>Using the Monster templates, each player tries to draw his or her own Doodle Monster using the Monster Card as a guide. In each round, one body part can be added and is decorated with a pattern. The winner is the player who succeeds in drawing his or her monster first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you already met Julius the Dragon? He lives with his friends, nimble little Filine the Mouse and Paula the wise owl, in a big old castle where lots of thrilling stories are hidden&lt;br/&gt;away, just waiting for you to discover them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Julius and Filine are feeling excited as they sit in front of the old fireplace in the castle. Paula has promised them a big surprise. In the castle library she has found an old book about&lt;br/&gt;monsters. She says the word &amp;ldquo;monsters&amp;rdquo; in a mysterious whisper. Julius&amp;rsquo; and Filine&amp;rsquo;s eyes open wide. &amp;ldquo;These monsters are everywhere in the castle. They are friendly and playful. They can change their colours and their patterns&amp;rdquo;, wise owl Paula goes on. &amp;ldquo;Yippee! Let&amp;rsquo;s go on a big monster hunt!&amp;rdquo; they all shout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever seen a monster? Try to collect as many shapes and patterns as you can for your own special Doodle Monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
