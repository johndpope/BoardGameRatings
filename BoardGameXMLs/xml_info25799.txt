			<description>This game uses letter tiles to form words on a grid.  Players start with 3 wildcards each and 9 letter tiles.  After playing a word, a player draws tiles back to a total of 12.  The tiles are colored and there are bonuses for using only one color in a word and laying it in the section of the board of that color.  The playing area is cross-shaped, with each arm of the cross a different color.  The center section contains dual color areas.  Words are played trying to reach the end of an arm for a bonus.  Once the bonus is awarded, play is towards the next arm of the cross.  once the fourth bonus is taken, the game ends and highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
