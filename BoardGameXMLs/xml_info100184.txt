			<description>Party word game. Each player gets a card. Now the agreed starting player calls out a letter and all the players must fill in one of their 25 squares with that letter. Then the next player calls out a letter, and so on, until everyone's grid is complete. Longer words score better than shorter words, and the one with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each card there are 4 grids. A is the main game but B, C and D can be used for variety. The only difference is that the solid squares will limit the letter placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
