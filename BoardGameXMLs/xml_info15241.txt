							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marvel Comics Super-Heroes Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This trick taking card game is basically a variant of Old Maid with a Marvel Universe theme tacked on. Deck contains 19 pairs of Heroes (including Spiderman, Captain America and Daredevil) and 1 Dr Doom on oversize cards. Like Old Maid, you draw a card from another player and try to match it to a hero in your hand. Match and discard. First to discard all of their heroes wins; if you're stuck with Dr Doom, you lose.&lt;br/&gt;The best reason to have this game is that the Heroes are drawn by such artists as John Romita Sr, Jack Kirby and John Buscema.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
