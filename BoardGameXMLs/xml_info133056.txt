			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sins of the Confessional is a role-playing game set during the medieval period in the fictional establishment of the Dual-Priory of Saint Thomas-in-the-Fields in western England, usually simply known as Southfield Priory. Players will take on the role of some of the monks and nuns of Southfield Priory as they struggle to gain enough influence to take over the Priory, all while defeating the worldly temptations that their rivals attempt to ensnare them with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sins of the Confessional is neither an endorsement nor a condemnation of any particular religion or religious practice, but is, instead, an attempt to create a setting in which players may enjoy the scheming, sins, and story-telling of a role-playing game within the context of a medieval ecclesiastical struggle. This was created as part of RPG Geek's &amp;quot;24 Hour RPG 2012&amp;quot;, wherein entrants were charged with creating an RPG from top to bottom within a 24-hour period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
