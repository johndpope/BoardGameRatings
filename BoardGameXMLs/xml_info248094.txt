			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's from the old days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 100 years, a family of blood is resurrected to death. In an old castle, six beings wake up after 100 years of death, but they have not forgotten. They remember everything all too well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slowly the spider wove his fine web over the big window. The dim light of the stars made the threads appear silver and unreal, and the vampire, who had stared down on the sleeping town before, slowly focused on the dark spider that created this incredible work of art. The voices behind him disappeared while he pondered the spider's great art and small body. He stared at the silver threads and the pattern as they formed, and rejoiced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as six PDF documents: a 17-page scenario and five 8-page characters (print-and-play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
