			<description>One in the series of &amp;quot;Max Haines Invites You To An Evening of Murder (tm)&amp;quot; party games.  Plays like the popular &amp;quot;How to Host a Murder&amp;quot; series.  This particular edition is &amp;quot;Dead of Winter.&amp;quot;  As this is a later entry in the series (after Canada Games), the components aren't as flashy as in earlier years.  From the box...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime Scene: In a secluded ski resort nestled deep in the mountains, a murder takes place.  Lisa Sherman, daughter of the late Charles Sherman, was three days away  from inheriting an estate worth 1.2 billion dollars.  The winds that night howled across the mountains and through the trees as the snowstorm descended upon the lodge.  Windows rattled, the wooden beams creaked, no one could possibly have heard Lisa's screams as she plummeted from the balcony to her death.  Within minutes the storm blew out and the moonlight glistened upon Lisa's lifeless body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She had been pushed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Suspects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jamie Tomlin: The activity co-coordinator at the lodge, with a dream of being an Olympic skier.  How far would she go for the gold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drake Stone: A ski instructor who couldn't resist wealthy, good looking women.  His best moves were not on the slopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lacey Sherman: The grieving twin sister, identical in every way.  Did she have any special insight into her sister's death?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sterling Brannigan: A successful business tycoon, shrewd to the very end.  His motto, &amp;quot;where there's a Will; there's a way!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iris Hudson: The manager of the lodge, and the victim's half sister.  Running the Twilight Lodge was all she knew.  Would she commit murder to keep what was rightfully hers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jeff Barlo: A Psychologist with a hidden past.  Hypnosis was his specialty.  Was murder part of his act?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marcy Brannigan: A wife with an ulterior motive.  Greed and deception are her pride possessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chet Granger: A charming Texan who loves his freedom.  He thrives on the thrill of danger.  Was his arrival at the lodge a mere coincidence?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
