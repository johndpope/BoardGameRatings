			<description>Each player gets a menu card. There are 6 different categories. The player start his/her turn with throwing the die and moving the pawn in the direction the player wants. The player has to answer a question in the category he or she lands on. If the player answers the question correctly, he/she places a Right-chip on the menu card. Otherwise he/she places a Wrong-chip on the menu card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player gets a correct answer for a category that he/she already had the Right-chip for, he/she may choose another player who also has a Right-chip for that category and force the other player to turn the chip over to its Wrong-side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever one of the players has collected chips for every category (it doesn't matter if they are Right or Wrong), the game ends and the player with the most Right-chips (correct answers) is the winner. In case of a draw the game continues until one player has the most Right-chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
