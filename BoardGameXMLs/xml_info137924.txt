							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mario Kart Arcade GP DX</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, is the third Mario Kart Arcade GP title, which will be released in Japanese arcade in Summer 2013. The game will feature ten redesigned courses, as well as features introduced in Mario Kart 7 such as the gliders. Along with Grand Prix and Battle mode, the game introduces two new modes; Alter-Ego and Team. Alter-Ego mode uses online functionality to allow players to race against ghosts set by other players. Team mode allows two players to face against two computer-controlled opponents. Similar to Crash Tag Team Racing and the elements from Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, the two players can combine their karts to form a more powerful kart, with one player driving and the other serving as the gunner. Confirmed characters so far include Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Bowser, and Donkey Kong from the Mario series, Pac-Man from the Pac-Man series, and Don-chan from the Taiko no Tatsujin franchise.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mario Kart Arcade GP DX&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
