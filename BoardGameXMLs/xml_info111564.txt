			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The land is without a King! The Lord of all Vaxxland has vanished. None can remember when, or how. It is as if the Kingdom is awakening from a dream, or a spell. Finally, a Champion has come forward to claim the throne, but he cannot wear the Crown until he has passed a challenge of virtue from every Noble who would serve him. The last and greatest challenge of all is call for Champions of his own. Indeed, are you ready to match wits with the true villains who would dethrone the greatest realm of the North? Can you through valor, battle, glory and honor discover the true enemy of the throne?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
