							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">F/X Race &amp; Culture Module</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where there is a need for greater detail regarding specific Races and/or Cultures, whether Fantasy, Sci-Fi or somewhere in between, the Race &amp;amp; Culture Module is what you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When using this Module, do not attach Races or Cultures to any Ability Pool. This works as an alternate. Races and/or cultures are rated by three dice. The first is known as the Body die, the second the Spirit die, and the third, the Inheritence Die. The Body die represents how physically fit, tough, and strong the race is. The Spirit die measures the intellect, capacity for wisdom, or even mental abilities. Finally the Inheritence die is rates any inherit special abilities the race may have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These dice are instead of an Ability Pool die (but still allowing any appropriate Specializations) whenever the character is being tested on or attempting as task where the race or culture&amp;rsquo;s basic nature is more appropriate than any set of skills or talents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What follows are VERY BRIEF examples of Races and Cultures covering many staples of fantasy and sci-fi as well as a few others just to push the limits. The average Human as a Race or Culture rates a d6. This is the baseline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
