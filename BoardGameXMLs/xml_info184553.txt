			<description>Dead Meat: Ultima Carneficina Dello Zombie!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will generate a set of Attributes, of which there are three in the game:  ZIP, WHOMP, and GUTS.  Attributes gain a numeric rating from a pool of 7 points.  Each number represents a d6, giving a player three dice pools in the various Attributes.  Each player will next generate three characters called Personas.  These Personas will all use (re-use) the same Attributes block.  The Personas should match the various roles the GM has allocated for the campaign--remember, the goal is to replicate a zombie movie plot and the GM will thus determine which people in the movie will be represented by the players' Personas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action resolution mechanic involves determining which Attribute will determine success in a given situation.  ZIP indicates reaction time, running, dodging, and fast acting.  WHOMP indicates combat ability and tasks that require only raw muscle.  GUTS is how likely you are to avoid freezing in fear, and how resistant you are to the zombie plague.  In combat, characters will use their WHOMP Attribute and roll a pool of dice equal to that attribute's rating.  Rolls of 5 and 6 indicate success--if the total of success rolls equals or exceeds the zombie's GUTS roll then the character has damaged the zombie.  Characters can disperse their WHOMP dice pool into multiple attacks.  Characters must state on every attack they are aiming for the head or they are assumed to be making a body shot, which is ineffective even if successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters who are wounded make a GUTS roll to determine if they can continue to the end of the scene (failure means they don't) when they make another GUTS roll to avoid a permanent loss of GUTS and possible undeath.  Zombies have the same Attributes as characters except CHUNKS replaces GUTS--functionally, they are about the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons are of several types:  Sorta Wimpy, Medium, Large, and Wicked.  They do progressively more damage.  The rules also include pre-generated zombies of several types (Basic Undead Geek, Lunger, Knight-Hunting Demon from the Crypt, Cyborg, and King Daddy Demon).  The rules conclude with a list of recommended zombie movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
