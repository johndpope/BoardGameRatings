							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thrill Drive</name>
									
			<description>Thrill Drive is a street racing sim arcade game released by Konami in 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking place in either the U.S.A., Japan, or Europe, the player must race three other opponents to the finish line without crashing into objects such as pedestrians that suddenly appear or causing accidents as well as avoid police cars along the way. Also, like various Sega driving games such as Hang-On and OutRun, the scenery can change at any time. The player has an assortment of vehicles to choose from, such as a sports car, a sedan, a station wagon, an SUV, a convertible, a bus, and a truck. The game is notable for the special effects when a player crashes. The screen will show a broken windshield as if you had crashed into something--as this would become a theme in later games in the series--and show a violent image before resetting you at the place where you made the mistake. Also notable is when a player finishes a race depending on how much time was left on the clock. When this happens, the computer will rate your driving technique as well as add up how many accidents the player had and how much money in damage the player has caused--and assigns a final rating, which can suffer badly if too many objects are hit or accidents are caused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Thrill Drive&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
