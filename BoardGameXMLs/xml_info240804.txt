			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Better Roll High for Goodness Sake!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While travelling through the Mulgahand Mountains, a group of adventurers stumbles upon Hollyglen&amp;mdash;a quaint mountain village known for its charm, innovation, and thriving economy built around the wholesale of magical charms and baubles. Arriving just in time for the holidays&amp;mdash;and a strange blizzard that interferes with teleportation magic&amp;mdash;the heroes are forced by circumstance to hunker down with a wealthy family until the storm passes. All they need to do to earn their keep is babysit a few young adolescents for the evening. But before long, the heroes find themselves and their charges prisoner to a malignant being within its extraplanar lair&amp;mdash;a demiplane it wrestled from the grip of a living saint. They must brave the terrors of this nightmarish realm if they are to have any hope of surviving, but even then, they must somehow escape the clutches of fallen demigod!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuletide Terror includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;ldquo;Yuletide Terror,&amp;rdquo; a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 8th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;    A gazetteer on Hollyglen, a town suffering growing pains nestled in a valley between two feuding nations.&lt;br/&gt;    A Yuletide Bestiary featuring three all-new monsters&amp;mdash;the gingerbread swarm, ratfolk troops, and the dreaded Yuletide treant.&lt;br/&gt;    Two new occult rituals and a slew of new artifacts themed from Father Yuletide himself!&lt;br/&gt;    And much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
