			<description>&amp;quot;F&amp;atilde; n.1&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;n.1 fan&amp;quot;) is the second boardgame released by Grow for the &amp;quot;Capricho&amp;quot; magazine - a Brazilian magazine for teenage girls - and thus targeting it's readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 to 4 players (always addressed by the rules as girls...) try to get a pass to the backstage of their &amp;quot;idol&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the pass, players roll a d6 and move through the board, trying to accomplish different tasks, which might involve trivia (about teenage celebrities or useful knowledge as birth control), guessing what the other players would do in a given situation (such as &amp;quot;your boyfriend smokes: would you a)tell him to quit b)end the relationship or c)start smoking too), and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a player completes a task, she (or a he) receives a matching token; after having one token of each kind, the player may exchange her tokens for a backstage pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, she should run straight to one of the 4 security guards in front of the stage, and check if her pass matches the one hidden under the guard's feet. if she gets a correct match, the guard lets her get to her idol, and she wins the game, hey! if not, she must try the other guards, or even do everything again to get a new pass (since not all passes are present in every game, because they are randomly chosen during game setup).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple, yet quite playable game, which should provide a fair amount of fun to it's target audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
