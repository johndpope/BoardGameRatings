							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Object</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Object, you will be playing some of the most brilliant minds in the country, who have been gathered together by the powers that be to discuss, well, an object. A thing which has been discovered, but for which science has no explanation. Its properties are for you to discover, its purpose is for you to determine, and the government's reaction is for you to decide. Is it an alien artifact? Is it going to change the world? Is it best covered up? Maybe it's some lost technology from an extinct civilization, or maybe it's actual, real-life magic. That is for you to uncover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes several pages of print-and-play cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
