			<description>ECOnomia is a game where each player is the CEO of a major corporation and throughout the turns they must add companies to their holdings by buying them, increasing their economic power. &lt;br/&gt;The problem is that on times of growing pollution levels, and the sustainability of our planet at stake, the CEOs must show their alignment with the preservation tendencies, sustainability measures and social responsibility. As so they must meet the emission levels set by the government, paying higher taxes for higher emission levels with caution not to exceed the limit established. The winner of this game is the CEO who manages to get the most &amp;quot;Green Points&amp;quot; (victory points) by choosing carefully the companies they bought, by cleaning their plants with the usage of technologies and by doing environmental initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in eight turns, and each turn is divided in the following phases: Event, Investment, Technology Acquisition, Revenue, Government Taxes &amp;amp; Subsidies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Event: on the beginning of each turn a random event is drawn and affects all the players. &lt;br/&gt;     Investment: Each player may buy a company of their choice (each company have in their tile the company cost, the revenue per turn, the emission level and how many green points it's worth)&lt;br/&gt;     Technology: technologies that improve the revenue points or reduce emissions may be bought by the players though auctions. &lt;br/&gt;     Revenue: Each player collect the revenue of their companies.&lt;br/&gt;     Taxes &amp;amp; Subsidies: Each player pays the taxes due or collects the subsidies if eligible to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the 8th round the player with most green points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.riachuelogames.com.br/economia/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.riachuelogames.com.br/economia/&lt;/a&gt; (Portuguese)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
