			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Native American prophecy tells that the peoples of the world will unite as Warriors of the Rainbow, to save the planet from destruction by greed and careless exploitation. The environmental pressure group Greenpeace was inspired by this to call its flagship Rainbow Warrior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been carefully compiled to reproduce six Greenpeace campaigns and one final campaign &amp;quot;The spirit of the Rainbow Warrior&amp;quot; dedicated to Fernando Pereira who died when the original Rainbow Warrior was sunk. This game is the first of its kind, designed to raise the consciousness of the environmental issues faced by the entire human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Seven Greenpeace campaigns from &amp;quot;Stop Acic Rain&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Save the Whale&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Serious issues presented in an all action way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed information on the campaigns in an accompanying booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Stunning Graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Unique action photographs of actual campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... The individual can make a difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greenpeace is a activist environmental organisation formed in the late 60s and early 70s. By the late 80s, when this game was released, they had achieved a reputation for worldwide direct action, both legal and illegal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rainbow Warrior consists of seven levels, each depicting a different Greenpeace campaign. Each level has different gameplay, from attempting to block a pipe pumping out low-level nuclear waste, to destroying aerosol cans before they deplete the ozone layer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
