			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A science-fiction graphical text adventure. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In a future time the Earth's resources are severely depleted and to conserve vital energy a decision was made to consign the Earth's dead to a floating cemetary in orbit. The satellite was named Necris Dome and was run by the Mandroids led by the Archmandroid. Over the years the Archmandroid has become a renegade and now thinks for himself. He has become a threat to human life. As a member of the secret force, you have been assigned to investigate the situation aboard the Dome and to destroy the Archmandroid. You will be shipped aboard with the next batch of dead in a robot craft. You must keep your wits about you and remember that it is possible that the programming of the Mandroids has been tampered with and it is not certain whether they are also a danger to man. From hre you are on your own.&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
