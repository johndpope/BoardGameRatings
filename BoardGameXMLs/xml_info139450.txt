							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salvage Team</name>
									
			<description>Salvage Team is a tile-based board game about looting starship wreckages. The players control a group of salvagers who loot valuables off wrecks before massive recyclers reduce them to metal bricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players build a group of salvagers and define their team leader. As long as the group travels together they can use their leader's abilities and properties. Alone, however, they can cover more ground, but are more vulnerable to threats and other salvagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round, each player's Recyclers remove one tile from the game board. The goal of Salvage Team is to get as much loot off the wreck before the last tiles are eaten. The game can be played in a single match or a longer campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
