			<description>Subtitle: An Adventure for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruthless is a short adventure which throws the PCs headfirst into the murky underworld of Carroburg, as they contend with spiraling debts, brutal unsavoury crime lords, an unstable wizard and a vampire in a crate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although intended for play in Carroburg, the adventure could easily be adapted to any city of the Empire. Six pre-generated characters, representing staff and regulars of the Rabid Stoat Inn, are provided at the conclusion of the adventure, or you may simply wish to include Ruthless as a brief underworld escapade for an established adventuring party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruthless is also suitable for new characters in their first careers or even for establishing a new party, with a twist on the old &amp;ldquo;so, you all meet in a tavern&amp;rdquo;. The adventure can be completed within a single session, and is intended to fit within the 3-4 hour slot of a convention game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruthless has a structured beginning and ending, but the middle section is designed to allow the PCs to devise their own plans to raise a lot of money in a short time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
