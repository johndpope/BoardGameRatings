							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carnival Arcane: The LARP</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the popularity of big circus attractions, small carnivals still tour the American countryside in 1928. While most carnival-goers seek only diversion and entertainment, a few want something more, something that cannot be found in the everyday world of light and reason, and the Lancaster-Rigby Carnival is rumored to offer what no one else can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The carnival train arrived yesterday in the New England coastal town of Warren's Rock. Opening-day receipts were fair, but the day isn't over. Tonight, for one night only, Lancaster-Rigby presents the Carnival Arcane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tents are up, the lights are strung, and the barker is ready to show you in....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Figments of Your Imagination (FYI) proudly presents Carnival Arcane: The LARP, the first in our licensed series of live action scenarios inspired by the horror-themed music of Midnight Syndicate. Based on their acclaimed album, Carnival Arcane, this scenario allows players to step into the roles of characters from the album and townsfolk, some with dark secrets, some with powers that defy explanation, and some with murder in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the day, Lancaster-Rigby is much like other carnivals, its colorful tents and avenues lined with clowns, side-shows, animal acts, games of skill and chance, and caramel popcorn. However, at midnight, long after most people have gone to bed, the carnival lights come back on and the gates swing wide, admitting anyone brave or desperate enough to contact the Other Side, or buy potions that heal incurable maladies, or procure supernatural means to fight one's enemies, real or perceived. The Carnival Arcane doesn't deal in sleight-of-hand or bottles of snake oil. Within its confines, patrons will experience true power, true miracles, and perhaps true fear. Of course, all such things come at a price, and those who willingly enter the Carnival Arcane must also be willing to pay....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 96-page book contains everything you need to run this exciting event:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Simple rules that keep the action moving&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull;    Comprehensive plot summaries&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull;    Detailed character sheets&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull;    Informative and enlightening player handouts&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull;    Prop, decoration, and menu suggestions&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull;    Extensive Game Master notes&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull;    General advice on running LARPs, such as finding locations and attracting players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our narrative-style character sheets clearly explain each character's past as well as their secrets, goals, and resources. Multiple story lines give every player a chance to get involved. Note that this is a plot-driven LARP with no boffer (foam weapon) combat. The landscape format makes it easy to read both onscreen and in print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carnival Arcane: The LARP is written for 11-20 players and one or two GMs, with a suggested running time of 4-5 hours. Try our easy, fast-playing rules, or use your favorite system. The album Carnival Arcane is not included nor required, but we strongly recommend playing it in the background during the event, to help set the mood and create the proper atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
