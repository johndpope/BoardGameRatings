			<description>An educational game that aims at teaching kids about environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a rain forest, the sea, a mountain forest, farmland and a garden. Die rolls determine how far a player can move on the board. The aim of the game is to collect as many oxygen chips as possible. This is done by landing on action spaces, drawing an action card and successfully completing the action/answering the question. There are also spaces which mean that the players get to listen to one of the 10 songs from the CD that is included. The player with the most chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
