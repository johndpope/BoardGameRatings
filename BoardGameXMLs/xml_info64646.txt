			<description>From the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holy Lands, The Christian Role-Playing Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A role-playing game for the true hero! Welcome to the art of role-playing! Here, you can become a knight, a saint, or any other character seeking treasure and adventure in the limitless medieval world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMAGINE THIS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your traveling companion, Brother Marcus, have entered a dark, underground cave in search of holy relics. You haven't seen anything but the narrow walls of the cave for hours. You are afraid that the caves are empty and worse than that, you're lost! Just then, you see a shimmer of gold up ahead flash from the flicker of torch fire. You and Marcus step forward somewhat slower than before. Soon, you both see a beautiful golden sword, once belonging to the Knights of the Cross, just hanging on the cave wall waiting for you to grab it! You think, this seems too easy, but the power and beauty of the fabled relic is very compelling. Just then, Brother Marcus, overtaken with greed, rushes for the sword. But before he takes a second step, you grab his cloak and stop him dead in his tracks. With your staff, you strike the ground to find the entire floor between you and the sword swing open, revealing what could have been a fatal fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What will you do next? Are you ready?
