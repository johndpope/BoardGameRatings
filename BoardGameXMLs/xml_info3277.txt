			<description>This is a representative of this peculiarly American class of board game produced for political reasons, as a form of parody.  For some reason, most instances of these games come from the right wing (another game in the same class is Capital Punishment, which is much more vitriolic in its political commentary).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; of this game is to &amp;quot;go broke and go on Welfare with the help of government grants and boondoggles&amp;quot;.  As the player tokens go around the board, their starting money eventually dwindles to nothing, at which point they no longer receive nor pay out money (ignoring the instructions on most of the board spaces) and exclusively draw from the Welfare fund (a separate pile of money) each turn they go around the board.  The game continues until the Welfare is exhausted, and the winner is then the player who got the most Welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
