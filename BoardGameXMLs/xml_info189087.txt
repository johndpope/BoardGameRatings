							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Monster Slam</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elves, Trolls, Goblins, Orcs, Dragons and Knights are back, for another Grand Monster Slam. Held once every five years, it is the biggest sports festival of the fantasy world. The Grand Monster Slam is a peaceful, cultural sporting event where all the creatures of GHoLD congregate in the capital to participate in the famous Grand Slam event. You are the Dwarves' champion, small, hairy but also sturdy and strong. Are you skillful enough to win? Will you represent your people honourably? Can you survive the opposing fans if you do win? It's you against sixteen opponents - all looking to pit their strength against you. Have you got what it takes? Can you survive and bring the Yellow Jerkin and the Golden Medal back to your people?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Monster Slam is a fantasy sports game with some similarity to Dodgeball. The aim of the game is to kick six small rotund creatures called Beloms from your baseline across the opponent's baseline. If a player is hit by a Belom kicked by the opponent, they are knocked out for a period of time. If all the Beloms are on the other side of the pitch, a player can attempt to run across the pitch for a 'Home Run' which wins the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each match there is a bonus round for additional points called &amp;quot;Revenge of the Beloms&amp;quot; where the player is besieged by angry Beloms which must be fended off with a wooden pole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games are played in an 8 player knockout contest. So winning three games in a row completes a league. At this point there is a further challenge called &amp;quot;Faulton Feeding&amp;quot;. In this game six large mouthed Faultons sit on pedestals along the opposing baseline. The player must attempt to kick their six Beloms into the open mouths of the Faultons. A score of 2 or more is required to progress from league 1 to league 2. A score of 4 or more is required to progress from league 2 to league 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
