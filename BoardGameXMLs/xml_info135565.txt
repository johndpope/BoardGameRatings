			<description>Welcome to The Association!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Develop the neighborhood, build common property, increase membership, and take control of the community, molding it in your image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players act as board members of their own individual associations attempting to establish a master association.  Canvas the neighborhood with your volunteers to gain support for your initiatives and work hard to increase the satisfaction of the property owners.  The more members to an association mean the more money that can be collected and spent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work on your own or in a committee with your fellow board members to change the neighborhood for the better but be careful &amp;ndash; only one player can be president of the master association.&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
