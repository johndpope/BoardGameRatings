							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Redline</name>
									
			<description>This is a square tile placement game in which every tile has one or more red lines that cross one, two, or three of its edges or vertices.  Additionally, each tile has either a yellow or a blue background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an initial deal, tiles must be placed so as to directly continue some red line already in play, while alternating the background color from that of the tile whose line is being continued.  &lt;br/&gt; An extra tile may be pulled from the kitty when the player creates a line of three or more tiles of the same background color, or four or more tiles of alternating background colors.  The winner is the last player able to place a tile.  There is a non-compulsory scoring system that may be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most other tile-laying games of this sort, the player is not required to place a new tile so that its edge is flush against a previous tile, but can also place a tile vertex-to-vertex, provided that the edges are collinear with the tile whose red line is being continued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
