			<description>In each box are fifteen perforated sheets which provide 150 slips. A letter is printed on each and in all there are 10 of each vowel and 5 of each consonant except Z which is entirely omitted. There are also 3 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSTRUCTIONS TO THE M.C.&lt;br/&gt;Suppose there are 12 players. Divide them into 4 teams of 3 players and seat them at tables or suitable furniture in groups of four so that at each fable there is a member of each team. A dice is allotted to each table.&lt;br/&gt;Put the vowels (well mixed) in one box and the consonants in another; then place the boxes in a convenient position.&lt;br/&gt;At a starting signal one player at each table throws the dice. If he throws a 6 he gets a vowel, 1 blind from the box as quickly as possible. If he throws 1 or 5 he collects a consonant. Figures 2, 3, 4 do not count. If he throws a useless figure he passes the shaker to the player on his left who shakes and plays accordingly, but if he has thrown a useful number then after collecting a letter he throws again until his is unsuccessful, when he passes the dice on. (This prevents crowding round the letter boxes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the letters are used up, or at the end of an agreed time the 3 members of each team get together and make up as many words as possible (plural nouns not counting) from their letters, bearing in mind the following method of scoring.&lt;br/&gt;A word of 6 letters or more ...    Scores 20 points&lt;br/&gt;A word of 5 letters scores 15 points&lt;br/&gt;A word of 4 letters scores 10 points&lt;br/&gt;A word of 3 letters scores 5 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A time limit of 5 minutes or so should be fixed for composing. The team scoring the highest number of points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
