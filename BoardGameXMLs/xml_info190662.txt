			<description>The system was planned to be released in January 1985 with initial retail price for the system was US$2,500. Fewer than a dozen units are known to exist and it's not generally believed that the system ever made it to retail. The design featured a laserdisc player and attached computer, each the size of an early-model VCR. Of the six games planned only two games were completed: Thayer's Quest and NFL Football LA Raiders vs SD Chargers. RDI Video Systems claimed that the system would be entirely voice-activated, and would have an artificial intelligence on par with HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Halcyon (console)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
