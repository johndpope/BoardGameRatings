			<description>&amp;quot;dollm&amp;auml;tsch&amp;quot; is an educational game (published in german). It contains 720 cards, listing 90 words in 8 diffent foreign languages (english, esperanto, polish, swedish, french, spanish, italian, and turkish), along with their phonetic transcription. The german translation printed on the back. The objective is to collect cards with the same word in different languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During gameplay, there are always 12 face-down stacks (german translation showing) and a good number of face-up cards (name in other language showing) in the center, plus groups of cards (with the same word in different languages) in front of the players. In his turn, a player takes any 2 cards; if their translation matches, he keeps them as a group in front of him, otherwise he puts them back face-up (thus the number of face-up cards increases over the course of the game). He may even steal a whole group of cards from another player if he can match them with one more card with the same word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a set time. Winner is the player who collected most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards: &lt;br/&gt;Bronze medal at the IENA Erfindermesse 2004&lt;br/&gt;Auswahlliste Deutscher Lernspielpreis 2004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
