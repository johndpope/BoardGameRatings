			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NO-ONE IS IMMUNE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time is running out for corporate mogul Tiron Korsby. A microscopic probe has been injected into his bloodstream by rival corporation Axiom. A probe that with every beat of his heart is homing in on his brain to execute its diabolical plan: total mind control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission: track down and destroy the intruder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microcosm saw the player piloting a miniaturised craft through the interior of a human body, hunting down and destroying enemy robots which have been implanted by a rival corporation. The game is basically an on-rails shooter, but the backgrounds were impressive for the time, having been pre-rendered on Silicon Graphics workstations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
