			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitman: Blood Money is a stealth game developed by IO Interactive, published by Eidos Interactive and directed by Rasmus H&amp;oslash;jengaard. It is the fourth entry in the Hitman game series and was released on May 26, 2006 in Europe and on May 30 in the United States[1] for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 video game consoles and the Microsoft Windows operating system. A Mobile Phone version under the same name was also released but with drastically different gameplay, graphics and overall style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story follows the life of professional hitman, Agent 47, as narrated in cutscenes by a former director of the FBI to a journalist who is interviewing him. The wheelchair-using ex-director recounts how his agency tracked 47 over a two-year period. The game also marks 47's arrival to the United States, and differs from the original three in that several contracts are carried out in civilian areas, as opposed to the &amp;quot;covert ops&amp;quot; settings of Codename 47, Silent Assassin, and Contracts. A sequel has been confirmed to be in the works by Eidos Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
