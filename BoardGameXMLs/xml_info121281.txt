			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1928. You are visiting Mr Minotier, a rich French businessman and his family on their private island off the coast of Bretagne. The storm that hits the coast as soon as you arrive is just the first in a series of strange and terrible events that will strike the island and its few inhabitants. Mr Minotier's long lost brother Aristide, who disappeared twenty years ago, reappears during supper and soon after collapses. A few hours later, L&amp;eacute;on, the housekeeper's son, is found brutally murdered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where did Aristide come from? What happened to him? What kind of animal inflicted such brutal mutilations on the poor boy? And will you survive long enough to solve the mysteries of the island?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incantation is an icon-driven adventure game, with light RPG elements: the player can choose the character's job, which changes his reason for coming to the island, and the character has three stats, influencing his chances of success in several actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story itself is inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos (there are several Mythos-related books listed in the content of the island library in the game manual).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
