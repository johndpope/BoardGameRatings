			<description>A dexterity game for children. Players take turns trying to place little plastic pieces (snails, beetles, leaves) on top of a plastic toadstool. The toadstool wobbles, and if some of the figures fall down, the active player has to take them. The first player to get rid of all of his/her snails, beetles and leaves wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
