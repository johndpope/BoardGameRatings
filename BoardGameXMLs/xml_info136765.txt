							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SuperPET 9000</name>
									
			<description>The last in the series was the SP9000, known as the SuperPET or MicroMainframe. This machine (only sold in Europe[citation needed]) was designed at the University of Waterloo for teaching programming. In addition to the basic CBM 8000 hardware, the 9000 added a second CPU in the form of the Motorola 6809, more RAM and included a number of programming languages including BASIC in ROM for the 6502 and APL, COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal and a 6809 assembler on floppies for the 6809. It also included a terminal program which allowed the machine to be used as a &amp;quot;smart terminal&amp;quot; as well, so this single machine could replace many of the boxes currently in use at the university. Additionally this machine became a remote development environment where the user could later upload their creation to a mainframe after completing development and testing on the SuperPET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Commodore PET&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
