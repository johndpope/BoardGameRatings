			<description>User Note: Two versions available, one for the Squadron UK rpg and the other for M&amp;amp;M Superlink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb (from M&amp;amp;M Superlink version)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've all been there. Real life gets in the way and we can't continue to play our favourite Superhero RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you tempted to use the Internet to keep playing? If so, this book is the essential primer. All the hints, tips and tricks you'll need to make running a Play-By-E-Mail M&amp;amp;M campaign a success. All the pit-falls to avoid. The pros, the cons, the joys and the disappointments. Written by a Referee with 30 years experience of running Superhero RPGs (ouch that hurts to say!) and over a decade of PBEM knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I won't say that this book will make running your games through e-mail a doddle but it will save you a lot of time effort and heartache and make the experience much more enjoyable for you, your players and your lurkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For anyone interested in running M&amp;amp;M Superlink games through the Internet this book is quite simply a must-have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
