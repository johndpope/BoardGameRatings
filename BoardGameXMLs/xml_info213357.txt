			<description>Each player starts at one corner of the game board with a car, a bicycle and a pedestrian. Movement is determined by a die. The players have to get their pedestrian to a space marked with a &amp;bdquo;Z&amp;ldquo; and the car and bicycle to the opposite starting spaces (for example: A to B), while minding the traffic rules. By the roll of a 1 or 6 the player has to draw a card and answer the related question from the games rules. According to the answer positive or negative points are awarded. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins the game. If 2 players have the same amount of points, the one who finished first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced in the 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
