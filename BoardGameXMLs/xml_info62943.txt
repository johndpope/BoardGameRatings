			<description>The &amp;quot;game board&amp;quot; is a large plastic hand which holds a spoon. The hand is filled with tokens. The players then take turns inserting a smaller spoon into one of three slots in the hand, causing one token to fall out. This has to be put into the larger spoon. When the weight of the tokens becomes too large, the spoon bends down and all tokens fall out - the &amp;quot;guilty&amp;quot; player is eliminated the the hand is refilled. Repeat until only one player is left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was allegedly designed by Uri Geller, at least the publisher claims that it was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
