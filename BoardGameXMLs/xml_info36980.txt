							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Auction Game</name>
									
			<description>Players each receive 10 counters with which to buy cards. The card deck, which consists of 24 pairs of cards, each card representing half of an article, is dealt out evenly. Each of the 24 articles fits into a category of animal, vegetable, or mineral. To start, all players look at their cards and place (face down) any pairs they may already have. They then use their counters to buy cards that other players are auctioning. Players take turns being the auctioneer. At the end of the game you want to have the most pairs. If the number of pairs is tied, the tie is broken by the number of coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
