			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescue Wilgold is a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5th Edition 5e single session adventure designed to take 4 players from level 3 to level 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released as part of Dragon Drop Adventures, this product is designed to be easy to use, simple to implement and straight forward to insert into your own game world or setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wizard Wilgold is being held hostage in his own tower! A group of ne&amp;rsquo;er-do-wells have tricked the old wizard into letting them past his defenses, and are now holding him, and his work ransom, demanding a ludicrous sum from the University for his safe return. The Archchancellor is looking for capable adventurers to save Wilgold&amp;rsquo;s research -and I suppose Wilgold as well, if you must.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
