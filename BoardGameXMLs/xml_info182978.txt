			<description>The year is 008 Post Galactic Colonization. Humans have developed the technology to terraform planets, and it has become a very lucrative business. Terraforming companies now race to newly discovered planets to mold them in the most profitable way possible. They will stop at nothing to satisfy their wealthy investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landed is a competitive tile-laying game where players take control of rival terraforming companies that have simultaneously reached the same newly-discovered planet. All players will sign unique contracts with investors to terraform this new world and claim use of the land. The player who fulfills the most valuable contracts and scores the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 2-4 player, hex tile laying game, you begin the game with 2 contracts and 4 double sided tiles. On your turn, you may complete one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Play a tile from your hand, adjacent to any other tile. You may fulfill a contract. Obtain a satellite card if you place a satellite tile next to another satellite tile.&lt;br/&gt;2. Draw tiles until you have a hand of 4.&lt;br/&gt;3. Draw 3 contracts. Choose 1 or 2 to keep and discard the remaining ones. You may have at most 3 unfulfilled contracts at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may also optionally play 1 satellite card as a free action at any time during your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues clockwise. When the last tile is drawn, the last round begins, with the player who drew the last tile getting the last turn. The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
