							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beasts of the Known Realms</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold! For there are beasts wild and majestic in the wilderness. Intrepid wanderers ventured to catalog them all within these lowly tomes so that you might know them well. These creatures, these beasts of the realms, are known well to us all through legends and folklore. But now thou might know them also and make with them what you will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following are statistics using the Sundered Epoch: Generations species rules and includes some guidelines on designing creatures for your games. Each creature listed is designed as a fully detailed character. All creatures, characters, monsters, etc. are referred to as Non-Player Characters (NPC) and the term is often used interchangeably. These sample creatures represent an &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; adult example of the creature. Just like with characters, some variation is expected and the Narrator should feel free to modify the creatures as appropriate for his/her game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
