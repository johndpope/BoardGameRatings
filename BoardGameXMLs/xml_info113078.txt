							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Froschkonzert f√ºr die Prinzessin</name>
									
			<description>The frogs sing a lullaby to the princess. Some frogs, however, want to catch flies rather than singing and that's what you have to smuggle themselves into the choir and catch the other players in this smuggling. Each player place a card face down on the bed and says a spell or he doubts that all the frogs sing out really, who has cheated or who doubted wrongly loses a frog.&lt;br/&gt;Player who has the biggest frog choir at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
