			<description>This game recreates a battle during the Napoleonic era between a British and French army. The French army counters represent a force of some 45,000 troops and the British 35,000 troops. Using these simple but comprehensive rules up to six players are able to recreate a complete battle with all its complex maneuvers and colorful tactics. The battlefield can be varied to suit any type of ground and the printed terrain pieces placed in any position desired thus give an extremely variable playing area, unrestricted by hexagonal or squared playing boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of several titles released by Tabletop Games which were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a mapboard) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming. The games offered an affordable alternative to the miniatures hobby in that they used un-cut cardstock counters for units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supplements:&lt;br/&gt;Napoleonic&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-N01 Prussain&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-N02 Russian&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-N03 Austrian&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-N04 Polish&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-N05 Spanish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
