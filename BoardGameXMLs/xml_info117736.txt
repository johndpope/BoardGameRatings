			<description>Fighter Maker 2 (FM2) for the PS2 was another entry in the Designer Series from Agetec Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is similar to the original Fighter Maker game in that it is 3D-based and allows users to create custom moves for their fighters. This is the main part of the gameplay, where a player edits the body, battle sequence, and animation of a fighter that are imposed once the actual fight begins.   While the original game was criticized as there was little to do once a fighter had been created, this second edition has more advancements in character design, movement, and attacks. As with the first, the game was met with lukewarm reviews, mainly due to its cumbersome interface and the lack of bells and whistles that were featured in most fighting games at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Music was composed by the U.K. band INTELLIGENTSIA, who also created the in-game FX.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fighter Maker&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
