							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cat that Got the Milk</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short, surreal arcade game, The Cat that Got the Milk sees you navigating abstract landscapes, sometimes inspired by famous modern artists, in order to reach an exit without colliding with any of the hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What sets the game apart from its peer, from a mechanical point of view, is that the shape goes up or down if you press the corresponding key, but move to the right on its own as long as you stop pressing it (and there's no way to go to the left)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
