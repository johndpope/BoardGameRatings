							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Warlock: A Dungeon World Compatible Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power is a difficult thing. Mortal men and women struggle daily to hold what few scraps they can obtain. Even the king upon his throne must safeguard his power with armies, decrees, policies. It is a long, hard road to travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not you, no. You&amp;rsquo;ve found a shortcut, an easier way to gain everything you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted. Hard work is for people who can&amp;rsquo;t make the tough decisions you did, who aren&amp;rsquo;t meant for greater things. While your allies train and study, while your enemies prepare, you act. This is your world, your life, and you&amp;rsquo;re going to get everything you deserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A shame you had to sell your soul to get it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warlock is a full class for Dungeon World and includes the playbook so you can start playing with it right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
