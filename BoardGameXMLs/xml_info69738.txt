			<description>(From the game box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're in their WORLD now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is Aura? What is the Book of Twilight? Why did you friend, Orca, fall into a mysterious coma? As the outlaw player, Kite, you're on a mission of truth. Take a journey into a virtual world where anything is possible, and nothing is as it appears. Fight your way through contaminated levels of cyberspace as you take on and eliminate enemies, and unlock codes that will allow you to gate travel to even more environments - all in the desperate attempt to discover who or what's behind The World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
