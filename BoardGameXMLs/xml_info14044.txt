			<description>In Les Vins de France, players tour the famous wine regions of France, acquiring some of the myriad types of wine, and scoring points by the judicious use of these wines with gourmet meals representative of the regional cuisines of France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll an eight-sided die and move clockwise around the outskirts of France.  Vinyard spaces allow the player the choice of acquiring a wine from the region, or dining on a meal from that region.  City spaces allow dining with a meal from any region.  When Dining, a player rolls the die and references a chart to determine the meal.  He then selects a wine from his holdings, and cross-references another chart to determine the points scored for the meal.  Dessert and Picnic spaces allow discarding wines for a set number of points.  Fortune spaces require the drawing of cards which grant special abilities, change the players location on the board, or cause the loss of a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
