							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Etherscope Rules Variants</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the three years that Etherscope has been in print we have received a lot of feedback from players, referees, fans and other publishers about the game. Likewise, we ourselves have had play and design experience that has impacted upon how we look at Etherscope. While firmly believing the game is strong as it stands, we have developed a number of rules variants, in relation to feedback and experience, that we feel enhance the Etherscope system and capture our design goals better. Further we believe these variants allow players to more fully explore and enjoy the themes and experiences of the Etherscope world. These rule variants are presented below. Note the use of any or all these rules is optional, it&amp;rsquo;s your world and group that count but these changes will included in the new rules and character classes in this and future support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
