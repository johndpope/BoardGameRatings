			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As your party closes in on the coast of the Newmack Sea you are greeted by a large group of the duke&amp;rsquo;s military. After gaining an audience with General Zulta you discover that your reputation has preceded you. The general asks your party if they could assist him in the capture of the rogue mage Oxidosus who is currently trapped in his island fortress. A cautionary note, if the players make poor decisions TPK is a very real possibility!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a mid to upper level group of adventurers.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
