							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ABC Dice</name>
									
			<description>A word dice game packaged to appeal to antique lovers.  It is &amp;quot;inspired by centuries-old references to spelling dice&amp;quot;, quoting John Locke's approval of using them, and the box art and the font on the dice have an antique feel to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There 8 dice included -- whose sides have a letter from the (modern) alphabet, or an asterisk as a wild card -- and a rules sheet.  To play a turn, a player rolls all 8 dice and rearranges them to spell as many words as possible in a set amount of time, while another player writes them down.  Different scoring schemes are presented for players of different ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules sheet has safety warnings on the back not to play on a glass or other fragile surface, useful precautions since the dice are fairly large (1 inch cubes) and weighty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
