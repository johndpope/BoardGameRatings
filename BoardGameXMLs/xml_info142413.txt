							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oil Well</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amidst the grass covered plains of the prairie stands this early ragtag oil drilling rig. Not much more than a wooden hut built around the well the oil spilled when the drill was successful makes it look even more rundown than it actually is. Behind the hut always slightly leaky iron pipes lead to two large wooden tanks where the oil I gathered before being filled into barrels for shipping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous such barrels are standing in the grass in front of the well hut. Some of them full to the brim with the precious black liquid, others empty and stacked high while some more have been loaded onto a cart waiting only for the draft animals to be on its way. A low but sturdy wooden fence surrounds the well, more to mark the claim than to actually keep anyone out. Right now this is the only rig here, but it probably is only a matter of time before more spring up all around it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
