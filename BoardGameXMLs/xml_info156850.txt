			<description>War Skull brings the action of first-person shooters to a fast-pace board and card game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ominous entity called War Skull has transported players to a battle arena called zones. Each player must gather various weapons and equipment to defeat other opponents, until only one is left victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the battle begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- - - -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is fast, simple and easy to pick up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 zones which is determined by a dice on every turn as well as drawing your card from a pile where you will gather weapons, shields and special items from each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has its limitation of attack and range, but if another player is within reach, that's where the fun begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take turns and battle until only one is left standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
