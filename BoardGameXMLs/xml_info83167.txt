			<description>&amp;quot;Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games (ソニック at バンクーバーオリンピック, Sonikku atto Bankūbā Orimpikku?, lit. &amp;quot;Sonic at the Vancouver Olympics&amp;quot;) is a sports game developed by Venan Entertainment and published by Sega for the iOS. It was released on January 30, 2010, but has since been unexpectedly removed from the App Store with no comment by Sega or Apple.  The game is officially licensed by the International Olympic Committee  (IOC) through exclusive license International Sports Multimedia, and takes place at the 2010 Winter Olympics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games follows the release of the similarly-titled Mario &amp;amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games with similar gameplay and setting, but with the absence of Nintendo-owned characters. In comparison, the game also features less events. It received moderate reviews, exemplified with a five out of ten rating from IGN.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
