							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Commission: Special Friends Edition</name>
									
			<description>In the mythical land of Xanada, the auditor general discovered that 250 million dollars of public funds had been paid out to political cronies for questionable or imaginary work.  Government record keeping was found to be in a shambles.  The king in his wisdom called a Royal Commission to investigate the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player, you are implicated in the scandal and will be called to testify.  In this gracious kingdom, you have little to fear.  You cannot go to jail, nor will you be asked to give any of the money back.  None the less, as good citizens, you will be expected to participate in the Royal Commission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
