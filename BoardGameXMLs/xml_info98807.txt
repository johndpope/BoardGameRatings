			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Call the Plays&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's fourth and long with less than a minute remaining in the game. The winner gets a wild card berth in the playoffs. You're down by a field goal. Your quarterback makes a perfect pass, your receiver is wide open, and then you see the referee's arms fly up signaling the touchdown. You're going to the playoffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offense&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are playing offense, you will be asked to select a formation for your team, a pass pattern for each of your receivers, and a blocking direction for your blockers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Audibles: If you don't like the look of a defense when you reach the line of scrimmage, you can call an audible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defense&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can choose from nine defensive formations. There are no patterns for individual defensive players. If the offense calls an audible, you will have a chance to change your formation, but you will not be able to see your selection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penalties&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two 5-yard penalties that can be called by the referee and cannot be declined - Offense: Delay of Game, Defense: Offsides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy Tips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the computer is playing defense, it can remember (for a short time) any plays you call frequently. If it spots a familiar pass play, chances are you'll be intercepted. So keep the computer player &amp;quot;on its toes&amp;quot; and mix up your offensive plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing the running game, follow your blockers and run to daylight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are playing the game for the first time, use the Shotgun formation and the Streak pass patterns a few times to get used to the passing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing defense, play bump and run with the receivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try a trick play. An effective one is the fake punt. It's possible - and embarrassing to the defense when it works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
