			<description>This is a game system for 17 games, not all of them using colored tiles:&lt;br/&gt;Jam: players take turns placing pieces on a 5x5 board, putting 2 or 3 pieces at a time, making sure they are in different rows and columns. The person to make the last legal move wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triplets: players take turns placing a white and black piece on an 8x8 board with the intent to make groups of the same color. Winning is determined by how many groups have the same number of pieces in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Color Scheme: this can only be played after a game of Triplets, by taking turns removing one piece at a time that is in the same row/column/diagonal as the last piece moved. What color is removed last determines the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternating Colors: this is a more advanced version of Color Scheme. It involves removing a piece each turn that is the opposite color of the previous piece moved, but also must be in the same row/column/diagonal as the last piece, and also must have been connected to it. Winning is determined by how many pieces one is able to remove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Order and Chaos: this is basically Pente played on a 6x6 board, save for one player wins by making a 5 or 6-in-a-row, while the other player wins by blocking this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Holes: players bid on how many empty spaces will be left after a game, the person with the closest bid wins. Turns are placing a white or black piece on a 6x6 board. Spaces that would make a 3-in-row of either or both colors cannot be played on (this is the black hole).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Board Building: players lay colored tiles on a 6x6 board, making sure their tile is not in the same row/column as a tile of the same color. Last person to make a legal move wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knight Rider: connect all 6 of each colored tile by a knight's move as in chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swithcraft: involves switching tiles around a 6x6 board to achieve goal picked by players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quadrants: this is a 3-in-a-row game with each section of 3x3 colored tiles being treated as separate boards to play on. Pieces can only be played on a tile that is adjacent in the rainbow spectrum to the last tile played on. Winning is determined by how many 3-in-rows are made in each section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off Limits: pieces are played a knight's move away from the last piece played. How many pieces land on red tiles determine winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRY vs. GOP: this is a simpler version of Off Limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Size Matters: basically Triplets played on colored tiles, by playing pieces on the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endies: goal is to make pairs of the same color by playing pieces on tiles of different colors. Players bid on how many pairs will be made; person with closest bid wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cross/Link: this is a connection game, by placing pieces on same-colored tiles to connect both sides of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Row vs. Column: another connection game that allows placing pieces on tiles adjacent in the rainbow spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together: this is the same game as Quink. The tiles are laid in 5 crosses and the goal is to make 5 pentaminoes of the same color within 32 moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 42-page booklet also includes dozens of variations for each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
