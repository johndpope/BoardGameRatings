							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Championship Sumo Wrestling</name>
									
			<description>Championship Sumo Wrestling is a short, simple game simulating Japanese wrestling. Sumo wrestling is a sport in which the object is to either force your opponent out of a circular ring or to force him to touch the floor with any part of his body except his feet. Action is fast and furious, and typical bouts seldom last more than thirty seconds. A good way to play is for each player to generate several wrestlers and fight a series of bouts at one sitting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls a six-sided die for each of five characteristics- Speed, Agility, Strength, Weight, and Balance- to generate their character. When battling an opponent, certain stats are cross-referenced with any of 8 wrestling moves: Charge, Attack, Step Aside, Slap, Lever, Lift, Push, and Pull, in order to determine a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was included in issue #64 of Dragon Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
