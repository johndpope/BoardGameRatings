			<description>Simino is a color matching game. &lt;br/&gt;Simino game box includes 49 Simino cards, four card holders, score sheets and Simino game board. Simino can be played by one to four people. The main goal of this game is obtaining the highest score by matching the colors of the sides of Simino cards that are placed in a location on the Simino board. Meanwhile, a player should consider minimizing the total score that an opponent attempts to obtain. Simino is the name of the best move in the game. A Simino move is played if a player places all of his/her four cards all at once on the Simino board during his/her turn in the game. Actually, a player can only place one card at a time during his/her turn. But if s/he can make a Simino move, then it is possible for him/her to place all of the cards s/he has at once.&lt;br/&gt;There are two groups of cards in Simino: Regular and Joker. A regular card can have a single color at each side, where as a Joker card can contain one side having two to four colors and the rest having a single color. Each side has a score associated with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
