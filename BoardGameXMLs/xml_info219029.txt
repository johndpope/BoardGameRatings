			<description>From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;In the year 2199, the Spaceship 'Epic' was caught in a plasma storm and forced off course through a space warp into unknown space.  Due to damage sustained during the storm, the 'Epic' has been forced down to an apparently uninhabited planted for urgent repairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst on-planet, the ship, unknown by the crew, became infected with an alien life form (ALF).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repairs made, the ship set off on its journey home to Altontron.  It was then they became aware of the ALF. Investigations of the ALF by the medical centre produced the following data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)  The ALF was a virus type of creature with an incubation period of 12 days.&lt;br/&gt;2)  After 12 days. it metamorphosed into pools of slime with the ability to grow and move.&lt;br/&gt;3)  After a short period, it then became into a slime walking monster.&lt;br/&gt;4)  The final transformation was into a large walking slime throwing monster, some of which appear to have the power to turn invisible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several crew members have been killed on contact with the ALF.  The captain of the Epic gave the order to abandon ship and the crew teleported to a nearby planetoid to await rescue.  The last crew member to leave, activated the ships into clean system whose Servo droids would hunt and destroy only ALF's on the ship.  On hitting an ALF, they self destruct, leaving their energy rolls behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also activated was a mayday message:&lt;br/&gt;TSS - EPIC TO UFP COMMAND SHIP OVERRUN WITH ALF'S&lt;br/&gt;SEND N.E.I.L. DROIDS&lt;br/&gt;KILL ALL LIFEFORAAAAARRRHHH!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the part of N.E.I.L., the half human, half cyborg, mercenary who can go where no human can go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arriving at the location of the TSS Epic, you have teleported aboard to clear the ship of ALF's in order for the crew to return and continue their voyage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
