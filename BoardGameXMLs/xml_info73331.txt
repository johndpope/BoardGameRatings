			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Misfits &amp;amp; Menaces focuses on a number of villains and/or one or more villainous organization that may be inserted into most super-heroic campaigns with little effort. Archenemies presents villains designed to be reoccurring foes in your game, thanks to their far-reaching plans and goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this issue you&amp;rsquo;ll find details for the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Adversary, an A.E.G.I.S. creation designed to combat metahumans for the government, but now out of control and off the leash.&lt;br/&gt;     Autocract, an exoskeleton-wearing, former weapon&amp;rsquo;s designer who sees the world as a giant social machine in desperate need of repair, whether it wants it or not.&lt;br/&gt;     Dagon, ruler of the deep ones high-priest of Cthulhu, and all-around bad ass.&lt;br/&gt;     Faust, an immortal alchemist and magician on the run from Hell who is willing to do anything to set his soul free, no matter what it may cost others.&lt;br/&gt;     Gaia, out of control environmentalist who will turn the world against mankind as readily as humanity turned against Mother Earth.&lt;br/&gt;     Hiroshima, a villain born of nuclear fire who is willing to use the same means to return Japan to its former glory and position in global standing.&lt;br/&gt;     Mordred, the reincarnation of King Arthur&amp;rsquo;s illegitimate son, he seeks to take everything from his father and claim Britain&amp;rsquo;s crown for his own within a new revival of the monarchy. (See Do-Gooders &amp;amp; Daredevils: Champions for more details.)&lt;br/&gt;     Morgan Le Fay, fairy queen and King Arthur&amp;rsquo;s half sister, she and her monstrous creations, the Fay&amp;rsquo;nabolg, seek to return Great Britain to the fairy kingdom that once ruled it (with her at the helm, of course.) (See Do-Gooders &amp;amp; Daredevils: Champions for more details.)&lt;br/&gt;     Mortus, ruler of the undead, plots from his dimension of the undying to transform Earth into a wasteland of creatures trapped forever between life and what may be found beyond.&lt;br/&gt;     System, master of the mechanical, wants to tear down society and rebuild it by using its own reliance upon high-technology against it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
