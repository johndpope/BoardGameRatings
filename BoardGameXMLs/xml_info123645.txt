			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game where everyone is a target.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Targets is a fast paced, easy to learn game. Play cards to build your hand, whittle down everyone else's, make temporary allies or retaliate against your foes. Remember, there can be only one winner. So target your friends, take their cards, block their actions and make sure, in the end, you are the only one holding cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt 10 cards each to start. On each turn, a player may either play one card from their hand, or discard one card and draw a replacement. There are three types of cards: &amp;quot;Power&amp;quot; cards which stay in front of the player when played, &amp;quot;Quick Power&amp;quot; cards which can be played at any time, and &amp;quot;Action&amp;quot; cards that cause the action written on them to happen when played. The last player with cards in their hand is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no real theme to the game. The cards simply display text such as &amp;quot;Target misses their next turn&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Destroy target power card&amp;quot;, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
