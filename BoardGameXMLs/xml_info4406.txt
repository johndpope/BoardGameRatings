							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mini Archimedes</name>
									
			<description>This travel-sized version of the four-player Archimedes Professional is played on a 7x6 board.  The object is to capture the opponent's King by surrounding him with colored pegs.  The Kings are the black and white pegs and start on the Throne squares at either end of the board.  The other 30 pegs are multi-colored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your move, you first move your King defensively, by sliding to an adjacent free space.  Next, you place a colored peg offensively, hoping to box the opponent King in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An optional rule allows a captured King to displace a colored peg if it happens to lie on a straight line away from him along with another same-color peg (at any distance).  Further, Kings aren't allowed to come adjacent to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
