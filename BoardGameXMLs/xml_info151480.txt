							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdom of Toads</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curse will echo in legends: in one dire moment, each man, woman, and child in the Kingdom of Kelwyk was transformed into a simple toad. Only the king's advisor, displaced from his body on an astral sojourn at the time of the curse, retains enough of his mind to summon aid. Could the rival County of Stonevale be behind this affliction? Or has Kelwyk's decades-old foe, the vile witch Vakelna, wrought her vengeance at last? The world's greatest champions are urgently needed to unravel the mystery of the Kingdom of Toads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kingdom of Toads&amp;quot; is an adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game of legendary scope and suitable for any campaign world. Presented for PCs of 17th or 18th level, and specifically designed to accommodate the varied and spectacular powers of high-level PCs, this adventure also includes notes and statistics for scaling challenges to PCs of lower or higher level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
