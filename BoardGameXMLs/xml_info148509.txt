							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Of Mice and Lemmings</name>
									
			<description>A desperate tale of rodents and river crossings, Of Mice and Lemmings sees between five and eight players attempt to cross a thunderous stretch of water in order to reach the safe haven of a brand new cheese factory on the other bank. However, while the mice will be looking to fill their stomachs with all that high-quality dairy product, the lemmings have another idea: Scupper the bridges that are being built and plunge into the torrent below! Combining elements of both teamwork and individual play, you'll be looking to choose the right time to reveal your true nature while screwing over your opposite numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players add cards to the central pool, numbered from 0 to 10. Depending on how many people are playing, a certain target number must be reached; 35, for example, with eight players. Each round, one player MUST reveal whether she is a mouse or lemming, then rely on her fellow rodents to get them all across the bridge &amp;mdash; or not, as the case may be! Reveal too early and you could be putting too much faith in the other players; reveal too late and there's a good chance you may not be successful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of Mice and Lemmings is a quirky update on the trick-taking genre and adds hidden identities, a healthy amount of bluffing, and rodents with one-track minds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
