			<description>This is a hybrid between Dominoes and Memory. In fact, the material is suitable for both games. The playing pieces are grey plastic units which have one nearly flat colored end with some 3D pattern, and one &amp;quot;diagonal&amp;quot; one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- In ORY, the players place all the pieces into the box and pull out two of them at a time, hoping to find two in which the patterns fit into each other. Whoever locates most pairs this way is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;- In DO, two random pieces are placed on the table. In his/her turn, a player tries to add a piece that fits the pattern and another one of his/her choice. A player who cannot add pieces has to draw a new one from the box. The goal is to get rid of one's pieces first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
