							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes Inc 4: Character Builder</name>
									
			<description>Heroes Inc 4: Character Builder is an expansion to Heroes Inc. This game includes several new heroes and villains that can be used in the other scenarios, as well as a detailed set of instructions for players to design their own heroes. A formula is given to determine the cost of new heroes which is then used to purchase the hero in scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a points system to buy characters with. Players have 40 points to spend on their heroes and villains in order to build the best group. The game follows the core rules of the other Steel and Glory games but adds new rules to accommodate for super hero fighting techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players activate a character which can take up to two actions, including fight, move, rest, climb, or stand/go prone. Characters can attack enemies that are one square away for melee attack or may use ranged attack for enemies further away. Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. Victory is achieved by having a character remain on a certain part of the board for three complete uninterrupted turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
