			<description>The beautiful Filly Butterflies are excited, because Princess Scarlet is visiting. She ha brought sparkling crystals, which they generously hands out in the magic Papillia garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reach all Fillies, the princess travels from place to place. With a little luck of the dice and courage to some take risks you can get hold of a lot of colorful glitter stones. Here we go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Filly Butterfly: Sammle deine Funkelsteine (Filly Butterfly: Collect your Glitter Stones), each player attempts to collect as many crystals as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, all players receive the same amount of crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows six locations in Papillia; each location has some spaces for crystals. A Princess Scarlet pawn is placed on one of the location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the die and moving Princess Scarlet a number of spaces clockwise, as indicated on the die. If Princess Scarlet ends her move in a location that still has an empty spot for a crystal, the active player has to place one of his crystals there, and may then roll the die again, if desired. On the other hand, if Princess Scarlet ends her move on a location that has no more empty spots, the active player may take all crystals from that location, and his turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has no more crystals left. Then, the player who has collected the most crystals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
