			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people have no interest in the practical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are those that devote themselves to esoteric knowledge, theory, history and art. If given the opportunity, they might be eternal students and teachers, ever learning new and unusual things. Their devotion matches that of the Monk or the Wizard, but has a far less useful application. Long nights, poor care for their material concerns, these things make them as physically weak as the Wizard, without the advantage of magic to buoy them up. Absent minded, and focused upon their own interests, they are often seen as eccentric. They can achieve wide renown for their sagacity, as courtiers or advisors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are the least physically and magically equipped of any Unlikely Hero to manage in a time of crisis. But they do have a power of their own, though it be abstract and less applicable than those of others. It is the power of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sagely and well read of the world are Scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
