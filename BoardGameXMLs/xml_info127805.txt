							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anno Domini: Hannover &amp; Deutschland</name>
									
			<description>Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year in which it happened on the other.&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives nine of these cards, and may only look at the descriptions. Each player in turn puts a card on the table, trying to put them in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&lt;br/&gt;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure and are hard to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Anno Domini series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
