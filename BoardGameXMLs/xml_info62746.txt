Also know as a Help Card. These cards help the player overcome an obstacle encountered by a spin of the spinner. If a player spins and lands on an area of the spinner which says, &amp;quot;Your plane is delayed&amp;quot;, a scoop card which deals with transportation (&amp;quot;Your friend takes you to your destination in her private helicopter&amp;quot;) will help the player overcome the obstacle. Six of the Scoop Cards (called Scoop 'Em) allow a player to swap assignments and locations with another player. In this way, one player can steal or &amp;quot;scoop&amp;quot; the other player's story and earn a Dateline.&lt;br/&gt;     4 - Portfolio cases - These are envelope-like containers where players will store the Dateline Cards once they have earned their Datelines.&lt;br/&gt;     Rule booklet.&lt;br/&gt;     Glossary of Journalistic Terms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
