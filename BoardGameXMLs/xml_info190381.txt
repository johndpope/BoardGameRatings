			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOIR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game where you take on the role of the streetsmart gumshoe, out on his luck boxer, smart-talking heavy, or one of many other people populating the dark streets of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOIR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game where lies and deceit are as common as air, and where dames will lead you into trouble faster than a mick finn will lay you on the floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOIR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game where you need a lot of Moxie to make it through to the climax before someone puts the chill on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOIR is a roleplaying game that emulates the movies and books of the 40's and 50's. It is part of the d6 productions line to see how many different systems we can make using just the humble six sided die (or several).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
