			<description>Travel / pocket version of the &amp;quot;Alias&amp;quot; board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;- stack of papers with portable gameboards&lt;br/&gt;- 50 double-sided cards&lt;br/&gt;- pencil&lt;br/&gt;- hourglass&lt;br/&gt;- rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alias consists of many cards, each card has 6 words written on it. Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &amp;quot;Silver Medal&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The &amp;quot;explainer&amp;quot; must change every turn. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the word that is written on card by using sentences to describe the word. For example, if the word is &amp;quot;Silver Medal&amp;quot;, a player can say &amp;quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&amp;quot;. But if other team member says just &amp;quot;Medal&amp;quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
