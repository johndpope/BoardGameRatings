							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Schlock Attack</name>
									
			<description>A two-player checkers variant inspired by the online comic strip Schlock Mercenary by Howard Tayler. (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.schlockmercenary.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.schlockmercenary.com/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To be the last player with checkers on the board or to meet your special victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A complete checkers set.&lt;br/&gt;    * A six-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;    * Some pennies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup is identical to that of a standard game of checkers. Next, one player choses a character to play. Then, the other player chooses a character and starts the game. The character you pick will give you certain advantages (and disadvantages in some cases). Also, some of the players have special victory conditions. Play is identical to a normal game of checkers, except that the rules that govern a character overrule all other rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your opponent loses the last of his or her checkers, you win. The game also ends if one player has met any special conditions that he or she has for winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the rules here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/110/schlock-attack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/110/schlock-attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
