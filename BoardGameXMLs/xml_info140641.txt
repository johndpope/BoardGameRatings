							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: MetaNet Detective</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It isn't enough to simply be able to solve mysteries in the information age. Today, detectives have to solve them almost instantly and expertly. While weeks of sifting through paper trails, endless hours of surveillance, and face to face interviews with suspects and witnesses worked in the past, a new breed of investigator utilizes the cutting edge in forensics and Internet technology to streamline the process. A MetaNet Detective usually has a background in research and forensics analysis, but it is not necessary. In fact, MetaNet tries to recruit a wide variety of experts from around the world, to cover every eventuality. It is possible to find former army officers and Tibetan shamans on MetaNet. All members are expected to have some knowledge of forensics analysis and investigation technique. This 7 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Haven: Full Metal Zero. Fans of Warren Ellis' Global Frequency character Miranda Zero will love to use this class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
