			<description>A Collection of Drinking Games and More!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buried deep within whispers of the city lies rumour of a great game, a great drinking game! Entering it's third year, not so secret but not so public drinking tournament has opened its doors once more and the drinks and music are flowing. Many have come far and wide to see who might defeat the current reigning champions, the Blackford Crossing Gang, and become the champions of The 3rd Annual Great Grog Games! However, more than just games, a greater mystery may lie beneath the floors of the Greyhog Inn and surrounding it's proprietor, Hoggle Greyhog. A great alchemist and inventor, the old gnome is putting the final touches on his Masterpiece, a flesh golem construct of monumental strength and vitality that once complete, will allow him to transfer his consciousness thanks to his Eternal Machine and live forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
