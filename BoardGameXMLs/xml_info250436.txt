			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rourke, a capable soldier, may have sought to flee war after witnessing the consequences of one of his missions, but soon finds himself dragged back into combat to help keep the battle from spreading any farther. This will mean having to put his skills back to work, taking the player on a journey through Rourke's conflicting emotions as he once again returns to combat despite wanting nothing more than to escape it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the game will be spent learning about the people with you, learning about the psychological side of warfare, as well as the importance of companionship in combat, more than how well one can pick out where to place a shot. The developers wish for players to bond with their fellow combatants and fighting civilians, helping keep up friendships, relationships, and morale if they have any hope of surviving against the game's tough foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
