			<description>Lapsus Calumni #10: The King&amp;rsquo;s Tomb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;This one was completely inspired by Brent Wolke&amp;rsquo;s recent work on Risus settings and is an unabashed homage to those games we played as children back in the 80&amp;prime;s. So yeah, this is all his fault. In honor of him, I even stole some of his creature &amp;lsquo;stats&amp;rsquo; for this module. Also, this just happens to be eight pages long. Go figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The moniker of &amp;ldquo;micro-dungeon&amp;rdquo; has recently begun to be floated about the net and it is perfect for this little dungeon. I much prefer these micro-dungeons to the earlier fad of mega-dungeons. They just present a nice little adventure with enough detail to spur a GM on, but leave enough open for him to customize a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
