			<description>IMPLEMENTS:&lt;br/&gt;Two differently numbered yachts&lt;br/&gt;An indicator with an arrow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a yacht and the plays in turn, according to the rules.&lt;br/&gt;Each player must spin a 5 to enter the yacht at space 1 but if later on he is compelled to start over again by stopping on either space 4 or 15 the player may enter on any spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a yacht stops on a gold space it gains two points, going to the next gold space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a yacht stops on a red space the player loses his/her turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If two yachts wind up on the same space, the first yacht is &amp;quot;blanketed&amp;quot; and goes back 4 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a yacht becomes disabled by landing on space 27 it moves forward at 1/2 spinner speed rounded up for the remainder of the game unless a 6 is rolled which repairs the yacht and then on the next turn the yacht returns to normal speed. Players stopping on spaces containing directions must always move according to those directions except for those landing on space 27 (disabled)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to reach space 40 wins the race&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game submission should be credited to KEVIN Kluvon KG who sent me the info on the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
