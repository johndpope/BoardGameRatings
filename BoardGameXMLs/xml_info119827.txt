							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Second World Sourcebook (Playtest Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occasionally a person steps around the corner of an alley, finds a hole in the back of their closet, takes a shortcut down a wooded road at night, or simply turns their head at just the right moment to watch a falling leaf and then finds himself elsewhere. These people are called Exiles; they step or turn out of our world, the world of crowded freeways and glittering convenience stores and into the Second World, a place of magic, mystery, danger, and more than a little bit of terror. There are two worlds you see, separated by a roiling gulf of chaos called the Forge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second World Sourcebook bridges the gap between modern day adventuring and traditional fantasy roleplaying. It provides a &amp;quot;campaign template&amp;quot; for running a dual-world game. By combining the sourcebook with your own favorite setting you can take your fantasy characters and run them through a modern day scenario, or take your modern characters and run them through one of the many fantasy modules currently available. Most modern settings already describe the impact of fantasy elements on them and include rules for handling magic. But what would happen if people from the modern world regularly trafficked with those in a more traditional fantasy world? What impact would it have if powerful wizards originally studied computer science at UCLA? What would the social institutions look like if the progress of ideas and politics we've seen in our world carried over to a place where electricity and gunpowder simply didn't work, but magic and divine power did?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
