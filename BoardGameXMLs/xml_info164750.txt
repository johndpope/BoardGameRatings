							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Who&#039;s That?</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The fast and furious name-guessing game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players divide into two teams, and decide on a time limit for rounds, which adjusts the difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card contains the names of a celebrity, a sportsperson and a historical character, and there is spinner with these on, plus three wilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One member of each team takes a card, spins the spinner, and sees who they must describe. They then have to describe that person to their team. If guessed correctly, they gain a point. If not, the card is discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first team to 15 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
