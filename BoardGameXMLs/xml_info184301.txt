							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King Cat: Feline Feuds</name>
									
			<description>Cat and Medieval and Contemporary Household Themed. The cats are divided into royalty designations/strength ranking and are attempting to exert control over locations in a Kingdom i.e. a bedroom for the purposes of napping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay consists of a drawing card then taking 1 or 2 actions of the following: placing cats in territories, placing Battle Cards of various types from the player's 4 card hand to give cats battle strength and scoring potential, battling opponent cats for control, and restoring cats after a battle. Drawing territories out of the deck and certain event cards add variety to gameplay/strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end of the 3rd draw deck. the victory points are gained by dominating territory based on the cat's size, faction, and royal stack relative to opponents. A second way to earn victory points is to have a valid quirk or bonus VP stack by the game's end. There are penalties to VP for holding certain cards and for cats being defeated in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
