			<description>We Built This City is a city building game where each player is vying to construct various public buildings throughout a walled, port city.  Resources arrive each turn and are bid upon by all of the players, and these resources are then used to construct the available buildings.  Victory points are awarded according to the building value and there are additional victory points awarded both during the game and at the games end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of player interaction and multiple game mechanics makes this a fun, challenging and ever-changing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beta versions are available for play-testing now.  Please contact support@ogagames.com to find out how your club or group can order a copy for review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
