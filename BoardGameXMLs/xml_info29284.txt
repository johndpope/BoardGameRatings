							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CULLODEN: The Last of The &#039;45</name>
									
			<description>Culloden on Drummossie Moor, April 16, 1746. William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, leads a new Government army loyal to the House of Hannover north to face Prince Charles Edward Stuart's fierce Highlanders. Bonnie Prince Charlie's Scots have been victorious in every encounter with the forces of the 'German Usurper' George II since the Jacobite flag of rebellion was raised at Glen Coe on August 19, 1745. Now as the fog lifts off the sodden moorland at 11 AM, 4500 claymore-armed clansmen, most having not eaten nor slept in a day and a half, stand to as the red-coated ranks of 9000 troops of the government army march into battle formations. As the cannon of both sides unleash grapeshot, the Duke orders his troops forward, confident in their fire discipline. The Scots, outnumbered 2 to 1 in bodies but possessing the spirit of a lion in every Celtic breast, launch themselves into an attack borne by their battle ferocity that has been victorious in every contest of arms for the past year. The throne of Britain has just been laid on the scales of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Culloden contains:&lt;br/&gt;one 11&amp;quot; by 17&amp;quot; map;&lt;br/&gt;140 die-cut backprinted 1/2&amp;quot; counters;&lt;br/&gt;8 pages of rules and scenarios;&lt;br/&gt;Just Plain Wargames Folio Format&lt;br/&gt;Cover Artwork by Adrian George&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
