			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inherent Advancement is a system to help declutter any Pathfinder campaign, whether or not you are using the mythic rules. In a single page, it presents a simple, easy-to-use mechanism to eliminate boring magic items and create more rewarding rewards that reside with the character rather than their gear. The system scales with level and offers advice on concentrating the value of magical items to make them more memorable, as well as the option of substituting mythic advancement for bulk treasure placement. The next time you shake your head at characters decked out like Christmas trees with &amp;quot;Big Six&amp;quot; bonus items, consider picking up Inherent Advancement and giving it a try instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Minis are short, inexpensive products designed to take one rules concept or set of Pathfinder RPG rules and bring them to you in a new way for the mythic rules, including converting existing rules as well as introducing entirely new rule options. Created by the same designers that helped bring you the official mythic rules, Mythic Minis skip the fluff and give you all crunch, all the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knows mythic like Legendary Games, and whether it's new mythic feats, class abilities, path abilities, magic items, or anything else, every Mythic Mini delivers a delicious dollop of dazzling design that will fill out your mythic experience one slice at a time. Check for a new Mythic Mini every Monday to make your game just a little more Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
