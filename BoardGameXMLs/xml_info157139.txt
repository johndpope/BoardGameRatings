							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Xhaos Theory: The Miniature Game</name>
									
			<description>Your Minions serve you without question. You are their Gawd. Their souls feed you in your quest toward the power to realize XHAOS THEORY. As you carefully wager their souls in bloody battles against other Gawds you risk losing those precious souls. A Gawd without worship ceases to exist.&lt;br/&gt;Command and guide your minions carefully or all hope is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xhaos Theory is for those that have always asked &amp;ldquo;What if?&amp;rdquo; Young and old, experienced or not. Play with a massive miniature collection, or just a handful of models or toys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xhaos Theory allows you to create virtually any miniature unit you want, from any time frame, and fantasy or Sci-Fi book you have ever read and take that force up against another player that has created their own force. That force could be a one miniature force of a giant city eating lizard, or a squad of super heroes, or perhaps a legion of undead! Scenarios, settings, number of models? That's all up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xhaos Theory is a scalable miniature wargame allowing players total control over size and setting. You can play a full out large scale battle, or a small skirmish with Xhaos Theory. Many battles have been fought with 7 miniatures on one side, and 20+ on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xhaos Theory is a turn based miniature war game simplified for younger gamers also for quick play. Complete customization of your own army and campaign system to advance your army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
