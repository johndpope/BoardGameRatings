			<description>A multi-player card game for librarians and teachers that teaches database search skills while students compete to stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Search &amp;amp; Destroy, every player starts with 4 cards from the Play Deck. On a turn, the player first draws 2 Keyword Cards and lays one down. They may then play up to 1 Action or Mod card, which may effect themselves or another player.  Next, the player searches the terms on their played card(s) in a library database. Finally they draw from the play deck to maintain 4 cards in their hand. Play then moves counter-clockwise.  Players are eliminated if their database search yields no results. The last player remaining wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box Components:&lt;br/&gt;64 Keyword Cards&lt;br/&gt;41 Mod &amp;amp; Action Cards (the Play Deck)&lt;br/&gt;6 Rule Cards&lt;br/&gt;4 blank Keyword Cards&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search &amp;amp; Destroy teaches the following skills:&lt;br/&gt;search string design&lt;br/&gt;keyword selection&lt;br/&gt;basic boolean searching&lt;br/&gt;faceting&lt;br/&gt;peer-review&lt;br/&gt;friendly competition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
