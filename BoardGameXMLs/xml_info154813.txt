							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Far Away Land RPG Creatures: Vol. I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the quirky and bizarre world of Far Away Land. This is a world where the one-eyed zoordrooz wear red booty shorts and hunt infidels, where undead legions take commands from lich masters, where a cataclysmic event of the past has sewn together the various realms of creation to a forge a nexus point on a fantasy world known as Far Away Land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far Away Land is a rules-lite fantasy role-playing game that uses six-sided dice. It mixes fantasy, sci-fi, and apocalyptic elements to create an immersive and rich world full of history and adventure. It is easy to learn and a perfect game for new (young) gamers as well as veteran gamers. All of the Far Away Land books contain colorful artwork, humor, and rules that allow gamers and GMs to pick and choose the level of crunch they want in their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book lists over seventy Far Away Land creatures, monsters, and races. It is an essential part of any campaign as it not only features a boatload of ready made encounters, but also the rules to create your own monsters from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
