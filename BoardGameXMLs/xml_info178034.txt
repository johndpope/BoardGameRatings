							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Plains: A Solitaire Game of Indian Fighting on the Southwestern Plains (1865-1890).</name>
									
			<description>BACKGROUND: SAVAGE PLAINS is semi-historical simulation of the American Indian Wars on the Southern Plains from 1865 to 1890. The Game begins after the American Civil War and the re-United States is ready to expand its influence and power. The US feels its Manifest Destiny is to expand and annex the Territories separating the Eastern States and California. In order to accomplish this, they must attempt to bring peace and stability to the region by &amp;ldquo;Pacifying&amp;rdquo; the Indian Tribes living there. This can be accomplished either through military victories or through diplomatic Peace Treaties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the US Army Forces on the Frontier of the Southern Plains. The Player&amp;rsquo;s Objective is to pacify the Indian Territories in the region in order to make it safe to build US Settlements, as well as, the Transcontinental Railroad. The Player must attempt to build a number of US Settlements with a total Settlement Value (SV) of at least 41 by the end of the Turn in which the last Campaign Card is Played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES: SAVAGE PLAINS features many colorful game counters including US Cavalry, US Infantry, US Artillery and Gatling Guns, Sioux, Cheyenne, Comanche and Apache Indian Units. Counters, also, include individual US and Indian Heroes and Scouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAVAGE PLAINS can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
