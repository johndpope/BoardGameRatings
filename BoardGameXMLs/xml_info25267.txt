			<description>The game &amp;quot;Quadriga&amp;quot; was included in Spielbox 4/81 and is the first game of the &amp;quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It depicts the chariot races in ancient Rome. Up to 8 teams race around the track twice to determine victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several obstacles and narrow curves make it difficult to drive the chariots. Therefore, accidents are likely to occur and since completely destroyed chariots stay on the track where eliminated, the difficulties even rise further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included to the game is an additional scenario. It is based on the novel &amp;quot;Sagare&amp;quot; from Tanith Lee and it includes many aspects from that novel: earth, air, water and fire obstacles as well as furious archers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
