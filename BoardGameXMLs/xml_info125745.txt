							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blackhandâ€™s Street Weapons 2057</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knives. Pistols. Swords. Tasers. Clubs. Shotguns. Whips. Missile launchers. Crossbows. Rifles. Ammo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who needs any of &amp;rsquo;em anymore, anyway? A good shadowrun is one in which you don&amp;rsquo;t have to fire a shot, they tell you these days. The old-timers still tell stories of how they used to go in &amp;ldquo;guns a-blazin&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; and get away with it, but the new generation of runners knows better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or so they think. There are times when absolutely nothing is going to save you, except for a good weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And this is where Blackhand&amp;rsquo;s book comes into the picture. It contains 293 melee weapons, firearms, and a few hard to classify gadgets, any one of which can mean the difference between living and dying to a shadowrunner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter what end of the weapon they&amp;rsquo;re on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Plastic Warriors book contains all the weapons from the Cyberpunk 2020 sourcebook, but with their statistics and peculiarities converted to Shadowrun. If you need a weapon for some reason, look no further than this book&amp;mdash;there&amp;rsquo;s something in it for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
