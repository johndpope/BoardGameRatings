			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; IN BETA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is in OPEN/CLOSED Beta and has not been fully released yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RimWorld follows three survivors from a crashed space liner as they build a colony on a frontier world at the rim of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;RimWorld is designed as a story generator. It's not about winning and losing - it's about the drama, tragedy, and comedy that goes on in your colony.To keep things interesting, the game creates events like pirate raids, trader arrivals, and storms. But these events aren't random. RimWorld uses an AI Storyteller (modeled after the AI Director from Left 4 Dead) who analyzes your situation and decides which event she thinks will make the best story. There are several storytellers to choose from:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cassandra Classic aims to create a rising curve of tension over the course of the game. Early on, the most dangerous thing she'll do is send a psychotic squirrel after you. Later on, bands of scavengers will arrive. In the late game, look forward to combined-arms attacks from mercenaries mixed with lightning storms and crop blights. If you want a traditional tension and difficulty curve, go with Cassandra.&lt;br/&gt;    Phoebe Friendly is for the player who just wants to build and watch a colony grow. She'll occasionally create minor disasters, but nothing that would threaten the existence of the colony. If you want a more relaxing game about growth and success, choose Phoebe.&lt;br/&gt;    Randy Random follows no rules. He may give you some amazing stroke of luck, like a trader selling an advanced weapon for a low price or a group of helpful immigrants, followed by a near-unbeatable pirate attack combined with an electrical fire. If you think losing is fun, you might want to try Randy.&lt;br/&gt;There might be other storytellers in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designers put special effort into tactics and psychology.&lt;br/&gt;Tactics:&lt;br/&gt;RimWorld uses an engine that was originally developed to power a tactical sim similar to Jagged Alliance 2. This means it has a lot of features designed to make small-team firefights interesting. For example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a cover system that models low cover and leaning around corners.&lt;br/&gt;    There's a really nuanced algorithm for determining and reporting hit chances based on distance, skill, weapon, lighting, angle, and cover.&lt;br/&gt;    Weapons have some pretty deep stats.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Psychology&lt;br/&gt;People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, and many other situations. You can inspect a character's psychology at any time to see what they're feeling and why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User addition: The game has been funded with Kickstarter. It is already playable, further content will be added for a full version. (4/14)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
