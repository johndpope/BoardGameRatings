							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beyond The Wicked Maze: Wretched Encounters</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond The Wicked Maze: Wretched Encounters provides a wealth of goodies for the Exiles Of The Wicked Maze 1 player game. Though the original map and adventure setting may be used, this product provides a wealth of new maze maps and side adventures (provided in the optional rules). The highlight of this product, however, are twenty new foes that may be used alone or alongside of the original foes. Furthermore, these foes can also be used alongside the foes provided in Dark Lust, the first Exiles expansion. Charts are provided for allowing an easy means of combining such foe lists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to foes, optional adventures, and maps are new special items and a new alchemical substance. These entries are directly connected to the new foes and do not come with an accompanying chart due to their presence in the game being limited to a specific foe encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
