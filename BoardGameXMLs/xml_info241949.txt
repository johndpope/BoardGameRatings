							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grenadier (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expand your IF games for 5e D&amp;amp;D with the new class, the Grenadier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grenadiers are individuals wholly devoted to explosions and destruction. They spend their days designing and crafting grenades of different types, with their overall goal to design a grenade more destructive and more beloved than any that have gone before it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, Grenadiers are former soldiers, from where they got their first taste of explosives and grenades. Having left the military, they were unable to also leave behind their taste for destruction. And they soon acquire or build a demolitions kit, and the rest is explosive. In the modern era, with vaporizers and plasma rays, there isn't much use for demolitions experts outside of the military. Except out on the frontier planets, that is, where someone who can blow stuff real damn good never goes out of style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
