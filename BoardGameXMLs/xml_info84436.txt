							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prestige Class Creation Cookbook</name>
									
			<description>Prestige Classes are an essential part of D20, and one of the most exciting features for players to mull over when planning their characters. But the prestige classes you can find in a book aren&amp;rsquo;t always exactly what a player or a GM thinks fits in with a character concept, or campaign world. Enter the Prestige Class Creation Cookbook - intended as a guideline for creating brand new prestige classes. Creating a Prestige Class is great fun for many GMs, but it can also be a fun event for players. Giving players some game background, and then turning them loose with this book can produce some interesting and highly tailored results, allowing players to fulfill their unique character ideas.&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Building Prestige Classes&lt;br/&gt;     Starting Out&lt;br/&gt;     Considerations for Class Features&lt;br/&gt;     Flavor&lt;br/&gt;     What to Watch Out For&lt;br/&gt;     Preset Class Features&lt;br/&gt;     Arcane and Divine Features&lt;br/&gt;     Holy Abilities&lt;br/&gt;     Warrior Abilities&lt;br/&gt;     Special Attack Focus&lt;br/&gt;     Much Ado About Rogues&lt;br/&gt;     Bardic Class Features&lt;br/&gt;     Monk Features&lt;br/&gt;     Druidic and Nature Abilities&lt;br/&gt;     Defensive Abilities&lt;br/&gt;     Specific Skill Features&lt;br/&gt;     Features Derived from Spells&lt;br/&gt;     Comparing the Standard Prestige Classes&lt;br/&gt;     Master Table of Spell converted to point cost&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
