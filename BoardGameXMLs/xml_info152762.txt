			<description>From the inlay (Play It Again Sam 18 compilation):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The top-hit racing-car simulation. Race your gleaming E-Type over 4 different circuits, with numerous hazards including roadworks, rocks, oil spills and, of course, the other cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an Outrun-style game where the objective is to race to the end of a stage within a time limit. There are five stages, Broads, Arctic, Sahara, Africa and Brazil of increasing length from 6 to 18 miles. These can be selected individually, or raced consecutively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most obstacles must be avoided, but warning triangles score extra points, and hitting policemen award a time bonus (in some cases this may be necessary in order to complete the stage). Extra points are also awarded for the time left when completing a stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also allows the user to select a skill level. A higher skill level increases the score achieved for the distance covered, however it reduces the number of crashes the car can survive before being wrecked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Author: Gordon J. Key&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
