			<description>This game uses 24 checkers with 12 in each color and a checker board or a 6 by 6 grid as the game only uses the middle 36 squares of a typical 8 by 8 checker board.  Each player places his checkers in the back row of his side of the board.  The game turns alternate between the two players.  The number of checkers in a stack determines the distance that a stack may move.  Moves can be made in any of the eight corresponding directions and cannot be blocked by stacks situated in the path of the move.  All moves are done in a straight line unless the move would extend through 6 by 6 grid formation, in which case the move is reflected by the edge of the 6 by 6 grid like a mirror.  A stack belongs to the player whose piece is on top.  It might be noted that the arrangement and order of the pieces within a stack can never be altered except by continued stacking.  Captured stacks always remain on the board and become part of the stack must be included in the count for the new movement distance.  A player may use his turn to place a stack on top of another one of his own stacks.  During a turn a player has the option of moving one of his stacks or only its top portion which may include any number of pieces and may leave behind a stack also composed of any number of pieces.  The height of the new divided stack determines the new movement distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2005, the &amp;quot;Too-Tall Rule&amp;quot; or variant was introduced.  This rule states that at the beginning of a turn that any player's stacks taller than four pieces must be divided.  Failure to comply with this rule causes a player to lose a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.stevecobb.com/Death%20Stacks%20--%20game%20instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.stevecobb.com/Death%20Stacks%20--%20game%20instru...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Stacks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Stacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
