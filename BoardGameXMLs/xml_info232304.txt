							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LazerKnight</name>
									
			<description>LazerKnight is a solo chess variant with a razor sharp edge. You are the LazerKnight! Your whole regiment was slaughtered in a brutal ambush and you are the sole survivor. Sworn to avenge your dead comrades, you sneak through the enemies' territory to defeat them single-handedly. Or at least take as many of them with you as you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you take on the role of a single knight chess piece which is going against a full set of opposing chess pieces. Your goal is to take out the enemy king and stay alive. To pull this off against all odds, you have the ability to hide out in black squares, gathering strategy tokens, which allow you to every once in a while break from your cover and strike out with multiple moves at once! But don't wait too long, because the enemy is not standing still and will try to encircle you, until its checkmate for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LazerKnight is a 1-page-rule ready to play solo chess game, specifically designed for the Boardgamegeek Solitaire Print and Play Contest. All you need to play is a chess board, chess pieces, 2 eight-sided dice and 5 tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
