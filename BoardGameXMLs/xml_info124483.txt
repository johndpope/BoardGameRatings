			<description>Deep within the forest, there live two witches: the beautiful marsh witch and the ugly forest witch. The two are engaged in a deadly war for supremacy. One day, the beautiful marsh witch encounters the legendary &amp;quot;one hundred cavalry&amp;quot;, whom she then used magic summoned into the battle, in hope of gaining the upper hand against her rival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There won't be a &amp;quot;game over&amp;quot; even if the player is slain, since the character in control is an undead, however, any item that the player has been collected up until that point will be lost. The player can also visit towns to accept quests from the residents. Alternately, the player can also refuse requests, and even able to attack residents of the town, although doing so will antagonize them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Witch and The Hundred Knights&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
