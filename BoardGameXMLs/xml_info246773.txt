							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Micro Brick Battle</name>
									
			<description>Micro Brick Battle is a fast-paced table top strategy game using 1:120 scale models built with LEGO bricks. It is a turn-based game for two players (or teams) which continues until one side has completely destroyed the forces of the other (or otherwise completed an objective as set out in a given scenario). This book is intended to provide the basic rules for land-based armored combat. It also provides building instructions and game stats for many of the most commonly used armored vehicles of WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future expansions of the Micro Brick Battle system will include aerial combat, additional armored vehicles, and Campaign Modules for specific historic battles. We also plan to host Micro Brick Battle tournaments at events around the country starting in mid-2017. This will coincide with the release of our companion card game Bricks of War, now in development process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from the basic game rules, the bulk of this book is devoted to building instructions for the basic game piece models. This includes a short section with tips for acquiring the necessary LEGO pieces and building tips to help you complete your models. The composition of your Micro Brick Battle armies are completely up to you; whether you want to recreate historic battles or build an armored juggernaut of your own design. Brickmania will be releasing various game piece mini kits which will be compatible with the Micro Brick Battle system. These will have the added bonus of including the corresponding Bricks of War card, which will be necessary for use in the official tournament play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes instructions to build game piece models for 44 different armored vehicle from WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes instructions for building the following armored vehicles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;France:&lt;br/&gt;Renault Ft-17&lt;br/&gt;Renault R35&lt;br/&gt;Char B1 Bis&lt;br/&gt;Sumoa S35&lt;br/&gt;Sumoa S40 (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan:&lt;br/&gt;Type 95&lt;br/&gt;Type 97&lt;br/&gt;Type 4 Ho-Ro (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Germany:&lt;br/&gt;Panzer II&lt;br/&gt;Panzer II Luchs&lt;br/&gt;Panzer III&lt;br/&gt;Panzer IV&lt;br/&gt;Panzer 38(t)&lt;br/&gt;Tiger I&lt;br/&gt;Panther&lt;br/&gt;StuG III&lt;br/&gt;Wespe (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great Britain:&lt;br/&gt;M3 Grant&lt;br/&gt;Churchill&lt;br/&gt;Firefly&lt;br/&gt;Matilda II&lt;br/&gt;Valentine&lt;br/&gt;Cromwell&lt;br/&gt;Archer&lt;br/&gt;Sexton (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Italy:&lt;br/&gt;Carro Armato L3/35&lt;br/&gt;Carro Armato P40&lt;br/&gt;Semovente da 90/53 (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;Semovente da 75/18 (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;Semovente da 105/25 (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soviet Union&lt;br/&gt;BT-7&lt;br/&gt;T-34/76&lt;br/&gt;KV-1&lt;br/&gt;Su-76 (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;Su-152 (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;Kv-2 (SPG)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;United States&lt;br/&gt;M3 Stuart&lt;br/&gt;M5 Stuart&lt;br/&gt;M3 Lee&lt;br/&gt;M4 Sherman&lt;br/&gt;M26 Pershing&lt;br/&gt;M10 Wolverine&lt;br/&gt;M18 Hellcat&lt;br/&gt;M7 Priest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
