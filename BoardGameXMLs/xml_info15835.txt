			<description>This is a simple children's matching game with a Sesame Street theme. Each player gets a gameboard depicting a location and a 3x3 grid with each space showing an item you might find there (for example, Cookie's Bakery has pictures of tasty things to eat). On your turn, pick up one picture token from the pile and check to see if the picture on the token matches one of the black and white pictures on your gameboard. If you have a match, place the token on the matching picture. If you don't have a match, you must offer the token to the other player to put on his or her gameboard. The first player to fill his or her gameboard with nine picture tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
