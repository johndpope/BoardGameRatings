			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEDIEVAL is an independently written and produced role playing game, strongly influenced by a medieval-European theme, and game play that is intuitive, gritty and fun. MEDIEVAL can be played with as few as two people, but the optimum group size is 4-6. MEDIEVAL uses a skill point-buy system, eschewing level and class restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system is unique, emphasizing strategic and tactical cooperation and planning, and allows players to customize characters&amp;rsquo; active offensive and defensive skills. With MEDIEVAL, no longer is combat static and confined to turn-based rounds, but unfolds dynamically and fluidly using a unique system of simultaneous resolution of outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEDIEVAL'S magic system also breaks the conventional mold of spell restrictions by level and class. Players choose and design any power they can imagine, adjusting the effectiveness of each power to suit a character&amp;rsquo;s needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
