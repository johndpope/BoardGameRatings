							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sons of a Mighty King</name>
									
			<description>The King is worried as a bunch of filthy, ruthless rebels have taken many of his castles. Fortunately, his two cunning sons come to rescue. Using the army, the workers and the money that the King happily provides they'll try to take back the lost territories and bring peace to the kingdom. They'll act independently, as they both want to impress their mighty father-king and who knows...he may be pleased enough, that he'll decide to step back and let their best son rule!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts ten turns. On each turn, three rebellious territories are revealed and players decide where to fight. Then they both do an action like hiring a worker, train an army, collect taxes or seek the king's help. Lastly, they can cede a previously gained territory to the king, they just have to secure it by granting army and workers too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The son that will bring the best territories back to the king, while keeping his army and finances in good shape, will win the king's endless favor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
