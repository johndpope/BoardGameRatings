			<description>A post-apocalyptic vehicular combat game for 2 to 8 players.  It uses the quick setup and rapid play of a card game and combines it with the tactile and visual strategy and excitement of a miniatures game.  Nothing needs to be written down during play, it's a great way to introduce younger card game players to the world of miniature gaming.  Gameplay is normally 15-30 minutes and most players will understand the rules after their first game.  How many wargames can fit all their rules on a single sheet of paper?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ScrapIron is 100% Zombie Free!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each use a miniature vehicle as their playing piece.  The game was designed around the popular Hot Wheels and Matchbox lines but can be easily adapted to any size vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose equipment from an Equipment Deck prior to the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action cards are chosen during the planning phase and placed face down.  Order if play is determined randomly and actions are then carried out in that order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When damage is dealt, cards of the Damage Deck are given to the target player.  Damage cards will either assign Structural Damage to the vehicle, 10 points and the car is out of the game, or cause special effects.  These effects could cause the car to spin out and face a random direction, cause the player to lose Action cards or otherwise harm the target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last car remains that player is the winner!  That did not take long, why not play again?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
