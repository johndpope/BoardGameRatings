			<description>Imagination is a party game of charades in which players compete vs. each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round one of the players becomes a game master. He draws two top cards of the deck and checks the number of the next top card (which is random from 1 to 10). Then he looks at the text lines (&amp;quot;tasks&amp;quot;) with this number and chooses a task from one of those cards. Next, he chooses an action how to explain the task to other players: to speak, to draw, or to perform. (The method of explanation becomes unavailable for this player till he uses all three methods in his text turns.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All other players tries to guess the task. The game master and the player who gives the correct answer both score 1 victory point, keeping one of the two task cards drawn by the game master. After that the next player becomes a game master, and so on. The player with the most number of cards is declared the winner at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;200 two-sided cards (with easy and difficult tasks on opposite sides) contain 4000 different tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
