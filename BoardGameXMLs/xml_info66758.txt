			<description>Subtitle: The Pasteurized, Processed, Star Wars-type Role-Playing Game Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jedi is an original RPG that used to be based on the Star Wars universe. It is simple, complete, and has been over 25 years in the making. Rules cover Character Creation, Aliens, Droids, Combat, Skills, Vehicles and starships (of all sizes), Force Powers and skills, World Creation, and much more. Uses 6-sided exclusively for simplicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is available for free - there may never be a charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After my game was pretty much done, which was before West End Games had the license, I started hawking it to different game publishers, and tried getting permission to do so from Lucasfilm and Kenner (the holder of the game &amp;amp; toy rights at the time). Neither would talk to me until I got permission from the other. As I continued to push, I got a &amp;ldquo;friendly&amp;rdquo; little cease-and-desist order (Included at the end of the book) that scared the bejeebeez out of me. So I ceased and desisted. Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Star Wars indicia are the property of, &amp;trade; and &amp;copy; by Lucasfilm, Ltd. Their use is an homage to the rights holder's creativity, and is not meant as a challenge to their ownership in any way, shape or form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
