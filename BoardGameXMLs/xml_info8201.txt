			<description>A game about a race around the world which is set at the end of the 19th century. In this game each player takes up one of the competing nations, and each nation sends a special steam-powered &amp;amp;quot;Walamob&amp;amp;quot; (Water-Land-Mobile) on the voyage around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action points are used to move your vehicle or to upgrade it. A vehicle may receive special movement equipment which makes it easier to move on certain types of terrain, but is may also get crew which might be helpful as well -- you can even obtain weaponry! A rightly timed Earth-Torpedo or a Rocket might slow the other down - enough to overtake him and to allow the player to take the lead himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
