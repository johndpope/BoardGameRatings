							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myriad: The Word Game</name>
									
			<description>In Myriad, each player has a board and a set of letter chips. The chips are placed on the boards to form words, with the score per letter being the number of letters in the word. Unusual features of the game include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     After playing a word to their own board, a player may place their letters on other players' boards to form words. Each player with letters in a word scores for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     When a word is formed that contains shorter words (e.g., KIN which contains IN), the shorter words are scored as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The center section of each board can be rotated to put the letters in different positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several levels of alternative rules are provided for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was sold in two and four-player sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
