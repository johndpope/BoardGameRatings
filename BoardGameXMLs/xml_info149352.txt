							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zebulon&#039;s Guide to the Frontier (Digitally Remastered)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My gaming group never used this supplement. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not entirely true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new races are a cool new addition to an already great game. The new frontier detail was incredibly valuable. The new gear was really cool after tiring of the old handful of things to be found in the frontier. The skill system in the old Star Frontiers game is built around solid frameworks that didn&amp;rsquo;t allow certain character concepts (&amp;ldquo;I want to be a stealthy assassin type, but don&amp;rsquo;t give a hoot about analyzing mineral samples!&amp;rdquo;), so the different skill list seemed like an interesting idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But we didn&amp;rsquo;t like the modified game mechanic. It was good, as it stood, but not for our sacred Star Frontiers. We liked the way things worked already. We had house-ruled a few things, and made decisions about how to handle this or that. For us to do all that over again didn&amp;rsquo;t wound like a very fun idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the new options, if implemented, made all the other existing published data no longer compatible. For example, what about the character statistics found in all supplements and adventure modules? What skills to THEY have?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So that is why I didn&amp;rsquo;t convert the original book to these rules and stick with them throughout. Since I liked the old rules, I figured everyone did. I was wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It turns out that as I distributed this file to friends and they distributed it to theirs... people started asking for Zebulon&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Frontier. Who am I to argue with the masses? I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Frankenstein too many times to ever want to anger a mob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here it is, in its original glory, reformatted and organized to make it more like today&amp;rsquo;s role-playing games. As I worked on this, I found that the new game mechanics are actually very sound. I like them. Use them if you&amp;rsquo;d prefer these, but just like the original Star Frontiers, I&amp;rsquo;ll only make rules and supplements for public consumption that rely on the original Star Frontiers game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
