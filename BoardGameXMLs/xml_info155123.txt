			<description>Phonetic Scrabble meets Apples-to-Apples! Pijin iz a gam ov fonetik speleng &amp;amp; a disarmingly fun new experience of words for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pijin is the world&amp;rsquo;s first spelling game of the spoken word. It's a hackable, expandable game that emphasizes the physical experience of communication. To play, you spell what you hear and only what you hear in pronunciation,  and you spell with phonemes. &amp;quot;Pigeon&amp;quot; is spelled /pijin/, &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; becomes /wurdz/, &amp;quot;spelling&amp;quot; is /speleng/, and so on.  Familiar terms sometimes look completely strange, but that's part of the fun as players explore and tinker with language itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no board used.  Each phoneme tile is worth one point.  The player with the most points wins. In Pijin Grid the object is to create a crossword-style matrix of intersecting words, one point for each tile in every word created by tile placement.  In Pijin Sprint players may choose to create either a list or an intersecting grid of 10 words that respond to a prompt, Action Card.  The grid may take longer but offers more scoring possibilities.  Pijin ships with one set of 52 Action Cards as the game's first &amp;quot;module,&amp;quot; but more modules of different themes are planned for release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
