							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">JUMBLE: 3 games in 1</name>
									
			<description>Originally sold as a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble exclusive, the 2008 incarnation of JUMBLE licensing comprises the following three modes of play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Word Spin-Off - A spin of the spinner dictates your challenge, and the sand timer keeps the heat on.  You have JUMBLE tokens with which you can buy hints or additional time.&lt;br/&gt;     Word Scramble - Race the sand timer to un-jumble the puzzles, trying to collect enough letters to spell a word.&lt;br/&gt;     Word Race - Race your pawn along a path, solving JUMBLEs along the way (under watch of the sand timer, of course).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
