							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Dictionary Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the box insert:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game where the scholar is not necessarily the winner. A game where wits provide for hilarity. The Great Dictionary Game is a fun-filled search for the definition of a word picked out of the dictionary and starting with one or more of the letters appearing on a card chosen at random. Proposed definitions can be absolutely accurate, a figment of the imagination, incoherent, plausible, misleading or humorous. The winner is the player with the highest score of points obtained either from his bets on accurate definitions or from votes of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
