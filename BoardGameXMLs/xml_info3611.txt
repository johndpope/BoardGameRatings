							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Backgammon 4</name>
									
			<description>A nice-looking variant for four players, by the same company that produced Four Player Chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture a &amp;quot;rounded square&amp;quot; with six backgammon points on each side of the square, then add three new points in each corner. The board is reversible, with traditional backgammon on the reverse side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regular backgammon rules apply for movement.  The setup is slightly different, since the points &amp;quot;farthest away&amp;quot; from your home court are used by another player, so those 2 stones start one unit closer to home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major change is direction - that all players in a three or four player game are moving clockwise.  Evidently there is no way to set up four players with two running clockwise and two running reverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are variants listed, including team play where two players can have stones resting on the same point.  For two players on this board, each gets two sets of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game differs from Quadragammon in that there are four complete sets of stones and the board has additional points printed in the corners.  And its main difference, the all-clockwise movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents - reversible board (4-fold), 4 sets of stones, 2 dice (!) and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
