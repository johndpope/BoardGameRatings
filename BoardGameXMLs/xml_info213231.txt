							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Jung Pirates Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When years passed without word of the Jung, they were considered lost, their return under the mon of the giant squid surprised everyone. They have reaped what they need from the traders on the seas of the Jwar Isles, forcing the Shiho to label them pirates. Their fleets are faster and their knowledge of the Isles&amp;rsquo; waters are unparalleled by all but perhaps the Carp clan, allowing them to evade the larger, less experienced junks of the Prefecture. Long years away from the courts of the Jwar Isles have left the Jung rough around the edges but they have not forgotten their ancestry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
