							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TKKG: Der Schatz im Teufelsmoor</name>
									
			<description>The TKKG - the gang, which consists of the kids Tim, Karl, Kloesschen and Gabi - are looking for a stolen treasure, hidden in the &amp;quot;Teufelsmoor&amp;quot; by the burglars. While TKKG tries to find the treasure as soon as possible, the burglars try to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a board, divided into several bigger and smaller areas, 8 cardboard figures (4 for each team), 33 cards and 2 dice, one normal, one showing the direction. In the beginning the burglar player chooses one of the fields on the board and writes it down: here the treasure is hidden. The aim of TKKG is to find it until the end of the game. In his/her turn the players can move on the board according to the dice result rolled. If the player lands on a &amp;quot;star&amp;quot;-field, (s)he is entitled to draw a card. The TKKG-player can ask a question, depending on the kind of question on the card, which the Burglar-player has to answer with yes or no. If the Burglar-player draws a card it is just put on the discard pile. Apart from questions regarding the whereabout of the treasure, there are also luck-cards, which allows the player to move a certain amount of steps on the board. If one player figure moves on a field, where an opponent stands, the opponent is taken hostage. If both players have hostages they can make an exchange, if the parties agree.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no cards left. The TKKG-player then has to choose a field, where he thinks the treasure is. If he is right he wins, otherwise the Burglar-player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was later re-released under the name Piratenschatz with a new topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
