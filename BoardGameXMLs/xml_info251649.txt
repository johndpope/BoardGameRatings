							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Red Skies: Mitsubishi A6-M5 Zero Squadron</name>
									
			<description>This is an expansion set for the WWII aircraft miniatures game Blood Red Skies by Warlord Games and designed by Andy Chambers.  This expansion includes a squadron of Japanese Mitsubishi A6-M5 Zero fighters and additional accessories to add to the core game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components included in this expansion are:&lt;br/&gt;6 Mitsubishi A6M5 Zero Fighters&lt;br/&gt;6 Advantage Flying Bases&lt;br/&gt;1 Aircraft Card&lt;br/&gt;7 Aircraft Trait Cards&lt;br/&gt;6 Double-sided Pilot Skill Discs&lt;br/&gt;1 Aircraft Markings Sticker Sheet&lt;br/&gt;3 Action Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mitsubishi A6M Zero was a fast, modern fighter, but had no armour for the pilot. When the Zero was in the hands of aggressive and well-trained pilots this weakness was rarely apparent. The A6-M5 model Zero featured improved engine, armament and protection, although the latter remained inadequate compared to other combat aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
