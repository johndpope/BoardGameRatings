			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Babies is a humorous character building card and dice game. The aim of the game is to get the most XP points, by completing quests which involves killing zombies, collecting items and building your characters stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your Hero - Improve on your skills and gain items to help you complete quests and defeat zombies.&lt;br/&gt;Complete Quests - Choose to fight a zombie or choose a quest to find items and build on your 3 stats, to make future questing easier&lt;br/&gt;Take a Nap - Too scared to venture forth? Regain your health or energy before embarking on your next quest.&lt;br/&gt;Player Interaction - Use special cards to help yourself or make life harder for your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;Each quest requests you to complete a set to skill tests by rolling dice to test your characters stats individually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You roll the number of dice equal to your characters stat that matches the test requirement on the Quest card. Get that number of symbols on your dice and you get the rewards listed at the bottom of the card, these can be an Item, an increase to your characters stats or XP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you fail you might lose some stats you gained earlier in the game or health or energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quest cards include a small funny story which players can choose to read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However beware the other players might have a trick or two up their sleeve to leave you behind and fall prey to the many zombies wondering the nursery. Special cards spice up the game play and allow you to affect others turns making them weaker or help yourself overcome obstacles in your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each game a random Boss card will appear, all other quests will disappear and players will have to fight the Boss to the death to survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completing quests and defeating zombies you keep the card and place it under your hero building your stats and XP. On the left hand side of the Hero card there are XP rewards to work towards. Be warned that if you fail to complete a quest or defeat a zombie you may need to loose a card decreasing one of your stats and any other benefits it gives!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
