			<description>D6 Shooter is a fast paced western themed press your luck dice &amp;amp; card game for 2-4 players. Take on the roll of Bounty Hunter and gain a good reputation by hunting down &amp;amp; capturing wanted bandits that plague a small town. Gather enough &amp;quot;Rep&amp;quot; points to work your way from Bounty Hunter all the way to Marshall. Better hurry, you are not the only one after the job!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes over 100 game cards, 10 General Store cards &amp;amp; 6 custom shooter dice. On each player's turn, they flip over a card to hunt for a wanted bandit.  Each bandit has a sequence of suit symbols (heart, diamond, spade &amp;amp; club).  The tougher the bandit the more suit symbols will appear.  The player can roll and re-roll the 6 dice up to 3 times to try to capture the bandit by matching these symbol.  Jokers are wild and can be used as any suit. Skulls, if rolled, render the die out of play.  Once captured you can stop &amp;amp; collect the bandit by moving them into you jail, or you may press your luck &amp;amp; try to grab more bandits.  If you decide to continue on your hunt you get to re-roll all of your dice, minus any skulls previously rolled, for three more chances to capture the new bandit.  Lose any bandit on your turn &amp;amp; you lose ALL the bandits collected this round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each bandit has a reward amount for their capture as well as 1 to 2 reputation points to put towards your promotions. Higher ranks gain the ability to re-roll a certain number of skull dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reward money can be traded in for General Store cards which can help you on your journey or played to hinder another player's. But choose wisely, spending your reward money will sacrifice the Rep you have gained for those bandits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game deck also contains event cards.  Some events award you with General Store cards by completing a rolling task. Other events may cause you to lose the bandits you are wrangling, or have your previously captured bandits escape from your jail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first player to be promoted to Marshall to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think you have what it takes to win the west? Then roll into D6 Shooter! Yeee-haaw!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
