			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An RPG of Mysterious Drifters and Risky Coin Flips&lt;br/&gt;A non-linear, coin-based story game focusing on shady drifters who lead a dramatic, nomadic, dangerous life&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clink is a tabletop RPG about drifters, the creeds that bring them together, and the history that drives them apart. Tell a story inspired by spaghetti westerns, ronin tales, and shows like Firefly or Supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're taking down the Crimson Dusk gang, uncovering the Oracle's mysterious treasure, or saving your partner from the lawbot's gallows, you'll have to expose the secrets of your past to overcome the dangers of the present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clink tells a non-linear story, crisscrossing between your characters' flashbacks and the risky business of the day. It's a flexible system that can support nearly any setting, so long as there's room for folks who aim to misbehave (six-shooters and door-kickin's encouraged too).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
