			<description>Old Lady in a Shoe is a well-presented, strongly-boxed game for very young children, the winning of which depends almost entirely on chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of a plastic boot on top of which is placed a plastic roof with a chimney; three square cards &amp;mdash; one marked Swimming pool, another Play&amp;not;ground and the third equipped with a spinner and divided into eight segments, two of which are marked Swimming pool, two Playground and the other four with a picture of the boot house; and 16 play children in four differently coloured sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is that each player should collect his four play children either on the Playground or in the Swimming pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player spins the spinner in turn and moves one of his play children as directed &amp;mdash; either down the chimney or to the Playground or the Swimming pool. One of three things can happen to a play child dropped down the chimney &amp;mdash; it can come out on one side of the boot into the Playground, on the other side into the Swimmjng pool or it can remain inside the boot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A child who spins Playground or Swimming pool can use his turn to move a play child from one play area to another. The winner is the player to get most play children on to one area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
