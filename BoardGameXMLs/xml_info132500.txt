							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: The Death Marshals â€“ Lady Justice Box Set</name>
									
			<description>This box set adds the Death Marshals to the universe of Malifaux. This crew includes Lady Justice (leader), the Judge, and 3 Death Marshals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactica wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Justice is one of the most powerful close-combat fighters in the game. Every opponent dreads facing her Judgement in Melee as her greatsword is capable of felling most with a single swing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Justice (or &amp;quot;L.J.&amp;quot; to her close friends) often activates before her crew to inspire them to follow and act with greater passion. She is a true inspiration, very straightforward and quite powerful, making her both an easy Master for new players to use and learn the game while maintaining such power and effectiveness that she is still feared by even veteran players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;L.J.&amp;quot; is one of the only guild Masters that is beloved by the people. Her Crew, despite its secrecy and mystery, share this light. When hunting the filth that has encroached upon Malifaux, she is commonly accompanied by the Judge, and three Death Marshals. The Crew that comes in her starter set is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Justice (Cache 4)&lt;br/&gt;3 Death Marshals (4-ss a piece [total of 12-ss])&lt;br/&gt;The Judge (7-ss)&lt;br/&gt;TOTAL = 19-ss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This encourages players to look to expand quickly as if you play a standard game (25-ss) with this box set alone, you will be forced to burn 2 Soulstones (i.e. 25-19 = 6-Stones remaining. L.J. bring a Cache of 4-Stones. The max number of Soulstones you can bring at a standard game is only 8, meaning you will have to lose 2 of the 10 Soulstones you have). To avoid doing this, pick up the Scales of Justice, or a different 2-stone Totem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
