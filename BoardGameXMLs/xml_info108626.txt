			<description>Zero-Sum is an abstract strategy, tile-laying, area control game for 2, played with dominoes and chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns laying down dominoes and manipulating the playing surface to gain points by the end of their 13th turn. The player with the highest score wins. But that would be too simple... too bland. So to change things up, every turn you give your opponent points as you're giving yourself points. Strategy reigns supreme here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
