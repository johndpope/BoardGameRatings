							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures Adventure Module DK1: Death Fog</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road to adventure had left you in the wilds for many days. Now, short on rations and in need of a good rest under a roof, the signs of a settlement are a welcome sight. As you pass the recently sown fields and draw closer to the village, there are signs that all is not well. Doors hang askew, shutters bang in the breeze, but of the inhabitants there is no sight nor sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bell that cannot ring, that must not ring, has tolled its deathly knell and the world of the living now belongs to the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Death Knell Apocalypse has begun! Can your characters survive the undead apocalypse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Fog is the first adventure in the new Death Knell Apocalypse campaign. The module includes introductory and setup information, an Adventure Record with background, start and objective information, 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards, 18 Treasure cards and 9 Great Hall cards. Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, Death Fog can be played solo or with a group, with or without a GM. The adventure is highly re-playable and compatible with other Universal Adventures cards. In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the Adventure Modules in the Universal Adventures line, this adventure is a new, simple way to play fantasy adventures. The organization and presentation of the adventures allows for quick setup, quick play and gives you the ability to focus on the action and &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; while leaving you the option to include tactical action and combat if you desire. Enter a new and deadly world of adventure. Gather your heroes and try to survive the Death Knell Apocalypse beginning with Death Fog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
