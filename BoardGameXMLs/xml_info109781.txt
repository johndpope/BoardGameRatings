			<description>In 1822 Brazil had become independent of the Kingdom of Portugal, but in 1825 the United Provinces of the River Plate challenged the new Empire, supporting the separatist movement of the Province of Cisplatina. Dom Pedro I do not hesitate and sent his powerful navy to defeat the rebels and faced his first War on the Continent! During three years, the armed forces of the two most powerful South American countries met in the War of Cisplatina!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cisplatina&amp;quot; is a board game for 2-3 players created by Julio Trois, whose theme is the War of Independence of the Uruguay. For 10 rounds, the armies of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguayan rebels waging battles for control of the Uruguayan territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cisplatina&amp;quot; is a tactical game, where military strategy is very important. Each player must organize his troops, composed of tiles of infantry, cavalry, artillery and ships. The movement is point to point, and the clashes follow the style of the best wargames, using dices and tables, for the resolution of battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
