							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Block 2 Block</name>
									
			<description>Block 2 Block was designed with players and customization in mind. There are many variant rule sets which make the game a new yet familiar experience. We invite you to come join the community of players and enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to determine how many blocks they can place on tiles at various tiers. As the tiles are revealed and claimed, new tiers worth more points open up and players can start revealing and claiming tiles there. Different tiles have different powers, some let you remove blocks from other tiles, some remove tiles completely, and some move or switch tiles in different tiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to accrue the most points, through skillful use of tile powers, wise investments, and some luck with the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
