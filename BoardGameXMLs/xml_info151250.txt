			<description>You and your friends have sneaked onto the Johnson's property, and now it's time to TP their trees!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a picture mat with a Tree on it, and a complete deck of TP/Hazard cards.  Your goal is to TP as much of the tree as possible before the cops show up, while dealing with Hazards which will remove your TP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Deck contains 2 complete games; 2 Play mats and 2 complete decks of cards with different colored backs to help identify which deck they belong to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solitaire (using 1 deck and 1 Mat), or versus; each player using a mat, combining the decks into 1 big deck, and playing the Hazards on each other!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three different color sets are available, allowing up to 6 miscreants to be TP'ing the Johnson's trees at once!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
