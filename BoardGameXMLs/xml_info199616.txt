							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Specimens in Centralia (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ms. Grey that hired you for this job didn't give a lot of details, but the place you're headed to has been off the proverbial map for over a century now, a patch of forsaken wilderness called Centralia. Reading over the details of what you're after again, you hear something distinctly unnatural from outside the vehicle&amp;mdash;the sound of throttling motorcycles and a few whooping hollers. Looking out the window nearly gets your head blown off as a mutant freak on a low-rider blasts at the van with a beat up revolver, dropping back so another biker can take a clean shot just as your driver starts to weave on the road!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specimens in Centralia is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible adventure in the world of Hypercorps 2099. The module begins with the operators (the PCs) en route to Centralia's coal mines, the sight of a fire raging since 1962. Within is their quarry, but how they take it down and bring it back to Pittsburgh plays a large role with how much they'll get paid!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this adventure is ideal for a party of four operators of 3rd-4th level (hyper score 3), it is also suitable for regular PCs of 7th-8th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside Specimens in Centralia you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Cover artwork by Sara Shijo, including a full-color display on the interior!&lt;br/&gt;    Scene illustration and character illustrations by Rollin Kunz!&lt;br/&gt;    Character artwork from Hypercorps 2099 by professional illustrator Nathanael Batchelor!&lt;br/&gt;    A new piece of cybertechnology for adventurous operators: hydraulic springheels!&lt;br/&gt;    Statistics for an armored van, a motorcycle, and the party's driver!&lt;br/&gt;    Four hyper monsters: the Giganot biker, Giganot tough, Skryrgrard the hyper-drake, and a lethal Ms. Grey!&lt;br/&gt;    Two maps (Badlands Roadway and Mines of Centralia), including both GM and Player versions!&lt;br/&gt;    Four pre-generated PCs made using the Hyper Score system: Cripple Beast, Improv, Nightmare Fist, and Warp!&lt;br/&gt;    A brief primer on the Hyper Score rules for players new to Hypercorps 2099!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
