			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Ancients&amp;rsquo; movies and literature, undead were often created by magic, curses, or other supernatural phenomena. The hideous and terrifying creatures now stalking the wastelands are closer to another theme from the ancestors&amp;rsquo; popular culture: technology run amuck, the escaped infectious creations of mad scientists. But the Ancient biotech engineers were not usually mad, and the infections did not escape. Instead, it was much, much worse: undead were born as nanite terror weapons, and intentionally used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expanded issue of Wisdom from the Wastelands contains 25 fully described and stat&amp;rsquo;ed horrifying undead monsters created through a combination of technology and biology, and discusses their general traits; transmission, incubation, and treatment; and place in the post-apocalyptic world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
