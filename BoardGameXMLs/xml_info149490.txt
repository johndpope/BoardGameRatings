			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounters in the Northlands is a collection of adventures and encounters for use with the (free) Age of Shadow fantasy role-playing game. Within its pages you will find the following four scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enchanted Forest&lt;br/&gt;The Enchanted Forest covers rules for traversing areas of accursed woodland, and features a number of different (and often treacherous) encounters that can be had within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shadowstone&lt;br/&gt;A traditional style of adventure that pits the adventurers against fearsome undead creatures in a dungeon-style encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aleglin &amp;amp; Elmina&lt;br/&gt;This is a scenario in which an elven lord has returned home after long years of imprisonment, only to discover that agents of the Enemy have proceeded him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathgar Ruins&lt;br/&gt;Mathgar Ruins is not an adventure in an of itself, but rather a fully detailed encounter location that the GM can tailor to his/her own quests and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in this product are a number of VTT maps (scaled at 50 pixels per square), as well as miniatures-scaled *battle-maps, for most of the encounter locations found within this booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note that these battle-maps are not intended to be comparible to high resolution dungeon tiles, but rather a simple and effective way of transforming the maps from this booklet into miniatures scaled battlemats (should the need arise).)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
