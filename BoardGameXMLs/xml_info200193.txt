			<description>From DriveThruRPG item description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contrapposto is a storytelling game about planning an art heist, designed to be played discreetly in an actual art museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-5 players take on the roles of a team of amateur thieves hired to obtain a work of art. All players work together to identify which piece of art they&amp;rsquo;re after and plan how to steal it while balancing the team&amp;rsquo;s odd assortment of skills &amp;amp; hangups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In about an hour and a half, the team will case the joint, plan their caper &amp;amp; try to convince each other that this will work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if the group can tolerate each other long enough to complete their scheme, it just might!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contrapposto is part improv comedy and part exercise in teamwork, with a healthy respect for art &amp;amp; museums thrown in. Don't worry: no actual laws should be broken while playing! It's largely a fun way to visit an art museum with a group of friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The phases of the game are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introductions - We&amp;rsquo;ll draw cards that assign us aspects our characters. Then we'll go around the circle, introducing ourselves in character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Casing the Joint - We&amp;rsquo;ll draw one shared card describing the work of art we&amp;rsquo;re meant to steal. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll move through the museum, debating which piece that card refers to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning - We&amp;rsquo;ll come up with a nice, logical, easy-does-it, can&amp;rsquo;t-go-wrong plan to steal the art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rehearsal - When it comes to executing a heist smoothly, you can&amp;rsquo;t just wing it. We&amp;rsquo;ll need to discretely rehearse the plan without rousing any suspicion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You in? - After the rehearsal, we&amp;rsquo;ll have a chance to vote out any Rats in the crew and try to convince each other that this will work&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aftermath - We&amp;rsquo;ll all play a Followthrough card to show what we do on the day of the heist. If we haven&amp;rsquo;t been betrayed, we&amp;rsquo;ll tally up our scores to see if we got away with it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
