			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pickles' Pig Tales players in the game will be creating and retelling a story from memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you roll the die and move Pickles the Pig closer to his goal of Castle Feastalot. If you land on a blank space you draw a card from the deck. After drawing you retell the story in order from the beginning and then add a sentence to the end using your cards picture and set the card in front of you. There are also a few special spaces that cause parts of the story to be changed or lost all together. If you make a mistake with the story or tell it out of order you will lose the card you just drew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the person with the most cards in front of them when Pickles reaches the castle to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help Pickles make his way to the castle by remembering - and building upon - a fun story! The new game of storytelling, imagination and creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Language Development, Creativity and Memory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
