							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Friedensfahrt</name>
									
			<description>Die Friedensfahrt (aka &amp;quot;Course de la Paix&amp;quot;) was the most important cycling race behind the iron curtain. It started in 1948 (and is still running: in 2006 it was the 58th edition, though the importance of the race is much lesser, and it is not run by national teams anymore). Of course, the race needed a companion board game! The game can be played with a maximum of 6 players and features twelve cards with portraits of the winners of the first 12 editions of the race and the name of the 12 stages. First card features two riders since the first edition of the Friedensfahrt was split in two legs, so there were two winners. The board shows a track from Prague via Warszawa to Berlin. He who scores best over all the stages wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
