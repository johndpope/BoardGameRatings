							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leaving Solace Part 1: Taking Down the Crowleys</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wexler doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like most people. Especially not these days. His hair is entirely silver and he wears it in a distinct &amp;ldquo;high and tight&amp;rdquo;. Most people no longer bother with personal grooming these days, but between his hair and his crisp, clean-shaven face, Wexler definitely stands out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some of you may know me, some of you may not. I&amp;rsquo;ve had dealings with the folks here in Solace Valley, both good and bad. I definitely count the Roughnecks among the good, and the Crowleys among the bad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What most of you don&amp;rsquo;t know is that I&amp;rsquo;m a Lieutenant Commander in the US Navy, serving on the USS Toledo, currently parked off the eastern shore of the US. It&amp;rsquo;s a special operations submarine. Normally we try not to get involved, but things have changed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You might have noticed that the number of zombies on the road is increasing. That&amp;rsquo;s because there&amp;rsquo;s another wave heading south from New York. Ten thousand zombies, according to our intelligence. For those who were here for the last wave, it almost wiped out the whole valley, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t half the size of this one. Put simply, my Commander thinks it&amp;rsquo;s time to evacuate Solace Valley.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have a new home in mind but taking it won&amp;rsquo;t be easy: Ellis Island. In the last days, before the government fell, we set up a hospital on the island and blew the bridges. It was overrun from within anyway, but there&amp;rsquo;s a ton of medical supplies there, and it&amp;rsquo;s currently cut off from the mainland. Also, its proximity to Manhattan and the eastern seaboard makes it a perfect spot to raid for supplies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now, we aren&amp;rsquo;t evacuating everyone. I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping tabs on the valley for some time. Believe it or not, it&amp;rsquo;s been one of the safer and more stable communities in the eastern US. Some of the people here are worth saving, and some aren&amp;rsquo;t. You folks have all made the nice list. Either because you&amp;rsquo;re good folks, or, in the case of Eli Crowley here, because you have something we need.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Crowley here is an expert dog trainer. In the BZ he could get 5-10 thousand bucks for his hunting dogs. Also, he has intelligence on an upcoming meeting between the Crowleys and the Minutemen. Yes, those fuckers. So, he helps us get onto their land and take out the whole miserable lot of them, and he and his wife get to come along for the ride.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now this won&amp;rsquo;t be easy but we&amp;rsquo;re calling in some friends from the USS Toledo. They&amp;rsquo;re going to draw the bulk of the enemy forces out onto the golf course while the rest of us hit the house. If all goes as planned, we&amp;rsquo;ll draw the majority of their heavy hitters out into the open. When we clear the house, we&amp;rsquo;ll come up behind what&amp;rsquo;s left and trap them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is step one. We get an expert that we need and take out some of the worst bad guys around. When it&amp;rsquo;s done, we&amp;rsquo;ll assess and talk about the next step in our plan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
