			<description>&amp;quot;The Need for Speed (occasionally referred to in full as Road &amp;amp; Track Presents: The Need for Speed) is a 1994 racing video game, developed by Electronic Arts Canada and published by Electronic Arts. It is the first in the Need for Speed series, which spans more than 15 titles to date. The premise of the game involves racing in sport cars, including several exotic models and Japanese imports. The game was noted for its realism and audio and video commentaries. Electronic Arts teamed up with automotive magazine Road &amp;amp; Track to match vehicle behavior, including the mimicking of the sounds made by the vehicles' gear control levers. The game also contained precise vehicle data with spoken commentary, several &amp;quot;magazine style&amp;quot; images of each car interior and exterior and even short video clips highlighting the vehicles set to music.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Need_for_Speed,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
