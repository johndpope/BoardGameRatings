			<description>Swipe is a fairly standard anagrams game. The equipment consists of 85 letter tiles with point values (they are in an unusual shape, something like an arrow, so that they interlock ). One tile at a time is revealed until someone is able to make a word and announces this. Words already made may be stolen (&amp;quot;swiped&amp;quot;) by anagramming them. Spelling long words gives bonus points, as does spelling the word &amp;quot;swipe.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is owned by Pokonobe Associates, who licensed it to Waddington-Sanders for publication. It was published in a bilingual English/French edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
