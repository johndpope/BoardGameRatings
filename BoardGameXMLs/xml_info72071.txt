			<description>&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank is a 3D platformer/shooter  video game for the PlayStation 2, developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony. Released in 2002, it is the first game in the Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's plot opens with the anthromorphic character Ratchet meeting the robot Clank on his home planet. Clank discovers that the villainous Chairman Drek of the Blarg race plans to create a new planet for his species, destroying the galaxy in the process. Clank convinces Ratchet to help him in his quest to gain the help of the famous superhero Captain Qwark, but they soon discover that they must save the galaxy on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers a wide range of weapons and gadgets that the player must use to defeat numerous enemies and solve puzzles on a variety of different planets in the fictional &amp;quot;Solana&amp;quot; galaxy. The game also includes several mini-games, such as racing or lock-picking, which the player must complete to proceed. The game was positively received by critics, praising the good graphics and variety of gameplay, although some criticism was aimed at the camera angles and the personalities of the protagonists.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ratchet_&amp;amp;_Clank_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
