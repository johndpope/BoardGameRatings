							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Extra! Extra!:  A Fact/Opinion Game</name>
									
			<description>Be the first to complete your paper route by answering questions about facts and opinions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra! Extra! is an educational children's game, designed to teach players to distinguish between fact and opinion.  Players start the game with five newspaper tokens each.  On a turn, they choose a card, read the passage on the card and then attempt to answer the associated question.  Correct answers allow the player to roll a die and move.  Wrong answers cause loss of a turn.  Players attempt to land on purple spaces, which are attached to houses and allow them to &amp;quot;deliver&amp;quot; one of their newspapers.  However, they may not deliver to a house that already has a paper.  A few spaces contain special instructions, such as extra turns or moves or loss of turns or taking a paper back.  The first player to deliver all his/her papers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
