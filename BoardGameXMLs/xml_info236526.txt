			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This story revolves around a small empire with a minor problem &amp;mdash; it currently has no emperor. The emperor disappeared over a week ago from the palace grounds. Nothing was found of his entourage including his personal guards. All attempts to divine anything regarding his condition and/or whereabouts have failed and no group has taken responsibility or made any demands for his ransom. This leads many people to believe him dead &amp;mdash; a victim of something more sinister than mere political intrigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
