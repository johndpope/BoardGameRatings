			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in the Golden Age, everybody was happy and everybody had enough. That's what the hoopla-heads say anyway. The truth wasn't that shiny, but they sure as shit had more and better than we do now. You know this for a fact because you've actually read honest-to-god books from back then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the gear and ideas from the Golden Age are still around waiting for someone with the brains to come along and find them. You've just got to know where to look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
