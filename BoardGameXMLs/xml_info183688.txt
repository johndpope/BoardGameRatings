			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinosaurs As They Were Always Meant to Be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinosaurs occupy a special place in our imagination. On the one hand, they are awe-inspiring creatures of myth and fantasy, terrible draconic creatures which no human has ever lain eyes upon, stars of novels, television, and movies. On the other hand, they were real, mundane animals, not so different from the animals we know in modern day times. As a result, dinosaurs occupy a nebulous space between fantasy and reality, and require a delicate balance to handle well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dinosaurs included in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary do an excellent job of presenting one interpretation of dinosaurs: that of being large, but nonetheless mundane animals, differing from a bear or elephant only in Hit Dice and size category. Like other animals, they receive little in the way of special abilities or mechanics to make them come alive at the game table. With Weekly Wonders: Cinematic Dinosaurs Volume II, we present a different interpretation of dinosaurs, one which draws on the more fantastical elements of these creatures, as seen in movies, television, games, and more. Though they are decidedly non-magical in nature, these dinosaurs can hardly be said to be mundane, with numerous new and exciting special abilities designed to evoke the sorts of action attributed to dinosaurs in other media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The primordial pteranodon (CR 5), with a deadly, razor-sharp beak, a terrifying penchant for dive-bombing, and the ability to easily carry off creatures of nearly their own size into the air, to devour at leisure at their nest&lt;br/&gt;    The primordial brontosaurus (CR 13), whose bulk allows it to destroy even towering structures with a gesture, and whose massive tail is a terror to behold on the field of battle.&lt;br/&gt;    Supplemental rules applicable to all dinosaurs and other creatures of immense size, which address the common problem of one could ever hope to kill such creatures by stabbing their toes, and providing extensive rules for climbing massive creatures, and fighting them from a precarious vantage point on the very body of one's foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
