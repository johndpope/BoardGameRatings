			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infecta is the game of cell survival. A life-and-death struggle between single-celled organisms involves two players in a rapid action contest of dice and strategy. Each opponent attempts to inflict the foreign cell by exposing it to a carrier virus while defensively contracting its own cell wall and shifting its nucleus out of danger. As in life, fate is decided by aggression, instinct and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Infecta each player controls a cell made up of a nucleus piece and many cell wall pieces. Each player also controls six virions (virus particles) which can destroy other pieces; the object is to destroy the opponent's nucleus, all the opponent's virions, or all the opponent's cell walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn the active player rolls two dice and moves pieces accordingly. Virions can only move in straight lines, and each one must use the full amount rolled on one die. The other pieces can split dice and move in any combination of directions desired. Rolling doubles entitles a player to another turn (though this cannot be repeated) and also to restore a destroyed virion under certain conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
