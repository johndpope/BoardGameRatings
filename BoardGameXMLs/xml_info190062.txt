			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1551; Stage One: Mike Miller; Stage Two: Nolan Callender; Stage Three: Sam Zeitlin&lt;br/&gt;Stage One and Two Title: Nexus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules text:&lt;br/&gt;Sing, O muse, of the gods themselves. Bold Zeus and silent Hades; kind Demeter and stern Hera. Lords of earth, sea, sky, and underworld. Sing of their feuds and their liaisons! Their loves and lusts and hates. The great beasts they have slain, the arrogant mortals they have humbled, the lovers they seduced, the oracles to which they told their secrets! Sing to us of their bodies, sculpted in marble, ideals we strive to approach, but always fall short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. Sing to me of the gods as they really are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In myth, the gods are just like us, men and women, drawn at a grand scale and given overwhelming powers. That is how we choose to remember them. This is not a game about those memories. This is a game about what really happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gods were born as specks of dust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
