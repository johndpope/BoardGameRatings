			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope Park offers a natural refuge within the bustling city; towering trees give cover to flowers and bushes as well as verdant grass. The sun rising over the hills gives a golden glow to the entire park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope Park is a set of maps detailing a public park of the Great City and its surroundings. Although it is set in the Great City this product can fit perfectly in your homebrew city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope Park is also the starting location for The Road to Revolution campaign arc (see The Skullcrackers adventure for more information)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains an overview map and four maps which can be jointed to form a large map of the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The locations detailed by the maps are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gardens&lt;br/&gt;Wine and Spirits Shop&lt;br/&gt;The Green Shrine&lt;br/&gt;Carts &amp;amp; Wheelwright&amp;rsquo;s Shop&lt;br/&gt;Park Guardian&amp;rsquo;s House&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
