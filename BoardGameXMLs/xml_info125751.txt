							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Catching Mice</name>
									
			<description>for 2 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player having 6 different colored counters each for mice and an indicator.&lt;br/&gt;The object is to win mice (counters) by stopping a players men on the letters M,I,C, and E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin the indicator and place their mouse on the start places in order. Using either end of the arrow obtained from the spinner result. If the player hits upon an &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; he takes one of his mice and outs it on the blue track opposite the &amp;quot;M&amp;quot;.  The players having obtained an M then try to get the I,C, and E, The MIC &amp;amp; E may be separated by many spaces but must follow in order.  In the case that a player does not obtain the next needed letter he must move forward the number of spaces shown on either end of the arrow. If a piece falls opposite an opposing mouse,  the mouse is returned to the center of the board to be used again. If a player obtains a letter and there are only mice of an opposite color in the center he takes one of them and exchanges it for one of his own color, No two men or mice may occupy the same space. The player having the most mice  home at the end wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
