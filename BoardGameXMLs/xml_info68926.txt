							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Linotaur</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adamant Entertainment continues our line of 4E support products with The Linotaur: a complete playable race for 4E campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proud leonine centaurs whose nomadic tribes hunt on the open grasslands, the linotaurs are decisive and stalwart, but somewhat quick to anger and very territorial. A young linotaur hunter will set forth from his pride in order to gain a tale -- every hunter&amp;rsquo;s worth is measured by the stories of their deeds that surround them. Linotaurs will become adventurers to amass life experiences, and then return to their pride and gain prestige through the telling of their tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Linotaur presents these graceful hunters as a playable race, as well as statted as monster encounters for use in your 4E campaign. New linotaur feats are also included, as well as several adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
