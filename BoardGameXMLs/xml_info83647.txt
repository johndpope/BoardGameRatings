			<description>FUBAR is a simple, one page set of rules designed for gaming WWII, Modern, or SciFi combat. Each player has a force composed of a number of Units, each of which in turn includes a number of individual figures, with weapons chosen from a short list of generic weapon types (it's simple to add more or detail the existing ones). A player is allowed to activate his units one at a time until he fails an activation roll, at which time play passes to the opponent. Units which have not moved, or fail to activate, are able to use reaction fire. Movement is measured from a short list of available actions, run, walk, assault, etc. Combat is resolved using a die roll-savings throw mechanic, with saving throws only if the target wears armor. Hits result in Suppression or Casualties, with more experienced units able to take more suppression hits before casualties are inflicted. vehicles are treated generically, but with a choice of armor &amp;amp; weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Force list, weapon choices and vehicle details are left to the player, although fan-produced lists have been posted on the game website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FUBAR has a range of rules and supplements including these genre:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR 40K Boarding Actions - Space Hulk and Space Crusade&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Generic Sci-Fi&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Stargate1&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Star Wars - Hoth battle &lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Clone Wars&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Starship Troopers&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Steampunk&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Warhammer 40K&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Warzone&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Hammers Slammers&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Imperial Commander&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR 15mm SciFi&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Micro FUBAR - 6mm scale&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Vietnam&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR WW2&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Afghanistan&lt;br/&gt;    FUBAR Horror &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
