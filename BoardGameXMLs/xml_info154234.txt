							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jungle Temple</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a Jungle Temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;To not offer a sacrifice to the sun god will ruin our crops. Even if she is your daughter Inul.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jungle Temple is a single external view map of a jungle surrounding a small open top temple that appears to be ruined by overgrowth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jungle Temple is intended for use in fantasy or modern games. Some of the stranger looking trees could also make it appropriate for an alien world in a sci-fi game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer Solstice: The jungle temple appears abandoned and overrun by plants and trees. However, one day a year the followers of the temple gather for the summer solstice to perform a sacrificial ritual at noon. A girl is sacrificed to the sun god and her blood offered to the jungle plants. This blood magic ritual imbues the local jungle trees with the power to animate and protect the temple for one year. The jungle itself will attack anyone who does not follow the sun god and approaches the temple. This act however kills the tree, which explains the odd number of dead trees in the otherwise fertile area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters can get involved by being attacked by the jungle trees and having a chance to save the person to be sacrificed and disrupt the ritual. If they attempt to save his daughter, Inul, the father, helps the player characters to save his daughter from the sacrificial knife. Or the player characters have a chance to explore the jungle temple for treasure and secrets when the sun cultists are not present after the jungle tree ambush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
