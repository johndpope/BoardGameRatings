							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The House of George Walter Michaels</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you escape from the House?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While conversing with your associates, the distressed fianc&amp;eacute; of your friend, Arthur Reginald, enters. Being long overdue for returning to her, she has become worried. It is uncovered that he planned on exploring the mysterious house of George Walter Michaels, an abandoned property surrounded by superstition and dark rumors, but when she expressed her worry about such an action, he lied that he would join you instead. At the brink of tears, she requests your assistance in locating him before something tragic can occur. You inform her that any ominous premonitions about her fianc&amp;eacute;&amp;rsquo;s exploration of the house are unfounded, but agree to aid the lady none the less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon entering the dilapidated building, you all are affronted by unimaginable horrors that threaten life and sanity. Can you find the right door out, the key to open it, and the means to survive until the break of day to be free from those what lurks in the house of George Walter Michaels?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a 10 Die Survival Game, the players run through as a group, trying to survive the cards that remove their pile of Dice. If you are out of Dice, you are dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for 1 or more players. You need 10 six-sided dice per player to play, or if 10 dice per player is too much, you will need some way to track the dice that they have remaining &amp;ndash; a pad of paper, some counters, etc. &amp;ndash; and 10 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also requires a deck of 10 Die Survival cards. This deck should normally be comprised of 3 Salvation cards, and at least half of the total deck should have Encounters (see below). A standard size for a deck is 30 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player should begin the game with 10 six-sided dice; this represents their life/sanity/etc &amp;ndash; when you have 0 dice remaining, you are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all 3 Salvation cards are found, then the game ends. All players that still have dice remaining can pat themselves on the back, while all dead players shouldn't feel too bad for dying to the difficult circumstances that they were thrust into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
