							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rubble Rousers</name>
									
			<description>In Rubble Rousers, you take the role of the owner of one of several competing construction and demolition companies in an ever-changing city of constant building and rebuilding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rubble Rousers features a hybrid of Euro-style gameplay elements with a light dexterity factor. You will roll out with your trucks (6-sided dice) by flicking them onto the board, knocking over any buildings (stacks of wooden discs) in their path. Once your truck comes to rest on the city board, you  spend action points to drive around the board, collecting rubble from destroyed buildings for materials you will subsequently use to construct your own buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay and strategy in Rubble Rousers is driven by hands of contract cards which can be played as either demolition contracts or construction contracts. If your card is played as a demolition contract, you earn Victory Points by toppling a building in the city that contains the materials listed on the card. If your card is played as a construction contract, you earn VP by building a structure that contains the materials listed on the card. Be careful, however, because if you are unable to complete your contracts within two rounds of play, you will lose VP instead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special bonus action cards can be activated to allow you to re-roll unsatisfactory rolls, perform rule-bending actions, dump unwanted contracts and more. However, once they are used, you must spend action points in later turns in order to maintain them and restore them to active status, ensuring you gain the end of game VP bonuses listed on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crowd-drawing game of exciting shots and near-misses as well as careful planning and strategy, Rubble Rousers bridges the gaps between players of all sorts of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
