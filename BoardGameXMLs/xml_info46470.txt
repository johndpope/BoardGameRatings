			<description>do yOU WaNt tO PlaY wiTh MadNEsS?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hi, there. I know you're not dead yet, but we're working on it. Anyway, I was wondering if you'd thought about your career prospects once I finally get around to killing you. I was hoping you'd consider coming to work for us. No? You won't even consider it? Oh, wel.. And, yes, Im going to kill you anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And All Pandemonium Breaks Loose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some wraiths see messing with the living as a hobby, others see it as a crime. Then there are the Haunters, to whom it's a calling. They're the ones who make the stories you read in the tabloid rags, the ones who make the walls bleed and the sky rain vermin. They're the ones who like to terrorize the innocent, to hound the wicked, and generally to make life hell for anyone they can find. But they've got a reason for it - and that's the most frightening thing of all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guildbook: Haunters is the fourth in the continuing series of Guildbooks for Wraith: The Oblivion. Now you can get inside the heads of those wraiths whom even Spectres consider to be a little odd. Here's a warning, though: Just because you get inside their heads doesn't mean you'll make it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guildbook: Haunters contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The mysterious link between the Haunters and the Wyld&lt;br/&gt;     Haunter recruiting practices - and, no, they're not pretty&lt;br/&gt;     New ways to inflict Pandemonium upon the living - fun, fun, fun! - and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
