			<description>In this re-themed edition of Ausgerechnet Buxtehude, we are now trying to learn the geographical locations of cities and sights of Switzerland. In the swiss edition, there also cards with mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place cards on the table according to their relative location. Other players may doubt the accuracy of the placement you made. Should the accusations turn out to be true, you would have to give out a scoring marker. The player with the most scoring markers in the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 200 location cards with longitude, latitude, and other information about locations.&lt;br/&gt;As there are four languages spoken in Switzerland the rules are supplied also in those four languages (German, French, Italian  and Rhaeto-Romanic)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
