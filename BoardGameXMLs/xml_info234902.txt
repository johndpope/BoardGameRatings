			<description>A cooperative board game for 1-4 super science revolutionaries.&lt;br/&gt;As youthful super scientist revolutionaries you wield a limited supply of near magical technology cards&lt;br/&gt;and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to overthrow the fascist government and rescue the city before your resources are depleted and progress is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucid City was a paradise, the home of innovative and artistic superscience. Then came the Undoing and life was nearly extinguished by greedy bureaucratic zealots. They suppressed progress, released engineered plagues and destroyed most valuable tech to consolidate power. All hope was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skillful and efficient play, converting limited innovation cards and renewable dice technology, is required to save the day.&lt;br/&gt;But with each step towards enlightenment, the enemy will try to counter your progress towards illumination. Tense, exciting play forces the players to integrate their actions, and use their resources with great wisdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
