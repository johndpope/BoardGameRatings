			<description>An colorful space exploration board game produced in post-war France. The object of the game is to travel through the solar system landing on the planets and moon and collecting valuable ore or precious stones. The winner is the player with the most valuable riches upon returning to earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires players to choose a spaceship that looks more like a plane and traverse the solar system by the move of a single die along a path of small white stars. The journey takes them on a path to the Moon, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter before returning to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whats interesting about the game is that 3 of the planets (Venus, Jupiter and Mars) rotate slowly during play by turning a disk and players have to align their ship towards the next path to move onto another planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On arrival on the moon and planets players acquire cards with valuable ore and gemstones. The value of each card is determined by who arrives there first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other interesting feature is a fast moving comet that orbits the players course by the throw of 2 dice. If a player collides with the comet a penalty such as loss of riches or even elimination from the game occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After collecting the precious cargo from the planets and returning to Earth players are awarded bonus cards in order of arrival. The player with the largest value is deemed the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
