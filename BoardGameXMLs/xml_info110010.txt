			<description>The children are playing Robbers &amp;amp; Police, in the game the players are the police trying to find the the robbers in their hiding places. 48 cards are distributed face down on the board, 12 of them are robbers. Players roll the die and move along the paths on the board. If they suspect a card to hide a robber, they pick it up and turn it over. If the suspicion was correct and it is a robber he is captured and the player takes the card. If the suspicion was wrong, the player has to free an already captured robber and put him back on the board. Who has the most robbers at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
