							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Quarrymen</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years there have been legends of a lost ancient complex hidden deep within the town quarry, and it seems that the local quarrymen have now stumbled upon an entrance to it. Long thought lost to the ages, little about it is known for sure, although rumours are now flying through the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sixty-six quarrymen took the opportunity to enter the complex opening and take a look around, but they have all since disappeared. Only Henry the Quarry master made back to the entrance, but he is not a well man. Found limp, semiconscious, and raving at the entrance to the complex by the two Foremen who remained behind, he can only babble about &amp;quot;The Creature,&amp;quot; squid, jars, jars, endless jars. Any questioning about the contents of the jars causes him to go into fits and screams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
