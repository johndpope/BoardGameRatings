			<description>Party game, What? Girls Night Edition, is a spin-off of the original What? party game.  Made for girls only, this party game is great for large groups of people. A hilarious party game, your girlfriends will be guessing who could have possibly said what! Players answer three categories of questions: General, Fill In The Blank, and Sticky Situation.  Girls can be as honest or as deceitful as they want, but the goal is to fool your friends so they can't guess your answer!  Shock value anticipated as players give their most creative answers.  Fun party game for bachelorette parties, girls night, pajama parties and any occasion where the girls can kick the boys out for a few giggles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
