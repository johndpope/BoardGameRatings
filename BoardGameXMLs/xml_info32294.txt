							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prophets Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Prophets Card Game is an LDS variation on Go Fish. Cards are numbered 1-13, with each number representing an LDS prophet. (The cards only go through Ezra Taft Benson.) There are also four suits, Beehives, Buffalo Skulls, Seagulls, and Wagon Wheels. Players ask others for the cards they need to complete the &amp;quot;Books&amp;quot; by asking for the name of the prophet pictured on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules make note that this deck of cards is appropriate for other standard card games as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
