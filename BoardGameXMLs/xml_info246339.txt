			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scraper Caper was partially developed by Bill Hogue during the early 1980s.  It was intended to be an arcade action game for the Atari 8-bit and Coleco systems.  Scraper Caper was advertised extensively in 1983, usually alongside Miner 2049er for which it was an intended sequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game apparently was not completed and was never released.  In an interview, Bill Hogue indicated Scraper Caper was not related to  N/A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
