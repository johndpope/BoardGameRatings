			<description>&amp;quot;Sometimes a finger is mightier than the sword&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the intuitive one-finger- Controls to command your army, browse the Levels and upgrade your units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;a Knights Dawn&amp;quot; you don&amp;rsquo;t just build towers like in traditional tower defense games - simply massing towers.  Here you must place your units strategically, for example taking the terrain into account and placing the weaker musketeers or mages in locations protected by the stronger defensive forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Beware - the enemy is tricky and vicious at the same time. You will fight battles to defend your airship, hold the horde back long enough in order to give your people time to flee and prevent the enemies from the revival of a monstrous sea creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a battle you will have the chance to further upgrade your troops, and prepare them for more intense fights to come. However your troops aren&amp;acute;t the only thing that upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As your troops get stronger during the story they will need a fortified place to live and rest between the exhausting fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, throughout the game city and land around you will evolve, starting with a simple camp without any protection. You will be able to turn it into a powerful fortress, and maybe even into the Main City State of your country. If you survive long enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh and one more thing, your camp isn&amp;acute;t just eye candy, it&amp;acute;s actually the games main menu, here you&amp;acute;ll be able to upgrade your units, change your profile, check out your accomplishments or head right back into the heat of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also make sure you have plenty to do after getting through the story, with tons of achievements, challenges and difficulties to get through.  Oh and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to post your accomplishments to Facebook via Facebook integration, go ahead and show your friends who the real king is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
