							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Masquerade Ball (System Neutral Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masquerade balls are a feature of civilised urban life, and eventually the PCs may be invited to attend such a prestigious event. Perhaps they are invited to secretly meet a new patron or to stymie some plot of these attending the event or alternatively their adventure may start unexpectedly during such an event. Masquerade balls are excellent excuses for role-playing and offer an excellent change of pace to a typical adventure. However, designing all the guests and their costumes would take more time than even the most diligent GM has at his disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where Campaign Events: Masquerade Ball comes in. Presenting copious notes on masks, costumes and guests along with hooks, opportunities and complications it takes the hassle out of running a masquerade ball and lets the GM concentrate on the important details of the campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
