			<description>&amp;quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers (also known as Gabriel Knight 1 or GK1) is a 1993 point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line, Inc. (the now defunct Sierra Entertainment). It is the first game of the Gabriel Knight series and was first released in North America on December 17, 1993, but has been subsequently re-released both individually and as Gabriel Knight Mysteries: Limited Edition, a compilation with The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery. The game follows the eponymous Gabriel Knight, a used bookstore owner and fledgling writer, as he investigates a series of local murders he plans to use as the basis for his new novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sins of the Fathers was released cross-format as both a single CD-ROM disc and as a set of eleven 3.5&amp;quot; floppy disks. The CD-ROM version included voice-acting by Tim Curry, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., and Leah Remini among others. The CD-ROM version also included video sequences that the floppy version instead included as a sequence of still images.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gabriel_Knight:_Sins_of_the_Fathers,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
