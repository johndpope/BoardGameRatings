			<description>Publishr's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This accessory contains thirty illustrated archetypical operatives for use as player characters for one-shot missions or for visiting players, or for use as non-player characters to round out a team or serve as backup personnel. Game Masters can even use them as enemies, contacts, or for any other purpose his devious mind can dream up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty of the operatives contained herein represent types of starting-rank operatives commonly found within Command, such as a hacker, brash pilot, cat burglar, or covert commando. The remaining ten are professional-ranked operatives with some experience behind them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are given names and background information riddled with&lt;br/&gt;inspiring content Game Masters might use to fill in his games.&lt;br/&gt;So whatever you need it for... you know you need it! Quick characters instantly available to bolster your player&amp;rsquo;s or their enemies&amp;rsquo; teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
