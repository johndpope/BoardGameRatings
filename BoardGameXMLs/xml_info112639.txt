He has resigned his post on the Soviet super-soldier team and sworn to lead a &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; revolution of justice and reason to resurrect Lenin's dream in the modern age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He's founded a private army, the Red Spider organization, with this goal. Possibly the most powerful being on the planet, Battle Czar is now a wild card. Both Washington and Moscow eye him warily...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
