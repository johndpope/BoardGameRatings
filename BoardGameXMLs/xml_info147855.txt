							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Re: Your Brains</name>
									
			<description>Based on the song by Jonathan Coulton, Re: Your Brains pits 2-5 players against each other and the zombie horde.  Players play food and office supply cards face up in front of them to give them bonuses, play weapon cards to destroy zombies, and play any card face down in front of their opponents to create more zombies that want to eat their brains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts out as a heroic human and can win if they are the sole survivor, OR they can become overrun by zombies and become a zombie master.  Each zombie master has a different victory condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game should not be confused with the other card game of the same name.  Same inspiration; different implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
