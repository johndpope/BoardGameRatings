							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Loss in Hanging Well</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In old Rict, pain haunts every home, fear its sloping lanes. The Officials murder freely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But uneasily, for they themselves may be next: in Hanging Well, where daemons dwell. Those who choose vengeance go sooner; those who seek other paths follow the Hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now the Hope too is to be hung...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Loss in Hanging Well is an adventure with five locations, a map and a set of protagonists, all folding into a pocket format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elements weave into a chase through the deeps onto the edge of a society, offering wily adventurers the secret of a feared site, access to outlandish beings and opportunities among two emerging peoples. The material is suitable for rules-light gaming and designed for easy adaptation to various settings and systems, describing the key elements with a degree of uncertainty in terms open to interpretation. It assumes that dice are used for random numbers, but also offers a diceless number generator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The package includes a copy of isophasmic light, a compact approach to gaming used in the creation of the profiles. As with isophasmic light, the adventure is laid out for use as a PolyP booklet, to make it easier to play spontaneously and on the move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
