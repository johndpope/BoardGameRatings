			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;CRIMINAL'S is a card game with a theme of thieving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are trying to steal a treasure which is guarded with four security methods. To defeat the security, you form a group of five criminals. There are six types of security, and each criminal has an advantage at one of them and a disadvantage at another one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, place 12 security chips, forming three groups of four chips  (A, B, and C). Chips in group A are revealed, meaning they are not guarding the treasure. Chips in Group C are never revealed until end of the game, meaning they are guarding the treasure. Chips in group B are partial information; a player can see two of them during the game. Then players are dealt nine criminal cards each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a round, the first player takes a chip. The first two players may look at it, and discards one card from their hand. The other players may not look at that chip but guess it from the discards, and discard one from their hand. Instead of discarding one, you may discard two and take the card the previous player discarded. Play four rounds so that everyone has five criminal cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At end of the game, reveal one security chip from group C, each player passes the security if they play one criminal who is advantageous to that security, or any two criminals who are not disadvantageous to it (other conditions apply). Take a treasure if you pass four securities in this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After several games, the player with the most treasures is the grand champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third edition in 2016 is in Japanese and English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;プレイヤーは手持ちのメンバーカードを使ってチームを編成し、そのメンバーで宝物を守る4つのセキュリティを解除しに行きます。見事解除出来れば宝物が手に入ります。このラウンドを繰り返し、最終的に集めた宝物の数が一番多い人の勝利となります。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
