							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TRS-80 Model III</name>
									
			<description>TRS-80 was Tandy Corporation's desktop microcomputer model line, sold through Tandy's Radio Shack stores in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In July 1980 Tandy released the TRS-80 Model III. The Model III could run about 80% of Model I software, but used an incompatible format for its 5-1/4&amp;quot; diskettes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improvements over the Model I included built-in lower case characters, an improved keyboard, 1500-baud cassette interface, and a faster (2.03 MHz) Z-80 processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another significant change from the Model I was the self-enclosed style of the Model III--the monitor, keyboard, CPU and (optional) disk drives were all contained in one unit. This was a departure from the design of the Model I where the keyboard, monitor and disk drives were separate components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TRS-80&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
