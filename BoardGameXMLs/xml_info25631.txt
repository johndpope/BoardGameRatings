							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of the Ancient World: The Crown of Kings</name>
									
			<description>The Crown of Kings is a programmed adventure using Dark City Games Legends of the Ancient World rule set. These rules provide gameplay very similar to that of Melee and Wizard from Metagaming. This adventure is compatible with those games as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are fought with counters on a hex map that is included with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher: &amp;quot;The Crown of Kings!  The ancient symbol of ruler ship from the legendary Federative Empire, said to have ruled this land in the misty past.  Some say that when the Crown is again brought to light, and worn by one both steadfast and strong, the Empire will rise again.  That is the work, perhaps, of generations of imaginations, but the Crown of Kings would be a prize indeed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
