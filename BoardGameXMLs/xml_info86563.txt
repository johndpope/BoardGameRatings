			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever think that tacking on specialist wizards to the wizard core class was kinda lame? Ever think that the specialists needed to be written up as their own distinct classes? Yeah, us too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Evoker is the seventh offering in The Core Specialist Wizard series. Each product of the series will present a different specialist as its own core, 20-level class, with distinctive abilities. Other related materials, including feats, two prestige classes tied to the core specialist class, and a small offering of related magic items, are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within The Evoker you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The evoker core class. These specialists wizards are experts at making something from nothing. In fact, existence has a way of ending up in their pockets (literally.)&lt;br/&gt;     The arcanamest prestige class. These wizards are able to temporarily enchant ordinary items, making them magical items.&lt;br/&gt;     The elemental troubadour prestige class. Bards that can focus their evocation talent to summon the elements.&lt;br/&gt;     9 new feats centered around specialist wizards in general, with a focus on the evoker.&lt;br/&gt;     3 new magic items, the force armor, ring of energy, and elemental instrument, and a new special ability for magic weapons, force-charged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
