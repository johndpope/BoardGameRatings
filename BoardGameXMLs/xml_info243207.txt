			<description>If you can master the poker face, And read the faces of others. If you've got the calm for Russian roulette, But can make others fall under pressure. If you can charm, and not be charmed yourself. And manipulate but not be manipulated. If you can persuade like a King, But not be led astray. And make others believe in illusions, By creating smoke and mirrors. If you can adapt when the odds are against you, And look cool when the game turns. If you can win in the face of defeat. And know when to lose a won game. Then my friend.... You have what it takes to be a Great Hustler. Hustle card game is an exciting new game that'll have you and your friends and family hooked. It's a fast-paced game that changes at every turn. One minute you're winning, and then suddenly the odds are against you. The next minute you may be losing but using your charm and skill and with a little bit of luck you can win in the face of defeat. The rules are simple and very quick to master. It's a game that requires confidence, skill and keeping cool under pressure. Call out values for opponents to match and the first to get rid of all cards wins the game. But be careful of different Hustle cards and opponents who may try to charm, manipulate and hustle to a win. Perfect for all ages and for bringing friends and family together. Remember you can either Hustle or be Hustled!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
