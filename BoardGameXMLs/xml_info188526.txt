			<description>Yakitori, the famed Japanese street food on skewers, is now a game in which players are skewering tiles, placing dice, and manipulating a fickle market to vie for the most Yen from hungry customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players roll dice, select from actions such as Cooking, Market, and Influence. Food tiles are bought, skewered, and sold at just the right time to net a healthy profit. Clever planning can pay off in this family-friendly game that will also intrigue seasoned gamers looking for a thinky game that integrates theme with mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
