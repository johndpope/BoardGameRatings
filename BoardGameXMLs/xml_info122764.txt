			<description>Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Marz (電脳戦機バーチャロン マーズ Dennō Senki Bācharon Māzu) was released exclusively on the PlayStation 2 in North America and Japan, with no European release. Marz is designed on the basic gameplay rules of Virtual-On Force, and uses most of the assets from Force, ranging from the stages down to the virtuaroids. It can be considered a spiritual home console version of the 4-player Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtual On Marz retains the Twin Stick control layout of the series, mapping the two stick to the analogue sticks on the Dualshock controller, and the turbo and weapon buttons to the four L and R buttons. A new Auto controller layout was provided, as well as several variants, for players who did not like the twin stick format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The match rules follow that of Virtual On: Force, that is, two-on-two matches with a leader on each team. Fallen teammates can be given half the other's life gauge through the &amp;quot;rescue tag&amp;quot; maneuver, and the first pair to fall loses the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Challenge Mode&amp;quot; is a single match setup that is akin to a stage in Virtual On: Force, with the player tagged with a computer partner against two other computer opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New to the PlayStation 2 Marz is the &amp;quot;Dramatic Mode&amp;quot;, which is a linear sequence of missions with various objectives such as exploration, target destruction and boss battles. When certain requirements are met, such as passing certain stages, or destroying a number of certain virtuaroids, new virtuaroids are open for selection and play in the other modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A split-screen 2-player mode is available, with the choice of playing on the same team or against each other. The game does not feature any means to play with 4-players, and thus, falls short of making full use of the design behind the Virtual On: Force game system and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Marz&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
