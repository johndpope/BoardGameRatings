							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">First to Fight: Wehrmacht / Gestapo Promo</name>
									
			<description>The title of First to Fight refers to the famous slogan and poster distributed in European countries after Poland was the first country to be attacked by Germany in September 1939. This game, released by Fabryka Gier Historycznych (Historical Games Factory) in cooperation with Fundacja Niepodległości (Foundation for Independence), takes place throughout the entirety of World War II, with the players taking the roles of commanders of the Polish forces that are fighting on numerous fronts: Eastern and Western Europe, Africa, etc. By allocating their troops in different regions of the world, they aim to carry out missions (including the most famous battles of WW2) and earn victory points (VPs). The players do not &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; or control the soldiers, which are represented by neutral cards, moved by the players around the board, and activated only when it is the time to play a mission card in a given region; that said, their particular specialization may increase a player's chance to win a mission. The player with the most VPs at the end of the War (May 1945) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wehrmacht / Gestapo is a promo card avaialble at SPIEL 2014 at the publisher's booth. It introduces a new phase to the game and two new effects in each round, depending on whether the particular region is currently occupied or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
