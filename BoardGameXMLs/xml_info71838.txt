			<description>This game is played in a similar fashion to Connect 4 where rounds may be won by scoring 4 tokens horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  Additionally, a player may win a round by creating a diamond with his/her tokens -- that diamond must contain the opponent's token in its center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in multiple rounds.  First player to win 9 rounds wins the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red and blue tokens come with pro baseball team stickers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horizontal? Vertical? Diagonal? Diamond?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the Rivalry begin! Connect 4 Rivalry Edition adds fuel to the fire. Drop your team's checker into the field to make a line or diamond! Plan your moves, block your rival &amp;amp; show no mercy. Bring the rivalry home and settle the score with new rules &amp;amp; game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
