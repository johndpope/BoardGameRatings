							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Behind Every Good Man</name>
									
			<description>From the KenMGames website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Write what you know&amp;quot; I am told.  Well, here is the result.  A &amp;quot;funny-if-it-were-not-so-true&amp;quot; kind of card game.  The hand you are dealt, for good or for bad, is your man.  It's your job to try and make something out of him.  Or at least change him enough that you won't be embarrassed taking him out once in a while. Yes, Behind Every Good Man is one TIRED and FRUSTRATED woman!  Included are some great variations like &amp;quot;Nobody's Perfect!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Dating Scene&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Blind Date!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
