			<description>[From the game box description] &lt;br/&gt;On the 60 lovely squares, 2, 3, or 4 players move their pawns to build a tower as quickly as possible. But do pay attention because an unprotected tower risks being dispersed to all four points of the compass by an unscrupulous opposite player! The last one to finish his tower is eliminated and the survivors get themselves ready to start a new game with more pawns. Crescendo offers a lot of possible game boards to develop vigilance and tactical sense in common with psychology and taking risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
