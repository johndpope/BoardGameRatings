							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flying Saucers</name>
									
			<description>Flying Saucers is an abstract strategy game that is similar to a four-player Checkers variant. The goal is to capture enemy saucers and be the last player remaining on the board. Players each control 12 discs that represent flying saucers which can move forward either via a straight line or on the diagonal. Once a piece reaches the opposite end of the board it becomes a &amp;quot;Super Saucer&amp;quot; which can move in any direction. Enemy saucers are captured by getting jumped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules include several variants that can be played on the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher: Flying Saucers is an exciting new space age game in which each player commands his own private squadron of flying saucers. This game is based on the strange flying saucers which many people say they have seen streaking across the skies. As you play the game of Flying Saucers, you may imagine yourself on a trip through space to a distant star - Challenged each light-year of the way by squadrons of enemy flying saucers, that will swarm about you and try to capture you before you can capture them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
