			<description>The Megapower Football Tournament is played on a board (size 120 x 60 cm) which is surrounded by stands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of players is variable. It can be played with 2, 4, 6 or 8 players and one referee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game the choice of sides is being determined by rolling a dice. There are two teams with 11 players each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players roll dice alternating and try to get to the other players penalty area and make a goal. Skill, strategy and speed determine the outcome of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
