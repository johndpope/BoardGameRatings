			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         The information that BGG has on this item indicates that San Guo Sha is an unauthorized reproduction of BANG! with just a few differences, published in China and distributed in several coutries of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All official expansions (Battle, Wind, Fire, Woods and Mountains) released in 2011, at the same time with 2011 Standard edition of the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yoka released this edition together with the 2011 Standard edition, updating the terminology and the new cardback so that it can be mixed with the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends of the Three Kingdoms (a.k.a. San Guo Sha) is a card game based off the Chinese classical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which shares many rules with Bang!, the differences are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1. The Monarch (Sheriff) may get an additional skill related to their kingdom allegiance; players routinely have two powers.&lt;br/&gt;2. Weapons may have their own additional powers.&lt;br/&gt;3. A card to let a player borrow a weapon from another.&lt;br/&gt;4. A card to cancel the effect of other cards.&lt;br/&gt;5. Peach (Beer) may be played by any player when someone loses their last life; there is no exemption of using Peach when there are only 2 players left.&lt;br/&gt;6. The game proceeds counter-clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
