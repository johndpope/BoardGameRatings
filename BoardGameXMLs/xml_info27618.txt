			<description>CLASSIC STATIS PRO BASEBALL is an authentic game based on statistics of every major league player.  Each player should perform in this game just as he does in real life; only your ability as manager will determine the outcome of every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLASS STATIS PRO BASEBALL is a no-frills version of the award-winning Statis Pro Baseball games... no frills because you do not get a playing board or score pad.  You don't really need these components because it is an easy matter to keep track of base runners and score on a plain sheet of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You DO get two dice (white and colored) and Player Cards representing every major league player of significance for the previous season.  You must cut each card apart along the dotted line, then collate by team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Classic baseball team contains 25 players, 15 fielders and 10 pitchers, and 2 pitcher at-bat cards that are standard for all teams; including American League teams - the cards being used when involved in either World Series or inter-league play, if you so desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
