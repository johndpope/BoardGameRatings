			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The routine exploration of a cleared dungeon turns into a nightmare when a gate operates suddenly and without warning. The PCs are gated into the lower plane called Acheron: a shadowy, cold and dismal land where evil is in control and there is only one way out. The adventurers arrive near a town called, Necros Mustafa, where the action is fast and many of the inhabitants dead...or undead. In this adventure, a vampire turns out to be a valuable guide and not a feared opponent! The town even has a regular ferry service, which crosses the river Styx. Your players will be delighted to meet Charon, the boatman on the river Styx!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel within Acheron is dangerous and deadly, especially for those who are foreign to this plane! The PCs need to find out how to get past the guardian (Cerberus: the huge, three headed dog) of the cavern that leads out. Payment will be required and it is not monetary! Feeding the foul beast its favorite meal might distract it long enough to get to and use the gate! There is also an artifact that can be found and acquired. Hopefully, the PCs won't be conned by the various 'tour guides', who offer to help them leave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Black Door is an adventure for levels 9-12, being easily adjustable by changing the number of opponents in each melee encounter. Do you have a dungeon where a gate has not been detailed? Do you want your PCs to face shadows, ghouls, ghasts, vampires, babaus and vrocks? Do you want see them completely oblivious to plot twists and double-dealing, making them a 'mark' for a con? This one is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sacred spire in the Kingdom of Elleron is taken by the demon lord, Varnaku, and his minions. So begins the quest in Hanan Pacha to rid the demi-plane of the evil ones who seek to make it part of their domain! The Spire of the Raven God; The Lair of the Demon Princess, The Dead of Winter and the Labyrinth of the Lost, Beyond the Black Door and Wyrmslayer are adventures that take your PCs throughout the regions of the central lands of the Inland Sea. There are plenty of conflicts, political intrigue, memorable NPCs and mysteries to solve as the heros seek the ultimate threat to the Land of Hanan Pacha!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visit the plane of Acheron, where a white dwarf sun provides eternal twilight and a blue giant sun only partially rises. Rent some vacation property along the river called Styx and witness cultists being baptized in its black waters. Meet a vampire called Vlad and his nosferatu pet. Most important of all, find your way out of this nightmare world before you get put on a slab in the mortuary, waiting to be rented out as a ghoul...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
