			<description>Deduction Screens were printed in 2014 in a limited quantity (200 times). They were a Stretch Goal during the Kickstarter Campaign in August 2014, but since the goal was not reached, Purple Games decided to print just a few copies and offer them to the public as an Add-On.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
