							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gumball 3000</name>
									
			<description>Back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a real-life version of The Cannonball Run, every year a collection of the craziest people in the world gather to take part in a 3000 mile road-race across Europe (or the USA in 2002). Danni Minogue, Happy Mondays, Fun Lovin' Criminals and the Jackass MTV crew have all taken part in the most amazing road spectacle ever seen. Can you imagine a 3 lane wide convoy of 40 super cars, all doing 140mph behind a blacked out Russian Government vehicle screeching their way to a gigantic party in St Petersburg? Now this unbelievable adventure comes to your PS2. Take any route you can, to get from checkpoint to checkpoint in the shortest possible time. Break speed limits, evade roadblocks and escape The Gumball Police Squad in your quest to become the Gumball 3000 champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
