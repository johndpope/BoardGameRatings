			<description>Goo Saga is a platform adventure game that takes place in a hidden underwater lab, where a reclusive genius scientist seeks to create life for his own enigmatic reasons. After many failed attempts, he succeeds in creating Goo, a strange creature with elastic properties. The scientist soon disappears mysteriously and Goo embarks &amp;omicron;n a perilous journey through the sunken laboratory, in an effort to find his creator &amp;ndash; and with him, the purpose of his own creation. Will Goo succeed? Throughout the game, the player is invited to guide Goo and solve puzzles, avoid deadly traps and face an army of foes that threaten to bring an end to his quest. Goo's destiny is in the player's hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goo can be in one of three states: Deflated, Normal, and Inflated, each one conferring different advantages. The player may choose which is the most suitable for each situation Goo faces, as the game progresses. Finally, the player may collect crystals by completing levels in different modes (Normal, Survival, Time Trial). Crystals are important as they may be used to enhance Goo's various abilities in order to get through levels of increased difficulty. Free access to a powerful level editor allows the player to extend Goo's journey of discovery in unprecedented directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
