							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Druthers</name>
									
			<description>Druthers is an LDS game for two or more players. Players share their opinions using phrases such as, &amp;quot;If I had my druthers...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher: Everyone likes to be asked their opinion, but how often does a seven-year-old (or even her dad) get to tell what she thinks? In this easy-to-play game, her choice can become the right answer! Simple, everyday questions have four given answers and a fifth &amp;quot;fill in your own&amp;quot; answer. Questions are geared to people in four categories: family, young child, teenage, or general. Players get points for correctly predicting &amp;quot;others' druthers.&amp;quot; Some questions bring hilarious responses; others might be insightful or thought-provoking. You'll discover things you have in common with all LDS families and what may be unique to your own household.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
