			<description>Plan 9 from Outer Space is a point and click adventure game developed by Konami for the Amiga. It was released in 1992 and published by Gremlin Graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is inspired by the 1959 Z-movie Plan 9 from Outer Space. It featured footage of famous actor Bela Lugosi interspersed with Tom Mason. Director Ed Wood had taken a few minutes of silent footage of Lugosi, in his Dracula cape, for a planned vampire picture but was unable to find financing for the project. When he later conceived of &amp;quot;Plan 9&amp;quot;, he wrote the script to incorporate the Lugosi footage and hired his wife's chiropractor to double for Lugosi in additional shots. The double hid his face with his cape to hide the fact that he was not Bela Lugosi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts when the producer notices that the film has been stolen by Bela Lugosi's double. The player must carry out a Epic search of the locations where Plan 9 from Outer Space was filmed to find the six missing reels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan 9 Stolen From Studio Archives!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan 9. The critics hated it. Bela Lugosi died during it. And his double has stolen it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lugosi's replacement is still bitter after 33 years from critics' reviews dubbing his only movie &amp;quot;The Worst Film of All-Time.&amp;quot; Even though he remained faceless, he intends to bring glory to the cult classic using more footage of himself and...colorizing it. As the studio's Private Eye you'll search over 70 locations, find the 6 reels and screen the film, frame-by-frame, to ensure that the warped actor did not cut Bela from the flick. Using actual digitized film footage, you'll sweat each scene, examining Plan 9 with slow motion, freeze frame, fast forward and rewind. It's up to you to preserve its original awfulness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
