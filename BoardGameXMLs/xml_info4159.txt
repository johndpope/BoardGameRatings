			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just think: you, a big network programming chief.  Buying shows and acquiring sponsors.  Arranging your own prime time programming schedule.  Knocking other shows out of the ratings.  Bargaining with the Union.  Winning Emmy Awards.  Winning the Good Broadcasting Award or getting zapped by the FCC.  That&amp;rsquo;s what you will experience when you play Prime Time, The Television Game.  Just as in real TV, the quality of the programming doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter much.  The object of this game is to make money.  Whoever has amassed the most profits at the end of the season is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
