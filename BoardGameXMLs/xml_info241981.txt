							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bossin (System Neutral Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Bossin sits nestled in a deep dell behind the cliffs guarding the Lonely Coast. Storms periodically batter the village, flooding the lower portion where the poorest villagers dwell. Yet, the rich bounty of the nearby mines and the excellent farmland provide the villagers with a comfortable living. The routine patrols from Caer Syllan offer a measure of safety to the unfortified Bossin, deterring raids from the half-goblins and other monsters dwelling in the Tangled Woods. To the east, a series of broken cliffs and unexplored forests provide plentiful game for hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life would almost be idyllic in Bossin if it were not for the machinations of the current village reeve, the retired adventurer Jacca Lander. Seeing an easier way to accumulate wealth than risking his life exploring old ruins, Jacca quietly disposed of the previous reeve and brought in a group of thugs to consolidate his power. He and his men regularly extort money from the villagers for their &amp;ldquo;protection&amp;rdquo;, rigging accidents to dispose of those who do not cooperate. Jacca ensures that none of this reaches the ears of the Lochers in Caer Syllan and so far he seems content ruling Bossin as his own fiefdom with an iron fist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
