							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pot O&#039; Gold</name>
									
			<description>Pot O' Gold is a colorful, fast-paced family card game. Each player takes on the role of a leprechaun trying to be the first to complete their rainbow and get the Pot O' Gold - but they have to be wary of the other devious tricksters who have the same goal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pot O' Gold includes nine different cards, each of which have actions associated with them. These include seven different color cards - Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet - that may be played sequentially to form a player's rainbow or to take an action that will help them manage their cards, get new cards, or attack another player. There are also two special cards: Pot O' Gold acts as a Wild Card as well as the winning card; Leprechauns are tricksters who undo the last action played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turns, players may play in one (or both) of two ways: to add to or to solidify their rainbow in front of them, or as an action. Hand order matters, and players must play the first card from their hand every turn; they may choose to play the second if possible. Play continues until one player has played all colors of the rainbow in order and plays a Pot O' Gold to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
