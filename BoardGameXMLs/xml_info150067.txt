			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compact Heroes is a hybrid game that combines the progression and storyline of a traditional role-playing game with the portability and ease of use of a card game. It is intended to be played with 2-6 players, with one player acting as the Game Master (GM), and the rest taking the role of adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What separates Compact Heroes from other card games is that there is no finishing point. There is no traditional &amp;ldquo;winner&amp;rdquo;. CH acts the same as a tabletop role-playing game in this regard. The very first character you create in CH can be used over and over again, gaining skills, magical items, and experience so that he or she grows in power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GM&amp;rsquo;s role is to organize and run the adventure, and will have the maps and adventure descriptions, essentially playing the part of storyteller. The GM will run the non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters. This does not mean that the game is GM versus Players. Quite the contrary. For the most enjoyable &lt;br/&gt;experience, the GM should be an impartial participant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tools Needed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the cards included in this core set, you will also need at least one six-sided dice (d6). A twenty-sided dice (d20) and additional d6 are recommended, but not necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also need something to write with as you update your character sheet, and having some scrap paper would also probably help quite a bit. And that&amp;rsquo;s it! Nothing else is required, and everything should fit in your pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
