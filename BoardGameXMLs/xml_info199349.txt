			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game requires cards to work, which much be purchased separately for $14.99 per booster pack of 6 cards. Games retailed for $24.99 and included the game disc, a manual, and a booster pack. Seven titles were planned but only five were ever released. Avatar: The Last Airbender and Nickelodeon Sports were the two that never made it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It used radio frequency identification (RFID) along with traditional video game technology. The RFID scanner reads and writes to the &amp;quot;cards&amp;quot; which, in turn, activate features in and save data from the game. The RFID tag silicon for the contactless game cards, and the RFID tag and reader designs were provided by Innovision Research and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
