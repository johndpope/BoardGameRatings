			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mattel Baseball presents a somewhat abstracted baseball game in a handheld package.  The player's team (batting) is indicated by bright LEDs; most of the playing field is indicated by printed icons.  The game requires sound, as the quality of the hit (hence the number of bases that can safely be run) is indicated only by sound.  The game also features fast-moving icons and is considered to be more difficult to play (accurate timing is essential) than the other titles in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
