			<description>In the great Empire of the Dragon, seats of power are awarded based entirely on merit, inspired by the divine hand of the Dragon Clan, which never makes mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How one determines merit, that&amp;rsquo;s the trick, though: In the Empire of the Dragon, there are delegations from each clan that come together, argue, discuss, negotiate and deal over days to divine who, exactly, will be the clan that chooses the next magistrate to fill this seat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you lead one of those delegations, seeking to win the seat for your clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Favour is a player-versus-player voting/hidden information game for two to seven players. Each round, players meet and gather and nominate political allies and rivals to try and curry the favour of the court, in the hopes of claiming a Magistrate&amp;rsquo;s seat on the Imperial Isle.  It is a time for cunning and intrigue, courtly consideration and deals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
