			<description>Tide of Battle is a customizable card game for 2 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of martial artists in combat with each other. Each player has a deck of 30 Tide of Battle cards, each card representing a martial arts technique. These cards are played as attacks or defenses against one another, with successful attacks subtracting from a target player's HP. A player begins with 30 HP and is knocked out, losing the game when that player reaches 0 HP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
