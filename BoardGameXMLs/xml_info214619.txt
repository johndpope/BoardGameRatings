							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure Starter: Meet the Spartans</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Adventure Starter is intended for a group of 3-6 Eastside Project agents of Heroic experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A couple of Spartans (vigilantes or solo Slayers) have been crossing the country killing Outsiders and narrowly escaping law enforcement. Their actions are causing problems for the Eastside Project as they are being forced to deploy their Cleanup Crews to cover up their crimes. This is becoming problematic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spartans are investigating an illness that has spread at a local elementary school. Three children have already died and several others are deathly ill and doctors have no idea the cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following is an Adventure Starter for use with the Sundered Epoch: Generations role-playing game in the No Man&amp;rsquo;s Land setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
