							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reich: The Iron Dream of German Unification</name>
									
			<description>REICH portrays events in Germany between the Reformation and the unification engineered by Bismarck. Players are not bound to a pre-determined sequence of events; rather, major social forces are used to compose game elements. These include Marxist agitation, religious riots, peasant uprisings, revolts, Papal recognition, key ministers (like the Iron Chancellor himself), foreign intervention and aid, mobilizations and wars, etc., making up a game system both exciting and flavorful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player becomes a Prince attempting to unify a fragmented Germany by means of adroit diplomacy, cunning bargains, and sudden mobilizations and armed strikes. Each turn allows for card play and interaction, then demands that the phasing player choose one of four exclusive policies in the ensuing Action Phase. Player intelligence, elan, and flexibility determine a game's outcome, with little reference to luck. Opportunities for conclusive action are many, but must be seized decisively and courageously. Winning or losing, REICH is a memorable and enjoyable experience for every player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
