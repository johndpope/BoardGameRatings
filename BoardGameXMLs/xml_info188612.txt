			<description>From publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;The heat shimmer that ripples above the parched earth does little to mask the horrors that lie assembled before you. You must focus on the task ahead. No plan survives contact with the enemy and the army you face is a howling, ravening horde of death that will test you to the limit. Today will be recorded in history but only one side will write it. Do you have the skill and courage to ensure it is you? Go. The time for war is now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Uncharted Empires, an Army Supplement book for Kings of War, the massed combat tabletop fantasy game set in the magical realm of Mantica. In this book, you are going to find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Nine brand new Kings of War armies giving budding generals a whole host of new options and dastardly tricks to outfox and out-fight their opponents, including The Brotherhood, Salamander Armies, The Herd, The League of Rhordia, The Trident Realms of Neritica, The Empire of Dust, Night-Stalker Armies, Ratkin Armies and the Varangur&lt;br/&gt;     New special rules to further enrich your playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;     Lots of new background information on all the armies and the units within them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
