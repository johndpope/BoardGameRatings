			<description>The zombies are coming! No one has anticipated their arrival, and for good reason ... they are your neighbors, your friends, your family. In this apocalyptic adventure, you play the brave Judy, whose mission is to help the population escape the ghouls, without being bitten herself. Unless you choose to play Ben, an unfortunate zombie forced to devour alive, without being killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready for anything to survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
