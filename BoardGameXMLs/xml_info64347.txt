							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King of Fishermen</name>
									
			<description>Players are fishermen and must go out to the sea and catch a variety of fish and later sell it in the market. The winner is the player that sells the most fish, but each player can only sell 3 types of fish and get the corresponding score. The remaining fish types will instead be subtracted from the score. Most important is the that the player can take the fish from the net at any time, so that it's difficult for other players to guess if and when a player will do this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
