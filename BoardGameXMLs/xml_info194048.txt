			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a spoiled rich girl, she had few boundaries and revelled in her freedom. As part of a sorcerous legacy inducted into a secret society when her abilities manifested though, she was overwhelmed with all the Order's laws and the soul-crushing number of people whose authority she could not ignore. Desperate for the liberties she once enjoyed, she plotted to eliminate the parents she felt betrayed her. Now LORELEI is free to do what she wants, when she wants, and with her power there is no law nor hero who can stand in her way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
