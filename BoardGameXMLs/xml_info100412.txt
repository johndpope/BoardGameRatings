			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;It Came from the Desert&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TurboGrafx CD version was released in 1992. It was a CD-ROM based game that made use of full motion video with recorded sequences of live actors. There were also action sequences that used drawn graphical elements (not captured, as seen in games such as Mean Streets by Access Software). The side-scrolling action sequence consisted of the player battling ants in tunnels. The TurboGrafx CD version did reuse the graphical elements from the computer version for the overhead battle sequences, but not for any of the character conversation segments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, this version was marred by poor quality of the video playback of the system, and the limitations of the game console hardware that resulted in side scrolling arcade sequences that were tacky in terms of gameplay. The acting in the video sequences was of B-movie quality by intention, keeping in-line with the source material that served as an inspiration for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken from the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The little desert town of Lovelock is in trouble.  Atomic testing has created giant mutant ants lead by the Ant Queen of Badness... The Antmind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Dr. Horton Pangborne's assistant, you must find a way to stop the ants before they build an A-Bomb and wipe Lovelock off the map.  The townfolks don't believe there's a problem and some of them are even under Antmind control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;Playing the role of Buzz Lincoln, high-school senior, locate the Queen's nest and destroy her before the Ants' atomic bomb is completed.  Avoid being injured, captured or destroyed.  Listen carefully for clues.  Collect evidence that will convince the Air National Guard to join the fight against the Antmind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stages of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;It Came From the Desert takes place over eight days.  Each day is divided into 3 parts - morning, afternoon and evening.  Each part contains up to 6 or more scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
