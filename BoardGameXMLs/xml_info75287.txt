			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TMNT is a beat 'em up video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft for the Game Boy Advance handheld video game console. It is based on the 2007 CGI movie which was released in the US on March 22, 2007. It was first released in North America on March 20, 2007, and was later released in Australia on March 22, 2007, and in Europe on March 23, 2007. This game was also released on the Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, GameCube, PC, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation Portable video game consoles, though this version is vastly different from any of the others released, it being a 2.5-D side-scrolling beat-'em-up game involving no three-dimensional game play whatsoever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
