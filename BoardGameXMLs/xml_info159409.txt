			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; from the Kickstarter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposing Forces is a 192-page RPG sourcebook for Fate Core. The first 48 pages details tactical rules and gives advice for running scenes of physical, social, and mental conflict. The remaining pages detail 135 pre-generated characters and archetypes for the Core system, addressing the three archetypal genres of sci-fi, fantasy, and modern settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advice and rules are designed to enable a more precise understanding of the system in order to provide players with a meaningful challenge and balanced experience. The pre-generated characters are meant to provide the Game Master with easily accessible NPCs, story hooks, and more efficient prep time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book itself is divided into four parts. Part one is the technical stuff that addresses the rules as a function of the game. It contains observations about conflict types and breaks down the math behind the Fate Core system. It discusses the use of Fate Points as a tactical tool, and explains how the tactical system in Fate materially differs from traditionally crunchy tactical sims. Finally, it provides several pages of Aspects and Stunts alongside a few words of explanation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parts two, three, and four consist of the characters and archetypes built ready for use in any Fate Core conflict. The characters are divided into the sci-fi, fantasy, and urban genres, and further subdivided into physical, mental, and social opponents. Characters appear at different challenge levels ranging from three kinds of nameless NPCs to fully realized characters ready to be dropped into an existing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The good folks at Evil Hat gave us some very helpful guidelines to construct NPCs for our games, but precious few examples. And nothing ready to go. The basic idea here is that GMs can flip to the archetype they need, jot a note, tweak an attribute if necessary, and be ready to run a conflict at the drop of an (Evil) hat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
