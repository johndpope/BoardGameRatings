			<description>Familjecharader is a word guessing game, a variant of the classic Charades. This is a family variant of the game with cards with pictures on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains of 100 cards. Each card has 1 picture on them, eg a shark, a pencil or a rocking horse. The players are divided into two teams. One person in a team looks at one card, and must get the other persons in the team to guess what was depicted on the card with gestures, to get one point for the team. To do sounds (not words) is ok. The charade must be done in a specific amount of time. Then it is the other teams turn. The team with most point in the end of the game, eg 10 rounds, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
