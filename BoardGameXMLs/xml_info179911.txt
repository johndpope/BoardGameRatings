			<description>The game theme is about the USS Los Angeles rigid airship, designated ZR-3, which was built in 1923&amp;ndash;1924 by the Zeppelin company in Friedrichshafen, Germany as war reparation. It was delivered to the United States Navy in October 1924 and after being used mainly for experimental work, particularly in the development of the American parasite fighter program, was decommissioned in 1932.&lt;br/&gt;Players are rolling dice and travels along the routes (two different routes in red and blue colors), which crosses Atlantic Ocean (from Germany to US). The first player, who cross the finish line, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
