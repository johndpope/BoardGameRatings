			<description>This game is based on the Disney movie Aladdin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his own Aladdin figure in his color. The players try as fast as possible to get to the palace of the Sultan trying to get the most valuable treasures on their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement of the figures is card driven. Player plays 1 card from 2 each round and gets after the action is done a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are the following card types&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Aladdin cards: for moving 1 to 5 fields (exact)&lt;br/&gt;    Carpet cards: moving to the next carpet field.&lt;br/&gt;    Dschafar cards: 1 opponent player has to pause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the card played has the same color as the last on the trash pile. The player can play an additional card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are Special fields (so called wonder caves). If a figure passes it, he gets a treasure Card without looking on the value.&lt;br/&gt;If he hits the field. The player is allowed to check the value and to decide if he wants this or a blind new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 3 different wishes, he is allowed to use in his turn (1 Opponent 6 fields back, all opponents back 1 to 3 fields, himself 4 fields in front) Maximum 1 wish/turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the palace the player can choose 1 of 4 open treasures (value 1-4) if he is the first. Otherwise one of the remaining&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Ends when all figures are in the palace. The player with the most valuable treasures gets Jasmin as his wife and wins the game. If 2 have equal treasures the first arrived player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
