							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lochfell&#039;s Secret</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hollyvyre saw her husband eaten right before her eyes by a giant sea monster that walked on water. That same day, a young man found his mother's grave dug up -- and his mother's body missing. Are the two events connected? What would a sea monster want with corpses? Drop this free online adventure for D&amp;amp;D v3.5 by Eric Haddock into your campaign world wherever there is a small port town. Suitable for four 15th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stories of misfortune are often exaggerated, especially when they have been retold many times. For that reason, most people aren't taking seriously the claim that a sea monster living along the coast is eating whole ships full of sailors and swallowing entire families. But there's no denying a few facts -- the town of Lochfell is losing its citizens to a sea monster (one that walks on water no less), someone is stealing that same town's dead, and ships are beginning to choose other ports for unloading their goods. Such a scenario could doom the residents of the small port town to either a monster's gullet or the poorhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one seems to know whether the town's two ongoing problems are connected, but the sea monster never leaves behind a corpse to bury. Is it collecting bodies for some dark purpose? Or did some more powerful evil creature create the sea monster to do its dirty work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone in Lochfell knows the answer, and it's up to the PCs to find it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
