			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Location: Abandoned CABAL Research Facility. Zone Designation R5. Sector 113, Grid Falstaff.&lt;br/&gt;Estimated Resistance: Brotherhood 23rd Attack Squadron &amp;ldquo;Howling Horsemen&amp;rdquo; - Banshee heavy attack fighters.&lt;br/&gt;CABAL Prototype Nether Obelisk. Possible Project ReGenesis cybernetic soldiers onsite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The situation is grave, commander. In the wake of the Firestorm crisis, we thought that CABAL was gone. Turns out Kane went the extra mile, and had a backup of CABAL&amp;rsquo;s programming fragmented and scattered to a few isolated research stations. One of them was destroyed, but due to the resilient nature of the CABAL program, the others are putting new pieces back where they lost code. These backup programs could be more dangerous than CABAL itself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re sending in a strike force to one of these stations. We&amp;rsquo;re not reading any life signs from our satellite observation, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything. Records from the last mission to take down a CABAL core indicate that it was protected primarily by automated defenses and cybernetic organisms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your team is our best hope. Good luck, commander.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player Information&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place in the Tiberium universe of the Command and Conquer series. In the timeline, it takes place shortly before the Third Tiberium War. When creating your character, feel free to take advantage of some 15 years of gaming history, since all technology up to and including Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is accessible. The briefing assumes that the  party is composed of GDI Commandos, but as the original CABAL was taken down by a joint operation, there could be NOD  personnel attached to the mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicles can be taken in the same manner as Sidekicks and Shieldmates, and when piloted allow the driver (and any other crew members able to contribute, such as gunners and sensor operators) to take part in a team with the vehicle as the leader. Since Sidekicks can&amp;rsquo;t have a higher Cliche level than the owner, you won&amp;rsquo;t be rolling about in a Mammoth Mk.III, but you could operate a Titan or a Predator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons are considered Tools of the Trade, and can include railguns, sonic emitters, grenade launchers, sniper rifles, assault rifles, rocket launchers, and a variety of other implements of destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
