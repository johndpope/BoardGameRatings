			<description>Back of box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hear Ye, Brave Warrior,&lt;br/&gt;THE TALE OF THE GEMSTONE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the dawn of time, the Creators of Heaven, Earth, and the Netherworld entrusted the magical Gemstone to Mankind. Using the Gemstone to focus the Earth's natural magic, Man was able to create a veritable Paradise. Prosperity and happiness spread far and wide in the Golden Light, and peace reigned supreme for time immemorial...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...Until now--for the Wave of Darkness has extinguished the Golden Light. Stricken with envy and greed, the loathesome creatures of the Netherworld have stolen the wellspring of all that is good: The Gemstone! Not content with the depravity of their theft, they dared to split asunder this Gift of the Gods into five pieces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time has come, brave warrior, for you to descend into the Caverns of Horror. You must call on every ounce of courage, strength and will as you fight your way through the treacherous labyrinths guarded by black-hearted Demons and their base servants. Locate all five Pieces and return the Gemstone to the temple altar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like those who have gone before (and never returned), you carry the prayers of all Mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GEMSTONE WARRIOR is more than an exciting arcade game. It give you the thrill of heart-pounding action, beautifully animated Hi-Res color graphics--and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gemstone Warrior is a thinking being. Crossbow, fireballs and magic are only part of his arsenal. He carries one more weapon which sets him apart: WISDOM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must provide his wisdom. We will provide the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
