							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Time Wars: Supreme Command – Core Set: Humanity</name>
									
			<description>Arm your Time Travelers and duel for control over the Timeline. Stack the deck, bluff your foes, orchestrate your strategy, and take your chances as you take command in the TIME WARS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather a Strike Team of Time Travelers. Arm them with high-tech weapons and tools. Duel for control over the lives and events in the Timeline. Achieve your Goals&amp;hellip; or foil those of your foes. Bluff your opponents, and bide your time, waiting for the right moment to strike, and collapse the Timeline. As one version of the past crumbles into oblivion, another will rise in its place. The battlefield is history. The stakes the future. Which future will you fight for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Time Wars: Supreme Command, you will become the Supreme Commander of your own Time Corps. Assembling your Strike Team allows you to dictate the flow of history, so that it meets your Goals, or thwarts the attempts of your foe. Time is your only currency. Each turn, your one choice will make or break your strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the world&amp;rsquo;s first Deck Stacking Game, there are no discard piles in this card game. Instead, when something is discarded, you decide whether it goes on the bottom of your deck, or your opponent&amp;rsquo;s. Streamline your strategy by removing cards from your deck that you can&amp;rsquo;t use. But be careful, as everything you give up could be used against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engage your opponents in deep strategy over and over again with a game that only takes minutes to learn and play. Two players can play right out of the box. With each additional Core Set, you can add another two players to the experience in team battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
