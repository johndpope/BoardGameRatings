			<description>In the not too distant future the hydrocarbons have run out! But not to worry, because nuclear power is here and it&amp;rsquo;s totally safe&amp;hellip; honest. Sure there have been some mishaps along the way, but today&amp;rsquo;s super clean super efficient nuclear powerplants are a true wonder of modern science.  The technology has come so far so fast that it has left a trail of obsolete and faulty industrial sites in its wake. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry though these relics of the nuclear revolution are nothing to be concerned about.  They&amp;rsquo;re mostly away from the populated safe-zones, they&amp;rsquo;re guarded by very competent Securobot staff and in a lot of them rad-levels are approaching acceptable.  It&amp;rsquo;s in these crumbling industripolis that we find our setting for Atom Raider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atom Raiders are the dregs of society, a kind of Atomic scavenger they trawl dead powerplants for the old unstable and yet very lucrative fissionable material.  Mostly it&amp;rsquo;s locked away in huge old reactor stores and normally guarded by the stupid but formidable securobots.  The only law force that can put up with those kind of rad-levels for more than a few shifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Atom Raider misdirection is the name of the game. Infiltrating players guide their stealthy Raiders through the darkened maze of corridors using subterfuge, bluffs, feigns and cunning to be the first to reach the reactor doors. The Securobot player must use his memory and powers of deduction to uncover which of the abandoned facility&amp;rsquo;s many shadows conceal the nefarious Raiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is very simple, but varies greatly with the number of players. The gaurds player has two guards under his control and may move them 1D6 each. If a guard managed to draw a line of sight to a shadow they can reveal it. If it contains a Raider then they are discovered and for them the game is up! The Raider players similarly have 2D6 which they get to use to move any shadow that they like. Could be the shadow with the Raider under, could be a bluff. If they make it to a vault with a Raider still undiscovered then they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
