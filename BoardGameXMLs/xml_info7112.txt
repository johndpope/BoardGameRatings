			<description>Often misquoted as &amp;quot;the monster game of modern warfare&amp;quot;, NATO Division Commander is a much-maligned SPI WWIII title that, because of being widely misunderstood, is often more studied than played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Described in the rules as a &amp;quot;battalion level simulation of conflict in contemporary Europe&amp;quot;, NATO Division Commander gradually introduces players to the most complex version of mechanics through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty, the easiest of which is simple, fun, can be expanded, and should not be avoided.  When completely addressed, the game is a War College-level education on the conduct of World War III operations at Division/Brigade level between NATO and Soviet forces. The game system builds on the combat-as-part-of-movement late-SPI systems such as Next War and Fifth Corps, and has as one of its basic premises the idea that unit strength is subordinate to tactical and command considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central to its uniqueness, NATO Division Commander contains two identical mapboards and rules for Controller play, producing a refereed, double-blind, fog-of-war effect which is still unique today, more than 30 years after publication.  The game includes solitaire and face-to-face rules to help controllers build up their knowledge of the game, and decide what they will include, and what slows the game down too much for their taste: thus allowing the game experience to be controlled for the players' experience and expectations. It also allows testing of scenarios before controller use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios are comprehensive and infinitely flexible, which makes demands of controllers, and offer a unique playing experience for those peering down the gun barrel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 1200 counters, rule books, and a pile of playing aids, NATO Division Commander still is, the one true smorgasbord of World War III land-based operational simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
