			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All characters in the game are performers of some sort.  Characters have two Attributes, Abandon and Stillness, which provide a potential bonus to action resolution die rolls.  Abandon represents raw, creative energy.  Stillness represents control and measured focus.  During play, characters also track two additional traits - Dream and Nightmare - that reflect their metaphysical progress as a performer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in phases called, appropriately, Acts.  Additionally, the game document is formatted somewhat like a playbill or script, which is a nice presentation touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
