			<description>From the publisher&amp;acute;s website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which fairy tale hero would you like to be? The Dragon or the Princess? Lets make it a surprise instead! &lt;br/&gt;Pick a card and let the magic begin! Only the others can see who you have become, don't even try to look into the mirror! Your task is to ask clever questions and guess who you are based on the answers of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to guess who or what he/she turned into (what creature the card depicts) the first player has to ask questions from the other players but they can only answer with &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br/&gt;For example: &lt;br/&gt;- Am I human? Boy? Girl? Etc... The well known fairy tales can help you in coming up with the questions. If the first player successfully guesses who or what he/she has been turned into, he/she can look at the card and keep it and it is the next players turn. If the first player is unable to guess the card, you should set it aside. Before you start the game you should agree upon how many times you want to change (how many cards one player can pick during the game) and the player with the most cards at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
