							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The adventures and luck of the Municipal Academy of Fine Arts &amp; Friends</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As long as you can remember, the Municipal Academy of Fine Arts has been famous for its evening classes on drawing, sculpting, etching, painting art history and art appreciation. You and many of your friends have attended these courses and have become accomplished hobby artists or free-time art aficionados.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But more than that, the Municipal Academy of Fine Arts has been famous... or infamous... for its field trips and the adventures that go with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You see, regularly the MAoFA organizes a day out to go and see an exposition or visit a famous museum... Those outings are open to all members, ex-members, family and friends and so regularly a bunch of artsy people hit the road for a fun day. And it is not that it is planned that way, but invariably something always happens: The last time you visited the museum of ancient history, you got caught up in a standoff between two cursed mummies. The last time you visited the zoo, you had to fight off an escaped gorilla slowly growing to King-Kong size... An invitation to a poetry reading got you mingled up in the persecution of dissident writers in Absurdistan... Hell even something as innocent as a picnic by the lake turned a hair-raising adventure. (Okay you couldn't know that the spot you choose for the campfire was also used as breeding ground of the local variety of the Loch Ness were-turtle... But what the heck, Sh-- happens.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, the MAoFA is famous. Its field trips are infamous and it takes a special kind of guy or gal to participate in one of those trips despite all the rumors and warnings. It takes an even more special kind of guy or gal to live through one of these trips and then sign up for the next one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are this kind of guy, you are this kind of gal and you just received an invitation for the next field trip. True to your reputation you sign up immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From here, the adventure takes over...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
