Within these pages you will find stories of danger and glory, learn about the mysterious jinn, and find fuel enough for any imagination! This great and wondrous tome is divided into three section for your reading pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 14 page section covers general information concerning the Sultanate and its people.

We cover the same topics above, but with a specific focus on how they apply with each city. Hundreds of new locations provide you with plenty of places to visit, explore, and shop! Dare you brave the House of Screams? Do you have the coin to shop in the Jinn Market?

The author has provided further information through the use of sidebars! Here are such thing as universities (and how heroes can enrol on courses), three new magical Arcane Backgrounds, rules and advice covering libraries, hiring sages, working for a living, and scribing tomes of lore, as well as information on the lesser jinn and thieves guilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
