							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">X-Men: Destiny</name>
									
			<description>In X-Men: Destiny, players are put in the role of new mutants who join the X-Men or the Brotherhood of Mutants; they have to make choices to decide the ultimate destiny of their character. X-Men: Destiny places an emphasis on &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot;, as opposed to a more traditional linear type of gameplay. According to the official press release, &amp;quot;the all-new original video game casts players as new mutant recruits in a rich, branching storyline that features a deep element of choice and gives players ultimate control of their destiny&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game, players collect power enhancements called &amp;quot;X-Genes.&amp;quot; Every X-Gene can unlock three types of abilities: offensive, defensive, and utility. X-Genes can be mixed and matched as the player sees fit for a unique experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;X-Men: Destiny&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
