							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Real Time Tower Defense</name>
									
			<description>The Darkness looms and your master is the only one who can banish it. It will take him 4 days. You, his apprentices, must defend him till he has finished casting his spell or be forever plunged into darkness. Your only hope is to build the powerful arcane defenses handed down to you by your master; Powerful towers. Time is of the essence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real Time Tower Defense is a real time co-operative boardgame for 2-4 players that plays in under 60 minutes. In what is a true tower defense game, players (the Apprentices) build towers to defend their base from the hordes of mindless monsters besieging them and survive 4 &amp;ldquo;Days&amp;rdquo; (Having at least 1 Team Health left without going below 1 at any point during the game). The game is played in real time, increasing the tension, giving players just enough time to do what they need to without overwhelming them. The game is run to a sound track which prompts players through the game (much like Space Alert or Escape but somewhere in between). There is a break between each &amp;ldquo;Day&amp;rdquo; giving players time to plan for the next while the difficulty of the game increases. Players also gather resources and build their towers in real time using a sand timer, meaning there are two aspects of the game competing for attention. Forget about one of these aspects and you will lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
