			<description>Metal Quest is set in unknown number of years after the end of modern human civilization. The survivors clustered into villages and began to live among the ruins, and those who fought the monsters and robots outside became known as hunters. You are one of them. Your job is to complete quest, trade and upgrade your vehicle in order to defeat monsters and outlaws and collect bounties on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL YOU NEED TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;6 or more six sided dice, pencil, paper (for recording Gold and monster&amp;rsquo;s Armour) and a cutting tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to collect as many Bounty Point as possible before the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY is divided into 3 phases:&lt;br/&gt;1. UPKEEP&lt;br/&gt;2. MOVE&lt;br/&gt;3. ACTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPKEEP. During upkeep you unflip your player card. If doom counter is activated (i.e first boss token are drawn). Roll 1 die, if the result is 1 move the doom counter forward 1 step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOVE. You move your character 1 step anywhere except diagonally. Whenever you move, you must draw 1 encounter token and resolve it usually Combat encounter, whenever you win or not put the encounter token face up next the the encounter pile. If you skipped this phase, no encounter card are drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACTION. During this phase you may resolve your quest or make 1 Town Action (if you are in town). Each solved quest gives 1 Bounty Point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOOM COUNTER. When the first boss a drawn, the doom counter is activated, put the green skull token on the first circle of the doom counter. During upkeep player will roll 1 die; if the result is 1, move the token 1 step forward. If the token reaches the black skull, the game end with all player minus 10 BP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END GAME TRIGGER. The game ends when:&lt;br/&gt;(a) The Doom counter reaches the skull area which also means &lt;br/&gt;everyone did not manage to defeat the boss or bosses or&lt;br/&gt;(b) Someone manages to defeat all the boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOUNTY POINTS At the end of the game. Total up your Bounty points (BP). Each quest is 1 BP, each boss is 5 BP, every 10G you got you received 1BP. The Doom Counter reaches the skull area minus 10 BP. The winner is player with the most BP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
