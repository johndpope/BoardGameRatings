			<description>Trumpalar  Based on the book &amp;quot;The Riddle of the Trumpalar&amp;quot; by Judy Bernard-Waite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to be the first to travel from the Trumper Tree, through the tunnels marked on the large colorful gameboard, to the Throne of the Trumpalar.  As the game progresses, players are given the opportunity to choose between improving their own position or placing one or more of their opponents at a disadvantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by entering the Throne of the Trumpalar, which can only be achieved through the tunnel indicated on the spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
