			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with exactly four players and no game master.  The players are defined roles including the infamous bandit Tajomaru, a wife, a woodcutter, and a dead husband (a samurai whose spirit is channeled by a psychic).  After distributing characters a d4 roll secretly is made by each player (except the woodcutter) to determine which other player they blame for the murder of the husband.  Play then proceeds in one turn with each player making narrative statements which must be congruous with all previously established facts.  Players take their turn in an established order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
