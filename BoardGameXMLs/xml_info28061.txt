							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Card Golf</name>
									
			<description>Card Golf is essentially the game of golf in a box. It can be played alone or with a group of two, three or four players. Each player is randomly dealt 14 club cards. The game is played and scored using a scorecard from any golf course in the world. Players must combine the club card yardage in their hand to match or exceed, by as little as possible, the yardage of each hole on the scorecard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
