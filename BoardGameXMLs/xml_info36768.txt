							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stadion: yleisurheilupeli</name>
									
			<description>Stadion is a track and field sports game featuring 14 running, 4 jumping and 4 throwing events. Basically all the events are played by spinning a pointer and then determining the result from the appropriate look-up table: how many spaces to proceed, how long the jump attempt was, how many hundredth of a second to add etc. The usual sports event rules are applied as well, e.g. there are three attempts for each height in high jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to: Kansojen Kisat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
