							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New Game of Divers or Hidden Treasure</name>
									
			<description>This game from Parker Brothers takes a concept used by early fishing games and re-themes it to divers trying to hook sunken treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a fold-out cardboard &amp;quot;tank&amp;quot; about 9&amp;quot; square and 6.5&amp;quot; high. Each wall contains a mesh-covered arch through which players can see to some extent what they are doing. There are two foot-long wooden poles, each with a string dangling from one end leading to a 2.5&amp;quot;-tall deep-sea diver figure with a small metal hook at its feet. The treasure consists of small cardboard rectangles, each with a metal loop projecting from the back, and the type of treasure (gold, silver, jewels) printed on the bottom with a value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The treasures are placed value down at the bottom of the tank, and players must dangle their divers over the wall, twisting the rods to try and hook the treasures. The game can be played as a race between two people that lasts until all the treasure has been retrieved. Or it can be played by more people, with each player getting three minutes to hook as much as possible. Either way, the largest value of treasure (not number of catches) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
