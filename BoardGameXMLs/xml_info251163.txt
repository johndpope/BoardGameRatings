			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re playing a high fantasy RPG, right?  But how does it get to be high fantasy?  Where do all the spell casters come from?  They come from the schools, the Universities of Magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magical colleges can be fascinating places to thrill the player characters, but they are also dangerous when it comes to game balance.  Walking that tight rope isn&amp;rsquo;t easy, and a little advice goes a long way.  That&amp;rsquo;s what this book is about.  What universities can there be?  How do they fit into the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; life and culture of their home cities.  And are they actually playing magical sports?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a ton of new ideas, ideas you can easily use in your existing game world or use to craft a new game world, then Small Bites is what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 14 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 43 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
