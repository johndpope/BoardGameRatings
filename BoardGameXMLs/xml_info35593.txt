			<description>As the instructions say this game &amp;quot;take players down the college trail.&amp;quot; The game is simple roll and move with a little twist of having to roll a special die at semester finals time to figure out your GPA. In the beginning your first rolls will determine if you want to go Greek or not, as well as paying tuition, eventual you land on a major and then as you go, you face different paths to take and if you want a bachelors, masters or doctorate. Each major has a different pay rating and is of course dependent on your level of degree. You also earn points for each semester according to GPA and there is a scale as to how much you make. To win  you have to graduate and the game ends with everyone graduating and the winner is the one with the most money. If you reach graduation first don't worry you continue to collect money each round without having to do anything. Also the game was distributed in a long tube and the game board is vinyl that rolls up nicely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
