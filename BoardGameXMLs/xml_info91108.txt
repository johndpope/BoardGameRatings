			<description>DX-Ball is a freeware computer game for the PC first released in 1996 by Michael P. Welch. The game, an updated version of an earlier series of Amiga games known as Megaball, is patterned after classic ball-and-paddle arcade games such as Breakout and Arkanoid. It became a massive cult classic in the Windows freeware gaming community during the late 1990s. A level editor was made available as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically a Breakout clone: you bounce a ball off a paddle at the bottom hitting different color blocks on the top of the screen. Hitting all the blocks results in completing the level and going to the next. There are 50 levels to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;DX-Ball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
