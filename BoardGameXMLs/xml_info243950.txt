							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Axe of Kardak</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bear, distracted by his meal, did not notice Kardak until he had crept within a few dozen feet of the beast. Kardak's elk skin snow boots crunched along the ice and the enormous bear turned to face the half-starved barbarian. Kardak took off his thick gloves and hefted his un-blooded axe. The Great Ice Bear stood up and bellowed out a roar that shook the mountains in the distance. For the first time in his life Kardak felt the cold spear of fear in his gut. He pushed down the unfamiliar feeling and roared back his own challenge to the wall of fur and teeth before him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His heart pounded like a blacksmith and his assistant hammering a block of freshly smelted steel. His ears roared with blood. His hands began to shake from the cold and from the fear. His eyes never left the great bear's deep black orbs though. The bear roared again, slobber and bits of whale-flesh flying from the terrible maw. The sound ripped through Kardak's heart but he stood firm, frozen to the ground. He stood his ground in the bitter cold and gusting wind. To run was to die. If he had to die, he would die with his axe buried in the flesh of this beast, the greatest of Ice Bears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF gives you the history, stats and powers for the Axe of Kardak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
