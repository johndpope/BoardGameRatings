			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the period of years from 2001 to 2003 a third world war took place! It was terminated by a massive nuclear bomb. The effect of the explosion and radioactive storm that followed was not restricted to the super powers; its effect was felt all over the world. The devastation caused resulted in a new life for the world's inhabitants - that of primitive cavemen. In this now desolate landscape the only creature to survive is the 'Krackat', a mutated turtle-like creature whose only diet is that of human flesh! Your only hope of survival is to kill the ever increasing numbers of Krackats. You perform this by pushing the pieces of rock (which form the maze walls) onto the Krackats. Background radiation is rising, thus you must complete this task before the rocks disintegrate or you die of radiation sickness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
