			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quiet down Crusader! Look, I got the room at half price and it comes with a hot meal. When was the last time we had a warm meal on this trip? Who is the person who pulled the arrow out of your back? That&amp;rsquo;s right, it was me. Don&amp;rsquo;t scold me, with that look. So what if it was me that put it there. That&amp;rsquo;s besides the point,&amp;rdquo; Amourgin carried on with his long winded excuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melinda, the crusader, still didn&amp;rsquo;t trust her hired lackey. The last time she woke up with several gold coins missing from the church funds purse. However, she did also wake up to find a freshly polished shield, breakfast, and her old battle standard stitched up. &amp;ldquo;So what you are saying is you still only booked one room?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Boss, it was the last room. Trust me,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a common fact, that behind every great successful adventuring party, there is a member of the group that does all the grunt work. They always carry the party&amp;rsquo;s inventory list and its contents, making sure that everyone is feed, and that there are enough chairs at the table. They are valued members and are never left out of the group, but push the others along when their hopes are down. They spur the group forward with planning, preparation, and motivation, while taking care of all the jobs no one realizes need to be done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They may be the side kick, the gal Friday, the number one henchperson, mook, or even a butler. No matter the title, they are the source of a plethora of momentum that stirs the party, known to each other as momenta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Momenta are unique in their ability to alter the initiative of a combat, give their allies extra actions, and carry all the loot they can handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 11 page PDF product includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 Momenta base class&lt;br/&gt;    3 Pathfinder Compatible Archetypes: Tough and Minstrel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
