			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Species and Societies is a companion Thunderegg Productions' popular book, Character Webs, although either book can be used standalone. This book features systems that allow you to randomly or directly create new species for your games, and a series of kits that convert these species into PC-playable races for six, yes, six different RPG systems!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also features a generator for the cultures in which your new species live and a system for simulating the treachery and diplomacy between socieites. As a bonus, we've included a section on creating words and names in various new languages to provide an extra bit of flavor for your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've provided support for The 13th Age Roleplaying Game, Dungeon World, Fate Core, Legend, The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Traveller. Each of these game systems gets new rules for designing your own playable races. And the book features a new, playable race for each game system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is designed to be printer friendly. In general each section is self-contained and all you need for each sub-system fits on one page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
