			<description>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played using 1/72 scale miniature figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ticonderoga was a French fort near Lake Champlain in Upper New York state. It acted as a guard to the approach to Quebec. In 1758, the British-American army under the command of Gen. Abercrombie and Lord Howe were to take the fort while Gen. Amherst was to capture the Fortress of Louisbourg. Only Amherst was successful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ticonderoga was a star shaped fort but the main fighting took places in a series of outer works away from the fort. The area was bordered by two rivers and the area was also swampy. An amazing fact of this battle was that it was completely fought by infantry without artillery support.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game table should be two meters by one meter. The French set up on the north side of the table. Green felt can be used to denote the flat open area, blue strips should simulate the rivers. Brown cloth, paper or battlefield accessories can be used to model the French trenches and abatis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
