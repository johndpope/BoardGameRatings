							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Emptied Coffin</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Emptied Coffin takes place primarily on the far away and mysterious world of Jove's Descent. The events are centered around a series of occurrences, starting with a chamber of the enigmatic Omega Vault opening and drawing the Kill-team to the wasted ruins of the Ghanathaar to uncover the forces that originally wiped the race of xenos out, and to stop a similar fate from befalling the Imperial forces of the Achilus Crusade. The mission is complicated by a series of mishaps that initially seem coincidental, but later betray the inhuman intellect that is the driving force behind a burgeoning apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Emptied Coffin is a complex adventure featuring many different adversaries as the Kill-team attempts to follow a mysterious clue unveiled by the Omega Vault. The judges really liked the adventure&amp;rsquo;s unique take on one of the lesser known xenos races of the Reach, as well as the Watch-Captain integration within the overall plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
