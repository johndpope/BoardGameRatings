			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EveryGame Redux lets you play a large selection of games on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everygame Redux allows you to play with multiple devices via bluetooth.  This will help keep player hands hidden, but if you only have one device it still isn't a problem as you can keep them off screen, and pass the single device around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everygame Redux allows you to save games, and even playback moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, EveryGame Redux does not have an A.I. opponent.  Which means you will need to have your friends to play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The app comes with a lot of games, and more are to be added as time goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game list-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eurogames:&lt;br/&gt;Castle Capers&lt;br/&gt;Cities of Calvino&lt;br/&gt;Pirates Vs Ninjas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Selections:&lt;br/&gt;Fences (by Pokke)&lt;br/&gt;Freez!
