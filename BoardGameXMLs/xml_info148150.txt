							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cell Block 17</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell Block 17 is a full-color, 32 x 30 inch, floor plan of a prison block, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sergeant: &amp;quot;Objective met, but they captured our squadmate.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;Command: &amp;quot;Mission is completed. Return to base.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;Sergeant: &amp;quot;What was that last order command? You are breaking up.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;Command: &amp;quot;Rrrr...&amp;quot; [Sergeant makes static sounds and then turns off the radio].&lt;br/&gt;Sergeant: &amp;quot;Our new objective is freeing the rookie. We either all return to base alive or we die trying.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sci-Fi Cells is a science fiction prison module that includes a prison with eight prison cells with an external hallway that matches the presentation of our Sci-Fi Tiles. This allows the module to be used with our Sci-Fi Tiles product as well as the Grey Matter Games product Deadly Missions: Sector 15. The product has eight prison cells, allowing for many more prisoners to be captured in one area than the currently used personal quarters which can only hold 1 prisoner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is meant to be used in near and far future science-fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies have captured a player character or a Game Master ally. The rest of the group enters the sci-fi prison in order to break them out of the sci-fi cells. The group needs to intimidate, subdue, or kill the prison guards in the hallway, prison room, and security hub and then release the electronic or magnetic locks on the sci-fi cells where their friends are held. Some complications could happen here if they accidentally release some extremely hostile prisoners while releasing their friends, such as a captured creature or alien. After freeing their friends, the really tough part begins where they all need to escape the sci-fi prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
