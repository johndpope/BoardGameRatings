			<description>From the web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TA3 is a complete guide to privately owned ground vehicles in the Traveller Universe. On the Ground expands on the design sequences found in the Traveller's Handbook, giving tips on vehicle construction and details on such things as &amp;quot;how big is my vehicle&amp;quot; and even rules on towing! There are tips on power plants and what kind of tires to use on some vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vehicles in this issue range from steam powered carriages to sleek perfomance motorcycles. These are the vehicles that your players will encounter everyday on most any planet at varied technological levels. Ever wonder how fast that heavy duty truck can go and how much punishment it can take before it falls apart leaving the character stranded? TA #3 tells you those things. Each of the 24 vehicles are fully illustrated and has a full description and vehicle design sequence stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also covered are the corporations that build and service these commercial and private vehicles that are used all across the Imperium! So, go down the the show room and pick out your favorite, select the color and drive off the showroom floor with a new vehicle for all your adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
