			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ahoy there, Kapt&amp;rsquo;n!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of pitting your players against the same old orcs and kobolds in every campaign?  Well give the swabbies somethin&amp;rsquo; to cheer about, and send them on a rip-roaring adventure with the Kroola!  Whether you&amp;rsquo;re roamin&amp;rsquo; the swamps, sailin&amp;rsquo; the seas, or just need a tough-as-nails mercenary to get the job done, the Kroola are ready for any kind of campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kroola are reckless, roving race of swashbuckling crocodile pirates that spend their lives chasing fun and treasure, wherever it may lay.  They are born in the swamps and raised aboard ships on the high seas, learning to fight for surivival, forage whatever they need, and take whatever they want.  A Kroola enjoys a fresh drink, likes a good fight, and loves a great prank, and isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to go overboard on any of the three!  After all, with a Kroola&amp;rsquo;s regenerative blood, it&amp;rsquo;ll all grow back, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With their tough hides and resilient bodies, a Kroola can play a vicious defender that won&amp;rsquo;t get pushed around.  They&amp;rsquo;re also slick and sneaky strikers who can take advantage of wild terrain to get the edge on an unsuspecting opponent.  A Kroola can come in many shapes, sizes and colors, from the small and crafty croc to the hulking Kroola Kolossus.  With their reckless attitude, their penchant for violence, their long toothy snouts and scaly hides, the Kroola make for an intimidating race that many folks consider the scourge of the seas.  But some landlubbers will never understand that a Kroola is just out to have some fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here at Poison Ivy Press, we don&amp;rsquo;t like to scrimp on the rations.  We give you access to the whole hoard, with somethin&amp;rsquo; for every member of your krew!  Here&amp;rsquo;s all the booty you get with the Kroola supplement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Kroola as a playable race, including a range of racial feats and the Kroola Kolossus paragon path&lt;br/&gt;     The ecology of the Kroola, including their physiology, settlements, and societies&lt;br/&gt;     Kroola characters, and advice on adventuring and roleplaying as a Kroola&lt;br/&gt;     New monsters, from the swarms they use as pets to unique Kroola villains like Kruncha the Pirate-King King!&lt;br/&gt;     Using Kroola in your campaigns, including sample locations and NPCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Break out the rum, boys! The Kroola have arrived!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
