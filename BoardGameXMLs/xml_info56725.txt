							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War in the Heavens: Hegemony</name>
									
			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever since the Vau gave humanity its first setback among the stars, their space has been shut to prying eyes. For a brief moment, however, it has opened - long enough for the most daring to catch a glimpse. But the daring need as much wisdom as courage, for encounters with the Vau teach that things are not always what they seem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this volume:&lt;br/&gt;Book One: Inception - A sourcebook explaining the histories and cultures of the Vau and the other sentient citizen races of the Hegemony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book Two: Elabi - The Vau are inviting select groups of Known Worlders to visit Vau worlds and open a dialogue between cultures. Inevitably, the question arises: What do they really want?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous installment in the War in the Heavens trilogy, Lifeweb, featured the shapechanging Symbiots. It is not necessary to own Lifeweb to use and enjoy Hegemony. The final installment will delve into the mystery of the Anunnaki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
