							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Its Harvest Time!</name>
									
			<description>A Game of farming and chance for 2-5 players. Players create their field, and roll for rain and harvest. Watch out for the drought! It can suck away any rain you have and keep you from a profitable harvest. Will you overcome the challenge and chance of farming to have the most profitable farm around?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin, players select crop tiles for their field. During gameplay, players roll four die, (with 3 chances to reroll) and play accordingly. Players receive rain, and from their stores, may choose to harvest their crops for points. However, rolling a drought depletes the rain already received, making it difficult to harvest the crops and thus receive points. Play goes around through several rounds until the final season, at which the winner is declared, who has the most harvest points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
