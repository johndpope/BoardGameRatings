			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this installment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A SIMIAN GENIUS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A SECRET SCIENCE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A FEARSOME REVENGE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;LOOK UPON ME, SIMPLE HUMANS, and know that you stand in the shadow of your better. I am Kongo, and I am potential realized -- transformed by science into something superior to man and beast alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There are many who will see me as a monster, and perhaps I am.

And above it all, the burning unquenchable thirst &amp;mdash; for REVENGE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locked in a secret war with the corrupt terror scientists of the Moreau Society, armed with strange technology, and in command of a horrifying array of mutated animal soldiers, woe betide any who stand against LORD KONGO!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulp Villains: Lord Kongo by Brandon Jerwa with Jarrod Feliciano, uses the Savage Worlds rules system, as featured in THRILLING TALES 2nd Edition. 41 pages, featuring fully-statted NPCs and adventure hooks, plus a collection of bonus files - 11x17 printable poster maps of Science City X and the Lost Island of Kura-Buto, as well as an 11-page quick reference guide featuring the stats of every NPC and creature featured in the supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
