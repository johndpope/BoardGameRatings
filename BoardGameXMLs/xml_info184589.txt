							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dino Egg Hunt!</name>
									
			<description>Dino Egg Hunt is a spin-and-move game designed to teach young children color recognition. It is included in the Get Ready for Kindergarten! book and game set by Sharon Hinchey. Tokens with pictures of dinosaurs or dinosaur eggs are places randomly face-down on the spaces of a loop-shaped track. Each player chooses a dinosaur playing piece and places it on a color-coded start space.  Each player in turn spins the spinner, moving one, two or three spaces.  As they moves, players secretly look at each token they land on.  If the egg on the token matches their dinosaurs' color, they keep the token.  If not, it is returned to its space face-down.  If a dinosaur appears on the token, the player immediately moves to that dinosaur's starting &amp;quot;nest&amp;quot; space and ends his or her turn.  Players may choose to move along one of two short cuts when they reach them.  The first player to collect all five eggs matching their color wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
