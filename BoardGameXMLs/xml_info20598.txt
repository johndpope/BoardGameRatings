							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lifesaver Game</name>
									
			<description>The Lifesaver Game provides a comfortable setting for parents to instruct children about the importance of safety and how to avoid dangerous situations. Children today live in a very active and sophisticated world. As a result, they need to know how to react to emergency situations. The best way to teach children is to make it fun. In the game, children and adults are asked safety questions and parents are encouraged to help the child get the correct answer. The child is rewarded with Lifesaver tokens for each correct answer. They could win a penny, five cents, a hug, a &amp;quot;stay up 1/2 later&amp;quot; token, etc. Honoring the tokens makes the family fun last long after the game is over. It also motivates children to play the game again and again, thus reinforcing principles of safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
