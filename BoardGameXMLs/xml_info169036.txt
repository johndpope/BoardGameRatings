			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within the northern highlands of Wisconsin prowls the Burning Crow cult. Dedicated to the proliferation of supernatural beasts, they are said to be the creators of new species. One often wonders how so many were-creatures are able to exist and the Burning Crow is just one explanation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Burning Crow represents a modern esoteric organization set within Shadowed Earth. The Burning Crow dedicates their lives to the protection of the natural world and their way of life through the use of old Celtic therianthropic rituals that imbue their bodies with the essence of an indigenous animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Burning Crow includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A brief look at the history of the Burning Crow cult.&lt;br/&gt;    Descriptions and stat blocks of its members.&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;    New werebeasts to throw at your players.&lt;br/&gt;    ... and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veiled Supplements #01: The Burning Crow is not a standalone game and requires the Entropic Gaming System core rulebook. Although designed to be used within a modern Shadowed Earth setting, such as Judgment Day, the OGL material can be used with any Entropic Gaming System product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
