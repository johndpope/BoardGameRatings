							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Let&#039;s Go Digging</name>
									
			<description>Players are archaeologists digging in rural areas and working together to unearth artifacts from different historical periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dig area is formed in the center of the table by creating a tableau of face-down cards in 4 rows of 6 overlapping cards. Only the top card of each row is available for play action. Players are then dealt a hand of action cards that allow them to move cards in the tableau, search the dig field, dig in one column of the field, or transfer cards to the collection site (in a separate area). &amp;quot;No Trespassing&amp;quot; cards will block digging in a particular column and force a player to play a (limited quantity) &amp;quot;Permit&amp;quot; card in order to access any artifacts locked above that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the 15th artifact or dirt sample card has been moved to the Collection Site or when players are blocked from moving any more cards.  Players count how many complete collections (groups of 3 cards representing the same historical period)they have managed to gather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
