							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wendo</name>
									
			<description>Wendo comes with a wooden board (with holes in a hexagon shaped pattern) and 18 wooden cylinders in black and white. The underside of all cylinders is marked yellow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces start at the edges of the board with their markings face-down and are moved in turn towards the center of the board. When they reach the center they are turned over and if they are jumped from another piece they are removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who first removes his pieces wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
