			<description>Young children's educational game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 different mini-boards, each consisting of five jigsaw-type pieces. There are five versions of play which can be intended for different age groups. All the games though relate to collecting pieces and forming complete boards. The games range from very simple where the players do little more than to complete 5 mini-boards each. The gameplay is negligible, Mum just piles up the pieces and then the children look for the pieces they are interest in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so each game adds a little more gameplay, ending with a game for three players where the pieces are traded back and forth. The winner is still the one who completes their assigned boards first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
