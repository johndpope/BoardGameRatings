			<description>World's End is an apocalyptic horror survival BOARD GAME where deceiving your teammates may either save your life or be the end of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be forced to work WITH, and AGAINST each other&lt;br/&gt;to ensure they survive and have the best chance to be the first to the escape helicopter leaving the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a lot of decisions to make as you try to escape the city. Every choice you make may affect who survives the apocalypse&amp;hellip;and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helping other players survive is a great way to make friends and may also help you along the way. Be warned: Lying to other players may give you a great advantage, however, it also may come back to bite you; depending on how good other players memories are and whether they desire vengeance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
