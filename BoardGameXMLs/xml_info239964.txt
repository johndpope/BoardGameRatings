			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The customer is always right! Can you quickly build the best burgers in this &amp;quot;grilling&amp;quot; competition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your fellow players work together at the best burger joint in town. But now it's time to see which team can claim the title of burger-flippin' champions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slamburger is the hands-on burger-building game for 4-6 players. Recommended for ages 6+, your family will flip, stack, and frantically work together to build the fastest burger while wearing &amp;ldquo;slamburger&amp;rdquo; gloves in this wild, hands-on game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Split into teams and race to stack all the ingredients for a deliciously delirious time to make the fastest burgers in town! The first team to complete 3 orders first wins. The game includes Slambuger gloves, double-sided condiment and bun tiles, order cards, and an order box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
