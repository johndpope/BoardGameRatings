			<description>Dino Bash is a short, but fun game first published in Roleplayer Independent (Volume 1, Issue 6 - May 1993).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple board game, designed to provide a little light relief between role-playing games scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based in a world where Dinosaurs have never died out.  There are three fractions, The Carnivores, The Herbivores and The Mammals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes places in the bar; The Jurassic Arms (A3 map provided with counters) and two six sided dice are required (miniatures could be useful).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has a simple profile which consists of three basic attributes; Wounds Points, Action Points and Combat Points, but also description on how they attack and any special attractions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of special items counters which the characters can pick up around the bar to help them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each fraction has a background which gives the player what&amp;rsquo;s they needs to do in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
