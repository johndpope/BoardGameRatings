			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Revenge is a real-time strategy game based in the FASA BattleTech universe. Developed by Westwood Studios for Mediagenic, and produced by Scott Berfield, it is a major milestone in the gaming industry in that the game serves as the prototype for what would later become Dune 2, the first real-time strategy title on the PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, The Crescent Hawk's Revenge was the turning point in PC strategy gaming, where a genre formerly dominated by turn-based titles would begin a massive shift towards real-time. Later Westwood titles, Dune 2 and Command &amp;amp; Conquer, would expand this newly-established real-time strategy gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
