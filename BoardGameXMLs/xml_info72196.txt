							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Society of Dreamers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Europe, in the early 19th century, a little-known group was formed. The members called themselves the Society of Dreamers. The Society believed that there were autonomous life forms living in people&amp;rsquo;s dreams. They called these creatures mnemosites. In this game, you and your friends play the Society of Dreamers, seeking to uncover the nature of the mnemosites with tools of science and mysticism. You will witness the childhood and youth of the members; the forming of the Society; and their investigation and - possibly - understanding of the mnemosite phenomenon. The game is written for 2-5 players and takes an evening to play. There&amp;rsquo;s no game master, and no need to prepare anything (beyond reading the rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
