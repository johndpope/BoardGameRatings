Youngest player goes first.  Roll the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll a Cootie part, take that part from the pile and place it in front of you.  If you already have that part, do nothing and pass the die to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;If you roll a picture with 3 Cootie parts you can choose any one of those parts.&lt;br/&gt;If you roll a red &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; you must put one of your parts back in the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll a picture of the die you can take another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.
