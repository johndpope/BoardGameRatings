			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tower defense game with 15 levels. Try to keep the heroes from taking your gems. There are three types of towers you can build: dens, crypts and temples. Dens can be placed on grass, crypts on snow and temples on rock. Dens fire quickly have a medium range and high attack strength. Crypts fire slowly, have a large range and high attack strength. Temples have a constant attack, medium power and short range. Each type of tower can be upgraded several times, and on your third upgrade you can choose between two paths of upgrade for the tower. In addition as you play the game you will earn experience. The experience can be used to permanently upgrade your abilities in one of three areas that correspond with the towers. Orcs, undead and demons. Each level can be passed with one of three rankings. Good, excellent and brilliant depending on how well you perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
