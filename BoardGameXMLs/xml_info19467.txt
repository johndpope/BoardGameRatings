			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;IF you aren't rich by the fourth week in this game, you're really upon hard times. Be prepared for a lot of razzing by the other players.  Once you are rich, see if you can stay that way. The big move could knock you flat. Or, another rich player could challenge you for all of your wealth. You'd better challenge him first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components are listed on the back of the box. Includes gameboard, dice, playing pieces, big move cards, unexpected expense cards, option cards, gold and silver bar cards, bankers FIC cards, play money, money tray, and rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
