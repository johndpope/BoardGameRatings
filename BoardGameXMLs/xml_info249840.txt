			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After decades of development, Kent David Kelly and Wonderland Imprints are proud to offer you the CASTLE OLDSKULL fantasy role-playing game system.  This first rules volume, OLDSKULL SWORD &amp;amp; SORCERY I:  BASIC PLAYER CHARACTERS features all the rules new players and Game Masters require to orient themselves in the fantasy world.  Here you will find rules, guidelines, and advice for creating newly-emboldened Player Characters in search of adventure in the unknown.  The Castle Oldskull Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery Adventure Game is designed in modular fashion, allowing you to progress and expand your realms with bold new challenges, wrought in a world of limitless imagination.  Additional volumes in this series detail character empowerment, level progression, dungeon adventuring, combat, Game Mastering, dungeon design, world design, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are a new player, or a new Game Master, or you don&amp;rsquo;t even know which is which yet and you want to find out what old school fantasy role-playing is all about, this is the book for you.  And if you are a veteran player or GM, you will find that this book includes many useful features which you can use to create a new campaign or to add intricate details to your own existing world.  Herein you will discover over 40 optional rules systems and tiers of complexity, bridging the Basic and Advanced rules in seamless fashion with your own customization decisions; detailed basic spell descriptions and rulings; balanced empowerment options for fighter and thieves; sacred weapons for clerics, by deity and alignment; clarified spell book rules for magic-users; comprehensive undead turning and binding rules; sanity rules which balance old school play and free will in a world threatened by Great Cthulhu and other Eldritch Horrors; three different cohesive saving throw systems, depending upon your complexity preference; detailed demi-human rules which separate and unify Basic and Advanced precepts; optional thieving skills for non-thieves; and in-depth alignment principles for both Basic (Lawful-Neutral-Chaotic) and Advanced alignment matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As both a supplement for existing games and a standalone comprehensive system, the Castle Oldskull Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery Adventure Game bridges divides by unifying schools of thought, without further separating players into a hundred warring tribes.  Choice within a universal framework is the key to system unity and customization.  This is a true basic learning guide to generating characters for fantasy role-playing, with fully explained paths and game design choices which any player or GM can uniquely command as his or her own creation.  Here you will find not just the rules and recommendations, but details revealing how to learn, how to gradually add complexity, reasons why systems are designed the way they are, and advice on how to play.  There is much lore and treasure to be had here, for both players and GMs of varying philosophies, whether they embrace Original, B/X, BECMI, or Advanced gaming at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is your first horizon to a greater unveiling world.  Book two in this series features full details on weapons, armor, shields, equipment, encumbrance, movement, languages, skills, proficiencies, and character customization.  Book three features full rules (and tactical advice) for all the basic tenets of dungeon adventuring:  home bases, rumormongering, preparation, hiring men-at-arms, journeying to the dungeon, exploration, mapping, scouting, stealth, wandering monsters, searching, encounters, surprise, initiative, parleying, combat, and more.  Future volumes will give Game Masters detailed advice on running the game, generating dungeons, and creating an entire world for decades&amp;rsquo; worth of play along with family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle Oldskull is not an upstart &amp;ldquo;me too&amp;rdquo; basic clone, merely repeating the rules without any original guidance or insight or innovative rules in play.  It is both a new game system and an established resource for existing fantasy role-playing-games, with seven years of publishing and thirty-seven years of play behind it.  It is enhanced with descriptive text, clarifications, comprehensiveness, modularity, design insight, freedom of choice, and flexibility.  You will decide what goes into your game, and what gets left out, and why.  And whenever you need further and affordable design assistance, be assured that there are already more than 20 silver-, gold-, and platinum-medal Castle Oldskull supplements ready and able to lend you a hand &amp;hellip; with many more on the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for?  This book represents the premiere of OSR S&amp;amp;S B/X Evolved, your own Gateway to Adventure.  Claim your kingdom from tyranny and dragons, and find your own true destiny in the dungeons which lie beneath.  Your fated fortune, in the dark or the light, awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
