			<description>&amp;quot;Armor Attacks: The Tank Platoon&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;an interactive exercise in small-unit tactics and leadership&amp;quot; written by John F. Antal, a United States Army armor officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pair of six-sided dice are required to play this solitaire game which is a variation on the Choose Your Own Adventure game book genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Armor Attacks, you take on the role of the leader of a U.S. Army M1 Abrams tank platoon. &amp;quot;Throughout the work, you will have an opportunity to make life-or-death decisions, and the story will develop according to the choices you make. As you progress through the book you will learn important tactical and operational lessons.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armor Attacks is illustrated and includes 11 maps. Appendices provide background information such as weapons data, friendly and enemy unit organizations, and tank fighting positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Antal wrote three books which used this system: Armor Attacks, Infantry Combat, and Combat Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
