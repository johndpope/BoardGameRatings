							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Basis Rules</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basis Rules is presented as HTML in eight major HTML divisions, including:  Introduction, Characters, Skill System, Combat, Other Rules, Equipment, Skill Descriptions, and Race Descriptions.  An index was planned but not completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is a generic, universal rules system.  The company intended to produce full genre support for:  Fantastic Horizons, Modern Horizons, Galactic Horizons, Cyberhorizons, and the campaign world of Kyrdalm.  However, only portions of the fantasy genre were completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation supports either point pool allocation or randomization (of a sort).  Character creation starts with Race, character history, and Initial Attributes.  Characters also have standard demographics.  The &amp;quot;alignment&amp;quot; system common in gaming is replaced by a system of Commitment Ratings to describe the character's basic outlook and strength of commitment to that outlook.  Finally, the bulk of character ability is determined by selection of Skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
