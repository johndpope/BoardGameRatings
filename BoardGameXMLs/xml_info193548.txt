							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Psionics</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get Mythic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although psionic characters and creatures can alter the very nature of reality, some have achieved a level of power that goes beyond even the extraordinary  and into the realm of mythic. With Psionics Augmented: Mythic Psionics, you will find character options to allow psionic characters to play in mythic games, using the same rules as their non-psionic counterparts. But mythic characters need mythic enemies, and you will also find a variety of mythic psionic monsters to challenge your players in new and unique ways!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psionics Augmented: Mythic Psionics is over 70 pages of new content and contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A new mythic path, the overmind, aimed at manifesters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psionic path abilities for the other mythic paths&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Mythic versions of feats such as Deep Focus, allowing a character to always be treated as maintaining focus, or Psicrystal Affinity, where even your psicrystal is mythic&lt;br/&gt;    Three hundred mythic versions of psionic powers, taking powers to whole new levels like a Mythic Energy Ball that freezes creatures in place or sets them on fire&lt;br/&gt;    Nine mythic psionic monsters, including the classics like the gray glutton and phrenic scourge, but also newer monsters like the deranged trepanner and ghaar&lt;br/&gt;    And more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock the secrets of mythic psionics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
