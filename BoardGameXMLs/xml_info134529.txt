							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Simurg</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Simurg is an immortal creature, ancient beyond our understanding. It is the source of all that is, was, and will be. Deep within its lair the Simurg slumbers, and dreams. Those dreams become our hopes and our sorrows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that the Simurg will make a gift of three of its feathers upon true believers, those brave enough to attempt the journey to its lair. Upon these feathers are writ the dreams of the world, and in a time of greatest need they may be burned to invoke the Simurg's wisdom and power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tides of Fate are the Simurg's to command, and it is said that if the bravest of the brave should be true enough to find the Simurg that it will grant an audience and a boon. So go forth brave ones, believers, and wake the Simurg!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
