			<description>This made-in-Singapore boardgame is produced by Pioneer Junior College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the game: set in China. Players are trying to 'plan a route across China that would score the most number of points'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality, the game can be thought of as a modified '10 days' game (with a scoring system, double-use cards as well as an 'interrupt' function).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game: Players set up 12 cards on wooden card holders (similar to the 10 days, albeit bigger). The difference is that cards can be rearranged AT ANY TIME (making for a shorter game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn, the player draws a card and chooses to replace a card in their holder. The replaced card is put face up in the middle of the table. Subsequent cards are placed on the same pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interrupts: if a discarded card allows them to complete a set of 3 connecting cards, a player can interrupt and take the card. A die roll resolves simultaneous interrupts. The set of 3 cards are revealed to other players and LOCKED from changes. Play continues to the left of the player who successfully interrupted play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player connects up 12 cards (9 cards for a short game). Each player then tallies up VPs printed on cards, choosing between one of two cards in each link. Completing player gets 5 VPs bonus. Tranport cards = 0 vp. Multiples cards are -1 point for one after the main card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The production values are high. The garish board is mounted, the rules and player aids are printed on thick laminated card, the wooden card holders add considerable heft to the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each box set is priced at US$99.90, INCLUDING shipping/postal costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For any queries, Pioneer Junior College can be contacted via email at pjc@moe.edu.sg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
