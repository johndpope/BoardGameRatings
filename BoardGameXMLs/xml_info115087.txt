							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fractal: Make Blooms Not War</name>
									
			<description>From the award-winning team that brought you Auditorium and Pulse : Volume One comes Fractal, an enthralling music puzzler experience. Push, Combo, and Chain your way through a pulsing technicolor dreamscape all the while expanding your consciousness at 130 BPM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 sexy game modes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAMPAIGN MODE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Mode takes you through the world of discovery. Each level offers new possibilities of play, while continually expanding on challenges. This is NOT a &amp;quot;more of the same game&amp;quot; scenario; we spent a lot of time crafting a lush campaign that expands, bends, twists, and creates new elements of gameplay that will completely alter the way you view the game. Throw in checkpoints at every ten levels and you have one beautiful experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PUZZLE MODE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s just nice to have a controlled environment. Puzzle Mode exposes the underlying mechanics of the game, then pushes them to the limit. Test your mettle against 50+ intense scenarios that will hone your skills enough to see you through Campaign mode, right before they set your brain on fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARCADE MODE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the other modes strike you as too contemplative, Arcade Mode might be more your speed. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing the pushes are unlimited, because time is tight and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to step lively if you want to see the other side of a minute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
