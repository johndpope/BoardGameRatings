			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA (Electronic Roleplaying Assistant) is the ultimate companion for Rolemaster campaigns. Using ERA players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ERA, you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. To create an interesting character, a good selection of race and profession is paramount. Rolemaster also provides background options to add more variety between characters. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample races, 2 professions and 3 background options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This feature package is the ultimate Shadow World addition for ERA RMFRP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It provides 68 RMFRP races, as presented in Shadow World Master Atlas 4th Edition. Each race impacts stat and resistance bonus, body and power point progression, initial languages, number of talent points, everyman and restricted skills, and includes the complete detail of description and special characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick from any of 68 races (yes, sixty eight!). Fair skinned Linaeri elves, or sinister Dyari, stout Umli, the winged H&amp;iacute;razi and the reclusive D&amp;uacute;ranaki are all available. Are you aiming for a character in a high-powered campaign, or a detailed NPC? Why not create a Storm Giant? Of course, you can always choose to create a K&amp;rsquo;ta&amp;rsquo;viiri, just ask your GM very nicely for permission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also provides 14 RMFRP cultures, to match with the races as suggested in the Shadow World Master Atlas 4th Edition. For human cultures with choice, the 6 available options are presented. For campaigns which require it, any combination can be picked. So why not try creating a Kuluku raised in the underground, or even in the city!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
