							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mind Masters</name>
									
			<description>A competitive deck-trashing game for 2-5 players by Florian Woo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays a famous Mind Master. These people have telepathic abilities, which allow them to read the minds of others and exchange and extract memories from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year, the greatest of these Mind Masters meet in a battle for sanity. During these tournaments, they try to bring the most precious memories of each opponent into the foreground, so that they can access and delete these thoughts forever. Only the ones who keep these hidden until the end will stay sane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mind Masters is a competitive card game, where each player has an identical 40 cards deck at the beginning. Inside these decks, there a five &amp;quot;Precious Memory&amp;quot; cards, which each player has to protect. They will play cards forcing the others to discard or even trash cards, to finally remove all of their &amp;quot;Precious Memories&amp;quot;. Therefore, the deck gets thinner and thinner over game play. The last player keeping at least one of his &amp;quot;Precious Memories&amp;quot; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created for the March 2015 24h design contest at BGG (theme: confusion).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
