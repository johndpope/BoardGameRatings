			<description>Fuzion Frenzy is a launch title for the Microsoft Xbox. At its core, Fuzion Frenzy is a four-player party game featuring 45 different mini-games (not including the titular Fuzion Frenzy). A demo of the game was included with some other launch titles in the US, including Halo, Munch's Oddysee and Amped. The title was among the first to be released as a part of the Xbox Originals program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel was later released for the Xbox 360, entitled Fuzion Frenzy 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to four players can compete in two different game modes: &amp;quot;Tournament&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Mini-Game Frenzy&amp;quot;. Mini-Game Frenzy is the simpler of the two, involving players selecting individual mini-games while an ongoing tabulation of wins per player is maintained. In contrast, the Tournament mode is the core game mode, where players attempt to earn the highest number of points after playing through two or more play zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fuzion Frenzy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
