							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Core Elements: Toolbox Edition</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;When James announced his retirement from gaming &amp;mdash; hopefully only temporarily &amp;mdash;  he generously turned over the bulk of his material to me.  I've been a fan of his work for some time, and consider it a privilege to be able to carry the torch onward in his place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Toolbox Edition reprints the original Core Elements Revised published by James along with a collection of optional rules. These rules, contained in the sidebars and appendices (along with a few revisions in the core rules themselves) will assist gamemasters in customizing Core Elements to suit their campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can only hope that this, the first of James' creations that I've had the opportunity to build on, will provide you with some good gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
