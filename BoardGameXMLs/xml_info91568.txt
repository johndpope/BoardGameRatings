			<description>Pilot Academy is a flight simulator video game released for the PlayStation Portable in 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lets you pilot aircraft from different eras, from World War I to the present day. The game has two major classes, Civilian and Military. The flying lessons and missions are divided into these categories. For the first few major civilian lessons (Taking Off, Turning etc) you control a Cessna, but after completion of the first lessons, you control a Global Express business jet and a 747, respectively. The military lessons do not involve the basic skills of flying, instead they focus on weapon control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has different missions which are divided into Civilian and Military, such as having to land a 747 in an area with many tornadoes or entering enemy territory for a reconnaissance mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pilot Academy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
