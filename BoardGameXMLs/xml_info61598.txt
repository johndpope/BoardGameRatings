			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d4-d4 is a roleplaying system best suited to campaigns set in modern (post-1600) or future worlds. It's semi-generic. A die roll of two four-sided dice, the one subtracted from the other and added to a Trait, and compared to a Difficulty level, resolves most actions. Traits are rated with a description, so that you can say, &amp;quot;Djim is an Outstanding Cook,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Jane is a Middling Swimmer.&amp;quot; From that, you get a performance from Crap to Famous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is designed to allow a range of game styles, from Hack to Thesp. Not only do some Traits compliment one another - so your Excellent Physics can help your Middling Engineering - but personality aspects help, too. This encourages you to bring the character's personality out. d4-d4. Pyramid versus pyramid, just like ancient Egypt only better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
