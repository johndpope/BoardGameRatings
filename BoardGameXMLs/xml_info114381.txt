			<description>Shift 2: Unleashed (also known as Need for Speed: Shift 2 Unleashed) is a racing video game, the 17th title in the Need for Speed franchise. It was developed by Slightly Mad Studios and published by Electronic Arts. Shift 2: Unleashed was released worldwide during March and April 2011, although it has yet to be released in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shift 2: Unleashed is the direct sequel to the 2009 video game Need for Speed: Shift and expands on the gameplay and features introduced with the original. Shift 2: Unleashed features over 145 cars from more than 37 manufacturers and over 36 different tracks, which players can compete in several types of races. Players can also compete online. The game also features three new main additions: an in-helmet camera, night-time racing and the Autolog feature introduced with Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shift 2 features more than 140 licensed vehicles available for racing and tuning, a smaller number compared with racing sims such as Forza Motorsport 3 and Gran Turismo 5. However, executive producer Marcus Nilsson said the studio wanted to concentrate on having only the must-have speedsters. Exclusively digitized for the game is the Pagani Huayra. There are also 40 real-world locations including Bathurst, Spa-Francorchamps and Suzuka as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Shanghai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shift 2: Unleashed&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
