			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our exploration of the city by the sea continues in this issue where we look at an old building with a new business in it, one that is not only creating a new sort of shop in the city but changing how business gets done in the city. The first stone building in the city now houses the cities first coffee shop, and it is moving the center of power away from court and into quite meetings over cups of this strange new drink from the south. Add a hidden chapel, a vengeful ghost and a monetarily out of favor courtier and this brew gets hot and bitter faster than you might expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
