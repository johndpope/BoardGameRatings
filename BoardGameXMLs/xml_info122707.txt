			<description>Our latest game, Pyramix, was just approved and is now available for $.99 on iTunes! It is also available free with ads for Android! The game, named with a combination of pyramid and mix, is what it sounds like &amp;ndash; a pyramid of mixed up letters and words. In keeping with the pyramid idea, the graphics of the game are reminiscent of ancient Egypt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pyramix, players must un-jumble the letters to spell a six, five, four, and three letter word using only the letters available. A gold bar to the left of each space tells the user the word is, in fact, a word, while the numbers to the right tell the player how many words can be made with the letters still left in the jumble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We created the game to give adults a fun brain puzzle to entertain them during those lapses in the day: waiting at the doctor&amp;rsquo;s office, in the airport, on a break at work, or between favorite TV shows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
