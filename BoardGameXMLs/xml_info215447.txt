			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arachnids are among the most unsettling creatures of material and non-material planes, thanks to their multiple legs and poisoned fangs. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean all spiders are evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kind Spiders are one of the few good-aligned arachnids of the material plane, standing in stark opposition to their unaligned or evil brethren. They are timid creatures by nature, but are known to be respectful and supportive of the Druids and Rangers who know of their existence. On some rare occasions, Kind Spiders have reportedly delivered lost children back to their homes before returning to their nests without a reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadly, there is one major reason Kind Spiders shy away from civilization &amp;ndash; the entire species has been cursed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends say that in millennia past, the Kind Spiders stood in opposition to an evil Insect God who plagued the landscape. Their webs captured the magical swarms that threatened sentient races, frustrating the deity to no end. Its minions cast a curse on the entire race, putting them in opposition to the humans, elves, and dwarves they once defended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;True or not, the fact remains that when a sentient creature meets a Kind Spider for the first time, they are more likely to see the entire race as snarling beasts than potential allies. Villagers and adventurers alike have unwittingly massacred the peaceful creatures ever since, driving them into remote forests and dungeons. And as their numbers weaken, the powers of the Insect God grow stronger&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
