			<description>Metal Max 2 (メタルマックス2) is the second entry in the Metal Max series. It was a vehicle combat RPG published by Data East for the Super Famicom in 1993. Ten years later, the game was ported to the Game Boy Advance by Now Production under the title Metal Max 2 Kai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the gameplay is similar to its predecessor, Metal Max. The game is open-ended and non-linear, with the player given the freedom to decide where to go and what missions to do in whichever order. The player can choose the character classes, such as a mechanic or soldier, for the player characters. The battles are turn-based, with the characters able to fight either on foot or using tanks. The tanks can be created and customized by the player, who can modify and enhance each part of a vehicle, though there is a weight limit to each tank. In certain areas where tanks cannot pass, the characters must engage the enemies on foot. The game also features gambling machines where minigames can be played, including third-person shooter and racing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Metal Max 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
