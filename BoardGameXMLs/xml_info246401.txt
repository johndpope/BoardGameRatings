							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 (And More) British-Inspired Pub Names</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a GM is designing an urban area, or the players are exploring one, or whilst they are out in the country or villages, it may be necessary to come up with a name for a previously unnamed pub, tavern or inn. That is what 100 (And More) British-Inspired Pub Names is designed to do. The supplement has two tables; a main table of 100 pub names and a supplementary table of 5 pub types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement provides 100 base pub names that can be randomly generated using the main table, or manually selected, but more can be generated from the notes on many of the names and using the supplementary table. The notes provide details on suitable locations, if they aren't being used randomly, possible alternatives and explanations as to what some of them mean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the 100 base names, alternates and supplementary table are all used, there are at least hundreds of potential pub names available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The names have a British flavour, and are based on British pub names. The streets should be suitable for settings from medieval to modern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
