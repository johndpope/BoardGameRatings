			<description>&amp;ldquo;Thomas Jefferson bought (bargain-price) Louisiana from the French in 1803. This purchase more than doubled the size of the United States. Meriwether Lewis &amp;amp; William Clarke were chosen by Jefferson to Explore this vast, unknown region. They assembled a group of Soldiers, hunters, boatmen, and slaves (40-50 men) known as the Corps of Discovery. They set off from St Louis in 1804. They Traveled as far as the Pacific. The Expedition lasted two and a half years. They returned safely after mapping large areas, finding new plants and Animals and meeting many new Indian Tribes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players compete to acquire the most discovery cards by making sets of four and seven cards. Solo victory conditions are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
