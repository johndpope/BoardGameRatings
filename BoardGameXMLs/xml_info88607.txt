							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NBA  Ballers</name>
									
			<description>NBA Ballers is a streetball game which is similar to AND 1 Streetball and gameplay similar to the NBA Jam series. The game features fictional NBA analyst Bob Benson (voiced and depicted by Terry Abler) and MC Supernatural doing the commentary. Supernatural makes many references to the Mortal Kombat series and NFL Blitz two games published by Midway. The game also maintains the &amp;quot;player on fire&amp;quot; feature that is in many, if not all sports games published by Midway. Most of the moves that were in the game were from real street ballers who provided some of their moves for the game. The game is powered by Gamespy game technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Nba ballers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
