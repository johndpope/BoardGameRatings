			<description>Designer's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Back late last year we released a free adventure and I made a promise that if it were downloaded a slew of times, I would work another one to release for free. Unfortunately the holidays and work have totally kicked my butt the last two months so I am just now getting around to releasing this one. I called on two of my pals to help me out and complete this one: +Josh Mannon and +Brennen Reece. Josh wrote a really unique and cool adventure and Brennen added in some really awesome artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short, system-less adventure written up in the old school fashion of kicking the character's ass and taking no names. We hope you enjoy this adventure, and if you do, be sure to check out our other awesome products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
