			<description>Christmas Penguins (Weihnachtspinguine) is a tactical dice game for 3-6 people.&lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of thieving evil penguins, trying to steal presents from Father Christmas.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to capture as many presents as possible, while Father Christmas, helped by a polar bear, tries to recapture the presents from the penguins. When Father Christmas reaches a penguin, the player whose penguin was reached takes the role of Father Christmas.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the penguin with the most presents at the end of the game. Because Father Christmas doesn't keep the presents, the player who is Father Christmas cannot win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
