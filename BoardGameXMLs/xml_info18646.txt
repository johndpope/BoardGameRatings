			<description>A children's game which is effectively a promotional item for Land Rover cars. The game is a simple roll and move game similar to Snakes and Ladders.  It comes with a laminated board, a set of rules, and a cut-out spinner and pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to reach the finish on an off road track, but you have to beware of hazards along the way, such as broken fan belts, mud, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
