			<description>A 2-player skirmish game based on the Star Frontiers Space Combat System - Knight Hawks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard is an 8 X 8 square grid which can be populated with terrain characteristics (asteroid, nebula, planets) at the discretion of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck of cards comprising four types of card: Attack, Defence, Movement and Special.  Movement and Attack cards will have a specified range and all cards have a specified effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use counters or miniatures to represent the ships of their space fleets.  The number and types of ships utilised will be dependent and which of the 5 scenarios is used and on the factions played.   There are two main Factions: United Planetary Federation (UPF) and Sathar Empire though certain scenarios use Mercenaries, Pirates and Home Defence Fleets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game board set up and victory conditions are scenario driven, but gameplay is conducted in the same manner regardless of scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 5 cards.  Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Tactics Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Draw 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     You may play cards from your hand. &lt;br/&gt;-     Use move cards to move a ship the indicated number of spaces.  Moves are orthogonal or diagonal.&lt;br/&gt;-     Use attack cards to engage enemy units at the indicated range. All attacks do 1 point of damage. Attacks are orthogonal or diagonal.&lt;br/&gt;-     Use defence cards to negate a target attack.  &lt;br/&gt;-     Played cards are discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.    End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Max hand size is 7 cards.  Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ship has a number of hits (1-12 dependant on class). If a ship has more damage on it than it has hits, it is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until the victory conditions for the chosen scenario are achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
