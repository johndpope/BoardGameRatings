			<description>Rosetta is a boardless tile-laying game with hex-tiles. Each tile (except 3 extra-tiles showing a rose) shows one of the numbers from 1 to 7. They are available in four player colours and 7 times as white. The white ones are the general supply, forming three stacks, so the three top tiles are available. Each player has the tiles of his own colour as a &amp;quot;personal supply&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: On a player`s turn, he can choose either a white top tile or a tile from his personal supply and place it adjacent to any tile(s) already placed on the table. It is allowed to place any white tile adjacent to any other tile, but coloured tiles must not be adjacent to other coloured ones. Aim of the game is to create as many &amp;quot;perfect Rosettas&amp;quot; as possible: groups of seven tiles, with a tile of your colour as the centre and 6 white tiles with the other six numbers surrounding it, which is 10 points worth in the final score. If one or more tiles of 7 tiles show the same number, the &amp;quot;doubles&amp;quot; are subtracted from the 10 points. Rose-tiles are &amp;quot;jokers&amp;quot; and stand for any number a scoring player wants.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when all tiles are placed, or all coloured tiles are surrounded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
