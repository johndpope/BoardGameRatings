			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELCOME TO THE CITY OF SPIRITS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Meriquai Falls, where Native American culture blends seemlessly with modern contemporary society to form one of the most beautiful cities in the United States. It is also home to one of the largest concentrations of metahuman activity in the Midwest. Between the schemes of Galvakar and his Imperions and the genocidal plots of the Manitou and his Totems of Retribution, the crazed antics of the Pooka King and the dark secrets of the Night Sparrow, there is plenty to do for an intrepid hero in Meriquai Falls. Save the city and perhaps, in so doing, save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIVE-WIRE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trent MacDailey was a man simply trying to live day by day when he became victim of the collateral damage of a supervillain attack. Imbued with the ability to absorb and channel electricity, he rose to become the protector of his home neighborhood, the now aptly-named Rampage Row. But will he work with the rest of the heroes of Meriquai Falls or against them? Only time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meriquai Falls - Live-Wire includes HERO System 6th Edition stats for the hero Live-Wire, as well as plot seeds to get him quickly into your Meriquai Falls campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
