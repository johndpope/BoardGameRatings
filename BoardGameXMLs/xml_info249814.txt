			<description>In Crimson Company two opposing players take on the roles of adventurous noblemen in a cut-throat fantasy world. In a battle of wits, they assemble armies of sellswords, from hardened warriors and shady merchants to mythical creatures as old as time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal in a match of Crimson Company is to conquer two of the three castles in the center. You conquer a castle by amassing more strength than your opponent in the castle&amp;rsquo;s lane by the time when that lane is scored. A lane is scored once a player owns at least four cards in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards represent a large variety of characters, all of which have specific strength values and unique effects. The latter are either one-time instant effects that happen when a card is played, or they are triggered in specific phases of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four randomly drawn cards from the character deck are &amp;ldquo;on offer&amp;rdquo;. You may only bid coins on one of those at a time. Then your opponent decides to either pay you off, doubling the coins you bid, or pass and let you play the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
