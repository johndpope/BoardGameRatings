							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Farm</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Farm has endured its long isolation rather well compared to other enclaves. The agricultural robots were constructed to be durable and easily repaired, and most of them are still in good working order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The farmhouse itself is long-gone, reduced to ash and a chimney by a fire that the household domestic robots were unable to put out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The domestics were themselves consumed in the blaze, leaving their outdoor companions to face the years alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the resource demands of the house and its staff gone, the farm was able to return to full productivity, turning out bumper crops of corn year after year. The produce trucks continued to arrive at more erratic intervals, bringing word of the spreading desolation and the dwindling number of stops along their route.&lt;br/&gt;When the trucks stopped arriving altogether, the harvest had nowhere to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The robots began dumping the excess corn in a nearby quarry (once its sole remaining excavator was dealt with). They continued with this stopgap solution for years, inadvertently creating the world&amp;rsquo;s largest compost heap in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the players&amp;rsquo; robots arrive, the farm workers will be overjoyed to finally be able to hand off their bounty, and will immediately attempt to press the newcomers into service carrying the season&amp;rsquo;s produce: hundreds of tons of corn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Machines that refuse to cooperate have the privilege of meeting the Thresher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player&amp;rsquo;s robots likely stumble upon the Farm by following the remains of the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players&amp;rsquo; robots might also enter from the quarry, as the mountain of corn is visible from a distance. If they find the quarry first it is likely deserted (save for the corpse of the excavator), but they may find some signs of local activity on the trail leading back to the Farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The river may provide yet another means of passage, either to the Farm or away from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
