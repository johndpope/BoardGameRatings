							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Warp and Quickstart Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This quickstart, some dice, a few pens and pencils and paper is all you need to start playing The Artifact RPG. The core rule book includes lots more to expand your play with but just starting out you don&amp;rsquo;t need all that detail yet. As you get used the basic setting and system you may want to add more elements to your play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This quickstart will begin with the basic setting, move on to some rules, take you into an adventure called The Warp and give some pregenerated characters for players to pick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
