			<description>The Zombies are multiplying&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team up, battle Zombies, and save Heroes in this times tables game designed to help children (and adults) learn their 12 Times Tables in a fun and engaging way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Times Square involves lots of multiplication and squaring, but players can also add, subtract and divide dice in any way they can think of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle and deal out Zombie cards onto a flat surface (no board required). Players then take turns to roll the four Battle Dice, working together to find the best dice combinations to exactly reach one or more Zombie&amp;rsquo;s strength to defeat it. For each unused dice more Zombies appear! Defeat all the Zombies in play to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Times Square is designed to be flexible with multiple ways to play and rules that can be changed to suit the way you want to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team up with City of Zombies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards that you get in Times Square can also be used to expand the City of Zombies board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
