			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 2 level, Black and White Blueprint of an Outer Space Mining Colony. It is 72 inches by 60 inches at its widest point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Hex, Square and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The trick is to make the people look where you want them to look. We are just a normal mining operation after all officially.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mining Colony is a hand-drawn, black and white, blueprint style map. The product includes a subterranean mining level and a ground level base on the planet&amp;rsquo;s surface. Each individual area in the spacecraft is labeled and includes hand-drawn objects signifying all of the objects in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mining Colony is designed for use as a standalone map or with the Space Station blueprint map. The colony has enough bedrooms for 21 colonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mining Colony is intended for use in science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pilfering from History: The mining company chose to excavate at exactly the right spot. Not only did they find rich veins of ore, but also strange and bizarre alien artifacts. Rather than register them with the government of the solar system, they decided to make molds of the alien artifacts, hollow out the cores of some of their mineral cubes, and replace them with the alien artifacts in molds. They sent these specific cores to their corporate headquarters for study of the alien artifacts at their research labs. The expansion of the mining colony added colonists who work to make the colony self-sufficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pirates often attack the transport shuttle but the fighters have fended them off up to now. This time, a single alien fighter attacked the transport shuttle and managed to disable one of the fighters before a lucky shot by his wingman destroyed the alien ship. The mining company sent home for help from their corporate headquarters immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters are mercenaries bringing a new fighter with them to the mining colony. As soon as they land in the hangar, people inside the facility panic. Some sort of alien carrier has appeared. The fighter on the landing strip is bombed and most of the personnel panic and flee to the subterranean level via the elevator. The alien carrier lands on the north side of the strip and sends an organic tube to the walls of the transport ship and hangar. An acidic ichor breaches the metal walls and alien soldiers pour into the shuttle and mining facility. The nearly extinct alien race intends on getting their artifacts back with only the group and a few brave men of the mining colony standing in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
