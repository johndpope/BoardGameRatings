			<description>The vast Forest of Wyr was once ruled by three powerful siblings: Callius, the Lion - known for his strength on the battlefield as well as for his cruelty, Tellard, the Serpent - his face always hidden, who sought out Wyr&amp;rsquo;s enemies with insidious dark magijks, and Amalfia, known as the Sun, also facetiously as &amp;lsquo;the Lucky Star&amp;rsquo; - she for whom everything went as she wished, enticing all who fell under her spell, setting friend against friend, brother against brother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was rumored in taverns, and in the low places favored by thieves, that the source of their power lay in six enchanted gems, hidden away deep within a network of towers in the Forest of Wyr and only the siblings and their loyal Guardians knew of their exact locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There came a time when a Thief of some infamy decided to test these rumours to see if they were true and dared to steal the gems. There would be a high price to pay if caught, but then, what is life without challenge! Across the boundary line of Wyr and into the shadows of the great trees the Thief slowly ventured...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Needed to play:&lt;br/&gt;The deck of 70 cards divided into Realm, Guardian, Forest Spirit, Stillness and Towers decks.&lt;br/&gt;1 mug or small bag, used as the Tower&lt;br/&gt;65 8mm wooden cubes in 6 different colors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play:&lt;br/&gt;To win the game you must find all 6 Gems before you are unable to draw new cards from the last of the 3 Encounter decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a series of rounds. Each round has two phases: Encounter and Tower Search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Phase:&lt;br/&gt;Choose one Tower card from the three face-up cards as the Tower you are searching during this round and place this in front of you. Then draw a new card from the Tower deck and place it next to the two remaining Tower cards. &lt;br/&gt;Draw 4 cards from the Encounter deck above the leftmost Realm card. &lt;br/&gt;Encounter each card in turn in the Encounter Line, first by applying any Actions shown on the cards. In any Encounter you may choose to Evade or Incapacitate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower Search Phase:&lt;br/&gt;After all cards in the Encounter Line have been encountered by evading or incapacitating, you may now search the Tower. &lt;br/&gt;Follow any actions listed on the chosen Tower card, paying icons on the Guardian cards in your hand to the Encounter discard pile if you wish to activate the actions.&lt;br/&gt;Then randomly draw cubes equal to the number of Tower icons showing on the bottom right corner of the remaining Encounter Line cards. The number of cubes drawn may be modified by cards you have incapacitated and/or actions you are subject to, either from the Encounter Line or from the Tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round End:&lt;br/&gt;Discard all cards in the Encounter Line and begin a new round of Encounter and Tower Search phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End: &lt;br/&gt;You win if you find all 6 enchanted gems in the Towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You lose if you do not find all 6 gems before you are unable to draw new cards from the 3 Encounter decks, or if any two Abilities ever reach zero during an encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entry in the 2016 Solitaire Game Contest&lt;br/&gt;Best Regular PNP Build Game - 2nd Place&lt;br/&gt;Best Graphic Design - 1st Place &lt;br/&gt;Best Rule Book - 3rd Place&lt;br/&gt;Best Overall Game - 4th Place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
