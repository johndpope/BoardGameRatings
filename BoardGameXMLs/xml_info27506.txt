							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Lanka</name>
									
			<description>This is a game conceived by Kreeda, and is the third part of the Ramayana series. In the Indian epic - the Ramayana, Dasharatha, Rama's father is forced by an old promise to send Rama, his eldest son away to the forest for fourteen years. Rama is accompanied by his wife Sita and brother, Lakshmana. Vanavaas - the Adventures in the Forest follows their experiences until the kidnapping of Sita. In the second game, the Search for Sita, you follow the adventures of Rama and Lakshmana as they search for Sita and seek the help of the vanaras or monkeys. Hanuman finally finds Sita in Lanka where she is a prisoner of the demon king - Ravana. Rama and Lakshmana, along with their new friends Sugriva and Hanuman decide that the only option is to fight a war with Ravana and rescue Sita. It was a mighty battle fought between the rakshasas led by Ravana and the vanara army led by Rama. This game brings you face to face with some of the unforgettable characters like Kumbakarna, Indrajit and Jambavan. It also introduces you to many of the special powers that gave both sides the numerous advantages. Rama is invincible and represents the Power of Good. However, in the epic he is told to seek the assistance of the vanaras led by Sugriva. It is this that led to the concept of the game. The game is based on C. Rajagopalachari's Ramayana in English. Contents: One pack of 52 cards, Rule sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
