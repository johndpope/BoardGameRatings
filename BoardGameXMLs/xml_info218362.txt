							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Resolution Race</name>
									
			<description>This game is from January 2017's 24-Hour Contest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise is simple: You and a group of your friends stink at keeping New Year's Resolutions. You all decide to pitch in $1,000 to see who's the most dedicated to their resolution. The most dedicated player wins(dedicated= most progress made on their respective board)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play: the majority of the game is spent trying to manipulate the decisions of your opponents, by playing cards to improve yourself and sabotage others!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
