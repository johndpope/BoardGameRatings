							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Terramartian War Part 04: The Shard, Part 1</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was almost 18 hours since The Sterling was dead in space. Its inertia still hurling it towards the empty cold void. The ship was blasted nearly in two. Most of the crew was sucked into space, still fewer clung to life in the few sealed pockets of air that remained in the ship. Whoever was sent to destroy The Sterling did not finish the job, but if they were attempting to delay the response to the distress beacon that The Sterling was sent to investigate, then they succeeded. There would be no rescue or investigation into the events that&lt;br/&gt;took place on TLK 4076.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air is thinner now. There&amp;rsquo;s not much time, you must find a way to activate a distress beacon to save the few that still survive. But considering the fate of The Sterling, that beacon may just be the blood in the water for whichever predators seek to finish them off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this chapter...&lt;br/&gt;Characters cannot use the same characters they used on TLK 4076. This is a different part of the campaign. It is the first of the series of events that led to the Martians loosing transdimensional terrors into the universe. A character may use the same character stats and just switch out Paradigms in order to give them a better chance of surviving this scenario. For narrative purposes though, the characters will not be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
