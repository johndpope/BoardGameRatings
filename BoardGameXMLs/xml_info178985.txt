			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mandate sees you, the player, as the captain of a single vessel. This vessel is manned by a cadre of officers, chosen and customized by you who are each individually named, with their own stats and strategic capabilities. These officers are in charge of crewmen, who are each individually named, but expendable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are fallible, human, and you make mistakes. Often, this will end with families torn apart, and crew members literally thrown out through the hull. Your actions will invariably mean loss of life. Issuing orders to officers will dynamically affect the actions of your crew, depending on the skills and attributes of the respective officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time in a game of this type, players will be able to board vessels taking the combat into an RTS environment whilst your friends still fight from their ships in space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mandate is split into three focuses: the story focus with adventure and RPG elements, the strategic focus with economic, diplomatic, and political elements, and the tactical focus, with space combat and boarding elements. Each layer of depth is fully fleshed out offering intriguing and challenging gameplay, and each element is absolutely required in order to succeed and grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decisions you make in Mandate affect the world around you, and your crew. Every action has a consequence, and as you push your ship to the farthest reaches of the universe, diplomacy, and morality are pushed with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Affect the world with your actions, not with your words. The Mandate will not be challenged with a dialogue wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Rule. No Quarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your bases - Command your fleets - Lead your boarding parties - Conquer rebels - Explore an empire in turmoil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mandate is a sandbox military Sci-fi RPG. When a rebellion breaks out across countless worlds, the newly crowned Empress turns to you - a disgraced former captain - and offers you a chance to reclaim your honour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will start with a single ship and must assemble a fleet to defeat the rebellion. Coordinate fleet and boarding actions simultaneously, striking the enemy on two fronts for maximum effect. In captured star systems, you may design, research and construct your own star bases and ships, recruit and equip your troops with advanced weaponry, and negotiate alliances in intense roleplaying encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you lead your crew to victory or dishonour in this dynamic roleplaying experience? Will you obey the Empress, side with the Rebels or carve out your own Pirate Kingdom instead? You decide! Yours is the Mandate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
