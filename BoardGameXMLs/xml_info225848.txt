			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do You Have What It Takes To Survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wilderness. Nearly every great fantasy story features some amount of time trekking through the vast and untamed expanse of nature. From The Lord of the Rings to The Belgariad, The Wheel of Time, and even your gaming table, it seems almost inevitable that mighty heroes will be challenged by the daunting power of the awe-inspiring natural world. This book celebrates those struggles, as well as the strength needed to succeed in the heroic ordeals required of explores and wanderers. With feats tailored to various climates and terrain types, your mighty heroes are able to fortify themselves for the unique challenges of surviving in nature&amp;rsquo;s most dangerous locales. Also included are some generally useful survival feats for the explorer on the go, such as feats enabling you to stand up to fierce weather, master torches and lanterns, and even unlock the lore of the land itself. All told, there are 34 new feats for those forced to rough it out in the wilderness. It&amp;rsquo;s best to be prepared for any journey you are about to undertake, and Weekly Wonders: Feats of Exploration is sure to prepare you for the worst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
