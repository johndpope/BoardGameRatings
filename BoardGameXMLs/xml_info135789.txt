			<description>Don't Starve is a wilderness survival game from Klei Entertainment originally released in 2013. Initially only available on PC, it has since been released in several other formats since 2013 including WiiU, XBox One, PS4, PS3 and PS Vita.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stars a number of different characters who have all been transported to a strange world by a demonic creature known simply as Maxwell. The player takes on the role of one of the stranded characters and must survive from day to day by foraging for food and supplies, forging equipment and dealing with the various perils of the Don't Starve world which include changing weather and seasons, environmental hazards, and physical and supernatural monsters, all whilst trying to keep healthy, well fed and mentally stable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't Starve features a strong rogue-like element, with perma-death and little in game help or instruction making surviving the game's randomly generated wilderness both tough and unforgiving. It's relatively well known for an Indie game, mainly thanks to a number of lets-plays on Youtube, and features a unique Tim Burton-inspired gothic-cartoon art style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the success of Don't Starve several expansions have since been released:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reign of Giants is the first expansion, adding new characters, items and environments to the basic Don't Starve game, but increasing difficulty and adding giant seasonal monsters. Both this expansion and the base game were also released together as Don't Starve: Giants Edition on several games consoles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don's Starve Together is a standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, featuring all the content of Don't Starve and Reign of Giants but with the ability for several players to play together either cooperatively or competitively online. Several tweaks were implemented to try and balance the game for multiple players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't Starve Shipwrecked is another expansion for Don't Starve, featuring more new characters, items and environments, and is set in a sea/desert island biome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't Starve: Pocket Edition is a iOS port of Don't Starve: Giant's Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
