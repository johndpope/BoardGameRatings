			<description>Word game which uses 40 octagonal tiles with letters on them.  Players draw and play a tile at a time to form words.  In addition to forming words by adding to the existing layout, one or more lines of letters can be removed and replaced to form a word as well, although each word may only be scored once throughout the game. Can also be played as a solo challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
