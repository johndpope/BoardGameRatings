			<description>from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 4-6 Mutants Level 1-3&lt;br/&gt;Gen Con 2012&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;introductory blurb:&lt;br/&gt;You are more fortunate than other survivors who scratch out a meager existence amongst the ruins and rubble, for you have something they do not &amp;ndash; a job. For several months, you have worked for a large mutant bear named &amp;ldquo;Barter John&amp;rdquo; at the trading post he established in an Ancient military base on one of the major trade routes. Barter John is quick with a smile and a laugh, but even quicker with a bullet to the head for thieves and looters. You work as John's &amp;ldquo;Acquisitions and Recovery department,&amp;rdquo; as he jokingly calls it. In other words, he tells you where to find stuff, and you go get it. John pays well and he lets you take first claim on anything recovered. With room and board on top of that, it's an easier gig than joining a band of mauraduers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;rdquo;Back in the &amp;lsquo;Afore-times,&amp;rsquo; the Ancients carved the likenesses of four of their kings into the mountains. It&amp;rsquo;s said that, before the sculptors carved this giant tribute, they created a smaller version to act as a sorta model. Well, I got a buyer for that model and I want you to get it.&amp;rdquo;**&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
