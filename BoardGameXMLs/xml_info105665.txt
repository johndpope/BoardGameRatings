			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Where man fears to tread, send robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within the hidden recesses of a powerful, monster energy plant: a tiny, seemingly insignificant circuit has malfunctioned.  Causing the critical temperature within the reactor's core to climb.  And climb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter The Android Crisis Team.  A stout group of eight amazing androids.  Each android has its own unique capabilities.  Upon this team's mechanized shoulders rests the only hope for averting a disastrous blackout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, without you, the powerful androids are powerless.  You evaluate each of the android's skills.  Their strengths and their weaknesses.  You assign tasks.  Formulate strategies.  Assemble missions.  Send out scouts.  Decide who battles and who travels the irradiated depths of the power plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Via remote video camera, you'll direct the mission as your androids explore over 2,000 chambers on eight separate labyrinthine levels.  Combat automated defenses.  Utilize complex tools and combine all the best skills of man and machine to locate and reach the reactor room in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time.  It's ticking away.  The tension is mounting.  The shutdown sequence has been initiated.  Hurry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
