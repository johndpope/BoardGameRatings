			<description>In Roadblock, players try to build the most wide-spanning road network while blocking their opponents from doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players begin the game with 5 road tiles in hand and each turn they draw a new one.  After laying down their first tile, they extend their road network each turn by playing a tile to continue the road from the tile played in the previous turn.  Players can also take their turn to play their tiles on their opponent's road.  If a player is unable to continue from a tile played in the previous turn, he or she can continue his or her road from the last intersection or the very first tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has built a road network that spans at least 12 tiles across; curves at the ends are excluded from the count.  The player that has completed such a road has won the game.  The game also ends when all tiles have been drawn and played.  If no players have not completed a road in the manner mentioned before, then the one whose network spans across the most tiles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
