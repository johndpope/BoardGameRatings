							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hockey Tivitz</name>
									
			<description>Educational Math board game that uses checkers type movement. The playing pieces called &amp;quot;Tivit&amp;quot;s are 6 sided dice with each side having a symbol and numerical value. The 2 players race to reach the opposite side of the board, forcing them to cross paths and allowing for opportunities to jump over other pieces. Each location at the other side of the arena (board) has a mathematical operation(addition, subtraction, multiplication or division). A players score is the value of their Tivit adjusted for the math operation for each Tivit associated with their final location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 30 different paper boards with varying degrees of difficulty. For ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
