			<description>Legepladsen is a game for children. Each child has a Lego-figure which has to collect 3 pieces of Lego each. The game can be played in 3 different ways depending on the age of the child. There are 3 different piles of cards, depending on which variation you choose. With the youngest children you simply have to draw a card and then move the same number as shown on the card. With older children you can choose either to play with addition or subtraction. To move on the board you have to draw 2 cards and move the sum of the cards. When you pass the symbol with the piece of Lego you can take one. The winner is the first player to collect 3 pieces of Lego and then get back to start. There are 2 tiles which can be placed on the board: Either you can have an extra turn or you miss your turn. Playing the game children can learn to count and calculate as well as game-mechanics as turn-taking, drawing cards, taking extra turns and missing a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
