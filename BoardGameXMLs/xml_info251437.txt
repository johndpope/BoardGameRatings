			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been 15 years since Second Impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An explosion in Antarctica vaporized the entire continent. The resulting tidal waves killed billions worldwide and flooded coastal regions of every continent. Worse yet, the very axis of the Earth itself was permanently shifted, causing a global climate change that devastated crops and added incredible strain to already decimated regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the following devastation, many countries and governments collapsed entirely as the United Nations struggled to hold humanity together. Rioting and war became common as vital resources disappeared virtually overnight. The months following Second Impact left no one unscathed, and all told only half of the human race survived the disaster and our resulting fear-induced stupidity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was 15 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was years before the situation stabilized enough for the UN to mount an expedition to ground zero to investigate the explosion. A report was published, proving that Second Impact was the result of a 4-inch meteorite traveling at 95% of the speed of light, much too small and traveling far too quickly to have been detected before its devastating collision with the Earth&amp;rsquo;s South Pole. To this day, all but the most well-informed of individuals believe this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In truth, Second Impact was caused by the awakening and subsequent defeat of a powerful being since labeled &amp;ldquo;Adam&amp;rdquo;. A being older than life on Earth, and of extraterrestrial origin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adam was the first. He was not the last. Humanity is under threat again, and if even a single battle is lost it could mean the end of the entire human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That fate of the world is in your hands. Don&amp;rsquo;t fuck it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
