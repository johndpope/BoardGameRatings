			<description>In this game, players follow tv-reporters from the show &amp;quot;Galileo&amp;quot; on their journey around the world. &lt;br/&gt;In different sectors, players have to estimate about special behaviours in different countries (like How long is the rollercoaster ride in a certain holiday park in the netherlands or &amp;quot;how many liters of icecream eat germans within a whole year?&amp;quot;) and with some luck and skills, they can put the nations flags on their suitcases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dices are included and will determine, which questions you have to answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
