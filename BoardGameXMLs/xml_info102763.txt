			<description>John Madden Football is a football video game, the second Madden football game released by Electronic Arts. Its features include various field conditions, audibles, and password-saved games. For the first time in a football video game, the game is played from above and behind the quarterback rather than from the side. However, as in the previous version, no actual NFL teams are included due to the lack of NFL or NFLPA licenses for authentic teams or player names. It is the series debut on the SNES and the only Madden game released for the Amiga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the first initial release (1990) on a console, which was on the Sega Genesis platform, only a total of 16 teams were available to choose from. Each of these teams were based unofficially on teams from the 1990 NFL season. The following cities and team colors chosen were Houston (Oilers), New York (Giants), San Francisco (49ers), Philadelphia (Eagles), Atlanta (Falcons), Los Angeles (Rams), Buffalo (Bills), Minnesota (Vikings), Chicago (Bears), Miami (Dolphins), New England (Patriots), Denver (Broncos), Pittsburgh (Steelers), Cincinnati (Bengals), Kansas City (Chiefs) and Washington (Redskins). An All-Madden team was included as a bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;John Madden Football (1990)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
