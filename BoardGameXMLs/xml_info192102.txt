							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Get up and Go with the Power of Oats</name>
									
			<description>This game was printed on the back of a Honey Nut Cheerios box.  It is a &amp;quot;flip and move&amp;quot; game where players flip a coin to move along a track, collecting oats along the way.  Heads moves the player one space, tails two spaces.  Some spaces grant the characters a number of oats, from one to fifteen.  Some spaces move the player forward or cause loss of a turn.  The player who finishes with the most oats wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules do not specify if the game ends when one player reaches the end, or when all do, but it would make sense to end the game when the first player finishes, otherwise losing a turn would have no negative effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
