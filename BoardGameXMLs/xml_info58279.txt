			<description>(Excerpt from Publisher's Description)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This all-in-one Siege Engine Role Playing Game is brought to you by the makers of Castles &amp;amp; Crusades. Created and written by famed game designer James M. Ward, Tainted Lands is an RPG of Fantasy Horror. Utilizing the simple Siege mechanic Mr. Ward allows the Game Master to plunge his characters into a world of unrivaled horror where the supernatural dominates the adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon the far slopes of the Turmberg Mountains, where the northern shores of Lake Vanhir lap the Plains of Cos lie the fog-enshrouded Tainted Lands. In the Days before Days hosts of dark hearted Val-Ehrakun settled here even before the sun and moon rose in the heavens. They shaped the earth, molding it with hysterical delusions. In their delirium they befouling the land, polluted the waters and staining the very air with madness. The land itself, filled with this poison became twisted, a living embodiment of the horror of nightmare. But as with all things, this too passed and the Tainted Lands became a wasteland of forgotten dreams and misspent sorcery. For eons it lay dormant, suffering under the yoke of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now, the shroud of its winter has given way and the Tainted Lands have come alive again. The earth groans and spits its necromantic horror in the air. Monsters, dread and foul rise from the muck of corruption and stalk the wastes. And the dreams of gods rise as nightmares from the blasted heath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come play in the tainted lands and survive the horrors that walk behind you, spring at you from the fogs all around, and grow from minor things into alarming corrupted creatures of awesome power; always hungry for those who accidentally become pulled into a nightmare of creatures and lands filled with horrific death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
