			<description>A One-Round Living City Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were awakened in the early morning hours by a knock on your door. Opening the door you saw a member of the night watch, who told you that your presence was requested at Sharkey&amp;rsquo;s Bar and Grill. The officer told you that the person who requested your service would provide any more information. After waiting for you the Night Watch officer began escorting you to the docks, so that you could enter the water and head towards Sharkey's. It did seem rather odd that with the crime wave that the city is experiencing you have not seen any other guards other than one escorting you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
