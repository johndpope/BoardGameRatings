			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tucked away under snow and ice and rock, deep in the Spine of the World Mountains, lies a relic of the Ageless War. The ancient cloud giant stronghold of Cloudbreak Keep &amp;ndash; the main location of giant knowledge and lore &amp;ndash; crashed into the mountains centuries ago. Lost to time and legend, the keep has been occupied by different monsters. However, recently cloud giant activity in the far North has increased. Floating castles have been spotted, the wildlife has been erratic, and the dwarves of Mirobar have made an interesting discovery. Scholars believe that within the keep lies an ancient cataclysmic ritual the cloud giants created. This genocidal magic contained the power to annihilate dragonkind and end the Ageless War. Now, if the cloud giants can reclaim the Tome of Fate, they may turn their sights to the smallfolk of the North. Can your characters locate Cloudbreak Keep and the Tome of Fate before the cloud giants? The fate of the Sword Coast may depend on it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4th - 6th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
