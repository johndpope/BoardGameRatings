			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climb effortlessly through the ranks of the Rebel Alliance with Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Specialization Decks! Created via FFG's in-house manufacturing, Age of Rebellion Specialization Decks each come with twenty talent cards for a single specialization, so you can keep the text of your character's abilities at your fingertips. Whether you're learning the ropes, flying star fighters into battle, or exchanging blaster fire with Imperial Stormtroopers, Specialization Decks will help you spend less time reviewing the rules so you have more time to battle the evil Galactic Empire! Many within the Rebel Alliance assume that all Medics are inherent pacifists. While a Medic might prefer to save a life rather than take it, most realize the necessity of fighting and violence for a greater cause, and are more than ready to strike down an enemy in order to save a comrade. With the Soldier Medic Specialization Deck, you'll always be ready for whatever task lies before you, since its cards allow you to transition seamlessly from your medical efforts to aggressive military action and back again. This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook is required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
