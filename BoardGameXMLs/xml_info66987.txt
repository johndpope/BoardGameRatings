			<description>The British aviation magazine, to celebrate the 50 years from the Battle of Britain, decided to offer to its readers a wargame.&lt;br/&gt;In the introduction of the rules it is so descibed:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;BATTLE OF BRITAIN: THE HARDEST DAY recreates the events of 18 August 1940, the day during the Battle when the greatest number of aircraft were destroyed and damaged on either side.&lt;br/&gt;Contestants are the senior Fighter Controller at 11 Group of Fighter Command, on the British side and the senior operational officer at Luftflotte 2 of the Lutwaffe, on the German side. For authenticity, in the game each of side uses the exact forces available to it on 18 August, bombers and fighters move across the map at the same rate as did the real aircraft during the Battle and each contestant has operational orders and directives similar to those of his real counterpart during this phase of the Battle of Britain. The players control pieces representing each British fighter squadron, and forces from each German bomber and fighter Geschwader, in their struggle for air superiority over the vitally important south eastern corner of England. The rules of the game have been carefully worked out to present a series of actions remarkably close to those actually fought during the Battle of Britain. With tactical skill and element of good fortune, either side can win. Devised by Dr. Alfred Price and Mike Spick.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
