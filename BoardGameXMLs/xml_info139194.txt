			<description>Up until now a squid and its friends - lots of little fish - have been playing happily together in the sea. However, a racy little shark has suddenly appeared and is circling this group of playmates. Luckily the squid is able to spread lots of ink ! Now we need your help ! Come and play together and help save the squid and its friends by covering the shark in so much ink, that it can't see properly. Because a shark that dissapears in a 'soup of ink' cannot be dangerous anymore ! The excitement begins: Is the shark going to eat up 9 little fishes first ? Or will the squid manage to squirt enough ink to save his friends first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
