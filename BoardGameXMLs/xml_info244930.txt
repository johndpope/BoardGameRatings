			<description>Don&amp;rsquo;t Shit Your Pants is an Internet browser game that puts you the pants of a poor sap who is desperately trying to heed Nature&amp;rsquo;s call. Based on the text-based adventure games of old, the only tools at your &amp;lsquo;disposal&amp;rsquo; are the limited text commands you can give the character on-screen. With 10 achievements to unlock, DSYP redefines the idea of survival horror. Will minstrels yarn tales of your bowel mastery for generations, or will you experience a mud-butt disaster of epic proportions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its release in 2009, DSYP has been met with critical and viral success. The game has enjoyed several million plays, and has received special acknowledgment from popular gaming sites Kotaku, 1UP, IGN, G4TV, Rock Paper Shotgun, and Giant Bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
