							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happy Holiday</name>
									
			<description>This game is one of a series of roll-and-move games published by the Regent Book Store in Singapore in the 1970s or 1980s. The games all have a paper board with graphic illustrations in the style of that period. Text on the board is in both English and Chinese. The boards were printed by Koon Wah Lithographers, Singapore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Happy Holiday, the board depicts children engaged in various holiday activites, like skiing, flying kites, canoeing, etc. Players roll a die and move their token around a spiral track, moving forward or backward or missing turns if they land on certain special spaces. These spaces show a child engaged in a particular activity the player moves or misses turns accordingly. Examples are, &amp;quot;(42) Stop once - showing a child reading a book.&amp;quot;, or, &amp;quot;(58) Back to 41 - showing a boy throwing a ball toward a girl on space 41&amp;quot;. The first player to reach space 62 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
