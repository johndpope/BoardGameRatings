			<description>Tips on Becoming a Better Dungeon Master&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collection of thoughts and ideas from 30+ years spent playing D&amp;amp;D and other tabletop RPGs as both player and referee. They&amp;rsquo;re things that have worked for me, made my games infinitely better. This is not to say I&amp;rsquo;m some Genius Wizard DM of Awesome. It&amp;rsquo;s just to say I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this a long time. It&amp;rsquo;s to say that I was terrible at DMing when I started, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a thing or two about what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t, and if you can learn something from that, well, here you go. Maybe you try some. Maybe not. If any of this helps you be a better DM, we can call it a win. The biggest caveat is that this is stuff that works for me. It might not work for you. That&amp;rsquo;s okay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
