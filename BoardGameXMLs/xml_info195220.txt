			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Davae Breon Jaxon's Cinematic Environs begins a new series of suppliments designed to help GMs paint vivid cinematic scenes for their players in a way that gives the environment its own unique character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These environs can take a mundane encounter or location and turn it into an epic scene that the players will be talking about for year to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first in the series deals with Arctic Environs. It discusses the effects of deep cold, despair, frostbite and generally miserable conditions one is likely to encounter in the frozen wastes, glacier fields and tundras of your world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, instead of simply sending the party on an edventure to explore an ancient tomb, the GM can have the tomb buried beneath a glacier. Instead of a simple orc ambush, the party now has to be aware that too much noise could trigger an avalanche, and so the wizard must rethink using that thunder-based spell. Instead of simply chasing the bandits across an open field, they end up chasing them across a frozen lake that is cracking beneath their feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also incuded is a new character background, new equipment and new weapons related to this particular environ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
