			<description>The &amp;quot;out of sight&amp;quot; game to play. For groovy gamers of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to collect as many marbles as possible without uncovering any of the red dots that are &amp;quot;out of sight&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marbles are set on all open circles so the red dots underneath cannot be seen. Then a spinner is spun that changes the position of the red dots to unknown areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players spin the &amp;quot;Fickle Finger of Fate&amp;quot; spinner to tell them how many marbles to remove. If a red dot is under the marble, the player must return as many marbles as it takes to cover all the holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player who uncovered a red dot cannot cover all the open holes, then the game is over and the player with the most marbles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
