			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the English edition of G00: Geographia Aventurica but has been heavily modified beyond a simple translation. From the introduction it is claimed that some things that wouldn't make sense (due to other material not being released in English) were removed and other information was added to solidify this setting together for the English audience. Due to these significant differences, this book is given its own item entry here on RPG Geek rather than as a version of G00: Geographia Aventurica&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the lands of the DARK EYE!&lt;br/&gt;The world of Aventuria awaits you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the frozen tundras of the Grimmfrost Wastes to the blasted wastes of the Kh&amp;ocirc;m Desert, the forests of the Elves to the steaming jungles of the Cyclops Islands, the continent of Aventuria has it all. Political intrigue, ancient Emperor Dragons, demon overlords and marauding bands of orks. The Orkstorm is over, and the evil Borbarad has been defeated, but their legacies remain. The people of&lt;br/&gt;Aventuria are rebuilding, and in desperate need of heroes. Who will answer their call?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 major regions and nations are covered in-depth, plus dozens more major cities across the lands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details on cultures, armies and navies, law and order, astrology and superstition, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reports from the few intrepid adventurers who have made the trek across the oceans and to the lands beyond&amp;mdash;and survived to tell about it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New game rules for poisons and diseases both common and rare, ancient magical tomes, additional Talents and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 130 major NPCs from all walks of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to explore the lands of The Dark Eye!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
