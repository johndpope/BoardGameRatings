			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boing is a strategy game that requires strategy and a bit of luck to win. In Boing, up to six human or computer opponents navigate their playing pieces around the board, playing tiles on the board in an attempt to gain points and undermine their opponents&amp;rsquo; efforts to do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything in Boing is customizable! The parameters that govern the size and shape of the playing board are tunable by the user. The rules of the game can be modified to suit every gamer&amp;rsquo;s particular playing style. Computer opponents have three levels of difficulty. With so many options, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get addicted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
