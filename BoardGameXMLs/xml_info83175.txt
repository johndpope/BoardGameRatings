It is set during in Rome during the rule of Emperor Commdous, and follows the player as they control a gladiator in the arena. The start of the game sees the player indebted to a patron, and they must fight to earn money to pay off their debt and become a freeman. Gameplay centres around training to improve the character&amp;rsquo;s abilities and fighting in the arena for money. There is a large degree of control afforded to the player in customizing their character, both in appearance and equipment. A variety of weapons can be chosen, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Gladiator: Road to Freedom Remix is a rerelease of the game that included a few updates to gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players can also work together or against each other in a number of arenas, and an Arena mode allows the player to create custom matches to play alone or with a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
