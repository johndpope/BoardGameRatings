			<description>Enlighten helps players compare major religions.  Players answer questions about Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hindu, Buddhism and New Religious Movements while circumnavigating the playing area. The winner is &amp;quot;enlightened.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has the traditional square board through which players move by casting a die, but the board is divided into the six major religions and three historical categories -- prehistoric, Eastern and paganism. As players successfully answer questions, they enter the Enlighten Path, where they have to identify quotes from major religions and philosophical leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charles Flores, a friend of the designers who was getting a master's degree at the California Institute of Integral Studies in East-West psychology, helped write the questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
