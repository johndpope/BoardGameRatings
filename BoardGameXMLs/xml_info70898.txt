			<description>This is a Warpspawn two-player card game representing English v. Scots circa 1296-1314 (You all saw &amp;quot;Braveheart&amp;quot;).  Game lasts exactly 72 turns, every 4th turn a very short one to account for that year's winter season; automatic victory at any time if one side captures all 20 territory tokens.  Each turn each plays leader, nobles, and troops cards; then event cards to affect cards in play; then strategy cards to enhance their side, highest number of different types of cards gets victory that year, takes a token from the other, may get some additional benefit.  I've made a card set (deleting 2 equally-matched cards, 1 for each side, to fit the cards conveniently on 3 sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
