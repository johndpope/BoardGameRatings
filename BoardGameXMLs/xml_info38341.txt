							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of RIO</name>
									
			<description>RIO is a fast paced, light family card game which acts superbly as a filler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the game special is that it comes in the Parker Brothers standard box size of its time, same as e.g. Star Reporter.&lt;br/&gt;Thus it is completely oversized, but if it's your cup of tea you are rewarded during gameplay by excellent graphics on the board and the box inlays where holiday scenes are depicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 48 cards - 4 sets of 12 numbers in 4 colours - which have to be laid out in a given pattern onto the board where a kind of discard-clock is shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win you have to get rid of your cards before all other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can score in different ways, and you have to decide when it's the best time to lay out your own or to destroy opponents winning combination and when to exchange cards of your hand with pre-dealt cards on the clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the rules state that 3 to 6 can play it also works well with 2 players, and there are variants for partnership play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
