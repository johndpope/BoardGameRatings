			<description>Shoot-A-Loop is a tin loop with a spring that launches marbles to the top where they will drop down into scoring holes. There are seven scoring holes with values of  25, 0, 50, 100, 75, 0 and 250 points. Included are three marbles in different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instruction sheet includes five games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triple Play - Each player shoots all three marbles, one at a time. The player then adds up the points for the round. The player with the highest total after three rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucky Triple Play - Played the same as Triple Play, except a player picks one marble to be &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot;. That marble is worth double points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1500 or Bust - Each player shoots all three marbles, one at a time. The first player to score a total of exactly 1500 points wins. If a player exceeds 1500 points, they bust back to 1250 and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoot Ten - Each player takes a turn shooting one marble ten times. After all players have taken a turn, the scores are added up. The player with the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call Your Shot - Played like Shoot Ten, except that a player gets a chance to double their score by calling their shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
