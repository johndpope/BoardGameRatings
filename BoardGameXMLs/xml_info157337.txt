			<description>A thrilling race between a skilled motorist, a jealous pedestrian and a beautiful girl: Each player has 3 meeples: a car, a girl and a man. The goal is to get all 3 meeples around the game board and back into their own garage. The opposite players move in opposite directions. The moves of the meeples are determined by a spinner. Whenever the different kinds of meeples meet, different things happen. The girl enters every car it meets and may change cars if the oportunity arrives. The man gets every girl to leave the car. If a car with a girl of another color enters its garage, the girl has to begin anew. The spinner can send the car or the girl back to its starting point too, if it shows &amp;quot;Weine nicht&amp;quot; (= don't cry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in the 1920s or 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
