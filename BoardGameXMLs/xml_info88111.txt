			<description>From the PDF's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vade Mecum of Magic makes the perfect companion to the magic system presented in the D6 Adventure Rulebook or the D6 Fantasy Rulebook. We give you explanations, clarifications, additonal guidelines, and more than XX new spells.So, if you just haven't had the chance to pick up the D6 Adventure Rulebook or D6 Fantasy Rulebook, can you still get something out of this book? Absolutely! We've included a couple of new, simple magic systems that're compatible with the full-blown version. We also give you information about the skills, so you can use the spells right out of this book.Need more spells? Check out the D6 Bloodshadows world-book! In it, you'll find more than 60 spells, plus an extended spell failure chart, potions and other magical items, and new horror-inspired species packages. If you feel like trying your hand at making spells but don't want to number crunch, West End Games offers a basic spell designer on its Web site (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.westendgames.com/d6/makespell.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.westendgames.com/d6/makespell.html&lt;/a&gt;). Use it a few times to help you understand how the full magic system works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: D6 Magic/D6 Vade Mecum of Magic (WEG 51024) was never released as a completed product. This Open D6 release was made from the last draft completed, therefore, use of material should be considered as is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
