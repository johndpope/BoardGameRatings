			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants! is a party game based on the SpongeBob SquarePants television series. In the game, the popular television series &amp;ldquo;The New Adventures of Mermaidman and Barnacle Boy&amp;rdquo; is in trouble. The cast has not shown up, so it falls to SpongeBob and friends to vie for the spotlight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls one of six playable characters (SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton) as they compete for nine different roles on the show. The game pits players against one another in 30 different &amp;ldquo;auditions&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; various mini-games similar to those found in the different Mario Party titles. Winning games earns points toward being cast in the different parts for the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mini-games are split into two categories: Free-for-all and 2 vs. 2. There are a number of artwork and action figure unlockables that are earned through a variety of achievements in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The home console version of the game differs significantly from both the Gameboy Advance and PC versions, which are platformer and adventure-puzzle games, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
