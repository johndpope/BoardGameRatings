			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds in a round-robin fashion as typical for card games.  The game utilizes a custom set of cards, one set required for each player.  The game document does not include the cards but does have directions for how to produce them.  The game also uses a pool of dice for some action resolution.  The players attempt to complete a series of challenges to move toward a desired goal.  Roleplaying is a secondary consideration to the card and dice game process, and in any event a single player &amp;quot;wins&amp;quot; the game at the conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
