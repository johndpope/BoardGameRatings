			<description>&amp;quot;After centuries of squabbling and fighting mankind finally came to terms with itself in the 26th Century. A United Earth Government was formed, putting all the resources of the Earth into the Colonization of the Solar System. Mars became colonized, using vast agricultural schemes to promote a more healthy atmosphere; the steamy jungles of Venus were controlled and made habitable. In the 27th Century the Solar Federation was formed. Man now looked to the stars to expand further. The Federation's nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, some four and a quarter light years away, was explored and found to contain three habitable planets - Titan, Poseidon and Vidor. These were soon colonized by eager migrants from the Solar Federation's teeming&lt;br/&gt;millions. The Galactic Federation was formed.&lt;br/&gt;It is now the year 2975, and once again war threatens Mankind. The Galactic Federation is split and the Solar Federation finds itself fighting against the Proxima Centauri Alliance. Both sides have agreed not to violate the planets but to settle the conflict on a much larger battlefield - deep space. Both sides have similar space navies and also, because both developed from the same culture, similar weapons and defense systems. The only difference lies in the tactical capabilities of the spaceship commanders. You now have the chance to command a fleet of spaceships to see who rules the two star systems.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of several titles released by Tabletop Games which were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a map) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming. The games offered an affordable alternative to the miniatures hobby in that they used uncut cardstock counters. Other games in the series include Ballistic Missile, MTB, and Galactic War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
