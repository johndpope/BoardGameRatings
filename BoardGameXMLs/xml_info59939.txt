			<description>Players draw a card and identify numbered features on a map of the world's oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifty cards have the name of a feature (e.g., Great Barrier Reef, Equatorial Counter Current) on one side and a description on the other.  In the easy game, players draw a card with the feature name face up and must match that card to the map.  In the advanced game, the card is drawn with the description face up and the feature must be both named and located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the person who has collected the most cards after a set time limit or when all cards have been drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box also includes a detailed glossary, a pre- and post-test, and a word find game and letter scramble that can be copied for class handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
