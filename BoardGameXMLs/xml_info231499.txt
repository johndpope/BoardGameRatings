			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uh! is a fast and furious card game based on the Machiavelli's mechanics. The deck is composed by cards inspired at the cave men world (torches, bowls, flints, etc.). Aim of the game is to remain without cards before the other players, combining them in succession or triplets. You can add or subtract cards on the desk and draw from the deck if and when you want. The thrilling of the game is that there's no turn: all players play at the same time, so you have to be smart, fast and aggressive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
