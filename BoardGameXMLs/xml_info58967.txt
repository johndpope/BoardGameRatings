							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Voyage to Storm Isle</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters of 3rd-5th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sea captain is a middle-aged man, with weathered features, thinning gray hair, and a neatly trimmed gray beard. He peers at you with penetrating green eyes, a huge tankard of ale clutched in one wrinkled and calloused fist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'My ship, the Salt Dog, is a merchanter, a peaceful vessel of trade and commerce. I've been sailing the southern seas for thirty years, and I've never had any need of soldiers or mercenaries. But I'm thinkin' I may be in need of 'em now. In two days, I sail for Storm Isle. There's a lot of ocean between here and there, and it ain't rumored to be the safest stretch o' water in the south. Word is, you can handle a sword and it won't take you long to find your sea legs. If the winds stay true, the voyage will take about ten days each way, so I'll be needin' you for the better part of a month. I'll pay you each a hundred and fifty gold, a third of that now, the rest when we get back. Probably be the easiest gold you ever came by honestly. You'll also have your own cabin on the Salt Dog and three square a day at my table. The wind, the waves, a little adventure on the high seas, and a purse full to spend in port when we return... What say you... do we have a deal?'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
