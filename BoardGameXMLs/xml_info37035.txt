			<description>An antique card game in which the players attempt to collect sets of picture cards belonging to particular artists. The deck includes an Index card for each artist which specifies how many cards are in that artist's set. The player who collects the most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternate rules are included for a game in which one player, the &amp;quot;President&amp;quot;, starts with all the Index cards and asks each of the players in turn for a card from a certain artist until all of the sets have been made up. The players win and lose counters from a pool during the course of the game. The player with the most counters at the end wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were at least two versions of the game published - one for the &amp;quot;British school&amp;quot; of art and one for the &amp;quot;Dutch school.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
