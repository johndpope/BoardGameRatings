			<description>Fa&amp;ccedil;ade puts the player in the role of a close friend of Grace and Trip, a couple who recently invited the player to their home for cocktails. This pleasant gathering, however, is somewhat damaged by the clear domestic confrontation between Grace and Trip upon the player's entry. Making full use of the incorporated language processing software, Fa&amp;ccedil;ade allows the player to type sentences to &amp;quot;speak&amp;quot; with the couple, either supporting them through their troubles, driving them farther apart, or being thrown out of the apartment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incorporating elements of both video gaming and drama, Fa&amp;ccedil;ade takes advantage of voice acting and a 3-D environment, as well as natural language processing and other advanced artificial intelligence routines, to provide a robust interactive fiction experience. The player can take an active role in the conversation, pushing the topic one way or another, as in an interactive stage-play. These stage-plays are stored as script text files which can be read after the player has finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fa&amp;ccedil;ade was released for PC in July 2005, as a free download from the InteractiveStory.net web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Façade (interactive story)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
