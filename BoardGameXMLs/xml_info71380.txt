			<description>&amp;quot;WCW Wrestling (a.k.a. World Championship Wrestling) is a Nintendo Entertainment System video game for one or two players released in 1990. It was the first (and to date, only) video game based on the National Wrestling Alliance (at the time, WCW was a member of NWA). After the Road Warriors left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation, they were replaced on the box front, instruction booklet, and cartridge label by Sting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The digitized voice sample at the title screen that says, &amp;quot;World... Championship... Wrestling!&amp;quot; was performed by Paul E. Dangerously. To date, the game has sold over 100,000 copies.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WCW_Wrestling,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
