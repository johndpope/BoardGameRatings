			<description>After the immortal God Zeus, king of the gods, has a particularly boring period in his existence, he decides he wants to have some fun with a few humans.He invites four people to meet him at his temple where he explains he wishes to give the gift of immortality to one of them but they have to prove there worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, he leads them to a maze at the back of his temple where he bluntly states that the first person to get out the other end, if anyone at all does, will be granted Immortality and be recognised as a friend of Zeus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by people playing as these characters trying to be the first one to reach the maze exit.Each character has an ability unique to them, such as the mage having a higher max energy allowance or the warrior using an extra battle dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists of rolling turn dice to see what actions can be made by the player which include but is not.limited to, dealing damage to other players, drawing cards, buying equipment, healing etc. Cards can be drawn from two decks open to all players but the deck with the exit in cannot be drawn from until players meet certain criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
