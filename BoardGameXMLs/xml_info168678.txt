			<description>Les Guerres Indiennes (&amp;quot;The Indian Wars&amp;quot;) is a series of solo games feigning all the conflicts which set the federal government of the United States against the Amerindian tribes throughout the XIXth century. The first volume of this series is centered on one of the characters the most known for this epic, colonel Georges Armstrong Custer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, three game boards represent the historic space of three major fights which delivers this hero of the western conquest to tribes Lakotas, Cheyenne and Arapaho: Washita (in November 27th, 1868), Honsinger Bluff (in August 4th, 1873) and Little Big Horn (in June 26th, 1876). On these maps, 1 cm represents approximately 200 meters and a game turn represent approximately half an hour of time.&lt;br/&gt;The lenght of this game is 10 turns, it is the time which you have to manage  the 7th of cavalry, the famous regiment of Custer, and allow him to fil his mission in spite of Indians warriors which will oppose you vehemently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can repel the American Indians who threaten your survival? You will try to replay history, but you can also explore new tracks by following the thread of the numerous proposed hypothetical scenarios. The task is difficult, but glorious. One thing's for sure, trust, it is a good day to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
