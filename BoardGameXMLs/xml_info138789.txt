							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Card Coyote</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;In a darkened room, the Trickster God smiled and shuffled the cards. The assembled celestial powers were not amused with Coyote's theatrics, but they also knew that the cycle was coming to an end. This was their chance to grab the power for themselves. But until then, Coyote literally held all the cards; a metaphor for the earthly power that he had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Players assume two roles each, a tradesman (like a blacksmith) and a god (from a mix of pantheons, including Thos, Cthulhu, and Chuck Norris). The gods are competing in a poker game while the tradesmen are working as their agents to unlock the ability for the player's god to walk among men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
