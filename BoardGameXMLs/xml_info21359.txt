			<description>&amp;quot;All the thrills of a social season and a chance to be a .... Prom Queen&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very cheaply made game by 'Built Rite'.  The Senior Prom Game is a simple roll and move game for children.  The game board is made out of thin cardboard and features 2 different tracks to move around depending on an initial spin with the spinner.  Even the playing tokens are made out of cheap cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some out of date and stereo-typical items are found on the game board including....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Meet new boy at game.  Wow!  Run ahead 3 spaces.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dance with T.V. idol at sock hop.  Move ahead 6 spaces.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Study for finals with boy friend.  Move ahead 2 spaces.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
