			<description>PREPARATION:&lt;br/&gt;Stack the cans in a pyramid.  Shuffle all cards and place the deck face down, in easy reach of all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;A player is chosen to be first.  He takes a card from the card deck and now attempts to remove the matching can from the stack.  He keeps the can and the card and the next player goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FALLING CANS:&lt;br/&gt;If on a player's turn only one can drops from the stack, his turn is over and he must return the fallen can to the stack and the card to the bottom of the card deck. He scores no points for that round.  If more than one can drops from the stack, the game is over and the player who upsets the stack scores no points for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;Each player counts the total point score of his cards.  Highest point score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
