			<description>The players are shepherds in medieval Spain seeking to expand and make wise investments in their flocks.  Throughout the game they choose from among the roles of Lambing, Market Day, Place Investments, Cry Wolf, Bear, Barter and Stray Sheep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In lambing, the players can choose to cooperate and help the other shepherds or go it alone, in hopes of receiving a larger return.  As the players all cooperate, the predator threat from the wolves and bear is minimized.  If any player chooses not to cooperate, then the predator threat grows, usually threatening the non-cooperative players the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Cry Wolf role is chosen, then the players must (in an order determined by earlier play) roll a twelve-sided die to determine whether their flock has been attacked. Once a flock is attacked, the remaining players&amp;rsquo; flocks are safe for the rest of the round.  There are many different ways a player can minimize the predator threat to herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to make investments, a player must sell his sheep (which are also points at the end of the game) and then place the gold received as investments in a Ram, Best Pasture, Market Stand, Guard Dog, Gaita, or Divine Intervention.  The largest investment in each of these areas provides advantages throughout the game as well as additional points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cry Wolf! uniquely employs a modified &amp;ldquo;prisoner&amp;rsquo;s dilemma&amp;rdquo; in lambing which is integrated with a typically increasing and dynamic predator threat.  The majority area control of investments combined with the timing of placement being determined through variable phase order also provides challenging strategic choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
