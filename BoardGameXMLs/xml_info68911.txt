							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Everytown</name>
									
			<description>Everytown is a ready-made, highly customizable locale for a Twilight: 2013 Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As written, the locations of Everytown are purposely named by their function and the NPCs called by their trade or position in the town rather than given names so the GM can easily modify them to reflect the locale and society they choose for their campaign. The intent is to maximize utility for every group playing Twilight: 2013, while retaining a plausible feel of a community of survivors that has survived the Last Year relatively intact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everytown is the root and trunk of a tree that, it is hoped, will bear much adventuring fruit for players. The follow-on scenarios connected to Everytown will be branches of that tree, usable on their own if grafted into another campaign, but adding adventure to the Everytown setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- from the publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
