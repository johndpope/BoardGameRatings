			<description>A Tale of Death, Drama, and Musical Comedy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Show Must... is a humorous adventure for any number of characters with almost any sort of skills. At least one person in the party should have some combat experience with a sword, and it might help (but be less amusing) if a few have decent Fellowship scores or the Performer (Actor) skill. The tale centres on the characters being forced by circumstance to appear in the premiere performance of a brand new operetta, a splendid and fantastical work called Porcolina! As such, there is little emphasis on combat and the adventure will work best if your players are keen to &amp;ldquo;ham things up&amp;rdquo; when their characters are on stage. If your players are agreeable to such things, The Show Must... makes an excellent adventure to break up the flow of job-hunting in a large town or city, so that not every job on the wall is either a dead-end or an obvious continuation of the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
