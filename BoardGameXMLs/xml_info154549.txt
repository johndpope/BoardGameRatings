			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Eldruden Earth. God is dead and so are his Angels. Demons and Devils maraud the haunted landscape, where humans hang from the skies, Hell has fused with nearly ninety percent of the Earth, and the oceans, seas, rivers and lakes have turned to blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity is threatened with extinction. Hell Storms frequent the remaining cities. Butcher men prowl the streets in packs, preying on innocents. Serial Killers are initiated into demonic cults where their deadly art is refined and skills honed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT IS EVISICUS I?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Tome features 10 Hell Class Templates that characters can play. Contained within this Hell Class Tome are the rules any Player may need to role-play a variety of classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell Classes are character classes that guide a Player&amp;rsquo;s roleplaying throughout their Nightmare. Although this book has been wrought for Players, a Hell Master can easily use these templates as a guide for creating NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
