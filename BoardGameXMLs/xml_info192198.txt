			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The folks here at Flying Ape Studios have always been fans of the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous roleplaying game, especially its older iterations. Fifth edition was a great surprise, since it had elements from past editions and became once again a game that can be played without worrying too much about rules and etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much to our surprise the rules for this edition were released under the Open Game License. We knew we had to come up with some content for it... but we didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to after all! We had already created some monsters for fun, so all that was left to do was to polish them up. So began Double Dose Monsters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be a regular series in which two new monsters are presented back to back. It is also available in Brazilian Portuguese. In this first volume we present the Shark Orc and the Burning Guardian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
