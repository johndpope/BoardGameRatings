							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust and Mirrors - Music for Night&#039;s Black Agents</name>
									
			<description> From the publisher's website: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust and Mirrors &amp;ndash; music for Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was delighted to be asked to write original music for Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents. The game is truly a masterpiece backed up by some incredible research and it just oozes atmosphere. Superspies vs Vampires? What&amp;rsquo;s not to like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this project I assembled a crack team of amazing composers who each brought something unique to the table. Everyone was very inspired by the source material and that really comes across. I consider myself honoured to be surrounded by so much talent here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The music itself is made up of tracks which are each designed to work for specific situations but also can be played together as an album for a general mood of tension, action and horror. I hope this creates the perfect mood for your games!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- James Semple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust and Mirrors contains the following tracks, specifically composed for Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Main Theme&lt;br/&gt;Mysterious and dramatic music sets the scene for the game ahead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Stakeout&lt;br/&gt;Hidden surveillance and gathering evidence during dark hours of the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The Brief&lt;br/&gt;A meeting, telephone call, email or letter is the catalyst for a series of events where danger lurks in the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Infiltration&lt;br/&gt;An overall sense of dread envelopes you when you discreetly enter the state-of-the-art facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Ambient&lt;br/&gt;A moment to reflect where secret agents become ambivalent when their duty to the mission conflicts with their consciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Manhunt&lt;br/&gt;A dangerous chase in a network of power and crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Suit Up&lt;br/&gt;The final battle approaches, and only you have what it takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. Urban Parkour&lt;br/&gt;Desperate pursuit across rooftops in a city where death is on the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. Purging The Demon&lt;br/&gt;A desperate struggle between human and vampire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10. Heist&lt;br/&gt;Heavyweight direct brute force is sometimes the agents&amp;rsquo; only recourse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11. Conspyramid&lt;br/&gt;Conspiracy theories take a horrific turn after uncovering an ancient and dangerous secret society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12. Covert Ops&lt;br/&gt;Behind enemy lines sometimes subterfuge is the best approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13. The Great Escape&lt;br/&gt;Confrontation is futile, all you can do now is run for your life. How will you get out of this one?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14. Captured&lt;br/&gt;Emotionally draining circumstance of being trapped in a fiercely unpleasant and smelly environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15. An Eye For An Eye&lt;br/&gt;An all out horror piece where the character is alone, vulnerable and miles away from any other human being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16. Horror&lt;br/&gt;The unfortunate and unforeseen event of meeting with blood-thirsty Vampires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17. Darkness&lt;br/&gt;The true nature and power of the Vampires is revealed. Few can stand against it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18. Crawlers&lt;br/&gt;You can feel them watching, waiting patiently for you to come out of your hiding place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19. Atonement&lt;br/&gt;A final reflective moment when the agents examine the life they lead and the choices they have made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
