							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armored Trooper Votoms: Plotters City Woodo</name>
									
			<description>Complexity level 4 on Takara's 1-5 scale (1=easiest)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based off the science fiction mecha anime Armored Trooper Votoms, but quite different in look and feel than Tsukuda's line of Votoms wargames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still uses hexes and counters, but also includes 24 miniature metal mecha for the main robots in the game. It includes 6 maps, and 6 small fold-up buildings. It also includes 2 periscopes (one for each player) for helping to determine line of sight. Basically its a rectangular tube with an angled mirror that you point towards the robot on the bottom end, and you look into the other end that also has an angled mirror that points at you. Using this, you can see from the robots point of view (sorry, it's tough to explain).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
