							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Firearms! DX</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Firearms DX, a fan-created sourcebook on firearms for Tri-stat DX. This book was made specifically for modern day weapons in mind, but I have listed generic primitive and space-age weapons at the end. The book will list handguns, revolvers, assault rifles, hunting and sporting rifles, and sniper rifles, along with some of the heavier weapons, like a (barely!) man-portable gatling gun and the flamethrower. This totals over a 100+ weapons! It will even include various &amp;lsquo;oddities&amp;rsquo; like a .38 cal cigar or the Stick Foam Sprayer. Because of the nature of this book, I must confess that I am not a vary knowledgeable when it comes to firearms. While writing this I tried to be as accurate as possible for each weapon detailed in this book. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that what is found within Firearms! DX is 100% accurate and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used as a reference when dealing with real firearms, there are many books on the subject that provide a lot more useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
