							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Intrachange</name>
									
			<description>Intrachange is a marriage of Chess and the I Ching inspired by The Glass Bead Game conceived by author Hermann Hesse. Gameplay proceeds as in normal Chess with the exclusion of the moves Castling, En passant, Promotion of the pawn, and Check/Mate. The gameboard consists of a standard chessboard superimposed with the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching with a different arrangement from the opposing black and white perspectives. Each chess piece is associated with one of the six line ranks of the Hexagrams based upon type and a yang or yin line based on color. Each player begins by making an exoteric move according the normal movements of Chess. If the piece lands in a square that doesn't match the line type in the associated rank of the I Ching Hexagram, then a second esoteric move is made to the appropriate correlative square. All pieces except the knight may pass through other pieces during an esoteric move. Pawns may only capture pieces esoterically after exoteric movement to squares of the seventh rank of the board. The game ends by moving a piece onto a square occupied by the opponents King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
