			<description>Kokusai Sannin Shogi (International three-person chess) is a modern variant of Shogi (Japanese chess) for three players, created around 1930 by Tanigasaki Jisuke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place on a board of 127 hexagonal cells. Each player controls a set of 18 pieces. The game allows for two players to enter an alliance against the third. If two players engage in a coordinated attack against the third, they are entered into an alliance automatically. The player not in an alliance gains a more powerful king piece and easier win conditions to counterbalance the alliance. As in other games in the chess family, the goal is to checkmate an opponent's king. A player not in an alliance need only checkmate one player to defeat both of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike traditional games in the chess family, which have a thin military theme, kokusai sannin shogi has a thin political one, with pieces named after concepts such as public opinion, diplomacy and propaganda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incorporates information from: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannin_shogi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannin_shogi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
