			<description>Explain the words on the word cards with synonyms, opposites, associations and other clues and make the team guess as many words as possibly before the time has finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get a die throw for each completely guessed card (=4 words) for &amp;quot;Guessing within the team&amp;quot; variant (only the team in turn may guess). The die throws are used to get around the game board and over the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it's &amp;quot;Everyone guesses&amp;quot; (all guesses on the same card), then you take several cards and you guess for example the 3rd word (decided by a die) on each card. Number of won cards = number of steps on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For &amp;quot;Duel&amp;quot; (the teams guesses on different cards and should be ready first) one of the team guesses all words on a card and the hourglass is then immediately turned and the other team tries to guess the words on their card in lesser time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has some similarities with the game &amp;quot;Taboo&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;It's published in Sweden (Pratmakarna = Chatterbox).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
