			<description>Legacy: The Card Game  is a fantasy based card battle game played by two opposing players in a turn-by-turn style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players start with 1200 life points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player builds their own deck or uses a Pre-Constructed deck from the Legacy Core Set, and tries to get the opponents life points to Zero through the use of Characters, Spells and Ttems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy TCG is VAST and has an expansive universe! There are many Heroes with Amazing powers at your disposal.  The type of decks you build are entirely up to you... Will you use a Hero? or Multiple heroes? or maybe try to over run your enemy with only monsters? Perhaps Playing only Gadgets and Gizmos to trap your opponent using technology?  Perhaps restricting your opponents movements through the use of Control cards? There are near endless combinations at your fingertips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
