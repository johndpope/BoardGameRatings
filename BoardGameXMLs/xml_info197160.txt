							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hebrac&#039;s Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>Hebrac's Dungeon is an RPG card game for one player designed by Luc Miron. It uses two or more decks of standard playing cards, a pencil, paper, and copy of the rule book for reference. You play as an unnamed adventurer who enters the deadly dungeon of Hebrac the sorcerer to defeat bloodthirsty creatures and recover four legendary treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins by shuffling the deck and laying cards down in piles of two within a 4x4 tableau. Each pair represents a room of the dungeon with a human or creature guardian concealing a treasure beneath. Each card of the deck is assigned unique properties based upon its position as guardian or treasure. Guardians include warriors, magicians, and demons to be fought, other adventurers who can be battled or bartered with, black and white priestesses who can harm or heal, steal from or reward you, merchants, and Hebrac himself. Treasures include magical objects that increase your stats, potions to heal your wounds, and various prisoners that can be released for reward or ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin at one of the four corners of the dungeon and play through adjacent cards by turning them over and resolving them one by one by battling creatures using the deck and 15 maximum life points for resolution, bartering with gems collected from treasure cards, or casting spells, also collected from treasure cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may progress to the next dungeon once half of the cards have been cleared. The game ends by dying in battle or successfully finding all four aces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
