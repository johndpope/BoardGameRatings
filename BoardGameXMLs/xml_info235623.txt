			<description>In a wild west were adventurers, outlaws and citizens are addicted and powered by coffee, a devastating plague threatens to end once and for all the storages of the precious black gold. Now, the last 3 beans are traveling in a reinforced train in order to be planted in a safe soil, but not without dragging the attention of everybody across the railroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 2 / 4 players game, you must fight as an Authority or an Outlaw to keep or steal the last 3 fertile coffee beans in the State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has its own set of actions printed in transparent cards, which are inserted in a bigger card with the opponent's actions as well, creating the base game cards. Then, each player must chose a card and play it at the same time. The person with the initiative executes his or her action first, then the other does this as well. After that, cards are swapped. It means the Authority's card goes to the Outlaw and vice-versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Outlaw must then use these actions to move alongside the train to steal the beans before it arrives its destination, and, off course, without losing all his or her health points. Meanwhile, the Authority must keep at least one bean until the final station. The time track advances everytime the cards are swapped out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight to save, or maybe even steal, the last hope of this coffee-driven civilization in this quick and strategic game by Potato Cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
