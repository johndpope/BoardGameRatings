							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sons Of Liberty 1773</name>
									
			<description>Boston, December 16, 1773. The Sons of Liberty boarded the tea ships and threw the chests of tea into Boston Harbor. This is the key event to the birth of American Revolutionary war which leads to the United States of America birth. In this game you will relive this historical adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is composed of 57 cards: 24 American cards, 24 Great Britain cards and 9 special cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, you launch an attack to the next player. He/she can defend it or ally to it. To ally, he/she needs to play a card with the same numeric value, without taking into account the faction. The joint attack passes to the next player. This third player can ally or defend too. To defend, he/she needs to play cards from the opposite faction and with a higher number value than the attacking ones. After defending, each player can add more cards to the attack.  If the attack is defended properly the attacking and defending cards are discarded. If it is not, the defending player puts in his hand all attacking and defending cards. When the deck runs out, the first player who runs out of cards is the winner. Also, there are special cards which modify a little bit the game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
