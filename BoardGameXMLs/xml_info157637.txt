			<description>from Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The Silent Dragon paused upon the rooftop. The object of his gaze was obscured, not only by the unpierced night, but by mortar binding bricks, wrapping the safe into which the bowl had been placed. It burned in his imagination all the brighter for its apparent unavailability. Its location was a mystery not in fact, but origin: how had the dark work come to rest in the hands of a simple bootlegger? What use has a criminal lowlife for creatures beyond the veil?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The Dragon motioned to his companion, a gesture of inquiry and implicit mutual understanding. The Green Gargoyle nodded, and as they melted into the night, to gather their allies, the stakes were clear in both their minds. Not, this time, would a failure result in merely the destruction of a neighbourhood, or the loss of a pure virgin... New York City, in all its splendid squalor would pay the price for failure this night: the ultimate price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game focusing on one moment when the lives of 6 great individuals intersect in the cause of saving 1920s New York City from a terrible fate: the summoning of a sleeping Elder God. It is a game of heroism, of gallantry in the face of unspeakable horrors. It is also a game of spectacular action, pithy one liners, and epic grandstanding: it is pulp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirit of the Tentacle is an adventure for Spirit of the Century and takes about 3 hours to run from handing out character sheets to the final thrilling climax. It is intended for 6 characters, though it will work with the right 4 characters. Everything needed to play is included, except the rulebook and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
