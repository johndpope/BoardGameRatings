							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Books on Serial Killers to Find on a Bookshelf</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 genuine books on serial killers that could be found on a bookshelf. These include the book's name, author and crimes of the killer(s). Be warned, this last is not that pleasant, even though the crimes are not explored in great detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such books could be found on the shelves of law enforcement and other professionals in their most innocuous location. Other places could be belonging to true crime buffs, serial killer groupies or, most disturbingly, serial killer wannabees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of the books are in English, and a huge proportion of the killers are American, not simply due to the fact that many serial killers are American but also because they are the ones most commonly written about. They include some of the most notoriously evil people to ever walk the planet, as well as a few general books on serial killers and some killers who were never identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample, more pleasant, result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Serial Killer Files: The Who, What, Where, How, and Why of the World&amp;rsquo;s Most Terrifying Murderers by Harold Schechter (2003, contains over a hundred different profiles of serial killers, including loners, groups and couples, of all types)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
