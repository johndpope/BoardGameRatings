			<description>Miniature golf game to be set up on a table, on the floor or wherever; with marbles, tiny golf clubs and lots of obstacles. The players can set up the obstacles any way they like, then add flags to determine the order in which they have to be played. The player who needs least hits to get his or her marble into the last hole is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
