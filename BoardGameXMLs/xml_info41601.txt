			<description>Octaquad is a print and play space combat game.  The game is fairly simple to learn and involves some rather unique rules.  The board itself is essentially made from the space ships.  Normal rules allow for 1 player per ship, but the players can mix and match however they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ship is an octagon-shaped tile, and each tile must always be touching the rest of the tiles.  Players can perform special tricks to position themselves in different places on the board, but these tricks can fail to succeed.  Positioning, facing, planning, and luck are all part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic rules right now are just for normal ship-to-ship combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
