			<description>Guerilla is an abstract strategy game played on a triangular lattice.  Players place pieces to form groups, which can move, larger groups being able to move farther than smaller ones (movement is by jumping).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unusual feature is that if an enemy piece is captured by &amp;quot;overkill&amp;quot; (pieces are captured by neighboring pieces which are stronger, strength being measured by the number of adjacent friendly pieces), a red &amp;quot;massacre&amp;quot; token is placed on its space, which becomes impassable for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
