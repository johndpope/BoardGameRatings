			<description>Battle Beast is a side-scrolling fighting game released for the PC in 1995. In the style of Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, a player can play against another human opponent or computer-controlled opponents in different levels using hand-to-hand combat, special moves and weapons to defeat each other. A distinct feature in Battle Beast is the use of animals, which can transform into large robotic machines to battle one another. Players can select 6 different animals, which start off as cutesy-looking pets but all transform into large robots to fight, each animal has its own specific special combat techniques, weapons and attributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can fight on various levels in the single player mode as they advance through &amp;quot;sewers&amp;quot; to reach the final boss, a large Toad (Toadman), and complete the game. There are also several mini-games mixed in between the fights such as races through mazes and secret bonus rooms to collect upgrades and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer can be direct human to human combat, with two players battling each other on the same computer or across a LAN network or the internet. Players can also battle in a cooperative mode together, where two players can progress through the single player levels together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battle Beast&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
