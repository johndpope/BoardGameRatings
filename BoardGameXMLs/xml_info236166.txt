			<description>&amp;gt;observer_ is a cyberpunk horror game from Bloober Team, the creators of Layers of Fear. Discover a dark cyberpunk world beset by plagues, war and squalor. Play as the new front line of neural police as you hack into the jagged minds of the insane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Dan Lazarski, an elite neural detective known as an Observer, and part of a corporate-funded police unit whose purpose is to hack and invade suspects&amp;rsquo; minds. In this future, anything you think, feel, or remember can be used against you in a court of law.&lt;br/&gt; The year is 2084. If you somehow survived the Nanophage, odds are you were killed in the War. Those who live have turned to drugs, VR, neural implants&amp;mdash; anything to distract themselves from this new reality. But they can&amp;rsquo;t hide from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
