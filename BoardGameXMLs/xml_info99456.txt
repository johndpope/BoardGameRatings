							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle of Terror</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Castle of Terrors' real name is the Black Castle, so named because of the jet-black rock it is made of. Many strange stories are told about it by the locals of the village below; stories of monsters and strange happenings, strange noises and mysterious disappearances; some of them may be true some may not but one thing that is true is that no living thing grows on the hill leading up to the castle - only the gray foreboding gras growing like a cancer across its barren wastes. The Castle itself is said to be a maze of rooms and cells guarded by Monsters and horrors beyond all imagining. Though according to legend it is said that at the center of the dungeons of the castle is a treasure so magnificent nothing can describe it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You walk into the crowded tavern, the thick air laden with smoke. You force your way to the bar helped by the fact that a large sword is hanging by your belt. After buying a pint of ale you make you way over to a large crowd of men sat smoking. As you sit down they all give you weary looks before carrying on with their talking. After a while you break the conversation and ask them about the castle on the hill. All talk in the bar stops with all staring at you with shocked expressions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'And what be you asking about that for?' one of the men inquires. 'I plan to go there' you reply, this comment was met by laughter until the rest of the bar saw the look on your face, 'You be serious then?' 'Of course but please tell me more about the old castle.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
