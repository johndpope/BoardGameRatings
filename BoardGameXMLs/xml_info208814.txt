			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Was available as data disk for Humans or stand-alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box back - Titled: Humans 2 The Jurassic Levels&lt;br/&gt;HUMANS 2 THE JURASSIC LEVELS&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Just what the heck are HUMANS?... and what are they doing in a computer game anyhow?! We know, we've heard it before, they're strange, they're ugly, they're...stupid. But there's more to these HUMANS than meets the eye, for inside each and everyone of them is a small but useable brain, Working as a team and discovering new tools (fire, weapons, the wheel, deodorant, etc.) is the key to survival in this vruel world of chaos and carnivores, It&amp;oslash;s a native struggle against extinction, where you score points by finishing levels with as many of your tribesmen intact as HUMAN-ly possible. Love, death, food... it's all here. With Gametek's computer version of HUMAN, the only missing link is you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box back - Titled: Human Race - The Jurrassic Levels&lt;br/&gt;WHAT YOU GET&lt;br/&gt;The front of this box tells you wether this is a stand alone version of &amp;quot;HUMAN RACE - THE JURASSIC LEVELS&amp;quot; or the data disks. If you already own HUMANS then you need buy only the data disks which SHOULD BE CHEAPER. If you are new to HUMANS, then buy the stand alone version of HUMAN RACE - THE JURASSIC LEVELS or the original HUMANS game and THE JURASSIC LEVELS fata disks.&lt;br/&gt;HUMAN RACE - THE JURASSIC LEVELS contains a further 80 levels of evolutionary mayhem. If you thought that the first version was challenging and addictive then try this!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
