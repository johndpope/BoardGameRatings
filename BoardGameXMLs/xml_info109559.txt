But a lone rider coming from the mining town warns the good Samaritans away. The town is empty, he says, stripped of life by the sky and swallowed whole by the earth. What happened in Werner's Folly? Where did a town full of miners go? And can the investigators solve the mystery before whatever caused the calamity here makes its way across the prairie toward civilization?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;admin comment&lt;br/&gt;added to the database in October 2011&lt;br/&gt;moved to (Unpublished Products) on August 23, 2015]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
