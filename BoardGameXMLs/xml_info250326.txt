							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bureau 13: Stalking the Night Fantastic (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of the human race is filled with evidence of eerie and unexplained occurrences.  Our myths, legends and fairy tales consistently reaffirm that the supernatural exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This knowledge of the &amp;quot;supernatural&amp;quot; has been with mankind since before the dawn of history.  Mostly these occurrences were misunderstood and greatly feared by the general populace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With no organization, it was usually the small mobs of angry peasants that stalked the creatures of the night, and more often than not, exterminated the supernatural, good and evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Always, though, there have been a few who were capable of discerning the passing difference between good and evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early 1860's the United States established a secret supernatural investigative agency under the cover of the Civil War.  Only a few top officials knew of its existence and it became known simply as &amp;quot;Bureau 13&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the next century the few employees of the Bureau went quietly about their &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; of ferreting out and eliminating the destructive aspects of the supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So successful were their efforts that the memories of the public dimmed and the fear of the unknown was replaced by awe (and suppressed fear) of the new technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foreign branches of the organization were established in Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The years have passed and worldwide memories have faded.  The public has come to believe that magic and the supernatural are the stuff of children's dreams and nightmares.  They are wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1989: Bureau 13, now an ultramodern force, more secret than before, fights to stem the growth of ancient magic and the supernatural that threatens the innocent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wherever the supernatural waits, good and evil, the agents of Bureau 13 will be there, but...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil is growing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
