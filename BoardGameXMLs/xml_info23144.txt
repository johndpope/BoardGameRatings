			<description>On January 17, 1920, the 18th Amendment to the US Constitution, which prohibited the making, selling, possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages wen Flappert into effect. The era of bootlegging and rum-runners, speakeasies and flappers, gangsters and G-Men, and a whole new generation of &amp;quot;flaming youth&amp;quot; was well on its way!  Yes sir, Prohibition changed the times drastically, which brings us to our story&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The date ~ April 1, 1920&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place ~ &amp;quot;Rosies&amp;quot;, a swinging speakeasy on Chicago's Southside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The victim ~ Leroy &amp;quot;Sticky Fingers&amp;quot; Hatfield, moonshiner extraordinaries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what happened?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leroy &amp;quot;Sticky Fingers&amp;quot; Hatfield was sure having a tough time down in the Ozarks. The perpetual feud with his neighbors, the McCoys, and a relentless revenuer, Tommy Lee Tucker, were making his life miserable&amp;hellip;..not to mention the fact that it was getting harder and harder to make ends meet.  When Prohibition set in, Leroy hightailed it to Chicago and brought along his wife, El-le  May, his one-armed cousin, Clyde Hatfield, his Ma and Pa, his trusty bloodhound, Billie Blue&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;and most importantly,  grandpappy Hatfield's recipe for moonshine. Leroy heard that making illegal hooch, or bathtub gin, and selling it to the local speakeasies was a great way to make some big money&amp;hellip;.and so &amp;quot;Sticky Fingers&amp;quot; rented a cold-water flat on the southside and set up his trusty still.  It wasn't long before his potent NOTO &amp;quot;Nectar of the Ozarks&amp;quot; became very popular with the club owners&amp;hellip;and their patrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tells us more ~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wild time was being had by all at &amp;quot;Rosies&amp;quot;, very popular speakeasy owned by Second-Hand Rose Romanowitz. The gin was flowing and a  Charleston contest was in full swing. It was a Saturday night and the joint was really jumpin! Outside, Leroy and Billie Blue were making the last delivery of the night when a dark automobile slowly pulled in front of the club. Suddenly, tommy guns began blasting, barrels of booze started bursting.......and when the dust settled, Leroy's bullet ridden body was lying in a puddle of blood&amp;hellip;.and NOTO.  Who could have left Leroy belly-up?  Was this a mob hit?&amp;hellip;the work of the vengeful revenuer?&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;or do we smell a &amp;quot;McCoy&amp;quot;? Hhmmmmmm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So join Alfonso &amp;quot;Scarface&amp;quot; Cannolli, Buggsy Moron, Idiot Ness, Anna &amp;quot;Sugar&amp;quot; Michigan, Sweet Nothings, and Saucie Susie, to name a few ~ and venture back to the days of flappers, raccoon coats, rumble seats and get ready for a roaring evening of mayhem, mystery and MURDER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
