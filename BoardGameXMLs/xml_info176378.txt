							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">101 Feats and Talents (13th Age)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Break out of your class!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are hereby cordially invited to a party inspired by adventurous storytelling, daring actions and dark villains. Pick one of these new options and redefine your character concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Feats, a Gentleman Thief always gets treasure, can bluff his way out of almost any tight spot and will never be held for long. A skilled combatant shall Seize an Attack climb up a monster at strike at its weakest point. A spellcaster can use Freezing Spell to slow opponents or freeze liquids, in addition to normally inflicted damage. There are also options for your companions, pets, and animated icky things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you want changes to be more profound, with Talents your character may exploit Infernal-Born Heritage so you can bind your bargains in blood, learn backgrounds like a genius savant with Eccentric Specialist, or just become unto some eldritch abomination with Tentacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Game Masters, your monsters and NPCs can become special, too. Remember Nastier Specials? Here is over a hundred ways to make life interesting for people who think this is just another zombie, an orc, or a whale. You can make that mean mastiff possess its owner via Companion of Possession, or you can have that gambler use Invisible Spell to carefully part some PCs from their loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
