							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Traumschiff</name>
									
			<description>A new game that is using a Traumschiff theme (Das Traumschiff is a German TV series). Each player draws five destinations that he/she has to visit. When a player reaches one of his/her destinations, he/she has to answer a question from the card (a die roll determines which one). If the player answers correctly, he/she has another move; if not, he/she has to try again next turn. On certain fields, &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; question are asked. When a player has reached all five of his/her destinations, he/she moves to a common target field and back to Hamburg from there. The first player to arrive in Hamburg is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
