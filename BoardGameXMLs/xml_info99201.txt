			<description>game introduction:&lt;br/&gt;300 years ago, the fall of the Star Federation was immediately followed by the  exodus of two-thirds its army under the command of the Grand Star General. Disgust  with the &amp;quot;Wars of Succession&amp;quot; spurred the General into self-imposed exile, far  outside the Known Sphere of systems. There, he created his own society, based on a  caste system ruled by the bravest and brightest warriors of the Star Federation's  military. Organized into clans, taught to place honor before and above all else, the  General's followers drilled and trained for generations, knowing one day they would  return to human colonized space, unifying all the squabbling warlords in a single,  bloody Jihad. That day has arrived!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: these rules are a supplement for the one-page micro-game War of the Mecha.  You will need War of the Mecha to use these rules. These rules are ADDITIONS to the  War of the Mecha standard game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;... provides rules for running an on-going campaign (planetary assault in this case) with specific mission objectives, victory scenarios, and rules for promotion in rank (as well as being busted down for failure). Fully compatible with War of the Mecha and War of the Mecha II:  Clan Invasion! this game provides only additional rules, not revisions or changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
