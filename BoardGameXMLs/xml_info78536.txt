			<description>Soundvoyager is intended to be played using sound only, without looking at the console's screen. The game involves several different subgames, one of which has players trying to center a dot on a side scrolling stage on top of an invisible target by only using sounds from the left and right speakers to guide them and another involves the player driving the wrong way down a three lane road trying to dodge oncoming vehicles by listening to which lane they are in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Bit Generations , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
