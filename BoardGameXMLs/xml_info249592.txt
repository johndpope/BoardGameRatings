			<description>The game of HOT is a simple and fast word game for two players.  The game starts with nine word cards placed face up between the two players.  Players alternate turns taking one card from the common area and putting it into their hand.  The objective of the game is to obtain three cards that share any common letter, for example BRIM, FORM, and HEAR all contain an R and would form a winning hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game assumes players will create their own cards from index cards or pieces of paper.  The nine cards bear the words: BRIM, FORM, HEAR, HOT, SHIP, TANK, TIED, WASP, and WOES.  Only the letters A, E, H, I, O, R, S, and T can win - each having exactly three appearances in the combined nine cards; every other letter appears less than three times, if at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOT was written by Leo Moser and published in Chimaera (Issue 5 - Sep 1975).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
