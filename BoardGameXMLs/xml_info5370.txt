							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crosswords for Dummies</name>
									
			<description>Have you ever played a crossword game in which you end up with all consonants or all vowels?  Or you get some combination...and still can't come up with even a three-letter word?  As you rearrange the letters one more time, the other players are getting, well, impatient.  That was then but now it's time to play crosswords The Dummies Way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you begin with 10 word strips and 100 points. Each word strip has a word from 3-7 letters.  On one side the word is written from left to right, on the other it is written from top to bottom.  Players take turns playing their words crossword fashion on a board.  There are bonuses that allow the players to &amp;quot;go again&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;give a word&amp;quot; to another player. The object is to get rid of all of your words first. Other players then lose points for the words they have left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rounds are played until someone gets to zero and then highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
