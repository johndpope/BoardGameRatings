			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curwen Family have lived up among the pine woods on the outskirts of Arwich Village for as long as the oldest village gaffers can remember. The beautiful Bessie Curwen&amp;rsquo;s bonnet is found in a strange creature&amp;rsquo;s grasp. The village owes much to her family, so someone must go up into the dark pine-clad hills to make sure that the Curwens are all right. After all, the Curwens saved the village from starvation two winters ago. If you do not go, who will?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arwich Grinder is a Lovecraftean 0-level funnel for the DCC RPG written by Daniel J. Bishop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What in the name of heaven or hell could be happening up there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included, But He Sure Had Guts!, a gruesome short encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
