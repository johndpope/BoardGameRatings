			<description>Spindizzy is a mind-boggling game for 3 players that can be played with the Shibumi game system. It uses the 4&amp;times;4 board, 10 red, 10 black and 10 white balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is initially empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a colour and start with 10 balls each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then each player passes 3 balls of their supply to the left neighbour, and 2 balls to the right neighbour. From now on, at all times during the game the players keep their balls hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player is selected to be the &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; of the first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn &amp;ndash; at the same time &amp;ndash; players secretly pick one of their balls from their supply and hold it &amp;ndash; hidden in the closed hand &amp;ndash; towards the other players. When all players made their selection, the balls are revealed simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the colour of the master player&amp;rsquo;s ball determines which player (remember, each player is assigned a colour) must play the ball in their hand first. A ball may be placed on any empty hole of the board or on any 2&amp;times;2 platform. Then in clockwise direction the other two players also place their balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a small 5-ball pyramid is formed, the player whose colour represent the majority (or, if there is no clear majority, the player who owns the top ball) scores 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player of the current turn will then be the master player of the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last ball is played and the point is scored, the game ends. The player with the highest score wins the game. In the case where 2 players are tied, the third player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Shibumi Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soft cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downloadable PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
