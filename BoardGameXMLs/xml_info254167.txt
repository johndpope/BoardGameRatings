			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She spins, bounces, and gyrates in time to the music as she seems to float across the stage.   The audience is enthralled and excited, getting pulled more and more into the exhilarated high of the show as it continues to an emotional finale.  This is the rush of Morgana Spitfyre&amp;rsquo;s shows. They are the ultimate emotional synthmusic rollercoaster ride.   This has made her latest album, Fire in the Night, skyrocket up the charts in several different realms.   Everyone is trying to get her attention&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone lately has been trying a little too hard to get her attention, so her manager would like some professionals to be around just in case things go wrong.  It should be fun; you get to live like a rock star for a few weeks and get paid to do it.  What more could you ask for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire in the Night is a Pathfinder compatible adventure designed for the Neverwhen roleplaying setting.  It is designed for 3rd to 5th level characters.  This adventure includes additional descriptions and histories to assist the Gamemaster in expanding on the encounters and storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
