			<description>With a population of over 600,000, Mississauga is Canada's 7th  largest city, the safest city in Canada to live, work and play.  Mississauga is where you will find Canada's busiest airport - Lester B. Pearson, some of Ontario's best shopping centers - Square One, Canada's first interactive entertainment center - Playdium, and some of the best salmon fishing in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the greatest concentration of major highways in the country, Mississauga is easy to get to - in fact, 29 of Canada's Top 500 corporations are headquartered here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, how would you like to own it?  Mississauga On Board is a unique real estate trading game that celebrates our city, as well as the businesses, attractions and people that make it exceptional.  Roll the dice, move your game piece around the board, and buy any property that catches your eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city is yours for the taking...one property at a time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
