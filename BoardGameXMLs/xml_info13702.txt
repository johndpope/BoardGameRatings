			<description>The game is played on a printed fabric board depicting two temples and two do-jos.  The contents include 2 dice, 12 colored glass gems and a drawstring to tie up board and the contents into a tidy bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player attempts to move their gems from one corner of the board to the opposite corner.  The first player to move all 3 of their gems to the opposite corner wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gems are moved by rolling the dice and moving the indicated number of spaces along the board.  Gems can be moved either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the board.  If a player&amp;rsquo;s gem lands on or passes over an opponent&amp;rsquo;s gem the two players conduct a rock-paper-scissors challenge: the loser has their gem sent back to their starting space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
