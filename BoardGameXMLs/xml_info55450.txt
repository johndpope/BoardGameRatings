							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Out Of The Frying Pan</name>
									
			<description>A card game of strategic investment, arson, and insurance fraud, where players earn money on restaurants they have a stake in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to an epicurean adventure of gastronomical proportions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time to leap from your economically restricting frying pan straight into the incendiary excitement of investing in your own restaurant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The culinary industry poses high risks and vicious competition. In fact, no food vendor has ever turned a profit, since the invention of the restaurant over 4,000 years ago, except for those vendors who moonlight as arsonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's right, your only hope is to collect the insurance money on your establishment. However, burning down your own restaurant is a sure fire way to get yourself put on ice by the fuzz. You'll have to rely on silent partners and the kindness of strangers to light up your livelihood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 35 Restaurant Cards&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 First Player Card&lt;br/&gt;    * 42 Investment Markers (7 in each of 6 colors)&lt;br/&gt;    * 50 $1,000 Bills&lt;br/&gt;    * 25 $5,000 Bills&lt;br/&gt;    * Rules for playing Out Of The Frying Pan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/out-of-the-frying-pan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/out-of-the-frying-pan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
