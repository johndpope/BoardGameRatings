			<description>Company to Divisional level wargame rules for use with 20mm miniature figures.  Each soldier represents approximately 10 men. Vehicles and support weapons represent 3 real-life equivalents.  The aim of the game is to recreate World War 2 battles.  A players wins when one side is forced to retire from the battlefield, caused by morale checks and losses. It uses a set of mechanisms to create a fast-play set that reflects the realistic experience of a WW2 soldier.  All the equipment available to the soldier in WW2 is included, such as support weapons, vehicles, artillery and aircraft. The rules reward players that use the equipment tactically rather than the simple &amp;quot;see the enemy and charge&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts up to 15 turns.  Each turn has a number of phases - move, spot, aircraft, fire, morale and orders. The winner of the initiative for each turn determines which side goes first in each phase. A single 6-sided die is used for almost all mechanisms. Vehicles, if hit, require a further roll to determine damage.  Morale is checked once a unit has received a number of casualties which varies with nationality.  Once a number of base units has received adverse morale checks, the overall morale of the army is checked each turn until one side eventually pulls backs or routs..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
