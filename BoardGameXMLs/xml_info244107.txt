							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Depths of Barrow Hall</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is rumoured that beneath a tall, and long ancient barrow, lies the tomb of the long dead Jarl Perkalay. Overflowing with treasures beyond imagination, this well trapped tomb also holds the spirits and bodies of the Jarl&amp;rsquo;s deceased guards. Buried here with him, they protect him, and his property, even in undeath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many adventurers have entered. None have left alive. Do you have the cunning, and skills, to survive The Depths of Barrow Hall?&lt;br/&gt;This is a deadly adventure. Full of traps, and vicious monsters, only the most experienced, well prepared, and luckiest adventurers will survive to claim Jarl Perkalay&amp;rsquo;s well guarded treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the extremely high chance of character death, we strongly advise against using this adventure with characters that your players are emotionally attached to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
