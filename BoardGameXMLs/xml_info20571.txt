							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Radical Racers TCG</name>
									
			<description>A new TCG with an automotive theme.  Start the game with a set MPH (miles per hour).  Each player Battles through the race playing four mutant racer cards attempting to decrease opponents' speed, while at the same time increasing their own.  Some interesting mechanics is that a player can force a tie, instant win or lose all their mutant cards.  The racer at the end with the highest mph wins.  They have also added an Advance game where you play until one player has captured all their opponents' Racers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     CCG Workshop (no longer available)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
