							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Three Stooges Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>Standard fan trivia game about the Three Stooges. Players roll and move across the board, answering three types of questions: True/False, Multiple Choice, and Specific Answer. Players cannot move until they answer correctly; if three or more questions are missed, the player may declare themselves stuck, roll the die, and move backwards, in hopes of getting a different type of question. Questions range from the biographical (&amp;quot;When Moe Howard skipped school, where did he spend his free time?&amp;quot;) to show-specific (&amp;quot;Which short features the phrase, 'Slowly I turn, step by step, inch by inch'?&amp;quot;) Nostalgia will get you across the board, but only true fans will sweep the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
