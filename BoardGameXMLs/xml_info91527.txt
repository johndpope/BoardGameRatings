			<description>Rol D Dice consists of 6 dice and a dice tray.  Players play singly or in teams.  &lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get exactly 9000 points.  &lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls all 6 dice.  Each roll must have at least one of a listed combination to count points.  Each turn must reach at least 500 points to count. Players may continue rolling as long as each roll has either a one or a five.  Failure to roll a one or a five means the turn passes to the left.  Players may pass on any turn or on any turn after a roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
