							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feldaryn&#039;s Flying Ship</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feldaryn's Flying Ship characters come across a ship that is stuck - in a tree. The ship is actually a flying vessel and the sole individual on it - by all appearances a powerful mage - needs help getting the rigging untangled from the tree. The mage, Feldaryn, is not what he seems and can be a source of problems to the characters. Having access to flying transport may prove useful, though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a three deck plan of the flying ship included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is aimed at d100 systems but is generic enough in nature to be adapted to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter, one page is largely an illustration, one page has a deck plan of the flying ship and one page is ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
