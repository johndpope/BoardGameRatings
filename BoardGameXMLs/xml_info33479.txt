			<description>ROL-OFF Indoor Golf is a dice rolling game meant to imitate a game of outdoor golf.&lt;br/&gt; According to the publisher: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Any game that can be played on the outdoor golf course can be played with a ROL-OFF INDOOR GOLF GAME. (A) 9 or 18 hole games (B) WIth singles or partners: 1,2,3, or 4 players(C) Low total score (D) Match Play wither each hole is counted separately (E) Low ball-low total (F) Least number of putts, etc...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing rules are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. Each player gets 3 shakes (2 shakes on a par 3). &lt;br/&gt;1st shake is the drive. Remove the lowest die.&lt;br/&gt;2nd shake is the fairway shot. Remove the lowest die.&lt;br/&gt;3rd shake represents putting. Remove the lowest die. &lt;br/&gt;The total of the dice removed represents total strokes for that hole. Mark your score on the score card.  &lt;br/&gt; B. Points are also awarded. Birdies are worth one point. Eagles are worth two points. A five-of-a-kind is a hole in one. It's worth 3 points. Points are recorded on the score sheet in the proper box for that whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C. The lowest score in the total column wins the game. The highest extra points in the total column wins the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D. Penalties: &lt;br/&gt;-When a player shakes three &amp;quot;1's&amp;quot; in one shake, he removes two aces and so his count for that stroke is 2. (Sand Trap)&lt;br/&gt;-When a player shakes three '2's&amp;quot; in one shake he is penalized 2 strokes and must remove two deuces so his count for that shake is 4 strokes (out of bounds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the above rules are followed, the scores will be very representative to a regular outdoor game of golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
