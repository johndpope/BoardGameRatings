							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Babel: The Weird Word Game</name>
									
			<description>The Babel deck consists of 56 cards, namely, two complete alphabets and the numbers 2,3,4, and 8. Seven cards are dealt to each player. Players simultaneously use some or all of their cards to create one babel each. A babel is a shorthand form of a word or phrase. (The idea is reminiscent of the game Inklings.) Then, players take turns guessing one another&amp;rsquo;s babels. Both the babeler and the first correct guesser receive the same score, which is the number of letters in the babel&amp;rsquo;s meaning. For example, GDR, meaning German Democratic Republic, is worth 24 points. 3 GD LYR, meaning &amp;ldquo;three good liars,&amp;rdquo; is worth 14 points. Play an agreed-upon number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
