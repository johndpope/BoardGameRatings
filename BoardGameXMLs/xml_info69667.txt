			<description>Orient-Bazar &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The treasure chests are empty, therefore the players need to first accumulate money before they can buy at the Bazaar.&lt;br/&gt;Only the players who ride the Elephant are allowed to buy goods. The player who first owns all six goods in his color wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a pawn and 15 Dinars. Each player rolls 2 dice, one for his pawn and one for the elephant. The player moves over &amp;quot;money spaces&amp;quot; to earn money, once he has enough money he tries to ride the elephant. While riding the elephant the players can buy goods (in their colors and in all other colors). If a player needs to buy a good from one of the other players it costs 150% of it's original price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
