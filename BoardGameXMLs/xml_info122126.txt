			<description>Comtricks is a 2 player only combinatorial (no luck, perfect information) trick-taking card game.  In the game, players play and win (or lose tricks), and then draft cards for their hands from a 4 by 4 grid of cards, with a card being taken freeing up another card.  Players score a point for each trick won, and win the game by being the first to reach a target score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides what is described above, the game also has cards which will lose a trick if led, but will win a trick if it follows what was led.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is playable with a standard deck of playing cards and two jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
