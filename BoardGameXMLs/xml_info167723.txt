							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bin&#039;Fa: The Tao of War â€“ The Game of Oriental Strategy and Conquest</name>
									
			<description>This latest version of Bin'Fa: The Tao of War has many changes from those familiar with its previous incarnations (Hexagony, Bin'Fa), such as the addition of the General; Vortexes that allow you to traverse the board in one move, appearing where east expected; rule changes governing the gathering of supplies, and the separation of the original hexagon shaped game board into six separate game board sections which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bin-Fa, armies move over a landscape that is different each game. A player controls at least one but can control up to three armies per game. You can use the board sections to create inlets, peninsulas, isthmuses, lakes, and more. Adding vortex and terrain markers allows you even more control over the layout of the game board and how it will be traversed. Your ability to take advantage of the layout of the battlefield is crucial to victory and defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each army is made up of 12 Army Units, one General, and one Supply Pawn. At the start of your turn, you must decide if you are going for supplies or moving your army.  On taking possession of the dice: first see if any of your Army Units are in danger and if so, respond defensively; second, see if any of your opponent's Army Units are vulnerable and, if possible, attack; third, if neither of these choices applies, go for supplies. Sun Tzu says: &amp;quot;Do not move without considering all the possibilities. Move always with a clear purpose.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for movement of your army allow you to simulate many strategies from the ancient battlefield. Even &amp;ldquo;cavalry charges&amp;rdquo; are possible&amp;mdash;where a unit dashes across the board to attack an enemy position. Your mission is to surround and eliminate enemy Army Units until only your Army is left, leaving you the victor.&lt;br/&gt;Deals and alliances can be made in the open or in secret. But only one commander can emerge victorious: knowing when and with whom to form alliances and when to break them can sometimes determine who wins and who loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
