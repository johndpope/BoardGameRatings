			<description>Author's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IKEA. We've all been there and now you relive your experiences in the game.  &amp;quot;The Church of Retail&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Saturday Hell&amp;quot;? A favorite destination for all life's great turning points - leaving home, moving, bringing home a new baby, or when divorce or death suddenly leaves you stranded. Maybe IKEA isn't as soulless as it looks in the catalog...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IKEA is a free-form small comedy where characters experience a day of &amp;quot;The Church of Retail&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Saturday Hell&amp;quot;, depending on their temperament.  The game is structured in scenes that bring out secret inner thoughts while the characters ostensibly are only trying to find that special off-white furniture set that will complete the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as with most things from IKEA, with this scenario some assembly is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was written for Fastaval 2011 &amp;quot;international&amp;quot; play.  The game document is available only in Danish, though the &amp;quot;Errands&amp;quot; (handouts) are available in Danish- and English-language versions.  With illustrations from the IKEA catalog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
