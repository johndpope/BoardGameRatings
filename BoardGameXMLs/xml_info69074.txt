							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aftermath! The Lost Adventures: Operation Morpheus and Karo</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a reprint that combines two of the hardest to find items for the Aftermath! RPG... Scenario Pack A1: Operation Morpheus and Adventure Pack K1: The Empire of Karo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book appears to be a scan of the two modules printed and placed in a simple glued-binding paperback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a barebones reprint. There's nothing from the publisher explaining anything about the history of these products, or a combined credit block for the modules, or even a title page beyond what appears in the original modules...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Available NOW! This book contains both Operation Morpheus and The Empire of Karo, reprinted in one book. Operation Morpheus OPERATION MORPHEUS is designed as a campaign introduction to an AFTERMATH! world. Although originally part of a campaign set in Australia the information and ideas herein can easily be used with any campaign. The setting is a major university in an important city. The time is approximately one hundred years after the collapse of civilization. The players take the parts of people who, having volunteered to take part in a &amp;lsquo;short-term&amp;rsquo; experiment in cryogenic suspension, awaken many long years after the planned time. They find the world in ruins and have no idea of the cause of, reasons for, or history of this disaster. Naked and unarmed they must face a strange new world. Cleverness and quick-thinking are the first steps to survival. The Empire of Karo The Empire Of Karo is a multi-adventure pack with a complete campaign background based on the area of Cairo, Illinois. The time is twenty years after the collapse of civilization and Karo (as the locals call Cairo) is the hub of a growing empire based on revived river trade along the Mississippi. This package includes a complete background to the growth of the empire, major personalities of the ruling clique, and even a detailed breakdown of the many merchants of the city and their business establishments. The scenarios begin with a series of military based adventures within the city and empire itself. Scenarios continue to include a variety of adventure types in the ruins of a larger city, St. Louis, which is frequently visited on scavenging expeditions by the bolder general merchants of Karo. Player-characters can either lead their own expeditions or join one of the well-established expeditions to St. Louis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
