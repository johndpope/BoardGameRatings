			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;...and so, after the Rain of Colorless Fire, the One-Named-In-Whispers ascended to the Spider Throne. In the third year of his ascendancy, Burgred, King of the Mara, refused the tribute of heads the Whispered One demanded. The One-Named-In-Whispers took only himself and Kas, his evil counselor, and devastated the land of the Mara with his magic. Burgred paid with his own head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon their return, Kas struck against his master, so that he might become the master of the Spidered Throne. In the end, both were slain and good people rejoiced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that not all of the evil lich was destroyed. So great was his power that his Hand and Eye have lived on, working evil over the centuries....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, Vecna - archmage, despotic tyrant, the most fearsome of all liches - has been nothing but a fearful legend to the honest folk of Greyhawk. Once the supreme master of all undead sorcerers, even today his Hand and Eye are objects of immense power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now something evil is stirring in the lands around Greyhawk. The Hand and Eye of Vecna have been found - and Vecna wants them back.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
