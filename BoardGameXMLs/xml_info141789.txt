							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Decomposed Queens</name>
									
			<description>The game is played with a deck of Zombie Rider Playing cards. All 56 cards including special gaffs and jokers are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The game starts as each player receives one of the random queen cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. After the queens are dealt each player is dealt 5 cards. The queens are held in the hand so the other players don't know which queen the other players have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The player at the dealers left begins. They lay a card down to start a trick, each player must play a card from that trick if they have it. If they don't they must draw a card then play any card. They player with the highest card with the same suite that was started wins the trick, unless a gaff or joker is played. The player that plays a gaff or Joker gets to take the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Roll off: If multiple gaffs or jokers are played the players must enter into a best of 3 roll-off with Zombie Rider dice. If there are more than 2 jokers or gaff cards played on one hand. The players roll one die each, the player with the highest roll gets a bye in the first round as the other players roll against each other. The highest total best of 3 wins the roll off. If any player in a roll off rolls double ZR (the engraved picture on the 1 spot) they win the roll off immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. The player who won the last trick begins the next trick, the game ends when someone runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring: &lt;br/&gt;3 points for every trick won that matches the same suite as your queen.&lt;br/&gt;2 points for every trick won that includes a gaff or joker.&lt;br/&gt;1 point for every trick won that does not match the suite of your queen.&lt;br/&gt;1 point for every roll off victory.&lt;br/&gt;-1 point for every card left in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in sets, and points are recorded after each set. The first person to earn 25 Points is most decrepit queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
