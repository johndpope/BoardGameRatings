			<description>The EPF needs you! Use EPF Agents to solve Field-Ops and earn medals. The first agent to collect 5 Field-Op medals wins. Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;All Field-Ops are shuffled, and the top card of this Field-Op deck is put in the centre of the table. All other cards are shuffled too, and every player gets 5 cards from this Agent Deck. With the youngest player starting, every player now tries to fulfill (one of) the requirement(s) on the Field-Op card to claim it for one or more medals. If not possible, that player draws a card from the Agent Deck, and tries again. If again not possible, it becomes next player's turn. If possible, then you put the Field-Op in question in front of you, discard all cards used to fulfill the requirement in question, put the next Field-Op from the Field-Op Deck into play and draw back up to 5 cards from the Agent Deck. Play continues until one player has accumulated a total of 5+ Field-Op medals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box contents:&lt;br/&gt;55 cards (36 normal penguin agent cards, 10 Field-Op mission cards, 9 other agent cards)&lt;br/&gt;1 code card (to unlock items in Club Penguin)&lt;br/&gt;1 rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
