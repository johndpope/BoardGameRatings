			<description>It's the year 2288, the world has gone through crisis after crisis but finally the economy has stabilised once again.  The Duke, aka Lord Hogarth, has united the continent but gang warfare is keeping the capital from peace.  The Duke has put out a 2 billion cash reward to the person who can take control and unite the gangs of the capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are are a local gang lord, a wealthy businessman or a local burger van guy that thinks he has what it takes, this is an opportunity that cannot be missed.  Start recruiting from the local thuggery and make a name for yourself launching war on this treacherous turf!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treacherous Turf is a card drafting combat game for 2 players.  Each player draws a hand of seven cards, takes one and passes it on to the other player, until each player has a new hand of seven cards. Players then take turns to place these cards one at a time simultaneously onto one of three arenas. Once all seven cards have been played each arena is totaled, whoever has the most points on their side of the arena gets 1 point.  After each arena has been totaled, the deck is shuffled and the drafting starts afresh.  Play continues until one player reaches 5 points. If two players hit 5 points at the same time, another round continues until one player has more points than the other, revealing a clear winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
