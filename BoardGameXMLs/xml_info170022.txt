			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Ponyfinder Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Maneville, which lies just north of the swamps of Ebonsilk, I struggling as the majority of the citizens have fled, leaving the town nearly deserted. The mayor of Maneville has big plans to restore the town to its former glory, and she has spent the last of the town&amp;rsquo;s funds to host a weeklong celebration of silk, the Silk-ebration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The redecorated Town is bustling with visitors and potential citizens, and the townsfolk are busy trying to decorate or keep visitors happy; perhaps too happy. Meanwhile, night has become a dangerous time, as nightmares have begun to plague visitors and townsfolk alike. A strange creature called the Mara appears out of nowhere, and most are eager to blame her for the problems. The festival&amp;rsquo;s success lies in the balance when a haggard monster hunter arrives in town to kill the Mara or destroy the town trying. With the town at stake, little sleep, and all the silk bows they can wear, can the party solve the mystery, find the real enemy, and save the town? Is the Mara truly the cause of the recent troubles, or is she the Pony of your dreams?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Episode 28 - A Danish Nightmare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What starts off as a fan based adventure quickly deviates and heads down a dark alley where it gets mugged. The good news is the Gagmen have pulled off their first Ponyfinder show. The Bad News is the Gagmen will now have to flee the country in fear of what their followers will do to them. Ponies may not have been the original intention, but we went there anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
