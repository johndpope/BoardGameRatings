							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Greasy Pole</name>
									
			<description>If three or more you chance to throw, Jump on the pole and up you go.&lt;br/&gt;But two or one, then you must wait, And hope next turn a better fate.&lt;br/&gt;When on the pole you'll learn the tricks, Go up with three, four, five or six,&lt;br/&gt;If one or two you chance to throw, Then down the Greasy Pole you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pole has 54 spots, most are yellow, and some are red, green or brown. The yellow ones have no directions and are the climbing ones. Green ones , of which there are two, mean a fall to the ground. The six red spots are extra upward moves while the two brown ones require either missed turns or the throw of an odd number as they are stay-where-you-are because you are out of breath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
