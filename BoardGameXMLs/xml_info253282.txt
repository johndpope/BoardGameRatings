			<description>The pawns move from one end of the bridge to the other and back again. This continues till the game ends. Movement is determined by a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a pawn gets on a colored space the player may buy this space and mark it with a property marker. If the player decides not to buy the space it is auctioned by the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a pawn gets on a space owned by another player, the player has to pay rent to the owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a pawn reaches a space, marked with a diamond, it jumps forth or back to the next diamond of the same color, depending if he has yet reached the middle of the bridge or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a pawn passes from the stairs to the bridge the player has to pay a bridge toll. Upon crossing the middle of the bridge (space with 3 diamonds) the player gets an income from the bank. If a pawn gets on the space with the 3 diamonds, the player gets double the income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends if one player goes bankrupt and the richest player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
