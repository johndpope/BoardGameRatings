			<description>A boxed set of six card games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bang! Zoom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with six cards each, which are used to spell words. The first person to spell BANG gets a 10 point bonus. Once this occurs, when someone spells ZOOM, they get a 10 point bonus and the game ends. Points are scored for each letter used in words. The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hooey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got to be sharp. You&amp;rsquo;ve got to be shifty. Announce which cards you&amp;rsquo;re laying face down. Whether you tell the truth is up to you. Any player can then question your honesty. If they&amp;rsquo;re right - you get the pile, if they&amp;rsquo;re wrong - they do! First player to get rid of all their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kid's game of pure luck. Cards are dealt face down to all players. Turn up cards in rotation and put them in the center; if you turn up a Big Fat Rat (rather than a Random Rat), you get all the cards in the center, unless the next player can also turn up a BFR. Object is to collect all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Royal Fluster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt five cards from a modified standard deck and attempt to put together a Royal Flush by drawing and discarding cards. If you discard an Ace, you must draw a Fluster card and follow the instructions, hoping not to be harmed. The first player to make a royal flush wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player deals 4 stacks with 7 down and the 8th card up. Play with only one hand (right, unless left-handed). At the same time, all players turn one card from the remaining deck face up in the center to start N piles. All may add to any pile. Ignore suits and colors. Build up or down, and change directions if you want: 5-6-7-6-7-6-7-8-9, etc. Numbers make a complete circle: 10-J-Q-K-A-2-3-4. Play only one card at a time from the top of of a stack onto a center pile; do not move cards sideways to create sequences on own stacks. Keep playing until ALL have used all their card piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Throws&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has a theme of rock-scissors-paper. It is played in two different rounds. In the first round, players take turns turning up cards on a face-down tableau. If they turn up a set of winners, these cards are taken into hand. When all of the card possible are taken, the second round begins, which is essentially a game of war between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
