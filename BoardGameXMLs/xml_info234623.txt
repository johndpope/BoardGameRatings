							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Penguin Brawl: Heroes of Pentarctica</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penguin Brawl: Heroes of Pentarctica is a fast-paced action card game about penguins, deception and the thrill of glorious battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is deceptively simple to learn, as all major game rules are clearly printed on the cards. Learn what each card type does, get to know the basics, and away you go; the rest is down to how you play. Don't let the simplicity fool you however, as this game is all about taking advantage of your opponents' weaknesses and using any means to steal, manipulate or vaporize your way to victory. You may soon regret your nefarious dealings, though, as your enemies may lose, but that doesn't mean you're safe from them! This isn't that type of game... and they will have their vengeance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing from their choice of two decks, and by using a mix of Penguins, Equipment, Trinkets, Spells, Instants, &amp;amp; Curses, it is their job to take every other player as a personal affront, and destroy them by any means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
