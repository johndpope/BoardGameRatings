			<description>From the designer website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tee Skoori&amp;quot; is a basketball simulation that lasts about 30 minutes. For playing you use two dice for deciding an attack. Throwing one dice you decide if you go below the basket, or the player may run after one pass into the fast attack. Also you have many chances to get the long distance throw. For very lucky shots you can earn extra free throws as well. Using these two dice you decide the success of the free throws and fast attacks. Attack cards can be used to avoid ball loss and the get more chances to get a score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the game play changing the players have attack and defense cards. Defense cards help to defend against opponent attacks and force the ball lost. Attack cards can be used to avid ball loss and the get more changes to get a score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like in real life, when one teams dominates over another, it can happen here as well. You can get the rush after the right moment and can gain a lot of points in a short while. So you should always play until the end of the game, because things may change fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
