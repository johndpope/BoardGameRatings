			<description>In the middle of the 19th century, in Sarawak, in the north of Borneo, two fierce opponents are facing each other. The Iban-People, known and feared for their head hunting and piracy, and James Brooke, an English adventurer and vassal of the sultan of Brunei, who recently became the ruler of Sarawak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this strategy game 2 players wrangle with their dice for the predominance in different areas, which are represented by cards. In 4 battles are fought three areas each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternately, the counterparties put dice with different values on the cards. But the waters off the coast are treacherous, so the dice change their positions and valence again and again. Anyone who holds the majority on one card after the betting of all the dices, assures the supremacy in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only those who are planning ahead, take advantage of the water's vagaries, and use their limited resources clever, will claim the rule in Sarawak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
