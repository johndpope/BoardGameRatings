							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gelimo Chantry</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gelimo is the best known remnant of the Henge Culture that flourished on Melderyn and the surrounding isles about 3,500 years ago. The five concentric rings of stones stand on a wide expanse of heath overlooking the rocky west coast of Melderyn. The remote, mysterious site is home to a chantry of Fyvrian mages, who benefit from the enhancing effect the stone rings have on their magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gelimo Chantry article describes the history of the mystical site and includes some legends that surround it. The chantry and its residents are described and there are full-color GM and player maps of the area as well as complete floor plans for the chantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics article and was originally published in 1987 as part of the Melderyn Kingdom Module. The article has been upgraded with new color artwork and redrawn maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
