			<description>Atomik Psioniks is a fan-written supplement for the Fuzion roleplaying game.  From the intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Atomik Psioniks is a plug-in for Fuzion, introducing  advanced, cinematic psychic powers, or psionics.  Psionics are mental powers, a cross between telepathy and super-powers.  Examples of psionic characters include Tetsuo from Akira, the 'scanners' from the  Scanners series, the girl from Firestarter, and Jason Ironheart from Babylon 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Indeed, Psionics includes telepathy and more 'mundane' forms of psychic powers, but this is far more than the simply Mental Powers plug-in for Total Fuzion.  Psionics include telekinesis, pyrokinesis, teleportation, healing, electrokinesis, and all forms of ESP.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is an alternate form of mental powers.  This plug-in is meant to replace the standard Mental Powers plug-in.  Many of these powers are also similar in effect to many super-powers, however, they are balanced differently.  A GM should be wary of this before crossing Atomik Psioniks with his Superhero campaign.  This is best used to enhance a sci-fi or sci-fantasy campaign.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So, Psiko, whatcha wait'n for?  Get the Power and shatter the Globe!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
