							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Espa√±a 1936</name>
									
			<description>In Espa&amp;ntilde;a 1936 you will experience the famous battles of Jarama, Guadalajara and Ebro, command the International Brigades or the Army of Africa. Can you conquer Madrid and force the Republic to surrender or will you lead the Anarchist forces of Durruti to victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game covers a period rarely seen in computer games and has rich historical detail and historical accuracy. It is the first computer strategy game covering the entire Spanish Civil War. You will face the real dilemmas and challenges of the Republicans or Nationalists during the war. Not only must you recruit and train troops, maneuver them and engage the enemy, but you must also manage your nation&amp;rsquo;s limited resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the powerful AGE engine, Espa&amp;ntilde;a: 1936 covers the complete Spanish Civil War from 1936-1939. The game features more than 200 regions, complete with cities, roads, weapons factories, weather types, factions and subfactions of the time of the war. The game includes a grand campaign plus the Fall of the North, a host of historical leaders, units and events. Espa&amp;ntilde;a: 1936 is a must-have for any grand strategy fan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
