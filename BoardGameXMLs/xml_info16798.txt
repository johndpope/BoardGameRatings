			<description>The game comes with 4 boards marked with a 50 square grid which has the numbers 1 to 6 going down the board and the letters Q U M E R O going across the board horizontally. Each player has transparent tiles which are used to cover the squares on the boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with 10,000's worth of points tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 dice are used in the game 2 conventional D6's and 2 further 6 sided dice with the faces depicting the letters QUMERO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each player's turn he rolls all 4 dice and then using the combinations that appear covers some of his squares on his board. For example if a player rolls R Q 2 &amp;amp; 3 he can cover one of the following 4 alternatives: R3 &amp;amp; Q2; or Q3 &amp;amp; R2; or Q5 (adding together the 2 numbers); or R5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player is the first to complete a column, row or diagonal he is entitled to receive from all the other players the value of points that relate to it: 500 points for a horizontal row; 750 points for a vertical column; or 1000 points for either of the diagonals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends either when all combinations on the board are completed, or all but one player has run out of points tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the player with the most point tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is further spiced up by the gaining of &amp;quot;Qumero&amp;quot; cards gained for rolling doubles, and &amp;quot;Double-Double&amp;quot; cards gained when rolling double-double (i.e. 2 identical numbers and 2 identical letters  rolled in the same turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Qumero&amp;quot; cards can be used as wild cards to cover a number or letter even though it is not thrown. &amp;quot;Double-double&amp;quot; cards are used to either double, triple or quadruple (depending on how many cards he holds) his score for any completed column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
