							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mishpuchah &amp; Mishegoss</name>
									
			<description>Microgame submission for 2015 Geekway to the West Design Competition. The game is a two player card game that takes about 30 minutes to play. It utilizes a deck of 18 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the mishpuchah get together, it should be a time of nachas, but there are always some tsouris.  Such mishegoss!  (Translation for the Yiddush impaired:  When the relatives get together, it should be a time of joy, but there are always woes.  Such craziness!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal out the guests for the family get-together, then seat them one at a time.  Gain points by making your guests happy.  Some members are particular about whom they sit with, while others have family members whom they wouldn't be caught dead next to.  For most rounds, there will be one branch of the family who is offended and won't score any points at all.  The game is over when everyone has been offended at least once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
