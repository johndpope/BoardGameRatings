			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breaks are mysterious occurrences. They always occur in a setting where rules have been invoked or broken and they always involve more than one person. As soon as the individual is broken, they become aware of the action of the Law around them, aware of the sensitive points through which it may be manipulated. In that near instantaneous moment, they must choose their path or have it chosen for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are either &amp;quot;Bounders&amp;quot; (those guided by the Law) or &amp;quot;Broken&amp;quot; (those freed from the Law's control).  Generally, characters are defined only by narrative tags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
