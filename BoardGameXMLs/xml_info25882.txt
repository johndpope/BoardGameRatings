			<description>This Heyne travel game is played on 3-piece board of 9x16 size. A exchange rate table is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel around the board, change the value of the shares as indicated on the landed spaces, buy and sell shares and try to have the most money at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bank starts with a limited amount of money - depending of the number of players - and the game ends, when the bank has no money left.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
