							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Square Deal</name>
									
			<description>A tile-placement game, where players are trying to play out 12 tiles, one-at-a-time, before their opponent.  The catch is that the square tiles, which are sectioned off into 4 triangular sections with different colors, must match colors with the side of the square(s) it is being placed next to.  In addition, the tiles must stay in a 5x5 grid and cannot be placed so that the grid would be larger than 5x5.  The first person to place all 12 twelve of their tiles (or has placed the most if neither player can legally place more) is the winner.  The game includes a solitaire challenge and a &amp;quot;brainy&amp;quot; version that increases the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
