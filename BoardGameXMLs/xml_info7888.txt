			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twice now on our Farm we have had minor Earthquakes. They have been very scary and caused damage. What if a really major Quake struck our area? What if our family and the Animal families living in the nearby Forests were away in Meadows the day that the Big Quake began? In this game, you face this very situation. You are like Forest Rangers trying to help the Animal and Human families to get past the spreading Crevices and to their Homes. Your job is to work together as a Rescue Team, sharing your ideas and giving a helping hand to all the Creatures. The random set-up makes each game different &amp;amp; gets children thinking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
