							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arrghh Bottom Sound Supplemental Material</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is game related flavor background material but in the form of a short story with a couple of monster descriptions and stats. This posting via the Conquered Armies website is an effort to use this material that was deemed far too adult oriented to fit into the game as it has finally evolved.  It came from a project related to &amp;ldquo;Arrghh Bottom Sound&amp;rdquo;, a Role Playing Game(RPG) that I worked on and the original thought was for a more adult type game but as that did not develop and not wanting this story and the work to go to waste I was able to obtain permission from the game designer to post the material here.  Arrghh Bottom Sound is a standard fantasy RPG, this story is just an adaption from the Siren scenario with 7 illustrations (4 previously used and 3 new color) and also the stats and description with two illustrations (new) of the &amp;lsquo;Gregarious Shrub&amp;rsquo; monster, a sentient plant that seduces and then devours its victims, written by yours truly with art by Zarathul and presented here with the permission of the game designer and author.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
