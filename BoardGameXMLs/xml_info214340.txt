							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So You&#039;ve Decided To Run A Role-Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody&amp;rsquo;s heard of tabletop role-playing games (RPGs), but unless you&amp;rsquo;ve actually played one you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know how they work. You know RPGs have something to do with nerds sitting around a table pretending to be elves and rolling funny dice, but the details are a little fuzzy. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re an experienced RPG player, most game manuals spend more time explaining rules and genre trappings than offering practical advice for first-time Game Masters. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a wannabe gamer who&amp;rsquo;s never rolled a twenty-sided die or a long-time player who&amp;rsquo;s decided to take the plunge and run your own game for the first time, So You&amp;rsquo;ve Decided To Run a Role-Playing Game teaches you how to go from thinking about running a role-playing game to actually doing it. So You&amp;rsquo;ve Decided To Run A Role-Playing Game starts by describing what actually goes on during a role-playing game, then provides step-by-step advice for organizing and running your own RPG campaign, from finding a gaming group to plotting your ongoing story. So You&amp;rsquo;ve Decided To Run A Role-Playing Game is geared toward first-time Game Masters, but contains lots of practical advice and helpful tips that even veteran Game Masters are likely to find helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
