							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dial M for Monster</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOUR MUSEUM, YOUR MONSTER, YOUR STORY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the world's most terrifying monsters is waiting to be unleashed on a dark and stormy night as a team of unsuspecting employees at a prestigious museum prepares for a new exhibit. Two murders from the past week have disturbed them but the exhibit must open on schedule. Surely the police can handle this matter. But this is no mere homicide investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dial M for Monster is a 1950s drive-in horror/mystery story of suspense, terror, and pure evil. Writers and the Director will spend an evening crafting a dark tale of something evil lurking within the shadows of the museum after hours. These mere mortals face monstrous challenges and dire complications as players not only tell the story as it unfolds in this one-shot adventure, they also create the monster during play. No two stories will ever be the same and the pages found within reveal the complete rules for creating a heart-stopping rendition of evil run amok, eight unique lead character roles, guidelines for creating your monster using player-created clues, character &amp;amp; scene notes, and three optional worst case scenarios for a truly world-ending cataclysm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell it with ScreenPlay, and prepare for a night of death and chaos by your own hands. It is not a question of who will live... but how many will die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
