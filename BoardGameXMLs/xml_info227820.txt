			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dance &amp;lsquo;Til Dawn is an immersive storytelling game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're going to listen to a playlist that has a beginning, a middle and a very definitive end. We're going to tell a story even as we're moved by the music. And, when the last song plays, this story is over. The end of this story is hinted at in the beginning, but the players will define how we get there, and how it comes to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dance &amp;lsquo;Til Dawn is a game about listening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are going to listen to music together. The music may very well move us and organically, the flow of the narrative will change. This is the hope. Players may choose to narrate, or they may choose to listen to the music and let it fill this shared space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are going to listen to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a commercially-published version of a game originally submitted to Game Chef - see Dance 'Til Dawn (Game Chef Version).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
