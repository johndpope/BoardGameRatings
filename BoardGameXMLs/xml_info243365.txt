			<description>Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing real-life tag with only two players, nobody really wins because the number of tags per player remains constant.  But in computer Tag, the clock decides who will be the champion.  Every 15 seconds, if the person who is it cannot tag the other, the computer will reverse the it player.  This feature allows a real fight for points.  If you are not skilled in attacking, you can become skilled in evasive tactics and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tag was written by Ad Davis and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 29, October 1982.  Source code listings were published for Atari and PET/CBM systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
