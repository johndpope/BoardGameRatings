							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Madness of Baron Von Richter</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Madness of Baron Von Richter is a short adventure primarily designed for characters in their late first or early second careers although with a little work it can be modified by altering the numbers of zombies, reducing/increasing their statistics or giving the Player Characters some help from local militiamen or the like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure follows the events which occur when the players arrive in the quiet town of Todesburg on the very night a grief stricken Baron attempts to resurrect his wife who has recently passed away. However, the spell goes horribly wrong (as such things tend to do) and she is instead raised as a zombie. And so are all the bodies in the town graveyard...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
