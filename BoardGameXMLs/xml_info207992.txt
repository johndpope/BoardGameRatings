			<description>In Under Quest you are in charge of a handful of characters in a small growing hamlet in between a larger town, and a notorious ruins. You goal is to build up your community by constructing buildings and your heroes by purchasing items in the market. There is also always the itch to go questing in the nearby ruins in an attempt to circumvent the traditional route to victory. The ruins are perilous and are all about risk vs reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the mechanics work together to create a rich experience where each player feels the freedom to play on their own terms and are equally punished and rewarded for pressing their luck in the ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you may spend a character card(s) to take one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Questing - Send one or more characters into the nearby dungeon in search of rare items and treasures. This uses a press-your-luck mechanic in which you reveal one card at a time and if the total of all the ruin card's value ever exceeds that of the combined power of all the characters, you bust. You may cash out at any time before this and combine the treasures indicated on each ruin card. You also can gain immediate victory points by revealing a set number of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Hire a new character - Send a character to the local inn to recruit a new character by paying a cost in gold. New characters tend to be more useful and skilled than the starting characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Contruct a Building - Send a character to purchase plans for a building that will be added to your hamlet. These building provide passive abilities and end game victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Bribe the Merchants - You may spend a character to place any number of items into the merchant's pouch. Doing so increases the value of those items, so will will want to balance the amount to bribe with the amount you keep for yourself. The value of items will be revealed at game's end and will make up a portion of total victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) Entertain at the Inn - Send a character to entertain at the inn. The player reveals the top treasure card. If the card indicates a reward of gold, the player claims the shown amount as a tip from the audience. If the card is an item, they receive no tip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6)Purchase from the Alchemist -  Send a character to make a purchase from the Alchemist. You may purchase multiple items here. Most are potions, but all are one-use items that the player may use later during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a determined number of rounds the game ends and the player with the most victory points wins. The player with the most gold is the tiebreaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
