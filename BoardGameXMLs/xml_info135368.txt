			<description>Time's Up! is a party game for teams of two or more players (best with teams of two).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same set of famous names is used for each of three rounds. In each round, one member of a team tries to get his teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed. In round 2 no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted). In round 3, no words are allowed at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
