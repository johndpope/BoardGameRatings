							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hawaiian Eye</name>
									
			<description>Hawaiian Eye comes from the 1959-1963  television show of the same name. From the cover. This is a game of intrigue and suspense with every play a challenge of wits and skill From the Hawaiian Eye synopsis: Set against the beautiful tropical landscape of Honolulu, Hawaii, this series centered around the cases of Hawaiian Eye Private Investigations and the two handsome, slick, tough-guy detectives who ran the firm - Thomas Jefferson Lopaka (Robert Conrad), or Tom for short, and Tracy Steele (Anthony Eisley), a Korean War veteran and former city police detective. They operated out of a swank office at the Hawaiian Village Hotel, where they were also the house detectives. Assisting them occasionally was a funny, ukelele-strumming Hawaiian taxi driver named Kazuo Kim (Poncie Ponce), whose wardrobe - consisting of a straw hat and crazy Hawaiian shirts - and numerous relatives living all over the Hawaiian Islands willing to help his employers if they needed it, provided invaluable comic relief. They were also aided by a dim-bulbed, scatter-brained, flippant nightclub singer and photographer named Chryseis &amp;quot;Cricket&amp;quot; Blake (Connie Stevens).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
