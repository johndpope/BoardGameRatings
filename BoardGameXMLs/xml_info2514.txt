			<description>Players take turns moving their own Helicopter pawn around the board to land on an unoccupied square. Individual board squares may be colored to match one player&amp;rsquo;s color, or in a neutral color. The color of the landing site indicates which player (whether or not that is the active player) places one floor of a new building at this square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player must then pay points to owners of all buildings over which the Helicopter has just flown. The pay rate is based on the total floor count for each color involved, and escalates steeply with increased floor count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn ends with one additional floor of the appropriate color being added to each building flown over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some players may be eliminated early when unable to pay.  Game ends when one player cannot move (cannot reach an empty square), or when one player has no more floors to place.  Player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
