			<description>From &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gamepile.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.gamepile.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divers Down is a &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; game based on the sport of SCUBA diving. It is classified as a knowledge game instead of a triva game because the information in the game is based on the information that SCUBA divers need to know in order to safely participate in the sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is for the player to complete three of the four possible dives (reef, wreck, deep or night). Each player starts on the &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot;. The player is then asked a question from a box of cards (similar to the question cards used in the game Trivial Pursuit). If the player answers correctly they descend to the next depth level. If they miss the question they move sideways towards the ABORT column. If the player ever lands in the ABORT column they must end the dive, return to the surface and start over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player reaches the maximum depth for the dive the next question they answer takes them back to the surface. They are then given a &amp;quot;certification card&amp;quot; for that dive and may start another dive. The first player to be &amp;quot;certified&amp;quot; in three of the four dives is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
