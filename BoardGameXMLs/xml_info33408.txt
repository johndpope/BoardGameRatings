			<description>From the publisher's site:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of the game is to go around the board and go up your Truck Terminal to the Central Trucking Terminal to eliminate your opponents without going bankrupt. If at any time during the game a player goes bankrupt that player is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real trucker situations and scenarios during game play make this a must have for truckers and&lt;br/&gt;non-truckers alike!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
