			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Cartoon Action Hour: Season 3 series book by Jason L Blair, a mystical gemstone is discovered that can peer into the souls of those who view it and divine their true nature, bringing it to life in physical form. Those with kind souls were blessed with Divine Light, becoming paragons of good, able to call forth noble creatures made of pure light. Those whose souls harbored evil intent experienced Dark Reflection and were transformed into twisted monsters driven by greed and vengeance. Now, the two factions find themselves at odds, as the Dark Reflection seeks to get its hands on the mystical gemstone at all costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Setting information.&lt;br/&gt;     Faction details.&lt;br/&gt;     Write-ups and stats for 7 Game Master Characters, 2 types of Goons and 4 ready-to-play Player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;     Details for creating your own Player Characters, including a brand new Special Rule.&lt;br/&gt;     Six episode seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
