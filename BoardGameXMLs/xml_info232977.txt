			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Singing Mountain is a dormant volcano that's well-known for having a system of crystalline and lava-filled tunnels beneath its flanks. It has long been a destination for lovers and artists, looking to find inspiration in its &amp;quot;singing&amp;quot; hallways &amp;mdash; but now the Darkness has infiltrated its passageways. Who will go in and root out this evil?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Massive Darkness: A Quest of Crystal and Lava, a six-quest campaign for Massive Darkness, takes players down into the heart of the Singing Mountain, looking to cleanse the mountain of the monsters that have taken up residence there. The set includes 15 double-sided tiles to use during the campaign and allows players to expand their other games of Massive Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
