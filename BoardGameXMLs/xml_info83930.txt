							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Qualities, or Half -Feats</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the fighter and the mage, feats are gained rather slowly for other character classes. Some GMs have resorted to handing out feats more often in order to get more use out of them. However, this creates imbalances and robs the fighter of their uniqueness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement suggests a means for characters and GMs to reach a compromise. Most feats give a sizable boost in power. Qualities, or half-feats, divide that power and distribute it more evenly. Thus, instead of receiving a sudden boost, qualities give an incremental advantage. Why bother? It might not matter so much at high levels, but at lower levels that extra little oomph does make a difference. They also show the gradual development of a character, rather than a sudden jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
