			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is designed to be run immediately after character creation as an introductory scenario. It presents an elementary problem-solving situation to the spanners, and does not deal with Time Combat or narcissists or anything complicated like that. Experienced players will have too easy a time of it and will solve the adventure almost immediately. The scenario is supposed to get players thinking four-dimensionally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is not a carefully-detailed adventure; it requires much embellishment by the Game Master. I have not, for instance, provided details of the corner or the chronies. There are some unexplained references in this scenario that assume you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with central Long Island. These references can be changed to any generic locations that apply. Just about any late twentieth or early twenty-first century corner would do, really.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
