			<description>Zizzlingers Miniature Collectible Game Pieces - with Power Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zizzlingers are plastic figures that are revealed like those little sponges that expand in water. Part of the fun is putting your pack in the water and seeing who comes out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zizzlingers figures each have a symbol on the bottom that is one of five symbols in a kind of extended Rock-Paper-Scissors (each symbol defeats two others, ties its own symbol, and cannot defeat two others). Each figure only has one symbol that is used each time it is used in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zizzlingers come in different licensed properties, some of which are Marvel Heroes, Disney Princesses, and Disney/Pixar characters. Zizzlingers gives you two to three figures in one package for about $5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.zizzle.com/zizzlingers.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.zizzle.com/zizzlingers.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
