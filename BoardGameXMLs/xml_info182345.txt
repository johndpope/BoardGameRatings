							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Deluxe Guide to Reincarnation</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Modern Take on an Ancient Classic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reincarnate is more than just a cheaper, lower-level version of raise dead that you can use even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a 5,000 gp diamond lying around, or don&amp;rsquo;t have a 9th-level cleric in the party. Reincarnate is a chance to roll the dice on your character&amp;rsquo;s destiny, and the spell provides a real and tangible possibility of creating dramatic change for the creature brought back. Many players enjoy the high risk and high reward experience of reincarnate, and others appreciate the interesting roleplaying opportunities it provides. But the spell&amp;rsquo;s a bit outdated, and it shows. For one, there are tons of exciting humanoid races in products released after the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook that you can&amp;rsquo;t become, because they were created after the table was made. Further, there&amp;rsquo;s one little phrase that turns a reincarnate spell cast on anything besides a humanoid into a real pain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For non-humanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had your game come to a grinding halt because your druid wanted to cast reincarnate on his animal companion, or you wish that there was a more convenient way to include all the fun new player character races in a single place, or you wish there was a teensy-weensy chance that a reincarnate could turn you into a medusa, this is the book for you. In addition to an updated set of tables for humanoid creatures, this book contains detailed nested tables for determining the new form of an animal companion, or a familiar, or a creature of any creature type. With no less than 50 tables containing creatures from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Race Guide and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiaries 1 &amp;ndash; 4, plus other sources, you have everything you need to make reincarnating any creature a fun and exciting experience. Plus, the book includes a set of optional rules for karmic reincarnation, which allows a character&amp;rsquo;s actions in life to influence how they return. Never look at reincarnate the same way again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
