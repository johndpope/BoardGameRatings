							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Epitaph (Issue 1 - Mar 2000)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the supplement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sink Your Teeth Into This!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out the new Deadlands Epitaph and get a big meaty mouthful of the most twisted tales in the Weird and Wasted West!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our debut issue features a full-color comic starring Ronan Lynch called The Blood Oak. It's a creepy tale that'll make you think twice the next time you sit under that old oak tree in your front yard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find Hell on Earth Dime Novel #4, Story's End. Everyone's favorite tale-teller and his new companions-the twin-Tokarev-toting Roth and the young Templar Samantha-face an ancient horror deep in the heart of the Wasted West. And you won't believe the ending!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then, of course, there's those big dinos you saw on the flip-side of this magnificent magazine. Jurassic Joe Wolf brings us Trouble at Table Rock, long a convention favorite among Deadlands fans and now in print for the first time ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add to that a new Veteran o' the Syker Wars Table by Jay Kyle, updates by John Goff and John Hopler, and a guide to writing for future issues of the Epitaph and you've got a whole passel o' meaty goodness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So set out your biggest dinosaur gun, load up some slugs, and let's go hunting. There's thunder lizards in them thar hills. And they're hungry, partner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
