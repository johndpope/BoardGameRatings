							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf</name>
									
			<description>It was known as Naomichi Ozaki no Super Masters (尾崎直道のスーパーマスターズ?, possibly &amp;quot;Osaki Naomichi's Super Masters&amp;quot;) in Japan. It is one of the early Sega sports games where a celebrity athlete's name was added to the title when it was localized from Japan (the other two games being Tommy Lasorda Baseball and Pat Riley Basketball). Although Arnold Palmer is shown on the box cover and at the title screen, the game makes no reference to him during the actual golf game play. The game features music composed by Bo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
