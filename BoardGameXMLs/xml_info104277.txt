			<description>From the Publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear Up!&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Fantasy is about killing things and taking their stuff, not dying of boredom while shopping for stuff. There are times when you want to pick out and tweak every last item of equipment for your new fantasy hero . . . but in most cases, starting gear ends up replaced, used up, broken, or lost within an adventure or two. So why waste valuable gaming time on it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter Dungeon Fantasy 13: Loadouts, which does for gear what character templates do for abilities. Simply look up your delver's profession (anything from Dungeon Fantasy 1-12) and pick a few lenses and options to get a decent set of equipment for him - all the armor, weapons, and other gear he needs to get out there and start having adventures. Leave the accounting for later, when you come home with the loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gear in each loadout is itemized, each piece annotated with cost and weight, a page reference, and brief stats. Every set gives the skills needed to use it, total weight, overall cost, and advice on trading points for cash or Signature Gear to afford it. There are even package costs and weights for alternate SMs, allowing you to outfit any adventurer from a pixie to an ogre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait, there's more! What would a book of gear be without new stuff? Inside are rules for artificers' tool vests, camouflage clothing, exotic weapons, partial armor, repeating pistol crossbows, and styled holy-warrior garb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the immortal words of Marge the Barbarian, &amp;quot;Less shop, more chop!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
