			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TNT (The Narrative Toolbox) is a rules-light, narrative-heavy roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics are focused on one thing: narrative control. The rules don't attempt to simulate how things work in the game world. They assume that everyone understands how the game world works and what kinds of things are possible, depending on the genre. What the rules DO help you decide is who gets to take control of the narrative and describe what happens next in the story of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based around the concept of universal character archetypes and the roles they play in adventure stories of all genres, TNT is effectively a universal roleplaying game that can be used to play any kind of story about any kind of characters in any kind of world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can dream it, you can do it in TNT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
