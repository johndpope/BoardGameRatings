							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harasser: Interdiction Mecha</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After examining many concepts, the Corrington Yards decided on designing a completely new mecha. The new design would be faster than all current or foreseeable enemy mecha, and would carry a huge payload of missiles. Its high speed would make it easy for the design to evade both enemy mecha and ground fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design had been in service for a few decades when the Beach War broke out. With an eye to making the Harasser more versatile, provision was made for four blaster cannon which could be installed in the upper torso, immediately under the cockpit, and firing via blast tubes and troughs through the shoulder joints. As the conflict escalated, the design was given even more firepower, with a pair of ion cannon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harasser went on to carve a name for itself as one of the most dangerous mecha in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
