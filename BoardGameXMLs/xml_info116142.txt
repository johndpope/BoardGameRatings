			<description>Pyramid Shambo is tournament-style Rock Paper Scissors (aka Roshambo), with pyramids used as scoring chips. Pyramid Shambo is to RPS what a Texas Hold &amp;lsquo;em Tournament is to a single hand of classic poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn challenges another to a round of Roshambo, with the loser paying the winner a small pyramid, making change as necessary based on pip counts.  Every time there's a tie, the payout escalates and the players continue to throw until there's a winner.  A player gets a bonus for eliminating another, and the eliminated player's pyramids are removed from the game.  The last player standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was made available on the Looney Labs web site late in 2011 as the company's holiday gift to fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in Pyramid Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
