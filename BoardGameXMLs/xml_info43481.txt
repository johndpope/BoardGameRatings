			<description>In Wildlife Rescue players take the role of conservation officers and aim to save as many endangered species for their zoos as possible. The objective of the game is to collect the highest scoring hand of wildlife cards, which are obtained by rolling six wildlife dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his or her turn, a player has three throws to collect a wildlife card, which each have a different points value depending on the relative difficulty of obtaining that species in the game. Players earn bonuses for collecting species wanted by their zoo (these vary from player to player - it's a bit like the mission in Risk) and can transfer a species from another player into their own collection, adding a dimension of player interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a finely-tuned probability mechanism - an understanding of probability therefore helps (details of the probablity distribution are on the publisher's website) but is not essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rule variations, including different ending conditions, are also available on publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
