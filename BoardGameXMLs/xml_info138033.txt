							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Future INC. High-Tech Stakes</name>
									
			<description>Game designed by creative team Lans Macabre. It's an area control strategy based on resource use, betting and bluffing. Players take the roles of megacorporations&amp;rsquo; CEOs to enlarge influence and dominance of the world. To do so they must spend resources to get control of cyberpunk freelancers - but it's not as easy as it sounds. The cyberpunks are very hard to control and everyone will try to recruit them. Each player will bet on different resources to get best results.&lt;br/&gt;Future INC. is all about getting control over locations and gathering resources.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with the same amount of skyscrapers and tries to expand by building new and capturing or destroying those belonging to other players. Thanks to skyscrapers players gain control over locations &amp;ndash; areas of the cyberpunk world - and gather resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five types of resources in the game:&lt;br/&gt;Credits - represent financial capabilities - used to build new skyscrapers.&lt;br/&gt;Cybernetics - represent technological advancement - used to change ownership of enemy skyscrapers to yours.&lt;br/&gt;Gear - represents military potential - used to destroy skyscrapers.&lt;br/&gt;Programs- represent defense against &amp;quot;cyber terrorism&amp;quot; - used to counter enemy actions.&lt;br/&gt;Influence - represents political power and intel &amp;ndash; used to gain an advantage by manipulating game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important thing in Future INC. is using free mercenaries - known as Cyberpunks - to do the dirty work. Using resources, corporation may influence a group of Cyberpunks to capture enemy building and gain victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is divided into five turns, each has three phases:&lt;br/&gt;1st phase, collecting resources: in which players gather resources, determine new targets for Cyberpunks and update points status.&lt;br/&gt;2nd phase, mission: in which players, using bluff, bet on resources to gain control over the Cyberpunks.&lt;br/&gt;3rd phase, actions of corporations: in which players spend resources to perform actions against each other.&lt;br/&gt;Points are gathered by winning control over Cyberpunks and locations. The player with the highest score at the end of the fifth turn wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future INC. High-Tech Stakes is a dynamic strategy for everyone who likes power struggle and a poker-like experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
