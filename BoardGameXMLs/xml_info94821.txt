							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS TT: Drop Zone Normandy</name>
									
			<description>DROP ZONE NORMANDY is the first release for the ATS TT line.  All of the scenarios depict actions in Normandy by the men of the 101st 'Screaming Eagles' Airborne Division as they parachute into enemy-held territory during the Normandy Invasion, and attempt to move inland in the days that follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a squad-level, tactical treatment of combat in WWII, in which personnel counters represent squads of 4-10 men as well as individual leaders and other key fighting men.  Support weapon counters represent individual machine guns, mortars and light anti-tank weapons and vehicle counters indicate single tanks and transporters. The scale of this hex-and-counter game is roughly 1 hex = 50 yards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An offshoot of the popular ATS (Advanced Tobruk System), the &amp;quot;TT&amp;quot; refers to &amp;quot;table top&amp;quot;, and strives to provide all the action of any other ATS game while requiring less table space, as well as a lower cost.  All of the included scenarios play out on a single map, and ATS TT will use slightly smaller personnel, vehicle and ordnance counters than previous ATS releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a new map, 8 new scenarios and all the counters required to play them out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
