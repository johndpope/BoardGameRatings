			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living on the outskirts of the coast was dangerous enough before atrocities of the ocean's depths came crawling onto them. However, now an ancient race of carnivorous fish people known as gleran, devoted to the cult of Umberlee have begun to emerge. They've reduced a few small coastal settlements to watery hellscapes littered with buzzing, bloated, half-eaten corpses. Residents have begun living in fear after hearing increasingly frequent tales of nearby villages suffering savage attacks carried out by these creatures and the profane rituals they perform with their victim's remains. The gleran presence is growing, as is the audacity of their bloody sacraments, and it needs to be stemmed before they encroach any further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salt and Sacrifice provides a short, 2-hour adventure for level 1 characters as well as 2 new monsters to add to your DM'ing roster. It is set on Selkie Rock, an islet just off the coast of wherever the GM feels like that's been overrun by gleran and embroiled in a bloody sacrificial ritual. The ritual has already given birth to a thrall of Umberlee, a human-crustacean abomination known as The Keeper, but needs just a few more sacrifices to complete and reach full strength. A preternatural fog traps the characters as they're faced with discovering the ritual's source and putting an end to it by slaying The Keeper, or perishing and having their souls fuel its completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
