							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soldiers of Stannum</name>
									
			<description>Soldiers of Stannum is an introductory set of simple miniatures rules designed to allow children and parents to play together. The rules are extremely flexible as to the types of miniatures used, i.e. superhero action figures can compete against medieval fantasy figures. Most rules are designed around the size of the miniature figure - for example, figures can move 3x their standing base length in a turn. Combat rules are resolved around a simple rock-paper-scissors method for hand-to-hand combat and shooting rubber bands or rolling balls for ranged combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the rulebook are reminders that this is a wargame for young children so it is appropriate to let them reshoot misfired shots or make forgotten movements. The goal of the game is to have fun with your children - not slaughter them with your superior gaming skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
