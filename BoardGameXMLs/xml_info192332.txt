							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reborn (M&amp;M3)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People say that heroes are born, not made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob is the living proof that is not true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was Reborn to rise from a doomed existence to become a true hero. A priest gave him an option to be Reborn into an improved self and he took it without thinking it twice. Now he acts as a mythical urban angel of justice and nobody knows who he is or where does he came from. Sometimes not even himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reborn's origin is shrouded in mystery and nobody, not even him, is quite sure if its Godly or not. He certainly hopes so, and tries to act accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This character is ready to be used with the Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds Third Edition System but it would be really easy to adapt it to any other superhero rule-system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes original art for the character (with an alternative non-Christian version for those who may prefer it) and 9 pages full of content including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    ORIGIN STORY&lt;br/&gt;    CHARACTER DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;    ROLEPLAYING HINTS&lt;br/&gt;    RESOURCES&lt;br/&gt;    M%M FULL CHARACTER SHEET (ready to use!). &lt;br/&gt;    +4 OTHER STORY RELATED SECTIONS (related characters, background info, etc). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
