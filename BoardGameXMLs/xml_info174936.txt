							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ten Kingdoms of Alphatiev</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Setting for any game system and a mini-RPG, with stats for -U- the Game of Stories!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the world was young, there were nomadic tribes that warred with one another, elves that watched with contempt, and dwarves that wanted to be left alone. Then, the storm came, and when the winds were done shifting sands, and moving trees, a large city sat nestled in the plains. From the city came flying ships and a high magic that astonished all. Now, generations later, this city is the hub of the world. We are all beholden to Alphatiev, and our ten kingdoms are strong for it. In the dark corners, however our undoing looms. Welcome to Alphatiev.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book, you'll find a complete Setting about the world of Ten Kingdoms of Alphatiev, and a customized copy of -U- Essentials which gives you everything (except 3 six-sided die) to begin playing in this strange parallel of our own world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
