It is a world where the vast majority of Mankind, remnants of the old world, and native Elves and Dwarves alike attempt to eke out a life off the land, and one another, surviving in less than ideal conditions surrounded by constant struggle and strife. Technology and comfort, a grim reminder of the pre-cataclysmic world, is limited almost exclusively to the wealthy and powerful. Between these two extremes we find adventurers and freedom fighters, pirates and bounty hunters; all struggling for their own personal goals, be it fame, fortune .. or freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TechMage has been designed to be a highly customizable Science-Fantasy Role Playing Game that can be played in a variety of timelines under numerous situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
