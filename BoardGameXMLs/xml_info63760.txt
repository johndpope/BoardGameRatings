			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science Fiction Roleplaying on Occupied Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shortly after Mars was colonized in 2030, a comet was discovered to be on a collision course with Earth. Several hundred seeding ships were launched in the hope of keeping the human race alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alien vessel arrived just in time to save Earth, but an intense electromagnetic debris field was created as a byproduct. Space travel was now too dangerous to attempt and communication between Earth and Mars was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several years later, Earth refugees arrived on Mars with a fantastic story of alien invasion and a search began for the lost seeding ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 2099 and the Martians are planning to take back Earth with the help of The Colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Technology&lt;br/&gt;Biotech (genetic engineering, gene tampering, and tissue growth)&lt;br/&gt;Nanotech (microscopic machines which operate within man and machine)&lt;br/&gt;Implants (bio-mechanical replacement parts)&lt;br/&gt;Autonomies (intelligent computer programs which operate independently)&lt;br/&gt;Exotech (heavily armored and self-powered suits)&lt;br/&gt;Research &amp;amp; Development (Create and design biotech, nanotech, implants, autonomies, exotech, guns, and more)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: Bookmarks, hyperlinks, index, rich character backgrounds, extensive list of weapons and technologies, and useful charts and tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colonies features a simple yet comprehensive set of game mechanics which uses 2 (or more) 6-sided dice. A character's ability and skill, along with varying degrees of difficulty (ranging from simple to impossible), bonus dice (keep the 2 lowest dice), and penalty dice (keep the 2 highest dice), affect the outcome of a task. These mechanics are very flexible and also reduce the need to roll dice in many situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
