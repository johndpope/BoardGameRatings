							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">House of the Hawk</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A general collection of all kinds of stuff from my old campaign from the mid 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario was published in two forms, but variations exist.  The scenario provides a substantive amount of setting information and sometimes refers to itself as House of Hawk Campaign Setting.  The titular House of the Hawk is a mercenary/adventuring company.  The included scenario is suitable for 4th - 7th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting incorporates elements from numerous commercially published settings, including Al-Qadim, as well as incorporating variant rules derived from The Arduin Grimoire 1: The Arduin Grimoire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sprawling scenario is typically distributed as a ZIP archive containing four GIF files (maps) and about twenty ASCII files (unfortunately ALL IN CAPS) that are semi-arranged in topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
