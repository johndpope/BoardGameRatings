			<description>BATTLEMAGE is a fantasy wargame for two or more players. Each person controls a small warband of warriors, each led by a powerful Battlemage. You are fighting for power and glory, but more than that you are fighting for control of the world of Ra'al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of BATTLEMAGE is fought between two warbands, each led by a powerful spellcaster called a Battlemage. The game is played on a tabletop with miniature figurines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses six-sided dice to resolve the conflict. Each figure (or 'warrior' as the game calls them) has it's own set of statistics that define how good it is at fighting: MV (move), ATT (attack), DEF (defence) and W (wounds). Additionaly, they may have special rules that let them do unusual things, such as make ranged attacks, use powers, or fly through the air, to name but a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book contains five different warbands, each led by a different Battlemage. They include the Whiterock Loyalists, the Shadow Academy, the Cult of the Black Wind, The Horde of Seven Peaks and the Ghostwood Raiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign rules are also include with the game, so that your warriors can improve with each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
