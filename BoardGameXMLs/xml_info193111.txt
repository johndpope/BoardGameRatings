			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anvil Eight Games is back!!! - and we are proud to introduce the first expansion for 'Aetherium: House Ikaru'. This expansion introduces a brand new faction to the Aetherium universe, complete with new models, rules, schemas and strategies to help you take control of the digital world. Aetherium is a tabletop miniatures/board game for 2+ players that takes around 45-60 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;House Ikaru is a megalithic corporation whose interests can be found virtually everywhere in the material world and within the Aetherium. This unstoppable entity has spread its tendrils far and wide in pursuit of commerce and profit. House Ikaru has been at the forefront of the technological race to enter the Aetherium and, with almost absolute market share control, they are now the leading force in wetware and hardware used to interact with the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a game of Aetherium, House Ikaru tends to access more RAM than other factions - the primary currency of the game. This resource allows players to control the board more directly, or to push their units beyond their normal limits. At this, House Ikaru excels. Many of their units are more than capable of going head to head with enemies, but with limited Cycle Speed (action points), players must plan carefully, or find themselves out-maneuvered and out-positioned. While not an easy collective to master, House Ikaru offers players a new and exciting way to enjoy a run into the Aetherium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
