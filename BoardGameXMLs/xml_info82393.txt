			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TOUGH AS NAILS!&lt;br/&gt;Entrapped within the lair of the evil dragon &amp;quot;Lore,&amp;quot; you must use your greatest skill to survive. A skill so powerful, so unique, it's all you'll need to defeat your enemy. With sharpened spikes of case-hardened steel, you will attempt to Nail 'N Scale your way to victory. Start off easy in mysterious chambers of bricks and mortar. Soon you'll learn that life as &amp;quot;Spike&amp;quot; doesn't stay so easy. Your quest is to maneuver your way through all 50 mazes, using your spikes to smash bricks, climb, and destroy anyone in your way. Each level is a different puzzle to solve, with new enemies to defeat. They'll try their best to stop you from reaching your ultimate goal: the dragon's lair!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
