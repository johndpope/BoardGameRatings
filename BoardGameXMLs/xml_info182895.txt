			<description>Partying Puppies is a lighthearted walk through a land of Puppyliciousness, with a dark zombie undercurrent that you are always trying to avoid. The object of the game is simple, be the last puppy standing as the other players fall to the zombie apocalypse; the last player not to be bitten by a zombie and get infected by the virus wins! It's that easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twist of Partying Puppies is not only do you get to avoid getting bit by presenting an antidote card, or skip a turn, or the usual expected game mechanics but there are physical tasks to accomplish along the way. As a result, it's a combination card game, truth or dare, and charade mix. To progress a card may call on you to bark like a pup,fetch something, or force another player to do your ridiculous task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
