			<description>Comix Zone is a 1995 arcade-style action game. The game's unique feature is that it is set within the panels of a comic book. Each level  consists of two pages and secrets are discovered by shredding the paper and revealing items. The unique dialogue is rendered within talk bubbles with the typical comic font. Sprites and backgrounds possess the bright colors and dynamic drawing style favored by superhero comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comix Zone was widely criticized for being released too late and for being too hard and short, but it was positively received, and praised for its great game-play, graphics, and soundtrack. It became a great success due to its game-play, and has been released on many collections and consoles since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The music was composed by Howard Drossin, a known video game and movie composer. Graphics were done mainly by comic artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally from a concept video animated by Peter Morawiec titled &amp;quot;Joe Pencil Trapped In The Comix Zone&amp;quot;. The video was made in 1992, displaying the animation of how the gameplay and the comic book elements would blend in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Comix Zone&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
