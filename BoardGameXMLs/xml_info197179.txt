							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Assano spel</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Assano&amp;quot; is a name under which several editions of Uno have been published in Europe, and also the name of this simplified Uno version given away by Quaker Oats to promote cereal products Havrefras and R&amp;aring;gfras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 54 cards plus two rules cards. Compared to a regular Uno deck, this is missing zeroes and duplicates of suited cards, while the four +4 joker cards have been replaced with two +2 joker cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are fairly short and ambiguous but can be interpreted to be largely consistent with regular Uno. Players are each dealt five cards and then try to empty their hands by making legal plays to the discard pile. There is no scoring: the goal is simply to shed your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
