			<description>Build the Kingdom - The Greatest Mission in the World is an LDS-themed game in which players attempt to gain the most converts in a game somewhat similar to Catan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a modular assortment of diamonds (rather than the hexes used in Catan) with each having a symbol representing a principle of the Mormon faith on it (Preach my Kingdom, Faith, Repentance, Baptism, and Prayer). Players gain the principles through die rolls and trade them in for converts, Books of Mormons, and churches - each of which is worth Celestial Points. Satan (similar to Catan's Robber) moves about the game board hindering the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player achieves 10 Celestial Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
