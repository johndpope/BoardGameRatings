			<description>The year is 1870.&lt;br/&gt;The World is at War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Dystopian Wars is similar to our own, but subtly different. The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset, so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spartan Games will supply highly detailed, high quality resin and metal miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games, because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall game play and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world. The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
