							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Double Cross</name>
									
			<description>This is a game in the Waddingtons House of Games Family Favorites series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rather simple game features a square board with a track around the edge and with a cross track through the center. Squares on the track have a number from 30 to 100. Players are given 700 dollars to start and have a counter that starts in one of the corners. Game play consists of rolling a die, moving along the track and collecting money according to the color and number of the square a player lands on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player wins all the money, but with some foresight, the game makers included an option to play the game to a time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
