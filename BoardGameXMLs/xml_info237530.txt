			<description>It's mating season, and these rabbits are getting out of control!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quick and easy 18 Card Micro-Game, you and your opponent square off trying to be the first to empty their hands of proliferating rabbit cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 9 random cards, some female and some male rabbits. Cards must be played in order that they appear in your hand, top to bottom. Simultaneously you play your card..&lt;br/&gt;2 Males: they stay in the pile&lt;br/&gt;2 Females: they stay in the pile&lt;br/&gt;1 Male 1 Female: They Mate!! The player who played the lower numbered card must take the entire pile of played rabbit cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in this fashion until one players hand is empty and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
