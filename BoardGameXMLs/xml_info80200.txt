							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Hunter</name>
									
			<description>Monster Hunter is a modern horror game of choices and consequences. The characters are in a position to save innocent lives, but only at great cost to themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is full of monsters preying on humanity. You have the chance to fight back, but what are you willing to sacrifice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Monster Hunter, each player takes on the role of an agent employed by a government agency that is trying to rid the world of monsters. The characters will have to decide how to balance their gruesome job against their relationships with friends and family, their principles, and their mental and physical health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Hunter can be played with any number of players, but two to four is the best number. With only one player there is no-one to act as Describer, and with five or more players may have to wait a long time for their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
