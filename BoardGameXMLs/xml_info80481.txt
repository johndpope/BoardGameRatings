			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magical Devices, a 1997 Gen Con supplement, celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Chivalry &amp;amp; Sorcery. Within the following pages are over 10 Devices of Power the GMs can place in their campaign world, or the formulas for an items creation could be found in scrolls, books, etc. by a mage that could attempt to create the item himself. Finding the materials to make the item can spin off into many new quests! Lastly, a GM can use the items provided to get ideas on how to create his own Devices of Power for his campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also provide three sample creatures from our upcoming creatures Bestiary, some expanded rules concerning the creation of Devices of Power, and specific magical effects of a creatures remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
