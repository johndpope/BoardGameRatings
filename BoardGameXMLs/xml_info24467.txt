			<description>This is a game for 2 to 4 players. The instructions say that it should be played by girls and boys together. Each player gets a particular color to start on. That color is used later on. A girl starts the game! There are spaces on the gameboard such as First Class, Air Mail or Special Delivery. When a player lands on one of them the player picks a card and reads it aloud. The card will list some kind of stunt that must be accomplished in order to score points. If a partner is needed to accomplish the stunt then the player spins a spinner, the male who has that color representing him is the girls partner for the stunt. There is a time limit to accomplish each stunt. The stunts are childish (this game is appropriate for perhaps 8 to 12 year olds).  Some examples of stunts that need to be done;  You and your partner eat a potato chip at the same time and immediately whistle Yankee Doodle. First one to whistle the first line wins the points. Or Standing back to back with your partner, remove his or her jacket or sweater and put it on yourself without turning around. The successful completion of a stunt in the given time limit results in winning a certain amount of points. First player to reach 500 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
