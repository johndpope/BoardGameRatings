							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moria Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Battle between the Fellowship of the Ring and the Orcs of Moria. Abstract Skirmish level combat. Each figure represents a single man (unit). Victory: You win if you kill all the opposing figures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the fighters. The Fellowship player has nine units and the Orc player has sixteen. A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the shared deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
