			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation is based on a point pool which is debited for every aspect of creation.  Characters are first assigned Attributes (Mind, Body, Spirit, Magic Resistance, Physical Resistance, and Life Points).  Characters may pay for Advantages or receive points back for Disadvantages; there are numerous types of both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also receive Skills from a fairly lengthy list divided into categories.  Many Skills are special combat maneuvers.  Spells are treated as a special kind of skill and are purchased individually.  Characters also receive Gifts or Innate Talents, but generally these are quite expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resolution of opposed actions or Skill use is determined by die roll, but the game uses specialized dice for different situations.  There are fifteen different dice symbols that appear on a variety of dice--geometrically, they are cubes and could be mimicked (not easily) with standard d6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spell system is fairly unique inasmuch as a character that knows a spell may use it as frequently as desired--there are no daily limits and no spell points.  In this respect, a spell represents a type of magical skill.  However, magic is somewhat unpredictable.  Combat is advanced and includes numerous options and special maneuvers, though a simplified combat system also is supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
