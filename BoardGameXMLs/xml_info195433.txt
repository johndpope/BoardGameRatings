							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AXE: Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core rules of the game are distributed in a ZIP archive that contains four PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules&lt;br/&gt;     Combat&lt;br/&gt;     Magic&lt;br/&gt;     Threat Encounters Bonus Dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, these documents include what you would expect from their titles.  The Rules document presents character creation and the dice pool mechanic.  The game intriguingly collapses a character's performance dice pool with their health status--wounds remove dice from the active pool; healing restores them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the design goal of the game was provide a simple, easily-accessible system that sacrifices realism for playability, the actual dice pool mechanic is quite complex and has numerous special-case rules.  The Threat Encounters Bonus Dice document provides an additional series of variants to the already complicated dice pool rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
