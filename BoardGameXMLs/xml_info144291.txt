			<description>Vinyl Goddess from Mars is a 2D action platformer published by Union Logic Software Publishing, Inc and developed by Six Pound Sledge Studios. It was released for MS-DOS in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;The game plays similar to Epic MegaGames's Jill of the Jungle. Epic was to publish the game as a sequel to Jill of the Jungle, but was not happy with the quality of the game, and published Jazz Jackrabbit instead.[citation needed] The story was then changed and published by Union Logic as an original game.[1]&lt;br/&gt;The game has three episodes (with only the first episode playable in the shareware version):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Episode 1: Forests of Old&lt;br/&gt;Episode 2: Caverns of Chaos&lt;br/&gt;Episode 3: The Return&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Vinyl Goddess from Mars&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
