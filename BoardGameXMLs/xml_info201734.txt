			<description>Roar of War is a tactical card battle game for 2-4 players. You will play as one of the four race leaders and try to locate and defeat your rivals&amp;rsquo; King or Queen. Each race has asymmetrical Attack / Defence / Counterattack Powers; therefore, a different strategy applies for each player. Orcs and Humans have balanced Attack and Defence Power whereas Elves have high Attack Power and Dwarves have high Defence Power. With each turn, players will have the chance to try different strategies and cover their King/Queen to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roar of War packs pure Strategy Game mechanics and beautiful art in one box. Each additional copy of Roar of War adds 4 more players to the game and enables large team plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to eliminate your rivals by attacking and defeating their King or Queen cards. The last player with the King/Queen card wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
