			<description>From the Press Release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to button up Bear's coat with three matching-colored buttons. Each player chooses a bear card wearing their favorite colored coat. The colored buttons are randomly placed face-down on a large, easy-to-use spinning board embellished with tumbling bears. After spinning the board, the player must choose one button from any of the four heart-shaped arrows. If the button matches the coat on the player's bear, they place it on his coat. If the button does not match, the player returns it to the board, face-down, and has to remember where it was. The first player to button up Bear's coat wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
