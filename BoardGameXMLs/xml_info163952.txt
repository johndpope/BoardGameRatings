			<description>A collectible card game based on the international Discworld Conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three main game types playable:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) A top-trumps style game based in various people associated with the convention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) A short game where players attempt to run the best single event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) A long game where players try and run the best events as the convention timetable progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In game types 2 and 3. Players build a deck consisting of event, role and modifier cards. Players in turn play events based on timetable slots, and then play roles and modifiers to improve or disrupt the events. Once all events are played (or the last event is played) players add up their score; the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
