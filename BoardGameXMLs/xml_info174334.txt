			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Superman has a new mission of stopping the falling meteorite from striking the city of Metropolis.  Superman gets information that the falling meteorite is heading towards Metropolis and is targeting the Daily Planet office (where he works as a reporter.)  On his way to destroy the meteorite, Superman encounters three deadly villains and has to knock them down and collect the tokens to destroy the meteorite with all his new super powers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metropolis Rescue Mission is a roll-and-move game where players move around a track, trying to reach the end and destroy the meteorite.  Along the way, they may land on spaces that force them to defeat villains as well as other spaces that will grant them extra powers. &amp;quot;Diversion&amp;quot; tracks and transportation spaces allow players to shorten the track and avoid some villains.  The first player to the finish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
