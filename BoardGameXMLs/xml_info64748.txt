			<description>The game consists of 3 Sub-games that are all played on a map of the Ladin valleys. In the very heart of the Dolomites live slightly more than 30.000 Ladins whose identity is characterised mainly by the uniqueness of their language which derives from Vulgar Latin. It is only thanks to the isolation of the splendid high-mountain landscape, in which the Ladins live, that the Ladin language and cultural heritage have survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Ladinoscop&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to connect the starting point and the arrival point indicated on the route card using the town tokens which lies between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) The Dolomite round trip&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this game is to complete the Dolomites round trip by returning to the starting point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Up and down trough Ladinia&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the third game is to reach all the spaces corresponding to the taken town tokens, and finally return to the starting point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
