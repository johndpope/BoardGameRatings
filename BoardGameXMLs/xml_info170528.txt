			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the eve of Brattleburg&amp;rsquo;s Winter Festival, Shemik has returned to see Lidya as promised. The party arrives just in time to discover that Shemik has kidnapped Lidya and jumped into his magical bag of holding. With a world of adventure crammed into a little space, the party must face enchanted toys, candied terrors, and one giant Christmas clich&amp;eacute; after another. Can the heroes save Lidya?  What has become of Bernard? And is that Unicorn still a unicorn if it breaths fire? With the Winter Festival hanging in the balance, Looks like the party may have to &amp;quot;sack tap&amp;quot; Father Christmas this year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is a sequel to last year&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Unicorn without a Horn,&amp;rdquo; and takes place within BrattleBurg Continuity. If you need to catch up on Brattleburg, you can find the whole story on our website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Episode 30 - Unicorn Now&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: It is the Holiday extravaganza, with a lot of very bizarre premises, loosely thrown together, for your enjoyment. Chase down an ex-evil wizard into a bag of holding and fight your way through evil elves, twisted toys, and all the holiday cheer you can muster. In our last adventure of 2014, we revisit the &amp;quot;Unicorn Without a Horn&amp;quot; adventure that we did last Christmas. That is as original is we could get this time. Maybe next year, Happy Holidays!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
