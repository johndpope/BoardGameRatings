			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 40 inch by 40 inch, floor plan of a SciFi Relay Station, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play), and a 360 degree view from the center of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zero? Can you hear us Zero?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Static]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you need a small expansion colony or a communication or sensor research facility, DramaScape has your location with Relay Station Zero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relay Station Zero includes the exterior surroundings of a small colony or research station of a planet and the interiors of two buildings with the roofs cut off, the relay station and the residential building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relay Station Zero is intended for use in near or far future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook(s) for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Transmission: Relay Station Zero&amp;rsquo;s last communication was twenty-four hours ago. Since then, there has been dead silence. Fearing the worst, the Player Characters are recruited for a possible search and rescue operation. What the Player Characters find when they arrive is up to the Game Master. The crew has either been captured or killed so that they cannot perform their duties or the communication system has been sabotaged or destroyed so that it no longer functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Extra Relay Lap: Someone on Relay Station Zero is relaying messages to an unknown organization. The Player Characters are recruited for a counterespionage mission to inspect the facility and root out the traitor. When the Player Characters stay far too long for a routine inspection, the spy infiltrates the relay station to message for an escape shuttle, sets charges to blow up all the relays, and then attempts to flee to the evacuation point where the shuttle will land and blow the charges at a distance. The Player Characters have to capture the spy and learn the contents of the last message as well as stop the bombs from knocking out the relays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next day, an unknown force attacks Relay Station Zero&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
