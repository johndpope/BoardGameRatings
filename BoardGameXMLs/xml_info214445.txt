			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Furyondy Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trials and tribulations of keeping Molag in control of the nation of Furyondy continue in the face of full-scale battle with the Old One&amp;rsquo;s forces breaking out elsewhere. While rumors of the war and what directions it will take are rampant, the commander of Molag has his own worries. Extremely lethal guerilla warfare has begun. Whole companies have gone missing or been found slaughtered. It is time to call for expert reinforcements. Are you up to the task of taking the fight to the elite troops of Old Wicked in what is sure to be a down and dirty fight with those adept at hit and run tactics?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an extremely dangerous Military mission in support of the garrison at Molag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PCs with infamy with the Furyondy Military may be offered a chance to redeem themselves. This adventure is designed for PCs level 5-14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
