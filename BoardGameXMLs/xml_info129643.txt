			<description>Grow is a solitaire game where the player guides a growing forest towards safety from the lumber industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player builds his/her tree through a series of rounds using hex tiles representing branches and leaves. The leaf tiles provides energy (used as Action point) for the player to spend growing his tree further or expanding his tree population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player's tree grows bigger, it also becomes more profitable to cut down. The lumberjack token will become more active and more powerful as the game progresses. The player loses the game when there's no more trees for the lumberjack to cut down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a free Print-and-play game available to anyone! Counters are provided but standard wooden cube are suggested for convenience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
