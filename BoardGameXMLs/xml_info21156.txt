			<description>This game is similar but different from &amp;quot;Fouray&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;4 Player Chess&amp;quot;.  The biggest difference might be that traditonal &amp;quot;4 Player Chess&amp;quot; has 96 open spaces in the initial setup while Forchess only has 4 open spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two version to this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Standard Forchess has fixed alliances&lt;br/&gt;2.  Cutthroat Forchess focuses on fluid alliances&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, four traditional chess sets are placed on the smaller and traditional 8 by 8 board with one pawn removed from each player's side, meaning that conflict occurs quickly due to a lack of available space.  In this version, the pawns move forward diagonally and capture forward vertically and forward horizontally, but they can never move more than one square at a time and thus there is no &amp;quot;en passant&amp;quot; capture technique in this game.  Castling does not exist in Forchess.  It is suggested that kings should be captured like other pieces, although opponents should still say &amp;quot;check&amp;quot; when putting a king in jeopardy.  Furthermore, a player cannot place a teammate in check.  If a player cannot move any of his pieces, he must remove one piece from the board per turn until he can move a piece.  If a player captures a king, he may then use all of the removed player's pieces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
