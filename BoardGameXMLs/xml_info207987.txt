			<description>No Regerts: The Game of Art and Poor Life Choices is a light hearted, fast paced, pvp style card game that plays 2-6 players. Your objective is to be the most badass by the end of the game while making your friends look lame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now how? With the playing deck, each player has a &amp;quot;formation card&amp;quot; to show you how your &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; is formed. Your body is made up of six tattooable limbs (two arms, two legs, a chest, and a back); and each limb holds enough space for 3 designs each (so 18 designs in total).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fill these limbs, you have to get tattooed. The game consists of three types of cards: Positive Tattoos (indicated by their blue title color and positive value), Negative Tattoos (indicated by their red title color and negative value, and Modifier Cards (which have no number value and have only a gold bar at the bottom of the card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now game play is easy to learn. Each players starts with a hand size of 5 cards... which will remain for the game unless you have a card that says other wise. And you have four main actions on your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Get tattooed:&lt;br/&gt;This can be a positive or a negative tattoo. To get a positive tattoo, you have to discard either another positive tattoo or a modifier (which is good as gold even though it doesn't have a number value) since good tattoo artists don't work for free. To get a negative tattoo, you probably know someone working out of a van or basement that will give you tetanus along with a free tattoo, so negative tattoos are free and don't require a discard payment. Some cards, both positive and negative, have extra effects that are in their description bars under their titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Note if you can't or choose not to do either, you can discard two cards to pass. But to get to your second action, you have to get a tattoo on yourself first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Open play:&lt;br/&gt;This is where you can do as much as your hand allows. If you can pay for a second tattoo, you can get one. This is also where the use of modifiers come into play and where the pvp aspect comes in. There is a dreaded modifier known as &amp;quot;Bad Advice&amp;quot;. This modifier is what mainly allows a player to play negative tattoos on other players. And there are other great modifiers that also will effect tattoos that are already in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Is a require discard.&lt;br/&gt;This allows for a more balance deck as well as forces more strategy and less hording. There are cards that will effect the discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Is basically refresh. Fill your hand back to five (unless you have a card that says other wise).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end game is determined when one player has filled their body, that player receives 5 bonus points, and everyone then totals their tattoo values to determine the winner. So just because you finished first, it doesn't mean you've won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
