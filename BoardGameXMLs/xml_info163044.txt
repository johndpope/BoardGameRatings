			<description>Wargame rules for the 18th and 19th Centuries in 10mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intention is to develop a fast fun set of rules with no paperwork, readable in under an hour and of less than a mere 30 pages. I hope my small contribution provides something you will enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will find that the emphasis had been placed on the American War of Independence and American Civil War. This was done to get the particular troop types of that conflict vetted in these rules. There is no reason why these rules cannot suffice for any European war of the same period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic set of war game rules must provide a vehicle for troop movement, a procedure for deciding combat and a method for accounting for the results of combat (casualties and routed units). Laid over all this, the war gamer must be confounded with command and control issues and logistics problems. All this must be done without unduly complicating the rule system and maintaining game playability and realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
