			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metamor Jupiter is an unusual shoot'em up where your ship is an organic entity which can transform into three different shapes, each of them having its own weapon system. A rain of blue comets are hurling towards the earth and they carry with them an alien invasion. Your mission, as you would have expected, it to stop it and destroy the core of the alien forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
