							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Torn Apart by Radiation Wraiths (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You never know the truth about a person until they're bleeding out in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maschine Zeit is a science fiction horror game, set in devastated stations suspended far above earth's surface. Explorers go to take valuables from the dead, to mine rare minerals from the stations or to collect the information needed to give proper funerals to the dead. The explorers are in for a surprise when they realize that many of the people didn't go away completely upon death. Their spirits are bound to the destroyed machines that brought their deaths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torn Apart by Radiation Wraiths is a one-shot, introductory adventure for Maschine Zeit. It contains character sheets for five characters traveling onto a station, a fully playable system primer, a number of modular scenes and an in-character map of the space. It's sufficient for a long night of tense gaming, or a couple of nights. Each character has a number of secrets and motivations, allowing the scenario to be run a number of times with completely different results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The files have all been recently edited and substantial amounts have been rewritten. The new version is quite a bit different from earlier this year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
