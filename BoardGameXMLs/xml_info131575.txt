							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grunting: The Race for Fire</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a time before time. When men and dinosaurs roamed the earth together, and the wheel had just been invented. Men and women roamed the plains in their loincloths, hunting mammoth, and creating the first communities. Language is just starting to find its feet, and some bright little cave-sparks have begun to harness the power of the landscape and the animals around them to produce higher standards of living for their fellow men. However, one thing is missing, FIRE! With fire, men can have metals, heat, better food, warmth, stronger, deadlier weapons, and command the fear of the animals around them. Fire is indeed mighty, and it&amp;rsquo;s what you need to get to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not have FIRE. But someone nearby does, or knows how to get it. The FIRE must be yours&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Grunting: The Race for Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are restricted from communicating with each other except via drawings and a limited game vocabulary of 60 words or so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
