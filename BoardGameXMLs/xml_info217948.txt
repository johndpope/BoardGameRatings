			<description>It's time for an exciting duck race on the lake!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in Quack Quack gets a headband with a wobbly duck, then sits down. The start command &amp;quot;Quack Quack!&amp;quot; starts all players moving at the same time. If one moves with the duck dangling from their headband near the eggs, the magnet on the duck attracts the eggs, which the player must then deposit as quickly as possible on their own water lily. If no eggs of a color are left in the pond, the player with that color has won this crazy race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
