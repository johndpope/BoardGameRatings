							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Oktobermen Special Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first issue of Due Vigilance brings you a team of supernatural super villains, ready to strike fear into the hearts of your players. Bound together by greed and darker urges, the Oktobermen are mystic mercenaries eager to take on the ugliest jobs for the right price. Springheel Jack leads his team to achieve his ultimate goal: to become a crown prince of Hell! These seven unholy villains will challenge the mettle of your players. Be warned! They are fearsome foes indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adding to the terror are the Devilish Duos Issue 1: Smoke and Mirrors (M&amp;M 3 Edition): two killers driven by different needs but entangled by fate. One is an immortal assassin who can only be seen in reflections, and the other is a ghost who sees the world through the twisted view of her painful past. With origins dating back to before the Second World War, they can be a threat and a mystery on their own&amp;hellip; but adding them to the roster of The Oktobermen can make the team even more dangerous than before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this compilation of Nightmarish Ne&amp;rsquo;er-do-wells, every night is Halloween!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
