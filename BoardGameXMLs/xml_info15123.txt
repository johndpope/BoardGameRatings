			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique version of Backgammon. Capture the backgam chips without getting caught. Score extra points. The winner may surprise you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Sid Sacksons &amp;quot;A Gamut of Games&amp;quot;: Like backgammon, except that there are a number of different paths. Men when taken off are not reentered, and chips can be picked up that earn extra points if carried to the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BackGam III is a variation of Backgammon that has a section of the board called a cage. In this cage are tokens called back gams. The cage is entered with a dice roll of one when you are on 1 of 2 special spaces on the board. If you capture a backgam from the cage and successfully bring into your opponents pen you are awarded bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
