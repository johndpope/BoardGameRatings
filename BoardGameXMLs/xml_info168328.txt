			<description>The animals are loose and must be brought back into the enclosures as fast as possible. If only someone could remember where the animals were last!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dash quickly as you and the other players turn over tiles to collect pairs of animals. Find pairs according to the Goal Tiles. Match a valid pair and receive a positive point, collect a wrong pair and receive a negative point. Score the most points at the end of 3 rounds and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
