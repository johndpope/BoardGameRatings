			<description>Sea of Nadia is a board game about hunting treasures around the Sea of Nadia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will dive into a fantasy land of 17th century where treasures are all over the islands of Sea of Nadia. And you will take a role of one of 4 captains - a rich but still crazy about gold merchant Phileas Maris, a brave lady Ruth Brand famous for her unpredictability, strong and explosive pirate Adrien Ackroyd, and sneaky bastard brought up by pirates Edmond Cantel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will take control of a hero and travel on a ship around the map, collect keys, open chests full of treasures, gain captain powers, get best merchant offers, cooperate with others to stop the most rich ones or maybe trick other hunters by messing their plans or even steal their keys or treasures and many more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To open chests you will need specific combinations of keys so the more luxurious is the chest - the more difficult it is to collect required keys and the more points you get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To improve your abilities and get great one time deals, you will be able to buy cards which give you permanent or temporary effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be careful and look at the compasses, as they will show you what is happening in the sea and will affect all of the players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- description from the designer, Alex Maklai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
