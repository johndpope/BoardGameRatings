							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Descriptions for Modern Zombies</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any modern zombie apocalypse game is going to need zombies. Rather than simply saying &amp;quot;You see a zombie&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;You see a lot of zombies&amp;quot; this supplement describes 100 different zombies in detail, from injuries to appearance to age and sex (although not ethnicity, so that they are generic enough to use anywhere).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zombies include children and the very young, and the descriptions may be too graphic for young players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A well dressed older woman with mostly grey hair that looks as if it was once expensively styled who is completely covered in blood, making it hard to determine how she has been damaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover, one the front matter and around half a page is the introduction and ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
