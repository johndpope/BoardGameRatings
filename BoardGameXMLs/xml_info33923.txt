							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek: Insurrection â€“ Son&#039;a Ambush Adventure</name>
									
			<description>This game was packaged with issue #46 (February 1999) of Inquest Gamer Magazine (the first issue after being renamed from just Inquest Magazine), and it is based on the movie Star Trek: Insurrection. Although it is designed for solo play, it allows a second player to control the Son'a.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as the crew of the Enterprise-E, and your goal is to guide the Ba'ku to safety. Inhibiting your progress are the Son'a and their drones which attempt to tag the Ba'ku, thus removing them from the board. You win the game if at least one of the Ba'ku makes it to safety. Combat in the game is resolved using a variant of the Icon System that is featured in Last Unicorn's Star Trek: The Next Generation RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
