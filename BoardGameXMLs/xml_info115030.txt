							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AFL Live</name>
									
			<description>AFL Live is a sports game in the AFL series of Australian rules football video games. It was developed by Big Ant Studios for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. It was released on 21 April 2011. Commentary is provided by Dennis Cometti and Brian Taylor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay has gone more in depth with the core mechanics. Some specific improvements include, faster ball movement and a more free flowing game, improved control and camera systems, and more scope for tactical adjustments. The possible addition of obscurities such as &amp;quot;behind the play&amp;quot; incidents will potentially add to the longevity of the gameplay experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 17 officially licensed AFL teams from the 2011 AFL season are included in the game. While it also features three extra teams, Victoria, Indigenous All Stars and an All Stars Team (Dream team) from the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;AFL Live&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
