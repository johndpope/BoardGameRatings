A version for the WiiWare service was released on September 22, 2011 in Europe and on October 13, 2011 in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can use the stylus and touch screen to test their reflexes in action mini-games like racing and skydiving, take on sporting events such as basketball, curling, and archery, strategize with tank and space combat games, or play match three, Sudoku, and jigsaw puzzles.
