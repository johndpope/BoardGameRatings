							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Labyrinth (1982)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the richest source of diamonds in the world, the long deserted mines of Prince Julian are rumoured to still hold much treasure. Legend also has it that help captive in the mines is the one who holds the key to world peace, prosperity, and good seats at the Superbowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dare you descend into the labyrinthian depths where many a brave adventurer has gone but never returned? Have you the courage to face the strange and terrifying creatures who guard those dark corridors where the walls are in constant motion, exposing entryways and sealing off exits? Perhaps you will be the lucky one who will return alive to tell us of the mysterious prisoner in the mines, and if the wealth they are believed to hold really exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
