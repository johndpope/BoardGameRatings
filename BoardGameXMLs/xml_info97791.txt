			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a side-scrolling brawler similar to Super Smash Brothers, but also uses mechanics that you would find in a dual-stick shooter. You can play with up to four people on the screen at one time, each attempting to blow up the others. There are five gametypes: Mission Mode (single story), Training Mode, Challenge Mode (single player vs enemy waves), Shooting Range (single player must shoot moving targets), and Multiplayer (up to four players either local or network.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can choose one of the anthropomorphic animals or bizarre looking humanoids. They were created by a down-on-his luck mad scientist that was commissioned by the military to produce a new type of warrior. The twelve default (and two downloadable) characters the player can choose from are the result of the scientist's machinations. There are eight original levels (and two downloadable) on which the battles take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
