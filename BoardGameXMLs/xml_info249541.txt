			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thunder of the falls is nearly deafening; the mist is nearly blinding. Even so, your mules seem cheerful as they pick their way up the narrow stone path. Another turn around the canyon, and before you stretch the great Mistrun Falls. It&amp;rsquo;s a breathtaking sight. But out of the houses&amp;rsquo; windows, there is smoke curling. And over the roar of the falls suddenly you hear screams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;K2: Assault on Mistrunner Village is a stealth or combat mission designed for player characters around 2nd level. In it, the players are thrown into a tumultuous conflict in a remote cliffside dwarf village, arriving at Mistrunner Village as an unscrupulous band of raiders led by an obsessive magician enact their assault. The players are offered the village&amp;rsquo;s treasures if they aid against the bandits, but there is an second threat up at the top of the village falls; a desperate shaman is scrambling to awaken the ancient guardians of the falls, little knowing that the gargoyles he&amp;rsquo;ll bring forth will try to kill villager and raider alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
