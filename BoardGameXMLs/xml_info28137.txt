			<description>(Translated from the box, in Norwegian)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your savings to the town which is full of funny stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are attempting to buy as many stores as possible. The more stores you own, the more money you may make. Your opponents do have to pay rent when they stop there! If you are really lucky, and stop by a traffic light, you do not have to pay rent on your next move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the stores have been bought, the player who first earns 30 coins wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
