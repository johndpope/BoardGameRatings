							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Evening Party Games: Clues â€“ Celebrities</name>
									
			<description>24 cards with a clue to a correct name are placed around the room. Players are given a card to record their answers and a time limit. When 'Time' is called, the player who returns to the party host with the most correct answers, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is undated but must have first appeared in the 1930's. The answer to the 2 example cards in the images are Norma Shearer and Bessie Love, both stars then but almost forgotten after WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
