			<description>Educational game based on stock market charting.  Players each have their own stock chart, created by the placement of tiles that depict stock chart patterns.  A player can play on his stock with a rising pattern, or play on his opponent's, with a declining pattern.  Not a bad way to learn about this 1960's technique of stock market analysis...don't know if it's still in vogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
