			<description>Join Julius and friends in a seek'n'find game on the high sea! Julius and his friends come to life in the first board game by Paul Frank for kids. Players race to find various images of their favorite characters from outer space, schoolyards, the shopping mall and the high seas. The winner is the first and fastest to find the hidden characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pull a card out of a pouch and then race to be the fastest to find the same picture on the board and place a token on it. The player who finds the most pictures wins in this fast-moving, quick-thinking game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parents watch children have fun exploring their creativity while developing fine motor and sequencing skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
