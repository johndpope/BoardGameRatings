			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the ninth book in the Loot 4 Less line, in which we deal exclusively with items that have a cost to consumer of 2,500 gp or less. And to increase the level of difficulty in terms of providing you with low-cost items, we also don&amp;rsquo;t deal in one-shot (or even two- or three-shot) magic items. Here in Volume IX: Bell, Book, &amp;amp; Candle, we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a narrow range of wondrous items that you ring, read, or light up. Many of these items are useful for spellcasters (in keeping with the origin of such items in myth and legend), but at least a few in each group can be useful to any character. Everything in these pages has no charges and can be used in adventure after adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, these items are all of real use. No spot-on-the-wall spells stored in a wand with a switch. We deal only in things that are of at least some practical use. No one is going to kill a teammate to take an everburning candle, but is that such a bad thing? These items can flesh out the equipment lists of low-level characters, can be found in treasure troves of mid-range monsters, or can be passed out as party favors at the celebrations of 30th-level wizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added bonus, to help make the vast category of &amp;ldquo;wondrous items&amp;rdquo; more diversified, some optional rules in this volume give various spellcasters advantages when making magic bells, books, or candles (as opposed to less interesting items that take the form of apparel or jewelry). These rules are not major power boosts or likely to come into play often, but they help make these classic icons of mystic power a little different from other wondrous items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
