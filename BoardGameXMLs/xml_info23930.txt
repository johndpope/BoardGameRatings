			<description>From the rule book:  &amp;quot;This is it,  your chance to be a star!  Epyx Head-On Football is designed to follow the same rules as professional football.  However,  you may make changes in the rules or adjustments in gameplay if it suits your needs.  With this game,  you're in charge,  you call all the shots.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2 player game that roughly simulates a game of American football.  There are two decks of cards which represent offensive and defensive plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The defensive cards have a red tinted window that line up 'decoder style' on the offensive card to reveal the outcome of the play.  Periodically the outcome will be &amp;quot;xx tape  xx&amp;quot; which means to activate the audio cassette tape included and listen to the &amp;quot;play by play action&amp;quot;.  The announcer will then tell you the outcome of the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the football pawn is moved down the board accordingly.  There are markers for keeping track of what down it is and the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice are used to determine the success of Field Goal and Punt attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest not rewinding the cassette tape until reaching the end of the tape,  thus keeping some level of randomness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;Audio cassette with over 200 highlight plays.&lt;br/&gt;20 Offensive formations and plays.&lt;br/&gt;12 Defensive plays.&lt;br/&gt;Game board&lt;br/&gt;6 sided die&lt;br/&gt;Offensive play holder (also marks scrimage line)&lt;br/&gt;Football pawn &lt;br/&gt;5 colored rings used for scoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
