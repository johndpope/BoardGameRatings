			<description>DeckPerception is a fun and interactive tabletop game in the classic tradition. Players use their powers of perception and deduction to make predictive guesses about their card--which they can't see but the other players can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3-4 players age 12 and up. Game play is 15-20 minutes. Game includes special DeckPerception cards, card holders, score sheets, pencil, and rules, packaged in an attractive and sturdy box. A great game for families, middle school and high school students, and adults (while enjoying adult beverages or otherwise).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is simple, highly interactive, and fun. Players are dealt one card each, which are placed in card holders so they can't see them but the other players can. Using the other players' cards, guesses, and reactions as clues, players use their skills of perception and deduction to predict the rank, the range, and eventually the number of their unseen card over several rounds of guessing. Guesses are marked on the included score sheets, which facilitate game play. At the end of the hand players look at their cards and receive points for correct guesses. The player with the most points after four hands wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
