			<description>&amp;quot;Skate or Die 2: The Search for Double Trouble is a skateboarding themed action/adventure game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, developed and published by Electronic Arts, who also developed the first game, which was ported by Konami's Ultra Games subsidiary. It is well known for successfully using digitized vocals and electric guitar in the opening theme (composed, along with the the rest of the game's music, by Rob Hubbard), rarely seen on the NES.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Skate or Die 2 is a side scrolling game, though the player can retrace his steps and return to areas he has seen before. The hero has a variety of skateboarding moves and weapons at his disposal, the controls for which can be programmed by the player. The hero's primary weapon is his paintball gun, though he can also throw eggs and firecrackers at his opponents. The game also has a bartering system. During the journey the hero can pick up CDs, cassette tapes, french fries, and tacos. These items can be traded with Rodney and Lester for new tricks and skateboards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Skate or Die 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
