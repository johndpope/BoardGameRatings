			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Bandit Kingdom Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boss is livin&amp;rsquo; fat and happy on the outskirts of the lands of Iuz. Boss Beare is a man of such stature (or, more appropriately, girth) that not much riles him, but growing troubles have been upsetting his digestion as of late. First is the increasing number of fledgling adventurers in Salfrayfields, piling up like cordwood on the woodpile because they&amp;rsquo;re not yet strong enough to venture farther into the Bandit Kingdoms. And on top of that, the Boss has lost a number of his men (and some of the villagers he is supposed to be protecting) to a series of animal attacks just north of the village. Boss Beare is looking for a solution that will cover his backside and ease his unsettled stomach, all while maintainin&amp;rsquo; his grip on this cushy job. He knows the shadows hold both the eyes of Iuz and the ears of the resistance, so he has to be careful in what he does. Maybe he can play his problems off against each other. It will be up to you to determine if Boss Beare will feast in peace, or remain badgered by problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one-round Bandit Kingdoms Introductory Adventure for 1st level characters only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
