			<description>On April 19, 1775, &amp;quot;The shot heard round the world&amp;quot; began a war for freedom. It took the American colonists eight (8) years to gain freedom from King George III of Great Britain. Noble men fought till death so that future generations of American-born citizens might have life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Revolutionary War-opoly commemorates twenty-two of the most recognizable battles and conflicts fought during the Revolutionary War. The battles are positioned chronologically on the board. While playing Revolutionary War-opoly, players will learn the location and essential information about each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this game is to increase the size of your army and conquer the battlefields. Each game consists of a board, 2 dice, tokens, 35 infantrymen, and 15 cavalry. There are American and British cards, battlefield cards for each battlefield, and enlistment rosters with different amounts of men to increase army size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
