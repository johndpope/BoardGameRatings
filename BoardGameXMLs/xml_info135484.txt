			<description>Each player takes role of one adept at final exam at Dargor Academy of Magic. The task is to find all six magic schools and become familiar with their teachings. Whoever reaches it first, is invited to the Council of Mages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, because the magic realm Hexane literally lives and its parts are constantly moving back and forth, it is not so easy to find a single building. Before the game, all hexagonal pieces of the world are randomly placed into a single hexagonal unit. Each player gets three magic cards and three wizards he controls. Magic card can be played only if the player masters the school of the magic card. At the end if some player disagree with the partial result, all wizards are placed in the middle of the board to compete in the final match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every move is accompanied by tension because wizards could end up trapped in a swamp, from where he can get out by throwing sixes. The player can choose any piece that moves with a given direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because it is a small world, there are many encounters between  individual wizards. Their rivalry triggers a fight at every meeting. Winner gets one card from the loser who must also return to the starting tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
