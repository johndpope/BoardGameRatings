			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinectimals is a launch title for the Xbox 360&amp;rsquo;s motion control peripheral the Kinect. The game, at its surface, is a pet simulator, but Kinectimals&amp;rsquo; gameplay separates itself from other pet simulators by utilizing the Kinect&amp;rsquo;s unique capabilities. The player interacts with one of over 20 wild cat cubs, and can name, train, and play with them in a controller-less environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name your Pet &amp;ndash; On of the first interactions the player has with their cub is naming it. After a short while the cat will start responding to their name, placing a bond between player and animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training &amp;ndash; The Kinectimals can be trained to perform a number of tricks by mimicking the actions of the player: if the player jumps, rolls over, or turns around the animal will copy them. Other orders will cause the pet to respond, such as telling it to get a jump rope resulting in the cat heading off screen to retrieve it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the Island &amp;ndash; The Kinectimals island is full of secrets and treasures to be found by you and your pet. As you wander the area, hidden items will be found that can be used to decorate your home or unlock new items and environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
