			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, full color battlemap of an Arabian Fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT) .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Shah slaughtered my trade caravan at Otrar. The Sultanate of Khwarezm will fall and I will execute the Shah for his treachery. Samarkand stands in my way to the Shah.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Genghis Khan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arabian Fortress 02 is an exterior map of an Arabian Fortress in a valley surrounded by mountains to the west and east. The valley has gorges that serve as a natural moat around the west, south, and east walls. Well-traveled paths with wooden bridges spanning the gorges circle the fortress leading to the south gate main entrance. There is a circular guard tower in the northeast part of the fortress and a large garrison building for troops in the southeast near the gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arabian Fortress 02 is intended for use in fantasy games. It can also be used in western games as a fortress in the southwest USA or Mexico. It could also be an archaic city in a modern game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Fortress Barring the Way to the Lands of the Setting Sun: Genghis Khan with his sons and greatest generals has invaded the Sultanate of Khwarezm. Genghis Khan wants the Shah dead and his Sultanate captured. Samarkand is the capital of the Sultanate and the last fortress along the Silk Road barring his main army into the center of Khwarezm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters can take control of Genghis Khan, his generals, and his sons as they lay siege to Samarkand using new tactics and siege weapons adapted from war with the Jin Dynasty. Or they can play the desperate Arabian defenders of Samarkand under siege and fighting out of loyalty to the Shah. They pray for reinforcements from the Shah&amp;rsquo;s army despite being dogged by Genghis&amp;rsquo; general Jebe&amp;rsquo;s small force dedicated to harassing him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
