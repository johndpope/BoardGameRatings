			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was developed as a series of forum posts, each one providing further elaboration or clarification.  Characters in the game are investigators sent to learn about a voodoo cult; in the process, they may well fall sway to the religious pull of the cult's practices.  The game uses a pack of French playing cards to introduce random events and also to resolve opposed actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By far the most intriguing part of the game, however, is the requirement that players wear marked T-shirts that function as their character sheets.  Throughout the game, markers are used to place additional items onto the T-shirt-cum-character-sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
