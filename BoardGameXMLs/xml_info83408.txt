							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noddy&#039;s First Board Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Noddy's birthday and he's having a party! He's going to town to buy all the things he needs. He must hurry, though. Sly &amp;amp; Gobbo, those Toyland troublemakers, will try to buy the party goods first, and ruin Noddy's plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young players move the game figures around the board, collecting objects to fill shopping lists. The colorful chance cards require no reading or number skills, and the simple rules allow for a perfect first board game experience!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duration of play: about 10 minutes per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect all the objects on their shopping list and return Noddy to his birthday party wins the game. It's a race against time, however, because if Sly &amp;amp; Gobbo finish their shopping list first, they ruin the party for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
