							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hollywood Monsters</name>
									
			<description>Hollywood Monsters is an adventure game by the Spanish developer Pendulo Studios which was released in 1997. The game received an indirect sequel in 2011 known in Spain as Hollywood Monsters 2 and internationally as The Next BIG Thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two journalists, Sue Bergman and Ron Ashman, are the protagonists of the game. The two work for a Los Angeles newspaper called The Quill but dislike each other and are bitter rivals. In the introductory scene we see the Quill editor telling Ron about a &amp;quot;Monsters' Ball&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;a social event where all the Hollywood movie monsters have a big party at the mansion of Otto Hanover, a film producer. The editor stresses that The Quill must cover the event because it is too important to miss. Ron is not enthusiastic, but when Sue comes in Ron tells the editor how important it is that The Quill sends its best reporter and that he is the only one capable of accomplishing the task. This has the expected effect: Sue proclaims that she is the best journalist The Quill has and that there is no way Ron could do a decent job. Sue then proceeds to the Hanover mansion in her little sports car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hollywood Monsters&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
