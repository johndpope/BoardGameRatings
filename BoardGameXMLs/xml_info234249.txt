			<description>It's holiday season, and the mouse has packed her backpack and wants to explore Germany. Help her plan and travel in Unterwegs in Deutschland!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan a route to reach the desired cities. With a little luck, you are the first to reach your goals. There is much to discover on the road: through the tricky questions of the quiz game, you will learn about the different regions of Germany. In the second game on the back, which is based on the memory principle, younger children from the age of 5 learn the federal states and their capital cities. Good travel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
