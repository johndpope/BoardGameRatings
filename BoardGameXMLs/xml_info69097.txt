							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atari 1200XL</name>
									
			<description>When the Atari 1200XL was released it was significantly more expensive than the earlier Atari 400 and Atari 800, but offered little more than expanded memory--64 KB versus the Atari 800's then 48 KB--to justify the price.  As a result, it did not sell as well as it's predecessors and was discontinued in 1983.  It's basic design lived on, forming the basis of the later Atari 600XL, 800XL, 1400XL, and 1450XLD systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User summary, info from Wikipedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
