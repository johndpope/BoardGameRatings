							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dart through the Amazon</name>
									
			<description>Playing as researchers on a quest for exotic specimens, Dart through the Amazon leads you through the world's largest rain forest to collect colorful dart frogs for scientific study. Racing against your fellow researchers, this expedition is no simple task, for amidst the Amazon, danger lurks around every bend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a 2-4 player dart frog collecting game, Dart through the Amazon  features two modes of play designed for both children and adults to enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base mode which is played without special rules and abilities offers younger children the opportunity to play the game. We also recommend this mode for beginners who are first learning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced mode of play features Researcher Cards that have their own special abilities adding new twists throughout the game. This mode is enabled by selecting one of our five Researchers before the game begins: Duke, Koral, Samuel, Tobias &amp;amp; Domingo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
