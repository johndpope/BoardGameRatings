			<description>Publisher summary&lt;br/&gt;Years ago, the world ended.&lt;br/&gt;Both of us survived. &lt;br/&gt;Both of us are walking across unpopulated lands. &lt;br/&gt;We don't walk alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Judge Comments&lt;br/&gt;I. Love. This. Game! I can see under the surface of &amp;ldquo;No Coincidence&amp;rdquo; the author&amp;rsquo;s clear vision and their uncompromising adherence to it. Everything about this game feels tight and deliberate and valuable. This is a game of shared memory and fleeting encounters, where the players of the game know less about themselves than the characters do. Beautiful, evocative writing paired with the simplest mechanics combine to make a stunning experience of a game, and one that I cannot wait to play over and over. - Daniel Adams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
