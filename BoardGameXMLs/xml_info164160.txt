A-10-10, or A-2-5 or A-A-10, anything like that.&lt;br/&gt; Jokers can be laid down on one at a time but not before you lays your first 3 of a kind.&lt;br/&gt; You may only lay when its your turn.&lt;br/&gt; When your turn comes you have to choose to take a card what's laid on the pile or take one from the deck, and must lay another card on the pile unless you can go out without laying.&lt;br/&gt;It is legal to go out on the first turn.&lt;br/&gt; A player cannot take the card on the discard pile on their first turn of the hand, and must draw a card before laying a 3 of a kind.&lt;br/&gt; Note: When you get caught with more points then you have as a overall score, you will be in the minus's.&lt;br/&gt;example: overall score is 50, you got caught with 110 pts.&lt;br/&gt;110-50 is 60 in the hole or -60. when you gain pts. next time, you have to use them to get out of the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
