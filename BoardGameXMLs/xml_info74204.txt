			<description>[From game manual]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, Scooby-doo and the rest of the Mystery, Inc. gang have been called upon to solve a bizarre mystery in a spooky place.  Daphne's long-time friend, Holly, desperately needs their help.  Very strange things have been happening in and around her family home, Mystic Manor.  Holly's uncle, the famous inventor Professor Alexander Graham. lives in the mansion, which overlooks a small fishing village.  The people from the village have all packed up their belongings and left town, because the whole area has been completely taken over by...Yikes... monsters!  Worst of all, Professor Graham has mysteriously disappeared without a trace!  Like, wow!  We're not afraid, right?  Wrong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
