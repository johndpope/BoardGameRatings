			<description>This has 108 cards: 76 single-letter, 30 double-letter, and 2 wild cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a 9-card hand, and on their turn they may:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) play as many 2+-letter words from their hand, scoring the sum of the values of the cards,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and/or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B) add 1 or more letters from the hand onto other players' words (without rearranging the other letters) to make new words, scoring the value of the cards played plus 2x the length of the new words formed;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C) discard as many cards from the hand as desired (instead of playing any cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are then drawn to fill out the hand to 9 cards again.  There is a bonus of 50 points for playing all 9 cards in a turn, or 100 if all 9 cards are in the same word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the goal (e.g. 300 total points) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are rules to use these cards to play word versions of: &lt;br/&gt;- 3 kinds of solitaire&lt;br/&gt;- 4 kinds of poker&lt;br/&gt;- Casino&lt;br/&gt;- Rummy&lt;br/&gt;- Anagrams &lt;br/&gt;- Memory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
