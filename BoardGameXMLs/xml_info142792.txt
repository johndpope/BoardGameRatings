			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You better watch out, you better not cry...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, the world was at war. The ruthless battles between greedy kings and their armies grew more destructive by the day as they vied for control of newly discovered lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one king went looking for reinforcements, he found a group of allies more powerful than any army he had encountered before. They were the mythological beings that were once thought to only exist in fairy tales. In the name of preserving the holidays and seasons they had come to represent, such legends as Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, and Mother Nature joined the fight, lending their aid to any who called upon them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villages: Holiday Pack includes 12 unique and powerful cards, one for each month of the year. Many of these cards were included as bonus cards in the base game, but now they're all here in one place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
