			<description>In Giraf'Fun players try to eat as many fruits with their giraffe until it's full and its neck is long. But watch out, or your giraffe has to go to the toilet and lose some of the fruits. The one who first makes it home with a full belly and a long neck wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn rolling the die and moving their giraffe. When they move onto a berry they can eat it. But if you roll toilet paper your giraffe has to go to the toilet and loose one of his berries again. Once a giraffe is full he must go to his own home. The one who first reaches his house wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
