							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Court</name>
									
			<description>Court is played by two people with a deck of 24 cards: four suits (Gold, Blue, Black and Red) each with six different cards. These Cards are ranked by value: Crown (10), Royal (8), Knight (3), Esquire (2), Standard (1) and Jester (no value).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two other cards of no value in each suit (Retainers and Serfs) available for a four player game. There also are rules for a three-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a hand of six, and a card is then turned to determine the Court color (trump) for that round. Players try to accumulate pairs that together will add up to a value of 60 or more. The winner of a round then gets one or more points, with the first to seven points declaring victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are somewhat complex, including ones covering use of a Jester to obtain another card, scoring for same color Crown and Royal, closing each round, and multiple victory points in a single round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
