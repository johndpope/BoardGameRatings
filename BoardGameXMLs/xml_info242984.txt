			<description>La Planche is an abstract press your luck game for 1 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;The board is divided in six zones, numbered from 1 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player roll a six-sided die and put one of his 6 tokens on the corresponding zone of the board, then he choses to continue rolling or to give the die to the player on his left. If the rolled die shows a number corresponding to a zone that already contains a token, the player who rolled the die takes all the tokens that are on the board, except those on zone 1 (tokens in zone 1 are blocked).&lt;br/&gt;The first player who get rid of all his tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
