							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bretta Valarez: The Queen Of The South Ward</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bretta is crazy. She&amp;rsquo;s just as likely to stab you as kiss you. While her methods may seem chaotic, every move she makes forwards her plans and strengthens her hold on the South Ward. Some people think the insanity is a front to fool enemies. Those people are wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Cache is a collection of characters designed to be used in tabletop RPG gaming, either as character concepts for players or as NPCs/villains by GMs. Artist Matt Morrow illustrates the character pieces, and Encoded Designs writes a system-neutral description, including how to incorporate this character into your campaign. These write-ups also include hooks for encounters and adventure inspiration, plus tags for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the system-neutral write-up are stat blocks for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fate Core&lt;br/&gt;    Savage Worlds&lt;br/&gt;    5e&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
