							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quad D.I.V.A.S.</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry I&amp;rsquo;m late. We used to have an already fine selection from all over Cygnar and beyond, but lately, the strangest stallholders have been pouring in. I just spent 2 hours in the market square, comparing prices for cabbages and lettuces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well really? And when did shoes become vegetables, too?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center of Corvis houses the famous Quad, a large market square, open day and night, where everything not too hot or heavy can be found. A myriad of stalls form a labyrinth for the squiggling mass of shoppers and tourists, all trying to get their share of the cut-price merchandise. Street-traders, hawkers and barrow-boys stroll around in between the different stands, offering even better deals from less reliable sources. &lt;br/&gt;And although the City Watch keeps a close eye on the trades and wares, once after dark many less-than-legal items can be seen changing hands underneath the counter, in the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a doomed effort to bring order to the chaos the Quad offers, the good folks of the Buccaneer Bass started a Descriptive Index of Vendors And Stalls (Divas) , partly to avoid the hassle of having to search for items on offer (and the best prices to be had), partly to offer that extra bit of service to our clientele, that&amp;rsquo;s been dropping in to inform on these matters more and more lately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
