							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pipsqueak</name>
									
			<description>Each player is given six dice.  All players roll one of their dice and hide it with their hand.  Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all pips on the dice rolled, e.g. &amp;quot;seven pips&amp;quot;. However, someone can always contest the bid, calling the bidder a pipsqueak. When that happens, all the dice are revealed, the pips are counted, and either the bidder or the caller loses their die, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
