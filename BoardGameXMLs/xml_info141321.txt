			<description>A taijitu is a symbol representing the balance between opposing forces. (For example, the Yin-Yang symbol is a taijitu.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also the name of this two player game set on an octagonal board made of hexagons. There are three types of pieces- player one's black pieces, player two's white pieces, and a type of piece both players can use that is grey. All of these pieces start in the center of the board, connected together. Along the eight sides of the board are scoring markers called Trigrams. The first player to land one of their pieces (never the grey ones) onto four of these Trigrams wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn is to take two actions, and an action is simply moving a piece they are allowed to move to any unoccupied adjacent space. A player is allowed to move either pieces of their color or grey pieces, but with these two cardinal rules: First, they are not allowed to move any grey pieces the other player moved on their previous turn, and, second, no piece may ever be separate from the rest of the pieces at the end of any action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player scores a Trigram, they flip the piece that landed on it to its other side, which now makes it a normal grey piece. This means as one player is winning, they will also have a more difficult time scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
