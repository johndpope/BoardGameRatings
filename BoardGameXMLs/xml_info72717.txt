			<description>A Warpspawn card game.  Players draw cards to acquire the foodstuffs necessary to cook &amp;quot;a meal fit for a king&amp;quot;; or else a commoner, as his majesty doesn't eat gruel and the hoi polli don't get to eat pomegranate.  Each of the more than 100 foods falls into a category, such as fish or drink or bread.  Each of the 20 recipes requires an appropriate number of foods from a category or several categories. Each recipe has a number of points which a player earns upon discarding the requisite food cards. First to get 100 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
