			<description>from What Is It?:&lt;br/&gt;Odyssey SEED is a rewrite of the Odyssey, the original Jovian Chronicles campaign published in the Green Book way back in 1993. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s where it all began. While it was an excellent campaign for its time, times have changed. The Jovian Chronicles universe has been fleshed out a lot since then, in the White and Blue books, and RPGs have developed a lot in ten years. So, just as the basic story of Gundam has been retold many times since the original Mobile Suit Gundam first aired over twenty years ago, with each incarnation building upon what had been learned in the development of the shows that cam before, I felt that it&amp;rsquo;d be worthwhile to rewrite and update the Odyssey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Assumptions &lt;br/&gt;The Odyssey SEED writeup assumes that the players are playing JAF exo-armor/fighter pilots, JIS agents, reporters, or one of the other standard archetypes. Some mix of the above three would work and could provide a good variety of skills, but this would also require the GM to put a wider variety of action in the episodes and possibly split the party more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from PDF Layout:&lt;br/&gt;This PDF is a re-cration of the web pages first posted by Nick in January, 2004. Everything is in here, for that professional JC look. With the re-emergance of such a classic adventure, it had to get the star treatment! Thanks Nick for the re-write and for letting me pump out this PDF for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:&lt;br/&gt;This is a compilation of parts 1 through 5 released as pull-out sections in Aurora:&lt;br/&gt;Odyssey: SEED: Episode #1: Dreams of Phantoms&lt;br/&gt;Odyssey: SEED: Episode #2: Dreams of Secrets&lt;br/&gt;Odyssey: SEED: Episode #3: Dreams of Freedom&lt;br/&gt;Odyssey: SEED: Episode #4: Dreams of War&lt;br/&gt;Odyssey: SEED: Episode #5: Dreams of Death&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
