			<description>The players have all arrived at the company as new employees, full of ambition and eager to work hard in order to dominate the company and rise up from a nobody to a somebody thanks to the admiration of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But to rise like a phoenix and transform into a dragon at the company, as everyone wants to do in Workaholic Liver War, you'll need to gain the cooperation of your colleagues while taking good advantage of your personal skills and random events inside the company walls. Experience in-fighting, develop a fantastic career, suffer from a burst liver due to all the stress and pressure, and ideally in the end get everyone else to bow to you respectfully...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
