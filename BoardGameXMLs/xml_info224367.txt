							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasci20: Characters</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once we were legends. Walking side by side with creatures of myth on far-flung worlds, soaring through the skies with ease and even mounting chariots that approached the realm of the Gods themselves. For his arrogance man was struck down and the Gods&amp;rsquo; fury scorched the world. Despite this grave punishment and the warnings of the Church of the True, there are those who persist in experimenting with machines, called &amp;ldquo;infernal tech&amp;rdquo; for weaponry and transportation. Even more disturbing to the Church are those who have embraced black magic and witchcraft. For these transgressions the Black Horde walk the land. Against these hordes heroes emerge, some using the very infernal tech the Church says has caused the Gods to visit another punishment on mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasci is about those who stand against the Black Horde. Heroes to the people, heretics to the church, they are the Men of Legend, the Heroes of Fantasci.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
