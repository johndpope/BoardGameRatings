			<description>With Creepstone Manor's notoriety on the rise, whole families have taken to staying at the hotel in the hopes of meeting its creepy denizens. Of course, Spookie is more than happy to oblige!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each guest in this expansion is part of a family. The top scarer on these guests not only gains points but will also get to keep the guest card. Players will score additional points at the end of the game based on how many members of each family they have collected and how rare guests in that family are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;- 12 Family Values Guest Cards &lt;br/&gt;- 1 Rules Card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
