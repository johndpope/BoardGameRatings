			<description>&amp;AElig;therverse: Upheaval. Upheaval is a new, fast-paced game of small skirmish combat, set in the cities of the parallel universes of &amp;AElig;therverse. Upheaval features an exciting campaign system, giving players new strategic choices as they guide a band of green troops through battle after battle, guiding their experiences and upgrading their abilities and equipment until they either become an elite force or are destroyed and replaced by new green troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available exclusively in digital download format, Upheaval is a 48-page PDF written by Jason Lauborough, designer of the original &amp;AElig;therverse and featuring art and fiction from the &amp;AElig;therverse print rulebook. The game leverages aspects of the revolutionary &amp;AElig;therverse army design system to provide a highly flexible upgrade path for units as they progress through the game. The gameplay portion of Upheaval features a revised and pared-down version of the &amp;AElig;therverse rules, optimized for small-skirmish play between two to four small units of troops (roughly 8-30 models per army).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upheaval is suitable for sci-fi play of military or &amp;quot;gang warfare&amp;quot; variety, historical and modern skirmishes, and fantasy war band campaigning. The PDF also contains options for adding even more detail to your campaigns, as well as providing rules for creating units that are already experienced, allowing for &amp;quot;one-off&amp;quot; games to be played between interesting armies without having to go through a full campaign system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upheaval's gameplay rules are ideal for 2-4 players, and the campaign system supports as many players as desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upheaval is fully supported by the Triskelegames.com website, including an active forum community, and will receive periodic free updates through the release of the semi-monthly &amp;AElig;thergate Newsletter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
