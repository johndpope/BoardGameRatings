			<description>TP Baseball gives you the opportunity to step into the shoes of your favorite team's manager and general manager and guide your team into the post-season and beyond.  Not only do you handle the on-field duties as the manager, using TP Baseball league rules lets you sign major league free agents, draft promising prospects, and make late season trades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TP Baseball uses three ten-sided dice, and will be quickly picked up by the experienced tabletop manager.  For those of you new to the experience, the game can be easily understood by just sitting down and playing a few games.  Nothing beats the hands-on experience.  The dice create a three digit number from 000 to 999.   Review the two players cards after the roll.  Results of 000-499 are read on the hitter's card and 500-999 are read on the pitcher's card.  Most results are explained easily right on the card.  A few may need the use of an outside chart, but after playing the game a couple times, most of the results should become second nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
