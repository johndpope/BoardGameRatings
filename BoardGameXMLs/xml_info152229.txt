			<description>Line or Colour is a combinatorial game for two players. Originally named Tangion (a contraction for Tangent+Tension), the game involves two perpendicular winning conditions that can tie players&amp;acute; brains in knots. It was derived from Domina 4 by adding a n-in-a-row victory condition and removing piece movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name was later changed to the more friendly Line or Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MATERIAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;49 rounded counters in 7 colours (7 each)&lt;br/&gt;25 white rings&lt;br/&gt;25 black rings&lt;br/&gt;The official edition includes a board for faster setup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 types of gameplay: basic and advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic version:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arrange 25 counters in 5 colours (5 each) in a square according to the figure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12345&lt;br/&gt;45123&lt;br/&gt;23451&lt;br/&gt;51234&lt;br/&gt;34512&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player 'White' (Starting player) takes all the white rings. Player 'Black' takes all the black rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with 'White' players alternate turns 'claiming' a counter by placing a ring of their colour on it. The pie rule is enabled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player either forms a row of at least 4 consecutive rings of his colour (orthogonal or diagonal) or has claimed 4 counters of the same colour. That player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced version:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arrange 49 counters in 7 colours (7 each) according to the figure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1234567&lt;br/&gt;6712345&lt;br/&gt;4567123&lt;br/&gt;2345671&lt;br/&gt;7123456&lt;br/&gt;5671234&lt;br/&gt;3456712&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Same rules apply, but a player wins by making a line of 5 or claiming 5 counters of the same colour. The pie rule doesn't seem to be necessary in this version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant for both versions: Arrange the counters randomly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AKNOWLEDGEMENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special thanks to Stephen Tavener for playtesting and Cameron Browne for playtesting and game name brainstorming, that unlocked its publication almost a year after its inception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
