							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The HitchHiker&#039;s Guide to Polaris</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Polaris RPG. This Guide is meant to be a general purpose introduction to the Polaris RPG universe. It contains a basic explanation of the rules, general information on skills, races and other game related data. The DM's Guide: All you ever Really Needed to Know About Hyperspace and Pan-Dimensional Travel takes a more in depth view of some of the particulars and explanations of the game&amp;rsquo;s plot, background and physics. If you are a player of Polaris RPG, we recommend that you do not read the DM's guide; it may generally spoil some of the fun of the game. This guide also assumes that you are marginally familiar with the genre of Role Playing Games as that it does not make an in depth explanation of what role playing is. If you have never player an RPG before, however, this may actually be a good place to start, since we are going to explain it to you like you are and idiot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
