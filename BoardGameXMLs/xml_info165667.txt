			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monstrous waves break against the rocks below, the rhythmic roaring of the ocean providing a backdrop to the confrontation. A lone figure stood with his back to the sea with five attackers closing on him with murderous intent. &amp;ldquo;Yer not fit for this world, fish!&amp;rdquo; jeered one of them. A rough gust of wind blew back the hood of the figure, revealing jet black eyes set into a shark-like face. A tooth-filled smile split his face ominously and he drew a wicked looking sword. The unruly gang hesitated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They had expected another young half-breed, inexperienced and easy prey. This one slid easily into a fighting stance. &amp;ldquo;Come at me, then, lads. Let me show you what a true Shark-blood is capable of.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all Lochivar&amp;rsquo;s creations, the Changed Ones known as &amp;ldquo;Shark-bloods&amp;rdquo; are by far the most relentless and the most singleminded. The archmage originally created them to act as water-borne hit-and-run soldiers to prey on Rekellian ships, but their ability to retain incredible focus over a long period of time made them ideal for a wide variety of tasks. Though the majority of them are still in service to the Black Hand there are many that have left the Jutar Wilds to seek a life of greater meaning than simple soldiering. These days, an encounter with a Shark-blood on the coast is almost an everyday occurrence for travellers. Though imbued with strong human traits they still retain much of their shark ancestors&amp;rsquo; appearance and demeanor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Freebie, we are opening our doors to the possibility of supporting the fastest growing incarnation of the oldest RPG in the world. Use this PDF to add an acquatic PC or NPC to your campaign or start a campaign focused around them. With three pages of content, get to know the Shark-bloods, part of a growing family of magically corrupted beings created by the mad wizard Lochivar! Prepare yourself for the Eiridia setting with this new race and three racial sub-types!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
