							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;Oosehe&quot;?</name>
									
			<description>A card game featuring lovely images of animals.Each player chooses a different animal, from the 8 listed on the Key Card.&lt;br/&gt;Cards are dealt out and kept by each player in a face-down stack. In his turn, a player must turn over the top card. If it matches any other face-up card, both players with the now matching cards must call &amp;quot;Oosehe&amp;quot;?, and name the animal now revealed. The first to do so, claims the matching cards plus all the cards beneath it.&lt;br/&gt;The rules are a little strange in that you are asked to call the name as listed on the Key Card but as this name is also on the cards, players could just read the card itself. Maybe Victorian children found these animals exotic and not instantly recognisable.&lt;br/&gt;The name of the game is pronounced &amp;quot;Oose he?&amp;quot;, as rhyming with the phrase &amp;quot;Whose He?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
