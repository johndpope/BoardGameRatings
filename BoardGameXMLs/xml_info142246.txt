							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gobbling Box</name>
									
			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You want your GOBBLER to eat as many dots as possible, while trying to avoid the ZONKERS who won't stop chasing your GOBBLER until one of them eats it or until the GOBBLER eats all dots on the GameBox. The GOBBLER's reward is a new Box; there's 3 in all. The GOBBLER can tame the ZONKERS for a short while by eating one of the ENERGIZERS on the board. Then it's the GOBBLER's turn to chase, catch and eat the ZONKERS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two skill levels; the pace is fast; the sound is great; the action is continuous. You can't beat this bargain of a game. Even Stacey plays it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fast-paced action arcade-type game runs on the TRS-80 Model I, III, and 4/4P/4D. The game generates a variety of special sound effects and music which complement the action on the screen. The arrow keys or Alpha Products joystick control the movements of the GOBBLER in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
