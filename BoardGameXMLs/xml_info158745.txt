							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Depression: The New Deal</name>
									
			<description>You are a governor of a state hard hit by the depression in the United States during the 1930s. You must work to implement new deal programs started by the Roosevelt administration. Achieve victory by building major civil works such as the Hoover Dam and the Triborough bridge. Each game, the goals are slightly different, but players compete to build infrastructure, raise their income, raise the morale of their people, and the player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are given a player board at the beginning of the game and you raise your income by buying program cards and taking on debt to help increase the morale of your people. You can build programs such as the civilian conservation corps and the civil works administration. Each card gives you benefits in terms of job creation, income increases, and increases (or sometimes decreases) in happiness.  Players have to choose between opening up more programs or using their money to decrease their debt and build large public works projects which give victory points at the end of the game.  Sometimes borrowing large sums of money pays off and sometimes it lands you in the poor house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
