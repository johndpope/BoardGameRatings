			<description>Antarctica is a cooperative game, in which the players are trying to protect four young animals on an ice floe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round, some of the ice melts, and the animals have to move further to feed. They are also threatened by hunters that are trying to shoot the seals and the penguins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players can deploy patrol vessels and helicopters to protect the animals against the hunters. When all animals are fully grown, the players win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
