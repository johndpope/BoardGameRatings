			<description>Poly-ingo is one of the games published in Math on a Roll, a book of number games using polyhedral dice.  In this bingo-based game, players choose either multiplication or addition and create 5x5 bingo-type cards using lists of numbers included in the book.  Players may choose the numbers on their cards and their positions on the card.  One player then rolls two dice (12 and 20-sided), calls out the sum or product and players mark that number if it appears on their card.  The first player to finish a row of five, vertical, horizontal or diagonal wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategy in this game comes from where the players choose to place numbers on their cards.  Since some numbers are more likely to be rolled, players may choose to place those numbers all in one row or column or in the center of the board where they can appear in horizontal, vertical or diagonal rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
