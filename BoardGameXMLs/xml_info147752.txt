			<description>Drag Race is a paper-and-pencil guessing game for two players. Players alternate choosing the letter A, B, or C (darkening a half-circle to indicate their choice) and guessing what their opponent has chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player 1 chooses a letter and Player 2 guesses what they chose. If Player 2 guesses correctly nothing happens. If Player 2 guesses incorrectly Player 1 gets to darken scoring squares (representing speed), with the number depending on how late in the game it is (the later, the more points scored). The object is to score as many squares as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the September/October 1978 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
