							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cads About Matrimony</name>
									
			<description>A card game that makes a mockery of one of civilization&amp;rsquo;s most sacred institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAD (noun)/ 'kad/: A witty charmer who behaves dishonorably and irresponsibly in matters of love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the spring of 2013, I was put in charge of games for my dear friend Nicky&amp;rsquo;s bachelorette party. Since I had no experience planning wedding party games, I went online to look for ideas, and found plenty of them that were extremely lame. I knew Nicky deserved better. I was playing a lot of Cards Against Humanity at the time, so was inspired to create a card game that honors the glorious institution that is matrimony, while also preparing my friend for the all frightening realities and ceremonial absurdity of humanity&amp;rsquo;s most fraught life-long commitment. The game I made for Nicky on my laptop and home printer was as hilarious, embarrassing, depraved, and satisfying as marriage itself. So I decided I should share it with everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple to play: one person reads a question or fill-in-the-blank card aloud to a group of friends. Each player then gives an answer card that they think best responds. The reader picks the response they like best. The questions and clues are both a parody and a celebration of all our bizarre cultural hang-ups around weddings and marriage, and funny enough to make champagne squirt out your nose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
