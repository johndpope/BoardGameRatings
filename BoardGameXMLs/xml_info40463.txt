			<description>On a player's turn, the dice are rolled to determine how many magnets must be moved to the center pit.  These are moved by means of the metal wand.  The required number of magnets must be dropped in the pit in a single trip -- if more or fewer magnets find their way to the pit in a single attempt the player scores no points.  Likewise, if the player drops any magnets along the way no points are scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnets are assigned 15, 10 or 5 points each, depending on their size (the larger the magnet, the more points it is worth).  The first player to 500 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
