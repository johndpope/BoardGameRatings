			<description>The game has a two sided laminated board with horse racing on one side and greyhound racing on the other. It's suitable for children as a traditional &amp;quot;first past the post&amp;quot; board game or adults can use it for gambling. Let's Go Racing parties, where a whole race card can be prepared with different distances and a choice of flat racing or over jumps, are becoming popular in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot; cards good and bad to add to the excitement and disappointment - &amp;quot;It's just Like Being at the Track&amp;quot;. There are three dice one of which is 20 sided used for determining the odds of individual animals in the race.&lt;br/&gt;One or two eight sided dice are used to roll and determine the number of spaces to move. The models of greyhounds and horses are die cast and brightly painted. There's also play money for the kids to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
