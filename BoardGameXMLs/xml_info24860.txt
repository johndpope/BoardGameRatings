			<description>In &amp;quot;Die diebischen Elstern&amp;quot; (=the thievish magpies) 2-4 players attempt to be the first player who can collect 6 different objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board size is 5x5 spaces. The space in the middle is neutral and the 24 other spaces show all 6 objects in the 4 colors of the players. Movement can be done to any adjacent space. If a player lands on an space of his color, he can take that object and put it on his scoreboard. If he lands on an space with another color, he can steal that object, if he does not have this object yet and if the affected player has it on his scoreboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very easy to learn, but not as easy to play as you would expect. It's difficult to concentrate on your own moves as well as on the possible moves of your opponents. And the fact that each object   shows up 4 times on the board, does not help reduce the confusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
