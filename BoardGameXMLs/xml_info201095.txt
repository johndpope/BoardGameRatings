							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 â€“ Albatros C.III</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Albatros C.III was one of the best German two-seaters of WW1. Created as a reconnaissance aircraft, it proved capable of undertaking a variety of roles: observation, light bombing, strafing ground targets, and escorting bombers. Introduced at the end of 1915, as an improvement of the successful earlier C.I model, it was produced in great numbers and used by many of Germany&amp;rsquo;s allies. Its construction was so robust it remained in service until the end of the war, some C.IIIs surviving even after the Armistice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albatros C.III (Bohme/Ladermacher)&lt;br/&gt;Erwin B&amp;ouml;hme was one of the great German aces, achieving his first victory in the Albatros C.III. He was unwillingly responsible for the tragic death of his friend, Oswald Boelcke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albatros C.III (Meinecke)&lt;br/&gt;When World War I started in 1914, Emil Meinecke joined the German Fliegertruppe and served first in Germany, then Turkey as an instructor and later as a combat pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albatros C.III (Luftstreitkr&amp;auml;fte)&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of C.IIIs were used in combat by the German Luftstreitkr&amp;auml;fte and until 1917, this airplane proved extremely useful both on the Western and Eastern Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each WW1 Wings of Glory&amp;reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
