			<description>The players will have to &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; some musical score with the help of some cards and following the musical rules. No need to know the music or to sing with Rythm 'n' Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the rules of the flat notes or the sharp notes to place the cards you draw. You have to use a Rythm card to draw some Play cards (maximum 4 cards). If during the player's turn the last Play card played is his, he could continue the musical score or win it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
