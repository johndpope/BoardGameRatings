			<description>Here comes the CAT FASHION SHOW! Dress your cats up and have them show off your fascinating costume design on the catwalk stage! Whoever earns the greatest fame after three fashion show seasons will be crowned the Master of Catwalk. But be alert! Don't let those copycats get all the fame out of cloning your masterpiece!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Copy Catwalk, players earn fame points by carefully playing their cat cards (number 0-10 plus three Copycat). Cat cards with higher number (more gorgeous costumes) win you some bonus, but only if no one play the same number as yours. Playing Copycat cards grants you no fame points, but they give you chances to copy other players scored costumes in the end of every season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage your cat cards carefully, predict your competitors' next move wisely, wish for the best luck using your Copycat, and you shall become the Master of Copy Catwalk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
