			<description>Writer Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yours is a path of destiny, of Legend. You have been chosen by an instrument of fate to perform great deeds. However, before you forge your Legend you must first prove your worth by undertaking the challenge of the Dungeon of Doom. Many have preceded you, few have returned. Do you have the skill, the endurance and the heart to overcome the labyrinth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon of Doom is a Dungeon Crawl for 4-6 adventurers of novice to seasoned skill level. It is intended to be a short scenario suitable for 3-4 sessions of play and as such can be placed in any campaign setting with little or no work required by the Games Master (GM). All that is required to play is the Legend core rulebook. All creature statistics are provided. While this adventure is written specifically for the Legend game system by Mongoose Publishing it can be easily converted to any percentile based game system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
