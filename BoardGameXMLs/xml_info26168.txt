			<description>London 1905. Alan Baddy, sinister and evil character, greatest exponent of organized crime, tenaciously chased by Scotland Yard for his terrible misdeeds, has gone back to his old ways. Which detective will first locate the building where Alan Baddy committed the crime, finding the incriminating proof?&lt;br/&gt; In this deductive game, first who plays Alan Baddy is randomly determined, the rest will play the astute detectives. The one playing Alan Baddy&amp;acute;s role will have to prepare the other elements of the game: decide in which building (11 pubs, restaurants and hotels altogether) the crime was committed, and assign the incriminatory proof (fingerprint, footprint and ring) of his crime to one of the buildings. All buildings will contain proof, but only one will contain the relevant ones with the required features.&lt;br/&gt; During the game the detectives will have to search the different buildings on the board gathering clues in every one of them and making notes of them in their &amp;quot;Detective Notes&amp;quot; sheets, followed by Alan Baddy who'll do everything in his/her power to frustrate their quest.&lt;br/&gt; The winner is that player who discovers in which building the crime was committed, contributing the proof which corroborates his/her hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
