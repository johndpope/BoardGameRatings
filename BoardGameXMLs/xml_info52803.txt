							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gary Gygax&#039;s Nation Builder</name>
									
			<description>Gygaxian Fantasy Worlds Volume VI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crafting of an imaginary realm from which real entertainment will spring is a serious undertaking.  Whatever its purpose, serving as the basis for role-playing game adventures or the setting of fictitious short stories or novels, the undertaking is a near Herculean one.  The author of such a fantastic place must meet many demands or else whatever follows from his handiwork will be found wanting.  This book is offered to the prospective creator of such a place in order to make the task of forming a nation from the stuff of make-believe a structured one, and thus easier to manage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nation Builder's primary focus is on the political, social and economic entities that comprise states in both modern realistic and fantastic settings.  Each subject is supported with an ongoing series of detailed examples and miniature case studies, so that Nation Builder can serve as both a guide to creating campaign settings and a ready-made sourcebook and sample milieu for writers, designers and the like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
