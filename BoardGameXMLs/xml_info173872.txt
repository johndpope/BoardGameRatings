							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">5 Fantasy Barkeeps, Volume I: Sources of Knowledge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often, the barkeep is little more than a two-dimensional construct, a blank slate meant to deliver information that directs the heroes towards other action. Before long, the barkeep becomes The Barkeep, an interchangeable piece of furniture just like the stools, tankards, and tables. Instead, bring the barkeep into the foreground. Use the five unusual figures here to have a fleshed-out figure at the ready and use their story hooks to tie them to the characters or tease the party in new directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the five barkeeps has a pair of hooks that could give them a direct, immediate connection to one of the PCs. Another pair of plot hooks attached to the barkeeps present quick story options to further develop the adventure for the entire party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 14-page supplement is suitable for any game system. It details the appearance, demeanor, and history of each barkeep along with information to add further depth and sow the seeds of potential storylines to invovle the PCs. All material can be easily placed in any fantasy setting you might choose to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Fantasy Barkeeps, Volume 1 can serve as a handy resource to serve up a unique NPC with only a moment's notice. There are also two handy tables for last minute information:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    20 Things Barely Overheard&lt;br/&gt;    6 Drink Specials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
