							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Imp Game</name>
									
			<description>For years, players of fantasy games have stormed the dungeons and strongholds of evil sorcerers, warlords, and just plain bad guys as heroes: knights, wizards, druids, paladins, and more. Heroically they have braved the darkest pits, the foulest creatures, and the most perilous of quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This, however, is not such a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Imp Game! Rather than taking on the role of one of these namby-pamby heroes, players in the Imp Game take on a much more entertaining role: that of the common, dungeon imp! Servants of a wannabe dark and quasi-evil overlord, players scour the world in search of items of power, foil the plots of &amp;ldquo;evil&amp;rdquo; Adventurers, and clean out the dungeons whenever needed, getting themselves into mess after mess with the only way out is to help each other!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Imp Game is a wonderfully hilarious game for 2 to 5 players of all ages. The Imp Game features a powerful &amp;quot;Failure&amp;quot; mechanic that captures the feeling of inept but stupidly lucky sidekicks, ensuring that success is inevitable, but who succeeds at what?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
