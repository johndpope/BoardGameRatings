Here be an adventure for the Honor + Intrigue Swashbuckling RPG system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of islands dot the Spanish Main. Though Spain&amp;rsquo;s influence crawls across the islands like a spider, dozens of islands lay undiscovered. In one island&amp;rsquo;s case, this is exactly how it is to be arranged. La Isla Castillo, or Castle Island, is home to dozens of prisoners, supposedly executed or lost at sea.
