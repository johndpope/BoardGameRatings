							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scrap</name>
									
			<description>You are the captain of a crew of workers, abandoned by your superiors on the planet Rhodon V, which you once mined for resources. Now, a cargo ship has crash landed nearby and its crew has offered a ride off of the planet to anyone able to repair their ship &amp;ndash; but you aren't the only one to respond to the distress beacon. Will you be the first player to collect all of the Repair Parts to fix the cargo ship and escape the planet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Scrap is to be the first player to collect three different Repair Parts and deliver them back to the Start Area. Repair Parts can be collected by passing over specific spaces on the board or by looting them from your opponents after defeating them in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player operates a unique vehicle, monstrous tank-like machines that have been constructed from salvaged mining and military equipment. Each vehicle starts with a special ability, different stats, and a set amount of upgrade slots. As players traverse the board, they will collect Resource Cards through different means, which are used to build upgrades, collect Unique Upgrades, trigger Events, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
