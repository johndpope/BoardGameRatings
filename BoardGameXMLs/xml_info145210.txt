			<description>Monsterland is a nice amusement park, but it's haunted by monsters after nightfall. Unfortunately, you and your friends didn't exit the park on time. The gates are closed and you are trapped in Monsterland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From this moment forth, it's all about getting through the night without getting scared senseless, but at the same time you need to scare the other players, because only ONE of you will exit Monsterland when the gates opens up again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsterland is an exciting and light tactical game for kids and families. To be successful in Monsterland you need both luck and skills, because you need to know when to play the right card from your hand, positioning yourself to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only one real winner in Monsterland - the player lucky enough to get through the night, yet still able to keep closest to the gates. All the other players will be turned- and forever live their lives as monsters...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn of the game, a player must either:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Try to scare another player with a monster card&lt;br/&gt;2. Calm one self down with a consolation card&lt;br/&gt;3. Pass turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scare cards played on other players forces them to move backwards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consolation cards gives a player courage to move forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defend cards (can only be played when attacked by another player) counteracts attacks (to some degree).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special cards such as the most powerful scare card; The Vampire, can be completely blocked by the special card; Garlic etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the route there are also some hiding places, in which players are immune to attacks while staying there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is illustrated by Carsten Gjerl&amp;oslash;v - &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://raevestreger.dk/pageGB/frontpage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://raevestreger.dk/pageGB/frontpage.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
