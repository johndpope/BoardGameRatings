							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Xanth Quest</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Board and Card game for 2+ players. Based on the Xanth series by Piers Anthony.&amp;quot; Particularly inspired by the first Xanth novel, A Spell for Chameleon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a track 63 spaces long, with each space being large enough to hold a card. The middle space is the Gap Chasm. Each time a player lands on an empty space, a card is drawn. A Challenge Card represents an encounter or event that must be resolved. A Location Card is left on the space occupied by the player who drew the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: Be the first player to get your pawn to the end space and then back to the Starting space. (It&amp;rsquo;s a race game.) This represents a quest involving a trek across the dangerous wilderness of Xanth.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
