			<description>Panic Restaurant, known in Japan as Wanpaku Kokkun no Gourmet World (わんぱくコックンのグルメワールド), is a 1992 platform video game developed by EIM and published by Taito for the NES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Panic Restaurant is a platform game that stars a chef named Cookie who must navigate through his own restaurant, which has been cursed by a rival chef named Ohdove. Cookie has to battle evil food monsters with kitchen utensil weapons before taking on Ohdove in a final battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 6 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Japanese to English&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Title screen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In USA title screen the background was changed to Black. In Japanese version you can see &amp;quot;Disco/Taito 1992&amp;quot;, in USA - &amp;quot;Taito 1992&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Hero&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Japanese version, the hero is a chef named Naughty Kokkun. In the U.S. version the hero is Cookie, whose appearance was modeled after Chef Boyardee. In the Japanese version, Kokkun's head was the default weapon, while in the version released in the United States the Clobber Pan was default weapon. In the U.S. version the best weapon was the Wacky Pan, which didn't exist in Japanese version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Villain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese name of the villain was &amp;quot;Hors D'Oeuvre.&amp;quot; This naturally resulted in some linguistic confusion, in transliterating a French name to Japanese and back into English. Thus the Western game's villain was compromisingly renamed Ohdove (or in some sources O'Dove).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Panic Restaurant&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
