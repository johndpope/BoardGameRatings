			<description>From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Void is an Exciting fast paced miniature tabletop battle system for 2 or more players. The game is set in a universe where the homeworlds of Viridia, Ironglass and Prime battle for colonies in the farthest reaches of the galaxy. VASA, the policing boby of panhumanic space, tries to keep in check the ambitions of the imperialistic homeworlds. However with the emergence of the Koralon what remains to be seen is whether humanity can put aside its petty rivalry or whether mankind will become another victim of the aliens.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Void is played in turns, split in phases. In the third phase players take turns activating a squad and completing one order for the squad. Once all squads have completed their orders a new turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory conditions vary and are choosen before play starts. examples include; Annihilation of opponent, Most Survivors, Most Damage, Objectives, Scenarios or Time Limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build armies before game play starts based on a agreed upon point limit from army lists provided in rules.&lt;br/&gt;500 points a couple hours&lt;br/&gt;1000-1500 a afternoon&lt;br/&gt;3000+ a full day&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented By Void 1.1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
