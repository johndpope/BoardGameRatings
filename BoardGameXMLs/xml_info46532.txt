							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Transformers (Revenge of the Fallen) Missile Mania</name>
									
			<description>The game comes with 8 Transformer pawns (4 Autobots and 4 Decepticons), 8 plastic bases, 2 plastic missiles, and 2 &amp;quot;More than Meets the Eye&amp;quot; dice. The pawns must be assembled before the game is played. The pawns consist of cardboard standups that can be flipped between &amp;quot;Robot&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Vehicle&amp;quot; mode. There are 2 different ways to play the game -- one is a very simple dexterity game, while the Advanced game adds movement, die-rolling, and a couple of other wrinkles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Basic game, players line up their Transformers in a row, one pawn on each base, about 1 missile length apart and about 4 missile lengths from the other player's Transformers.  The players simultaneously slide their missiles across the floor or table, trying to knock down the other player's units. The first one to knock down all 4 opposing units wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Advanced game, the sequence of play is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player may convert one unit between Robot and Vehicle mode. Only units in Vehicle mode can move.&lt;br/&gt;2  Each player rolls his special die, which he first secretly sets to Robot or Vehicle mode.  If he has no units in a mode, he can't use it. The die results allow movement, extra shots, protection from enemy shots, or repair of a previously hit unit.&lt;br/&gt;3. The players slide their missiles, trying to knock over enemy units. They must slide from behind their closest unit to the other side.  Based on the die results, a player may shoot once, twice, or not at all.&lt;br/&gt;4. First one to knock over all the enemy units at once wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
