			<description>This is created to commemorate the forgotten heroes who devoted their lives to defend Hong Kong from the Japanese invasion in December 1941.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's an operational wargame for 2 players. One player plays as Major General Takeo Ito, the commander of the Japanese 38th Division while the other player plays as Major General Christopher Maltby, the overall commander in Hong Kong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a card-driven system. Players take turns to play cards to move their units on map &amp;amp; use cards to add strength in combat. Game units are company-size and one turn represents one day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese 38th Division is strong. The Allied player must use their weaker force to delay the invasion as long as possible while keeping casualty to minimal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
