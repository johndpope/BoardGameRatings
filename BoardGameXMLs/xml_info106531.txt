			<description>A game where children learn the basis rules of the movement law. It starts with recognising the traffic signs and later on the meaning. Afterwards the child learns what it must do when the traffic is controlled by a traffic light or a police officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is represented in the game with a bicycle. During the game a player has to visit several destinations. On his way the player has to recognise traffic signs or react to different traffic situations: stop when the light is red, ... The first player who has reached 5 destinations is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
