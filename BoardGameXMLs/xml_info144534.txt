			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How far will you go to get what you want?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this role-playing game, the characters are people, not mutants or monsters or elves. However, they are driven people, willing to break the most fundamental laws of reality to achieve their goals. They know how to summon, bind, and command demons. But demons are dangerous, transgressive beings, who demand a Price for the power they lend ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your character commands unimaginable, horrific power with a mind of its own. Can you handle it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete role-playing system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story creation. This is your instrument. Its rules are built specifically for you - the whole group - to create the most powerful, entertaining story possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No wasted motion. Conflicts are resolved with a fast, fun, and innovative dice system, well-suited to all aspects of interaction, violence, and sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flexibility and creativity. Full guidelines permit you to customize the premise into your own, unique vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now including extensive annotations based on fifteen years of winning awards, breaking new ground, showcasing success in independent publishing, and setting standards for clear and effective design, Sorcerer is the same as it always was - a game for today. You've never seen role-playing like this before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
