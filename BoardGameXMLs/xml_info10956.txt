			<description>Taken from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Boom Box you are challenged in balancing your Boom Box right and left audio channels. Boom Box can be played by 2 or more players at the same time: each player just needs the supplied deck of 27 cards (print and cut them); the faster the player gets rid of his cards, the better! The cards represent different notes in three different colours and different lengths. After each player has flipped over the first card from their decks (this card representing the Boom Box itself), they must play their cards to the left or right of the radio, respecting these two easy rules: if you want to place a card on the Boom Box left channel, this card does not have to have any characteristic in common - number of notes, colour, length - with the preceding one; on the other hand, if you want to place a card on the Boom Box right channel, it must have at least one thing in common with the previous one. It is easy, isn't it? But what if the goal is to have the same number of cards on the left and on the right? Things get interesting and slightly harder, but funnier as well! Challenge your friends in this fast competition, and you will see! As soon as cards are placed, players draw new ones from their decks: when a deck is emptied, the round is over and points are scored. After three rounds, the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
