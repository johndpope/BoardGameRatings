							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seii Taishogun: Sengoku Karuto</name>
									
			<description>Seii Taishogun: Sengoku Karuto is the seventh title available in Small Box Games' Pure Card Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sengoku Karuto loosely borrows from the theme and mechanics of one of Small Box Games' most popular games, Seii Taishogun.  Players are rival daimyo in Sengoku era Japan attempting to cleverly outwit eachother to gain control of various locations scattered across Japan's four main islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the original, each card represents one to three (1-3) samurai belonging to one of four clans and one of the following locations: temple, pagoda, or castle on one of the four islands of Japan.  Players secretly assemble armies comprised of Samurai from one of four clans to conquer new locations.  Armies constructed of Samurai from the same clan are more powerful than armies using various clans.  Additionally, players can persuade locations to rally under their banners or attempt to conquer another player's locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are awarded points at the end of the game for the locations they've conquered, with additional points being awarded when various conditions are met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
