			<description>A ward is a member of a noble clan who has been taken in by another clan to be raised for a time. The practice varies, with it sometimes being undertaken voluntarily - to help prospective heirs learn the customs of other clans as part of their education. It can also be involuntarily, with the &amp;quot;ward&amp;quot; actually being a &amp;quot;hostage&amp;quot; for his or her clan's good behaviour or until a ransom is paid. Sometimes, as part of marriage alliances, one of the betrothed is taken as a ward so he or she can get to know his or her future spouse. IIju is not Dragon but Hare, although his loyalty to the Takashi is unquestioned, he is the head of the Takashi household guard whom follow his orders without hesitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister contains one model, one 30mm base and one full colour profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
