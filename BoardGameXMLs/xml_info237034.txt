			<description>A One-Round Tournament for Six Dwarven PCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four days ago, during evening services at the Hall of Clangeddin Silverbeard, Father of Battle, His sacred axes began to drip blood. The omen was clear: Enemies were coming, and dwarven axes would soon run red with the blood of those who would threaten Citadel Rockhearth. Preparations were made for war, and last night the enemy showed his face at the gates of your stronghold. The enemy was no stranger to any of you. Duergar. Gray dwarves whose twisted existence is an affront to dwarvenkind. The initial attack was poorly executed, and if they had hoped for surprise, that hope turned on them when a force of 3,000 mountain dwarf warriors marched out to meet them in the open caverns. Badly outnumbered and openly exposed, the invaders have been annihilated beneath your feet. Despite your obvious supremacy the Duergar forces have not backed down and each encounter has been a hard won struggle against the uncharacteristically bold gray dwarves. The battle has raged through the night and into the morning. Though the outcome has never been in doubt, the Duergar have made an uncommonly worthy account of themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
