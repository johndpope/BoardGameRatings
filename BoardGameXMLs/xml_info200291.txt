							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manatech</name>
									
			<description>Manatech is a 1-4 player, cooperative, action-adventure game that features real-time elements, modular levels and dice-assignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world of destined kings, daring rogues and scheming evils, mages and magic creatures were once hunted to near extinction. Through rebellion, struggle, and fate, the mana-laden were able to overthrow their oppressors and, over time, build a sprawling metropolis. Now, with these past events all but forgotten, their ancient oppressors have risen again in the form of the Iltheria Corporation. It's up to your band of rebels and warriors to infiltrate the Iltheria Corporation and foil their plans once again. Manatech is played by moving standees through a series of room tiles and rolling dice to pass challenges. The game is won when your scenario specific objectives are completed. Your objectives will take you all around the corporate tower, and force you to face auto turrets, laser walls, and the corporate security team. This modular, corporate espionage game uses a combination of timed player turns and dice assigning to create tense, strategic gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
