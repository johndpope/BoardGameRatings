			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of STAR TREK III, based on the original NBC television show and major motion picture feature. The program you have purchased is the number one best-selling Star Trek computer game. This is not an arcade type of game; it's a game of luck, a little skill, and a lot of judgment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the commander of the Star Ship Enterprise. Omega VI is an unexplored area of the galaxy. It is known to have several class M (Earth type) planets, several large stars and black holes, a pulsar, and star bases. It has recently been invaded by Klingon warships. Other than that, little more is known about Omega VI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. You are to explore the entire Omega VI region of the galaxy and to collect as much data about it as you can in your ship's computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. You are to locate all of the class M planets in the Omega VI region. After locating these planets, you will orbit them so landing parties can be beamed down to collect more detailed information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. You will stop the Klingon invasion of Omega VI by destroying all of the Klingon warships located in this area of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. You must complete you mission and return to Star Fleet Command no later than star date 2500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
