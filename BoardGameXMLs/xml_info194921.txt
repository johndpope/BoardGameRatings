							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alpha Bet</name>
									
			<description>In Alpha Bet players take turns writing words in a shared grid. Each player has three copies of the alphabet to draw letters from, plus an additional copy of the alphabet and pool of vowels available to all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player creates a word they first write it down in a separate area and bet points per letter. Their opponents then write down letters they think will appear in this word and also make per-letter bets. The player will gain the points bet for letters no opponent guesses and lose them for guessed letters; their opponents gain points for correct guesses and lose them for incorrect guesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
