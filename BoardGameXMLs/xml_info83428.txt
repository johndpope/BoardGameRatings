			<description>The board depicts a ship with seven hatches. Around it, there is a course of fields, some of which have special symbols. The hatches are covered with tiles. These hide characters from the Disney movie.&lt;br/&gt;The players roll dice and move around the course. The goal is to collect a set of three cards depicting Ariel's friends, then go onto the ship and flip over hatch tiles. When a hatch tile shows one of the friends, another hatch tile can be flipped over. When the witch appears, the player has to start collecting cards again. When the prince appears, the game ends and the active player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;While circling the ship, special symbol fields enable the players to draw cards, move forward etc.  When a player reaches a field where (an)other player(s) is/are, he/she can steal a card from each of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
