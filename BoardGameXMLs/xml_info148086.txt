							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robespierre: the game of the French Revolution</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;- Sire, sorry to bother you ...&lt;br/&gt;- What's so important?&lt;br/&gt;- The populace has assaulted the Bastille, Sire&lt;br/&gt;- And you wake me up to me by a simple revolt?&lt;br/&gt;- It is not a revolt, Majesty, is a revolution &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;(Versailles, July 14, 1789)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Louis XVI, timid, indolent and absolute monarch of France, advised by his finance minister Jacques Necker, has summoned the States General, aiming to enlist the support of all sectors of society to reorganize public finances and prevent the imminent bankruptcy because of the ruinous state of the royal Treasury . However during the first sessions of the States General things go wrong and irresolvable disagreements arise between the aristocracy, the intransigent minority reluctant to lose their privileges, and representatives of the &amp;quot;third state&amp;quot;, the vast majority of society, who demands equal rights, freedom and dignity. As a result, after a few days frustration and outrage spread across France to the cry of &amp;quot;liberty, equality, fraternity&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Robespierre players assume the role of the different warring factions during the French Revolution. All intrigue for themselves, according to their individual ideology and interests, yet sometimes are forced to cooperate to safeguard the gains of the Revolution against the reactionaries and against the retaliation of the Imperial powers which, from the borders, threaten to invade France to restore the old regime...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robespierre, a political game of hidden identities in French Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief description of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Robespierre, the players take on the roles of factions during the French Revolution. At the beginning each player receives one identity tile face down and keeps it secretly until the end of the game. Each faction has a different victory condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his/her turn the active player reveals a event tile and performs one avaliable special action. Then he/she can do actions in the four areas of power: the Press, the Government, the Assembly and the Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Press: the active player may write journalistic articles ant take cards from the deck. The cards are an important tool in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Governement: The player may accuse any other faction of being disaffected toward the Revolution by playing an accusation token at the symbol of this faction in the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Assembly: the active player may vote on one Law (card Law) by playing cards face down on it. The other players may vote or not in clockwise order. If the law is approved, its effects are applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Army: the active player attack the reactionaries or the Sans Culottes in France, or to attack a foreign province if the war has been declared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may end immediately by achievement of individual victory of a faction. For example, the Monarchist player wins if the Royalist Conspiracy marker reaches the end of the track, or if the reactionaries conquer the Paris region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no player gets his individual victory, the game is over after three terms of office, and then the players count earned victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
