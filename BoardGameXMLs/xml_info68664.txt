			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first installment in the Project Shrine Maiden series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Highly Responsive to Prayers is a variant on the Break out (Arkanoid) type of game. On screen, there is a collection of bricks/blocks. A ball is bouncing around the screen, and the player should try to deflect the ball so that it hits the blocks, destroying them.&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the Arkanoid type of game, where one side of the screen has no walls, and the player controls a &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot; that hinders the ball from exiting the screen, in Highly Responsive to Prayers, there are walls on all four directions, so the ball cannot exit the screen at all. Instead, it bounces around with a downward gravity, and the player controls a small shrine maiden on the floor, who can move sideways and shoot talismans upwards, hitting the ball and giving it momentum. If the ball hits the player, he loses a life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ball's upwards (bouncing) momentum decreases a bit with each bounce, but the ball's sideways momentum doesn't decrease naturally. So if the player fails to hit the ball and it stops bouncing, it will soon simply roll sideways, killing the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 20 screens to clear, with a boss on stage 10 and 20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
