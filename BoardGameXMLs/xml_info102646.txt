							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adventures of Luther Arkwright</name>
									
			<description>From the Foreward of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever thought that there might be a conspiracy out there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone, or Something, really behind IT ALL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manipulating everything. Wars, politics, the weather, advertising (especially advertising), the clothes you wear, the average length of hair, TV and Rock and Roll - the WHOLE PICTURE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is. They are called the Disruptors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it's Okay. Luther Arkwright defeated them. We're safe now. And the tale was told in three graphic novels by Bryan Talbot - Luther's chronicler on this Parallel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's Parallel as in Parallel Earth. The Disruptors were not after just our little corner of all Creation, not by a long shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had is easy, really. No dangerously subtle manipulation of the religions on our Parallel, no supposedly accidental Eco-disasters, no Bio-engineered diseases with insidious social side effects, no tendency to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a minority who are in turn controlled...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which makes it easy to relax. To play a game such as this. To take part in a strange and terrible conflict. To smash the conspiracy, tear away the mask, reveal and destroy the hidden forces manipulating those other Earths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Multiverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
