			<description>From Hypothermia #15:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hailstorm is a quick, easy, luck-based game intended to feel vaguely like craps or roulette.  If Icehouse pieces are the new playing cards, then perhaps this shall be the first of many games that will be played in the casinos of the future, when people who enjoy losing money when they play will be able to do so while playing with pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It requires drawing pieces out of a bag, and dropping them.  If it end up pointing straight up, you get the piece.  If it land flat, you get any pieces it is pointing at.  THe first person to complete a tree of a single color wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Betting rules are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
