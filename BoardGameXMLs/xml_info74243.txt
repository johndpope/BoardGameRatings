							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happy Sheep</name>
									
			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Sunday, you and your relatives meet at your dear Aunt Dolly&amp;rsquo;s place for tea and cupcakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dolly is a mad-keen knitter, whipping up a cosy garment every week. It's your job to supply her with the wool from her flock of happy sheep; the fleece of four sheep will meet her needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, she only wants wool of one colour- either black or white. And since her sheepdog Fang ran off with a Bichon Frise last year, those four sheep will need to be within arms reach for you to gather them in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the one who gathers the four sheep first, thereby winning Aunt Dolly&amp;rsquo;s biggest smile- and the biggest scone?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Sheep is a fast, fun game of strategy, memory and bluffing. It takes 15 seconds to set up, two minutes to learn, and five minutes to stop laughing when you trick someone into crying &amp;quot;Happy Sheep&amp;quot; and proving they don&amp;rsquo;t know black from white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes strategies for gamers and a simple variant for very young kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play: &lt;br/&gt;Mix the 20 tiles (10 black, 10 white) face down and form them into a 4x5 flock. On their turn, a player slides out one tile and looks at it. If it's one of the 4 show-off sheep, they show everyone and put it back in the same place. Otherwise, they may rejoin the sheep to the flock face-down wherever they please.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as any player thinks they know where four sheep of the same colour are in a 2x2 group, they yell &amp;quot;Happy Sheep&amp;quot; and turn over the four tiles. If they're right, they win; if not, they're out and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It sounds simple, but with other players moving tiles, bluffing and sabotaging, it's easy to get beaten to the win or tricked into calling incorrectly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For strategic players, the backs of the tiles come in with and without daisies, so by some careful calculation it is possible to improve your decisions...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
