							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tomb-World of Alak-Ammur</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even within the deepest recesses of history&amp;rsquo;s own heart, one cannot find a sorcerer more powerful nor infamous than the man known as Alak-Ammur. His origins lie hidden behind a veil of lies and half-truths so thick that it is useless to even speak of them. Know simply this, that Alak-Ammur grew strong in the ways of arcane lore as easily and quickly as other men take to breathing fresh air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few were surprised, even in his own time--or at least all records seem to indicate--when Alak-Ammur disappeared mysteriously. Most of his kinsmen and peers assumed that he had died, although in truth he had neither kinsmen nor peers. But assumptions about men like Alak-Ammur are so often wrong that it hardly seems worth relating that they were.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But they were.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sorcerer left the world of his birth and explored the myriad worlds beyond. He lived for a thousand more years than his fellows knew, for he never returned to that place he had once called home. When it came time for him to die--when his body could no longer continue to house his spirit--he used his magic to fashion a tomb for himself. But Alak-Ammur&amp;rsquo;s tomb would be no more a normal crypt than he was a normal man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;True to his nature--and his nature was power, pure and simple--Alak-Ammur crafted for himself a world in which to put his physical form to eternal rest. Not a large world, as world&amp;rsquo;s go, but truly an entire world as distinct and unreachable from any other world as, well, another world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one could find this tomb-world, surely it would hold great secrets, it would solve vast mysteries, and it would make one wealthy and powerful beyond imagining. If such a deed could be done at all--and survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tomb-World of Alak-Ammur is a mini-adventure for 12th-level PCs written by legendary designer Monte Cook. Originally released through Dungeonaday.com, this PDF is 32 pages and comes completely linked and bookmarked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
