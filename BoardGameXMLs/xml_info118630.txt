			<description>FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Authentic Content&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight Night Champion showcases the truest graphical representation of the sport, lifestyle, and culture of boxing with authentic and dynamic blood, realistic body damage and deformation, and mature content throughout. The first ever mature content EA SPORTS title is able to show you the truest effects that come from a 12 round Heavyweight slug fest, and a rapid-fire Welterweight battle.  Bruising, blood and cuts have never looked and felt so real, so get ready to experience the violence and brutality that is true to the trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captivating Champion Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EA SPORTS brings you their first  story-based game mode inspired by classic boxing movies provides hours of captivating and emotional gameplay. Step in the shoes of up-and-coming middleweight contender Andre Bishop and experience the trials and tribulations of working your way to the top of the boxing world battling inside and outside the ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full Spectrum Punch Control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control your boxer&amp;rsquo;s punches with precision and accuracy like never before with a new synergy of gameplay controls. From overhand punches to strategic counter jabs and one-punch knockouts, overwhelm your opponents with your refined skill set. There&amp;rsquo;s no more need for complicated analogue-stick gestures, you simply flick the stick to the left or the right at different angles to throw every punch in the game.  There are a LOT more punches to throw with a variety of straights, overhand hooks, hooks, hooker-cuts and upper-cuts.  Gone is the old-school arcady haymaker. This year we&amp;rsquo;ve introduced the &amp;lsquo;heavy punch modifier&amp;rsquo; that lets you sit down on your punch and add a little more power, including to your jab and your straight (something you&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to do in Fight Night). If analogue punching isn&amp;rsquo;t your thing, there are 6 controller figurations that include button control.  So while we hope you take the time to learn and master the Full Spectrum Punch Control, know that you can switch back to button controls to feel the difference for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physics-Based Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move around the ring and time your attacks with precision. Building off the best-in-class gameplay engine featured in Fight Night Round 4, you now have an even wider range of abilities when it comes to counterattacks, setting up combos, and attacking your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every boxer needs to start somewhere, and in Legacy Mode we are starting you in the amateurs!  We&amp;rsquo;re bringing amateur boxing gear, and amateur scoring to give you the truest taste of working your way to making money in the pros.  As you fight your way into the pros, take bigger fights against tough opponents for the chance to win a larger purse.  Loose that battle and get beat up bad, you can be sure that the damage will have long-term effects on your body, so be weary as you progress through your career.&lt;br/&gt;If you start winning some of these battles, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to unlock certain training venues around the world, and go train in places like Philly and Big Bear to train on specific areas of your game. Training and fighting will earn you valuable XP Points to allot points to different skills including combinations, blocking, and head movement.  Check out our Pre-Order page to find out how you can get a serious head start on creating your exclusive custom boxer through the Everlast XP Boost Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All-new Online Gyms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create an online gym with your friends and battle it out to see who&amp;rsquo;s the ultimate champion, or turn boxing into a team sport and challenge other gyms in Rival Matches to unlock items, win trophies, XP and more.
