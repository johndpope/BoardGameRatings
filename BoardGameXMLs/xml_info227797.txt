			<description>Bag yourself a rich guy (or a loser) in this free PNP push-your-luck dating game for 2 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Golddiggers, you play the role of a Digger; an unlady-like lady who wants to bag herself a rich guy; a Gold guy. In order to get your Gold, you have to try and impress them at a number of social events hosted by yourself and your competitors. Fail to impress the Golds, and your only option will be a big, fat Loser!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the character of one of the women. Each round one of the players turns open a new event card and each of the players picks one of their talents to try and impress the Gold guys with. Then each player rolls a dice so see how succesfull they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever gets the richest guys wins, but the more wealthy a Gold is, the harder it is to get them, and the more risk you run of ending up with the loser, so choose well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
