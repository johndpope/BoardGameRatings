			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of Mayhem just got commuter friendly (although I suppose that depends on who&amp;rsquo;s along for the ride)! Re-enact your favorite epic superhero and action-star battles at high speed with &amp;lsquo;Mayhem Rail&amp;rsquo;. Finally we have a subway train and all the accoutrements to attach to those &amp;lsquo;Streets of Mayhem&amp;rsquo; rail tiles! Mayhem fanatics REJOICE! This electrifying modelset expansion to Mayhem is Scott Reid&amp;rsquo;s first release at WorldWorks Games and we can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how proud we are to have a talent like his onboard. This is just the start of a promising line-up of work from this talented creator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Mayhem Rail&amp;rsquo; offers gamers a unique opportunity to play both inside and out of subway cars and more importantly you can build as many train cars as you want for pennies! With fully removable roofing and incredible WWG caliber detail in every train car, you&amp;rsquo;ll be astounded by the realism and grit shown in these models. Every detail is represented right down to the &amp;ldquo;questionable&amp;rdquo; seating, the sticky handrails, the garbage strewn flooring and those oh so entertaining dubious in-car ads. ;) Both clean and graffiti versions are represented giving you the option to dress your train cars in a suitable grim for those neglected corners of your city or shinny and new for the more civilized parts of town. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there; Scott even included raised subway station platforms for your citizens to board at each stop! Tie that all together with a number of props and custom ground tiles and you have yourself a fantastic addition to your growing city! The action possibilities are endless, just think of the chaos you can create with this one addition to Mayhem!&lt;br/&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s include with Mayhem Rail? Here&amp;rsquo;s the big breakdown:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subway Platforms&lt;br/&gt;          o 1-inch, 1.5-inch and no-grid versions are all represented&lt;br/&gt;          o Optional platform roofing&lt;br/&gt;          o Platform ramps&lt;br/&gt;          o Platform bikerack (with bikes in 8 colors!)&lt;br/&gt;          o Platform ticket machines&lt;br/&gt;          o Platform benches&lt;br/&gt;          o Steel Support columns&lt;br/&gt;          o Station street signage &lt;br/&gt;      Rail Add-ons&lt;br/&gt;          o Exclusive &amp;ldquo;down&amp;rdquo; rail tile leading to the future &amp;lsquo;Mayhem Subway&amp;rsquo; expansion&lt;br/&gt;          o Rail signal posts with ladder and crowsnest attachments&lt;br/&gt;          o Freestanding grey cinder block walls with and without graffiti and posters! &lt;br/&gt;      Subway Cars&lt;br/&gt;          o Both &amp;ldquo;Graffiti&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Clean&amp;rdquo; versions of rail cars are supplied&lt;br/&gt;          o &amp;ldquo;Graffiti&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Clean&amp;rdquo; windows transparencies&lt;br/&gt;          o Driver compartment with control panel, seat and cabinet separator&lt;br/&gt;          o 6&amp;rdquo;X3&amp;rdquo; Passenger compartments with hand rails and seating&lt;br/&gt;          o Removable roofing elements&lt;br/&gt;          o Fully detailed undercarriage for those &amp;ldquo;Hollywood derailings&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;          o Working doors!&lt;br/&gt;          o Train mounted destination markers&lt;br/&gt;          o And as always this product comes with fully detailed step-by-step photographed instructions to guide you through the building process&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
