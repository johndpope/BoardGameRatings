			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A One-Shot Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with OSRIC, 1E and 2E game systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for 4-6 player characters of levels 6 to 8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago the brave knight Inara Marteen, Paladin of the Light, sacrificed herself to save this world. She lost her life leading her holy order&amp;rsquo;s charge against an invading horde of demons from the Planes of Hell. Inara fell in combat, where she single-handedly defeated the demon lord known as Soul Eater, driving it and its infernal minions back through their demon gate. There in the fires of Hell, banished for 100 years, Soul Eater sat and stewed on its defeat at the hands of the warrior maiden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A century has passed since that fateful battle and now, free from the bonds of banishment, Soul Eater has returned to this plane to exact its vengeance, first upon Inara and then upon this realm! Finding her tomb, the demon and its minions set about to defile it and destroy her rest, and her legacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon waking from her well deserved eternal rest, Inara&amp;rsquo;s spirit is angry, defiant and seeking vengeance of its own! Sensing a party of goodly adventurers near her barrow mound, her spirit has reached out to you, worthy adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you save this realm from demon invasion and help a noble knight to rest in peace?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you answer the Eternal Knight's call?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains a completely original ONE SHOT adventure, fully detailed and ready for immediate use with very little preparation by the GM or the players! A quick night of role-playing fun right at your fingertips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find amazing Old-school style art and a completely detailed map in the Old School blue &amp;amp; white style, with detailed encounters for each area! This module also includes a fully detailed map of THE RED EAGLE BARONY done in the Old School style, and complete with information on geography, local settlements, defenses, and areas for further exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure includes a carefully crafted set of SIX PREGENERATED CHARACTERS, ready for immediate use in the game by players or the GM. Each of the six players is presented fully ready to play with all of the necessary stats and gear. As a BONUS, these PCs are specially laid out so the GM can simply print out the page, cut out the sheets, hand them out and the players will be ready to go with their own handy mini character sheet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also include special addendums with detailed listings of all NEW MAGIC ITEMS, a NEW OSR SPELL and a NEW MONSTER, the Demon Lord Soul Eater, whose true name is Drizildour&amp;rsquo;ahkbane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module provides wonderful background information and additional areas for adventure for those GM&amp;rsquo;s setting their campaigns in the author&amp;rsquo;s ever expanding campaign world, which now comprises three different kingdoms: Jarlburgh, Alderburgh and The Red Eagle Barony. This adventure&amp;rsquo;s exploration of Inara Marteen&amp;rsquo;s barrow mound takes place just east of the village of Breyburgh, the site of the Starry Knight Press module S3 The Way O&amp;rsquo; The Fae (available for purchase on DrivethruRPG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book features 15 pages of excitement and thrills, with multiple areas to expand your adventures, and it is sure to please discerning GMs and players everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
