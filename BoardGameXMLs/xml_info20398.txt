							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blow Your Nose</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Instant fun game which can be played at home, in the bar, in the office - anywhere&amp;quot; This addictive, cult game, originally designed for children but quickly hi-jacked by adult game fanatics as a table-top, bar and party game, is now available with DRINKING RULES. The game is simply played by blowing your 'noses' through a series of numbered hoops, the rules being similar to the game of croquet, but it is not as easy as it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
