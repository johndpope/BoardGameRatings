			<description>(from the back of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Give him back that ticket!&lt;br/&gt;Ever since September 1960, when the very first parking ticket was given to an unsuspecting Doctor on call.  It has been a global game not to get a ticket.&lt;br/&gt;Now the game has come to life and you can &amp;quot;Give him back that ticket!&amp;quot;  Over thirty years later and the game is still being played on the streets.  Even if you have never had a parking ticket, Beat the Traffic Warden will appeal to all as a fun, spirited and enjoyable board game.  It is not a game of pure chance, you need skill, tactical risk taking and determination to beat the Traffic Warden.&lt;br/&gt;A game that generates great excitement and may bring out the rebel in you!  It's a game we can all relate to.  Feel really good handing the tickets back to the Traffic Warden, or get a great buzz from playing the Warden and handing out tickets yourself.  Whatever side suits your personality.  Beat the Traffic Warden makes the impossible possible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functionally, this is a straight-forward roll-and-move Monopoly game, but with a player-controlled adversary to add extra interaction to the game.  The plastic bits are very nice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
