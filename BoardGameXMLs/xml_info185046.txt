			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fallen Barony was published by a manufacturer of a line of weapons, armors, and equipment for Live-Action Role-Playing.  As such, the game has a fairly heavy emphasis on arms, armor, and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters belong to a House, have 10 Health Points and, if of the Elfkin race, have 10 Energy Points.  Characters select a class from a list of two:  Shadowmages or Lightmages.  Characters may being play with whatever equipment they carry (with some restrictions based on Rank).  Characters begin with two Skills, each at Level 1 (Skill Levels range from 1-5).  Characters also may cast spells (called Shards).  Characters gain one Experience Point for each event they attend and may spend these Experience Points to gain new Skills or Shards, or to improve a current Skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules document explains the various Houses and their structure and function within the game, and has a lengthy section on setting, history, and society.  Several types of weapon also are noted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the rules are not credited to any person or persons, they do state they are based &amp;quot;...on the Novel of Mark Harm.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
