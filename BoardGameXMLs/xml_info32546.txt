							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dunbar</name>
									
			<description>Fourth wargaming entry in a series of games about the English Civil War, by the same designer/company, it depicts one of the more important victories obtained by Cromwell, this time against the Scots in the so called Third Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a simple but neat variation on SPI Thirty Years War system (adding a chit drawning activation mechanism for the leader, so making the classic Igo-Ygo system more re-playable and extremely fun even for solitaire play), Dunbar is an easy to learn (4 pages of rules) introductive or lunch-hour challenge boardgame, coming with a 2 A4 full color map and 93 full color counters, with silhouettes of the leaders and the armies that fought this battle.&lt;br/&gt;If the basic system takes in account a no ZOCs movement, combat and morale (victory is based on routing the enemy army), optional rules add facing, command radius and cavalry charges, making the challenge tactically more complex (but still very easy even for a novice to the wargaming world)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is avalaible for print &amp;amp; play through wargamedownloads.com and as a laser-printed DTP through Noble Knight Games, Boulder Games, and directly through the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
