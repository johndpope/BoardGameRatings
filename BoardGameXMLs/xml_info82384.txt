			<description>Tranz Am is a ZX Spectrum video game released by Ultimate Play The Game in 1983. The game was one of the very few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves driving around America, much reduced in size, collecting eight trophies, avoiding natural hazards and kamikaze cars which attempt to crash into the player. Other hazards include a limited supply of fuel, which can be topped up by driving over petrol pumps. The game was written by Chris Stamper and Tim Stamper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tranz Am&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
