							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Origins: “Fleshed Out” PnP Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The goals of this expansion are to flesh out some of the abstracted technologies within the original Origins (e.g. Obsidian, Iron, Roads) and to avoid the problems of a cycle of &amp;ldquo;nothing to do&amp;rdquo; turns that can happen in some games. The other consequence of this expansion is that geography plays a much larger role after Era I and well into Era IV (which seems to be keeping with the intended theme given Phil&amp;rsquo;s Jared Diamond references). England is well placed to become a powerhouse in Era III and China can no longer be ignored. With a good foothold, the New World has great growth potential. Finally, before this expansion, in many games, Era II only lasted 2-3 turns despite representing over 30 ky and this expansion hopes to make Era II more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important: This expansion assumes use of the Age of Reason Expansion (Era IV) and does not use the Animal Farm Expansion (playing from American Megafauna) but can likely be easily adapted and can use the alternate brain maps or be played after Bios Megafauna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;- 25 Map Hex Overlays: Featured on the overlays are new resources to be&lt;br/&gt;exploited (including Coal, Jade and Trade Crops), a new south Pacific Route to&lt;br/&gt;the New World and the Toba Event.&lt;br/&gt;- 10 New Innovation and Population Actions: Including Interbreeding, Emissaries&lt;br/&gt;and Publication.&lt;br/&gt;- 9 Infrastructure Track Overlays: With new Infrastructure bonuses including&lt;br/&gt;Clipper Ships, Organic Farming and Paved Roads.&lt;br/&gt;- 2 Full Color Player Guides: Includes all the new Actions, along with a Terrain&lt;br/&gt;Guide, Selected Glossary and Slavery Rules. The Color makes it much easier to&lt;br/&gt;read (at least for me).&lt;br/&gt;- A Detailed Manual: Includes Wikipedia based footnotes in the style of the&lt;br/&gt;original manual.&lt;br/&gt;- Rules for porting the game over to High Frontier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
