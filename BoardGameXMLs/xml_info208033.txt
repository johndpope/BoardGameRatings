							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LOLZ: The Gift of Laughter! – The Original VOL 2</name>
									
			<description>Gameplay in LOLZ: The Gift of Laughter! is team based. A player from each team will place a &amp;quot;Mouthis&amp;quot; around their lips, pulling their lips back and making pronunciation difficult. That player will then attempt to reach a few words from the card they have drawn. They may repeat themselves as often as they would like and must get their teammate(s) to correctly guess the words they are trying to pronounce within 30 seconds. Afterwards the opposing team takes a turn. The first to five or ten points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
