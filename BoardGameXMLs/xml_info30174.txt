			<description>From the Instruction folder:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;CHECK-O is an exciting new game, designed to entertain every member of the family.  Two, three or four people can play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Action takes place on a board with traditional checker-squares on it, separated so that red squares touch red squares at diagonal corners and similarly, white squares touch white squares at diagonal corners.  Moves by players are made diagonally.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of the game is to capture opponents' men by leap-frogging over them until the checkers of only one player remain.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It will be noted that there is a big square area in the center of the board.  Wings extend in four directions giving the playing area the shape of a cross.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;CHECK-O is a direct descendant of the ancient game of Checkers, devised over 5,000 years ago by the Egyptian Pharoahs (sic), so history tells us.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When the Roman soldiers conquered Egypt, they took home many souvenirs of their exploits in North Africa.  Among these was the game of Checkers.  Even in ancient times, moves were made in the same way - diagonally across the board - and each player faced his opponent with twelve men.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;CHECK-O, though similar to Checkers, is faster-moving and gives more opportunity for strategy.  This is especially true in CHECK-O DOUBLES when each player must out-plan and out-think three opponents who are coming towards him from three different directions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
