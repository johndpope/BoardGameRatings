							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chariot Arena</name>
									
			<description>Chariot Arena is a Grim Trojan board game based on the chariot races of Roman times and the first of Grim Trojan&amp;rsquo;s Downloadable Board Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To keep the game fun for different levels and ages of players, optional rules have been created (the alternate rules follow the official rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This board game is very loosely based on historical records about chariot races. With that said, never forget the game is a board game and as such has been modified to keep game play fun. The arena is based (again, loosely) on Rome&amp;rsquo;s largest and oldest circus, Circus Maximus (called a circus because of the oval shape).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacks are allowed to simulate the whipping and bumping that occurred in a chariot race and the curves are more dangerous in the board game because they were in the real races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chariot Arena has two different playing boards to allow for better game play. The larger board comprised of four pages&lt;br/&gt;with smaller hexes was designed for a larger group of players and for those who enjoy longer more detailed game play. The&lt;br/&gt;smaller board comprised of two pages with larger hexes is designed to allow a smaller number of players to have more&lt;br/&gt;interaction in few laps and its charts are less complicated. Try both and play the one that best suits your style of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As each player takes their turn, they must first move their pawn 6 hexes. They then have the option to stay where they are or roll 2d6 (two six sided dice) and moving their pawn across the board one hex at a time the number of hexes shown on the dice. Movement can be forward left, forward right or forward. Moving a pawn backward on the track is not permitted. Only one&lt;br/&gt;pawn can occupy a hex at a time. If a pawn is in your way, you must move around it. The player also has the option to move&lt;br/&gt;the pawn less hexes than indicated on the dice (example: a player rolling 10 can move only 7 hexes if they wish). If a pawn&amp;rsquo;s path is blocked by other pawns and it is impossible to move forward while moving the base 6 hexes, the player must choose which pawn to stop behind. The player and the owner of the other pawn must both roll from the Accident Chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
