							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WCW vs. NWO: World Tour</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;WCW vs nWo: World Tour is a professional wrestling video game released in 1997 for the Nintendo 64 game console. The game was THQ's first foray into the Nintendo 64 wrestling scene and is a semi sequel to the lesser known WCW vs. The World for the PlayStation. In the beginning, Asmik Ace and AKI began producing a wrestling game that was similar to Puroresu and fighting games for WCW. The game was very well received due to its tight construction and ease of play, especially compared to Acclaim's comparatively more difficult and convoluted game, WWF War Zone.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WCW_vs._nWo_World_Tour,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
