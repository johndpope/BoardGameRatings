			<description>Box Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sneak 'N Peek is a one or two player hide and seek game designed to be played on the Atari Video Computer System or the Sears Video Arcade. There are four variations of the basic game and two levels of difficulty to increase your enjoyment and test your skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sneak 'N Peek is played in and around a spooky old house with a large yard and three weird rooms. Each room, including the yard, is a separate scene, and contains up to five hiding places. Some of them are in really strange places, and some of the locations can change depending on the game you select.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game always begins in the living room with player one standing in the corner and covering his eyes. Player two may sneak to any of the five hiding places in the living room or exit through the door to another scene. A timer keeps track of how long it takes the player to hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a friend isn't available to play, the computer will be happy to hide from you. It knows all of the hiding places and is very sneaky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
