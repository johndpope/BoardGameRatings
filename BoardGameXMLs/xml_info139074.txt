			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter the game, whatever the game system, they all have one thing in common. They exist in a world, which in itself, is contained in a universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some also say there is more than one universe, the so-called Multi-verse theory. What is different is the details of the universe and plane in which it resides&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your players have started asking difficult questions. What are the rules of the plane we heading to? Does the universe have borders, does time work the same way, with many, many more decisions being needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is where the Multi-Verse Kit (MVK) comes in. The MVK is a series of random charts to help generate ideas, fill in blanks or simple give basic details about the areas in which your players roam. Using a top-down approach, the MVK will cover the building-blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MVK is done in separate parts, so you can take what you want from it. Just need ideas about making a new planet? Need some quick details about the plane you are heading to? Just use the part you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MVK is system-generic and, for the most part, suitable for fantasy &amp;amp; sci-fi settings. You may get weird results, but work with it, as it help generate some of the most memorable places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system presented here can be used to design planets and system for the players to visit, or even to provide details about their home system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
