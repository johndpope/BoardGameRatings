			<description>Lucie is a little mouse whose stomach is making gurgling noises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Lucie, it is time to stock up. So, she has to get out of her hole and explore the house to find cheese. To feed her whole family, she really needs to find lots and lots of cheese and&amp;hellip; the more the better!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So she is now ready to get these delicious small golden cubes. But be careful as mousetraps are scattered all over the house. And above all, Minou, the big cat of the house, is ready to jump over her and to munch her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Lucie, you are a small mouse ready to do anything for delicious cheese. &lt;br/&gt;Now go hunting but do not forget to get back into your hole in time. Otherwise, you can lose everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you get out of your hole, you draw the first card from the pile and you place the face-up card in front of you.  Now it is time for you to make a decision with what you have on your card or just because you like taking some risks.&lt;br/&gt;Either you go back into your hole with your precious cheese or you draw a new card to get more.&lt;br/&gt;If your decision is to draw a new card, you will be facing the same options: either you go back into your hole or you keep on drawing.&lt;br/&gt;You can then keep on drawing, but be careful! If you draw at least 3 cats or 3 mousetraps successively, you will be caught and all the cards you have drawn during that round will be lost. They will then be the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;If you decide to go back into your hole, you will get back the cards you have drawn during that round. Pile these cards, face down, in front of you. From now on, these cards will always be yours. Once your turn is over, the player on your left can start playing.&lt;br/&gt;The game is over as soon as all the cards are drawn. Each mouse counts the bits of cheese she has on her own cards. To win, you must have more cheese than the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two variants are included in the game :&lt;br/&gt;-cards Dog and cards Discreet mouse &lt;br/&gt;-six role cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
