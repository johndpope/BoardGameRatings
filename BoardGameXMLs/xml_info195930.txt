			<description>In this survival co-op, you and your crewmates find yourselves in the middle of an ocean on an alien world after a mishap during interstellar travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 30 days a planet-wide storm will knock out all communications. You need to find three islands and repair the rescue beacons that were launched when your spacecraft was destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your exploration you are as likely to find unwelcoming creatures as helpful items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decide how to use your stats, abilities, and dice allocation to face these challenges, and the challenge of propelling your watercraft through this ocean, and activate the distress signal. Otherwise, you will likely suffer the fate of this planet's previous inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
