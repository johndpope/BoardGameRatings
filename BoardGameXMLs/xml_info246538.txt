			<description>The time is ripe for some gold old-fashioned family fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant three to six players around the table and let the mayhem begin as you race to plant the most crops and reap the most point.  Fill your fields with wheat, oats, corn or beans.  But watch out for those pesky crickets, because they'll devour everything in their path-unless, of course, you enlist the help of the famously faithful seagulls.  You could also be hit by other hazards, like a wildfire or even a drought so dry the cows are giving evaporated milk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And while it's a good idea to love your neighbor, watch out: he or she might just send come crickets your way.  And don't forget that others can use a Helping Hand card to help themselves to your hand!  When the dust finally settles, you're sure to find a harvest of fun for everyone with Crickets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 5 cards each, on your turn you draw one card and play a card. Play crops on one of your two fields, trying to fill it with five crop cards. Upon harvest, shuffle 4 of the cards back in the draw pile and keep one for scoring purposes.  A player can also play crickets on each other's fields to cause the player to have crops eaten each turn. Play immediately cards have a black border and happen immediately and are things like fires and sick seagulls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to 30 points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
