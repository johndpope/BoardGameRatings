			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tales have often been whispered of a singular and terrifying lifeform called the Hlorg. Reputedly, this bizarre creature &amp;ndash; considered by many to be no more than a legend told by crazy outposters in 3space &amp;ndash; has the ability to consume any carbon-based matter&amp;hellip;  including the hull of a ship, or an entire planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through whatever means &amp;ndash; perhaps never to be known &amp;ndash; a disgusting, amorphous, non-destructible Hlorg finds its way onto the PCs&amp;rsquo; ship, or into a facility under the PCs&amp;rsquo; care. It may have been microscopically small at the time of transfer; it may have been inside a food shipment, stuck to someone&amp;rsquo;s shoe or caught in a draft bringing it through an airlock.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs must deal with an unwanted visitor onboard their vessel - one that might eat everything in sight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLUTTONY is a DayTrippers Adventure from the GOLDEN AGE ADVENTURES anthology.  If you have that book, you don't need this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DayTrippers uses a descriptive scale which can easily be converted to other game systems.  Conversions are included for 2-12, 1-20, PbtA and percentage-based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
