			<description>Founders: A More Perfect Union is a trivia-plot game for 2-3 players or teams. Each turn involves roll and play, as well as the possibility of play cards.&lt;br/&gt;     Each player has authored a draft of the Constitution that contains the principles and protections necessary to unify the states. However, in order to present the draft at the Constitutional Convention, each author, must convince a certain number of states to join his or her delegation in support of the draft. Once the delegation is large enough, the author can travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and present the draft before the convention in Independence Hall.  If you are successful in persuading the convention in your favor, your draft is ratified and becomes the Constitution of the United States! Players will have to study up to prove to these learned delegates will test your knowledge and  reason before choosing to give you their support.&lt;br/&gt;Answer trivia questions to get your state cards necessary to go to Philadelphia, but be careful, another player might have the play cards needed to steal a member of your delegation, or just send them packing home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
