			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Through the Looking Glass, a free set of role-playing game rules.  The game is what it is: simply a personal project released for the comment of fellow gamers.  These rules are essentially genreless, rather than generic, and have been basically designed for use in a modern setting.  Additionally, a set of rules for generating characters with parapsychological talents has been included, but these rules could be converted to cover magic, genetic modification, cybernetics or a host of other possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were developed around two design philosophies: First, the creation of players&amp;rsquo; characters should be based around personalities, should stretch the players' ability to take on new and different roles, and emphasise more than a simple set of statistics; Second, the game mechanics need to be simple, yet flexible enough to allow the referee to show their own role-playing (rather than rules-mastering) skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
