			<description>Game Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Enclave (ZE) is a free, solitaire game of survival on a Earth dominated by Zombies: while designed as a solitaire game you can easily play ZE with two (multiplayer rules are included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the game is the Refuge (the Enclave in the game title), the place where you're trying to defend yourself from the zombie attacks, accumulating enough resources in order to gain some additional weeks of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game with a very simple, undefended Refuge and then you will have to plan how to protect your Survivors by adding the many &amp;quot;defenses&amp;quot; available. &amp;quot;Defenses&amp;quot; can be holes, wall reinforcements, explosive barrels, traps and so on: the idea is to replicate the full spectrum of iconic scenes seen in the zombie movies. The game sequence can then be summarized as: gain new resources, spend resources to improve your Refuge, wait for the enemy attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies will be managed with a &amp;quot;buildup pool&amp;quot;: every turn you draw a buildup chit and apply the results (normally new zombies arriving) while an &amp;quot;Attack!&amp;quot; marker will initiate the combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During combat the zombies will move from the upper part of the map (the external defenses) toward your Refuge: the Defenses will try to slow and/or damage the zombies but it's up to the Survivors to close the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of rules, the game will include a set of Standard Rules, with basic tasks and a good set of available resources to start with. Several scenarios will make possible a quick start of the game with not only your Refuge, but also an external defensive wall and a bunch of resource points that you can spend during setup to prepare your initial defenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules will add more details (like Vehicles and Events), and finally the Campaign game will make possible to start really from zero, with just you and Soldier, your invaluable dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
