			<description>Wage War in the Steampunk Apocalypse&lt;br/&gt;The world has changed. Over a hundred years have passed after the American War for Independence was interrupted by the opening of the first rift and the Legion of Damned poured though. Humanity was facing extinction at the hands of the demonic and undead. Finally the Angelics arrived and set a stop to the expansion of the rifts and halted the free roaming Legion hordes. Once on the brink of extinction humanity has surged back, forging new countries and technologies. Now after decades of rebuilding the uneasy peace is starting to fracture. Skirmishes are becoming more frequent along the borders and nations turn to warmongering.&lt;br/&gt;Titan Zero Industries LLC presents Ictus, a table top wargame set in the Stempunk apocalypse of 1909. Ictus features high quality miniatures, six unique factions, an all-new stacking rule set and multiple game scenarios including cooperative play. &lt;br/&gt;In standard Skirmish or competitive game scenarios the goal is to eliminate the other player(s) officers. However, in cooperative play scenarios the goals of the game can vary to include eliminating the enemy, surviving for a number of rounds or achieving a set goal. &lt;br/&gt;Each unit is a paintable miniature that comes with a corresponding card that details the abilities of that character. While many abilities are set, conflict is resolved by the rolling of six sided dice (D6), with rolls of 5&amp;rsquo;s and 6&amp;rsquo;s being considered successful. Stacking is the major game mechanic. The Shield Warden unit, for example, provides a +1 defensive bonus to all allies within 1&amp;rdquo;. If there are three Shield Wardens within 1&amp;rdquo; of each other the bonuses stack and each unit would receive a +3 defensive bonus.&lt;br/&gt;There are six different factions to choose from; the British American Colonies, Mercenaries, United American Territories, Legion of Damned, Republic of Cascadia and Empire of Castile. Each faction has a unique look and play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
