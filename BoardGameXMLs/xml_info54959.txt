			<description>Judgment is a board game created by Miles Ratcliffe and, although some thought by Chaos Publishing Ltd. has been put into to publishing the game, it is not due to be published any time soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Prepare to step into a whole new fantasy world full of magic and adventure as you battle your way through your quests like never before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a distant world, far from our reach, there was land full of magic and prosperity; where the just had ruled over the corrupt for many a millennia. Now a great force has thrown this world into chaos, separating the land into eight domains, just as this great power has been divided. Ultimate power will be granted to the one who can control this incredible force; and, as the chaos has spread across this once prosperous land, the evil and corrupt have made their return - who will claim judgment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as one of 16 characters as you try to collect the chaos fragments to either restore the world to prosperity or damn it to destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judgment can be played with 2-8 players as each player plays out their strategy trying to out-wit each opponent as they battle creatures, cast spells, collect gold and purchase wargear to claim all the chaos fragments and exact judgment on the world!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
