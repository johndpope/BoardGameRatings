							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treacherous Waters: Caribbean Conquest</name>
									
			<description>Buckle your scimitar and join your pirate brethren for a battle to become the Pirate King of the Caribbean. Whether through ruthless combat or economic dominance, become the master of the Caribbean waters and prove that you have what it takes to be crowned the conqueror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treacherous Waters: Caribbean Conquest is for 2-6 players and offers up war and adventure on the high seas. Aim to win by either eliminating all opponents or playing all of your pieces. Keep your flagship afloat and sink your enemies to wipe them from the board or systematically engage all of their ports and fleets to erase them from existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is simple but intense. Players roll a die to move, attack, and defend. Stock plenty of garrisons in your ports to stave off enemies, and protect your vulnerable flag ship as it can take only six hits before descending to the depths. Loot cards can further your advantage (or your opponent's disadvantage) by providing bonuses (or penalties) to moving, attacking and defending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You choose between one of six pirates, each with his own background and color, and conquer ports and trade routes to generate larger fleets and greater resources. As the emphasis of the game is on conquering your enemies and making bold moves, the one who dares the most will have an edge toward winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
