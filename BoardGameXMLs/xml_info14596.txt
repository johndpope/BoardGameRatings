							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure Trail</name>
									
			<description>In Treasure Trail, each player takes the part of a traveler attempting to be the first to reach the pot of gold at the end of the trail. The &amp;quot;trail&amp;quot; is a continuous track of colored spaces beginning at the left and ending near the right side of the game field. A spinner is used to mark the players&amp;rsquo; progress; each player moves a number of spaces forward in accordance with the color indicated. Every time the arrow points to red, however, the offending player must move his traveler backwards (or forwards) to the nearest unoccupied red space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
