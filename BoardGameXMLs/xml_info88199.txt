			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is only one adage that can be applied to science fiction roleplaying, it is this: The future is a place of limitless possibilities. While the d20 System core rulebooks give the GM and players everything they need to get started, there is always room for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its spiritual predecessor (Modern Player's Companion), the Future Player's Companion focuses on the material used in character creation and game play designed for use by players but also valuable for Gamemasters. After all, the same material that applies to a player character can just as easily apply to an NPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomorrows' Hero brings theory to practice. Building on the material from Future Player's Companion: Tomorrows' Foundation, we work through methods for building your starting sci-fi hero. Inside, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Step-by-step systems for creating your sci-fi hero with options like mutations and cybernetics.&lt;br/&gt;     Bioware, biotech, and genetic engineering: science improving on nature's gifts&lt;br/&gt;     Guidelines for creating your own player races, from the near-human to the truly alien&lt;br/&gt;     Genetically-engineered, robotic, and alien companions for your heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
