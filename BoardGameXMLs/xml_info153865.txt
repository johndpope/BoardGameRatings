			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtuax is a story roleplaying game about a virtual world manifested as reality. Something has gone wrong, however, and a mathematical error has caused the virtual world to unravel, deleting itself in the process. It is only a matter of time before it erases everything. Characters are self-actualized programs seeking out the source of the anomaly, to shut it down before the entire system crashes. This one has some strange, abstract game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtuax is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
