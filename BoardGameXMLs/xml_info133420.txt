			<description>Santa's head elf Bartholomew has decided to retire, and rather than just choosing a replacement willy-nilly, the big guy has decided to leave the position open this year and let the top contenders for the job prove themselves over the holiday season!  The players will be taking on the roles of these elves each of them trying to build toys as efficiently as possible to make all the good little girls and boys happy.  Each one will be sending their helper elves to different locations at the North Pole - taking letters from children back to the workbench, gathering parts to build toys, recruiting more helper elves, or even tattling on each other!  After the twelve days of Christmas are done, the elf that has done the best job this holiday season (by collecting the most victory points) will be named Santa's new Head Elf (and win the game)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christmas Chaos, designed by Bill Corey Jr, is a game for 3-5 players ages 10 and up, and takes 90-120 minutes to play.  Christmas Chaos is a worker placement game with elements of resource gathering and management, and area influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
