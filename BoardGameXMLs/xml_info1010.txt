			<description>In Diver, players compete to capture their assigned series of underwater photographs first.  When one player has gotten all six, the game ends and the one with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six areas of deeper seas around the central island, each of which must be visited once by each player as well as a shallow area between the island and those deep spots in which players can capture secondary photographs to earn money (VPs) through giving lectures on the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The amount you can move depends on the air in your tank and is reduced by the depth of your dive (at turns start).  Balancing depth and distance is the significant tactical challenge of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
