Meks = Giant robotic war machines with a human pilot.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Decks: There are 4 separate common decks (each with its own discard): Mission Deck, Foe Deck, Event Deck, Build Deck. Players keep a Hand of Event cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Build deck has 4 card types: Pilots, Meks, Weapons, Equipment. Weapons and Equipment are referred to as Attachments. Weapons may be further classified as:&lt;br/&gt;Energy, Ballistic, Hand-to-Hand, or Missile.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's Squad can consist of up to a maximum of four Meks and four Pilots.
