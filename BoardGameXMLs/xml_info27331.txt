			<description>Dino Trivia is jam-packed with questions and quirks about dinosaurs!  Amaze your friends when you know the answer to: &amp;quot;Where was the first Velociraptor fossil found?&amp;quot;  If you are a junior player, do you know the answer to &amp;quot;What did a T-Rex eat?&amp;quot;  When you cannot answer some questions correctly, you might be asked to perform an outrageous action and pretend you are an Allosaurus chasing your prey!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Text from back of box]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns asking the person to their left questions from the back of the next card drawn from the pile.  Standard questions may be quite difficult, even for an adult, while &amp;quot;junior&amp;quot; questions are very simple to accommodate younger players.  A correct answer earns the player the card while an incorrect answer may require them to perform an &amp;quot;outrageous action,&amp;quot; such as flapping their arms like a Pteranodon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to construct a T-Rex skeleton composed of four separate images on the backs of the cards they earn.  Obviously many cards contain duplicate images, so reaching this goal may require more than four correct answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All information is taken from the book Dinosaurs by Michael and Caroline Carroll; religious content is held to a minimum on the cards themselves (2 of 100 questions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
