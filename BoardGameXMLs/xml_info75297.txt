			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2005 installation of the McRae franchise has over 70 stages spread over nine countries: Australia (loose gravel), Japan (tarmac), Finland (gravel), Greece (rough rocky gravel), UK (tarmac, mud, and gravel), Spain (smooth tarmac), USA (gravel/dusty tarmac), Sweden (snow and ice), and newcomer Germany (abrasive tarmac/light gravel). There are over 30 cars available, including Ford Focus WRC '01, Subaru Impreza WRX Sti '04 (which is featured on the front cover), Citro&amp;euml;n Xsara WRC '04, Peugeot 206 WRC2003, and Mitsubishi Lancer EVO VIII . There is also a revised graphics / damage engine that enables paint scratches on the car, and a new 'career' mode where the player starts out in the lower club leagues and works their way up to compete with Colin McRae in his 2004 Dakar Rally Nissan Pick-Up. In 'Championship' mode the player competes as Colin himself competing in 6 Rallies using any 4WD car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's graphic engine allows for more realistic damage effects and a blurred vision effect if the player comes into contact with a hard object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mac version of this game has been published by Feral Interactive and developed by Robosoft Technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two mobile game versions of this game were created, a J2ME title developed by IOMO and published by Digital Bridges and a N-Gage title developed by Ideaworks3D. Both were nominated for BAFTAs in the Mobile and Handheld categories respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
