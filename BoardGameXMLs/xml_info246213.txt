							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So, There&#039;s This House</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Unique Fixxer-Upper Opportunity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every story starts somewhere, every hero has a beginning.  This &amp;quot;starting level&amp;quot; adventure for the Near-Modern Era of roleplay in the Victory System is the stuff that heroic beginnings are made of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every town has &amp;quot;That One House,&amp;quot; where bad things are happening but no one wants to seem to to anything about it.  Well, mabye it's time that some Player Characters took care of things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So, There's This House&amp;quot; includes a fully-mapped two-story house where bad things happen, six potential drug king-pins operating out of the house, a variety of Thugs with varying levels of ability and threat, comprehensive rules in the Victory System for a number of narcotics both actual and fictional, and a brief look at some of the features of the Lovecraftian &amp;quot;Outside&amp;quot; for when situations at That One House get REALLY bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a problem and it needs to be dealt with.  We're not gonna tell you how it needs to be done... but it needs to be done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
