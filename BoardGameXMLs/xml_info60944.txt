			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the Neiyar, it is believed that all things are imbued with divine energy.  The very waters of the land are the tears of Sophia Mater.  From the footprints of Sophia Groa came all plant life. The blood of the god Roarth gave life to the animals of the land.  Because of this, the Neiyar believe that, if you can simply find the right combination of materials and put them together in the right way, you can harness that divine power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hearth Magic is a unique magical system that defies the laws of arcane and divine spellcasting.  This supplement introduces players to the world of the Neiyar by presenting the complete rules for learning Hearth Magic and creating new Hearth Magic rituals, as well as 22 known Hearth Magic Rituals (including 6 brand new rituals not found in the core book).  Previously presented as closed content, we have now made all of the Hearth Magic rituals open game content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Special Note:  If you already have the Neiyar Core Book, this supplement presents clarification on the basic rules for Hearth Magic, and 6 new rituals.  It also includes the rituals presented in the core book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
