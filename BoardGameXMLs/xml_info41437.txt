							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teapot game</name>
									
			<description>Colour match your teapot and your cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a colour.  On their turn they spin the spinner.  If the spinner points at a cup, they take the cup of their colour.  If the spinner points at a teapot, they take a piece of teapot - there are four to collect in total.  If they already have a cup/completed teapot then they miss their turn.  Once you have a completed teapot and cup set, then you need to spin a boiling kettle to win the game.  Spinning a boiling kettle before this has no effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
