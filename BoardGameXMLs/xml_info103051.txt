			<description>23 cards. A game that might be used by a teacher or, more especially, a Sunday School teacher. The cards quote verses from the Bible and the teacher asks his pupils to quote chapter and verse verbatim. If they are correct they can either take the card or he can award points. The first player to collect a pre-set number of cards or to reach a pre-set number of points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;The cards have no graphics at all and could best be described as functional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
