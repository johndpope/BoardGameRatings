							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pacific 1942 Point Luck</name>
									
			<description>Pacific 1942 Point Luck, the second extension of Pacific 1942 Admiral game, came to gamers as a small present free of charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This extension brings to game new dimension - chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name Point Luck is connected to meeting point of US ships in the Battle of Midway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true is that we have decided to keep Pacific 1942 as simple as possible, which, absurdly, brings the game much closer to reality than too complex and tricky rules often do. But everyone knows that chance plays quite important role in real combats. Up till now every fusillade destroyed one battle unit (one prism), an attacking bomber squadron destroyed one battle unit of the attacked ship (one prism) and so on. Now combat rules has changed by Point Luck Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) How many dices are rolled?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacker rolls as many dices as many Battle units he use for attack. For example a fully equipped (3 prisms) battleship can use up to 3 dices. But if it have moved in the turn, you need to reduce number of dices according to number of moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If more bomber squadron attack a ship, you can use as many dices as you have squadrons (cylinders).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You never roll more than three dices. The fourth, fifth etc. attack is always succesfull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can, of course, use only one dice and roll it more times up to number set above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can stop your attack at any moment and use your actions to move out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B)Where put deffender his Battle units&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B1) Rows&lt;br/&gt;According to number of Battle units uses deffender the first, second or third row of Point Luck Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first row has a symbol of one Battle unit, second row has a symbol (prism) of two and third row of three (or more) battle units. So if you have (as a deffendor) one attacked Battle unit, you use first row and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B2)Columns&lt;br/&gt;B2a) First row&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To which column has a deffender to put his BU? It&amp;acute;s only his decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expamle: In case of one BU form columns 1-4 and 3-6 two groups. If deffendor puts his BU to number 2, his BU will be destroyed if attacker will roll 1,2,3 or 4. From previous text implies that more BU attacker has, more attamptions has to roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B2b) Second row&lt;br/&gt;In the second row are fields splitted to half, so columns 1-3 and 4-6 forms units. Because deffendor has two BU, he can choose whether to split them or put both BU to one section. In first case he will for sure loose at least one BU. (And of course attacker can roll the dice according to number of his attacking BU.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B2c) Third row&lt;br/&gt;When has a deffendor three or more BU, he can place them in the third row. Here fields 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 forms units.&lt;br/&gt;When is the Point Luck Card used?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C) Point Luck Card is used all the time when:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     battleship fires&lt;br/&gt;     bombers attack&lt;br/&gt;     fighters attack bombers (even in case when it is turn of player whose bombers try to flight through place where enemy&amp;acute;s fighters are.&lt;br/&gt;     whne fighter shoots on un-armed fighter &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D) And when NOT to use the Point Luck Card?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point Luck Card is not used in case of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     battalions combat&lt;br/&gt;     armed fighters combat &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
