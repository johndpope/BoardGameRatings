			<description>Variant of Dune published in The General vol. 26 #1&lt;br/&gt;Pieces and cards published on insert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AT START&amp;mdash; 20 tokens in reserves (off-planet). &lt;br/&gt;Start with 30 spice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FREE REVIVAL&amp;mdash; 3 tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVANTAGE&amp;mdash; You have Influence over almost all major powers (except the Fremen) on Dune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. During a turn, you may use your power of Influence during the revival/movement or the battle round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. In the revival /movement round, you may order any player to &amp;quot;hold in place&amp;quot;. That player will not be able to reclaim tokens from the tanks, ship tokens onto or off Dune, or move his tokens on the mapboard during the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b. In the battle round, you may order any player to &amp;quot;hold in place&amp;quot;. That player will not be able to attack: anyone during that round, but may defend if attacked by another party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALLIANCE &amp;mdash; You may not ally with the Fremen (although a third player may be allied to both). Allies may make use of the Lansraad &amp;quot;Optional Advantage&amp;quot; of restricting territories; the same conditions as to who may be affected is imposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaders and Values: &lt;br/&gt;Baron Moat &amp;mdash; 6 &lt;br/&gt;Earl Viacontc &amp;mdash; 5 &lt;br/&gt;Administrator &amp;mdash; 3 &lt;br/&gt;Commissioner &amp;mdash; 2 &lt;br/&gt;Representative &amp;mdash; 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disadvantages : &lt;br/&gt;1. You cannot make use of your power of Influence in both the revival/movement and combat rounds of the same turn (unless able to &lt;br/&gt;play a Karma card, to be described later).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. You have no power of Influence over the Fremen player, nor may you ever ally with the Fremen player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional Advantage: At the start of any turn, before the Storm marker position is determined, you may declare any non-sietch territory on the mapboard (except for the Polar Sink) &amp;quot;restricted' All tokens that do not belong to the Lansraad player, a Lansraad-allied player, the Fremen player, or are co-existing Bene Gesserit tokens must be moved out of this territory during the upcoming revival/movement turns. Failure to do so results in the tokens being sent to the tanks. With the exception of the above-mentioned token types, tokens may not be moved into the territory during the entire turn. The Lansraad player may not declare the same territory &amp;quot;restricted&amp;quot; for two consecutive turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karma Powers: &lt;br/&gt;1. When played against the Lansraad player, this prevents him from using his power of Influence or optional &amp;quot;restriction&amp;quot; once. The &lt;br/&gt;card would be played right after the Lansraad ordered a player to hold in place or declared a territory restricted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2, If the optional special Karma Power rules are used, the Lansraad player may use a Karma card once during the game to use his power of Influence during the revival/movement and combat rounds of the same game turn. The card would be played at the start of the battle round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
