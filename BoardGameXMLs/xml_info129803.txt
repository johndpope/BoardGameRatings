							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I Spy Quest</name>
									
			<description>The game is set up by inserting one of the two double sided game boards into the frame in 1 of possible 4 orientations (=16 possible configurations).  Pictures will be visible through holes in the top of the frame.  However, when the game begins, each of these holes is covered by a pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns pulling off two pawns in an effort to find a match.  Matching pictures do not match exactly in I Spy games.  For example, a match might be two similar airplanes that are different colors.  Or it might be an elephant toy photographed from 2 different angles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a match is made, the player keeps the pawns and takes another turn.  If not match is made, the player puts the pawns back and the next player gets their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all matches are revealed, the player with the most pawns wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a set of short riddles to answer after the game for each of the 16 board configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: Game tray, 2 double-sided picture boards (16 game variations), reveal sheet with 16 riddles, 36 pawns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
