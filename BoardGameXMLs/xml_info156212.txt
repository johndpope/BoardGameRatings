			<description>Stalagbite! is a game for 2-4 players where you take on the roles of dwarves heading into the deep caverns beneath the Lost Mountains in search of Gold and Glory. Dwarves hammer at the rock formations looking for gold, gems and crystals, but they risk uncovering hazards such as rock falls, deep pools, jagged pits and the primordial horror known as the Stalagbite!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While each player is in theory out to win the game by collecting the most gold, player&amp;rsquo;s dwarves also earn Hero Points by killing monsters and rescuing comrades. The player with the most points, in both treasure and glory, at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
