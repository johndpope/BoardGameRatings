							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strike Legion Main Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>Strike Legion is a SciFi tabletop miniatures game dedicated to ground combat in the near and far future. The game uses a unique Electronic Warfare system that allows players to alter their units' attack and defense ratings each game turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main rulebook is divided into Basic, Advanced, and optional rules, and teaches the rules through the use of 'programmed instruction' scenarios, wherein players learn to apply new rules through playing these scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A section dedicated to creating units is included, allowing players to create any troop or vehicle types form their favorite science fiction or alternate history backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is scaled at 1 piece = 1 tank, flier, gun, or infantry team; 1&amp;quot; on the tabletop = 250 meters. Miniatures from any manufacturer can be used, and the game is supporteed by dozens of army lists available for free download from the publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended miniatures scales range from 6mm to 15mm; the game can be played with smaller (2-3mm) scales, but is not recommended for figures larger than 15mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules and support for solitaire play are included in the Strike Legion: Skunk Works rules module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
