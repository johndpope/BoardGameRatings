			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 2639.033, forces of the Kilrathi empire land on the human-occupied word of Enyo, putting a quarter of a million human prisoners under orbital guns. Thus began the Enyo Engagement, in which the Terran Confederation executed a masterful plan over the course of one week to drive the Kilrathi from the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least, that's the way the history books say it happens. Whether or not it will actually turn out that way is entirely up to you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enyo is a miniature campaign developed for the Wing Commander Role-Playing Game. This guidebook contains all of the information you need to oust the Kilrathi from the Enyo System, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A simple, yet flexible character creation system.&lt;br/&gt;     A set of read-made characters, allowing players to jump right into the game.&lt;br/&gt;     Customized ships and vehicles for use with the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     Flexible rules that allow players to play with as much detail and complexity as they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
