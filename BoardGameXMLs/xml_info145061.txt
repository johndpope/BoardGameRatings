			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Age of Worms Adventure Path is a complete Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons campaign in twelve parts, published monthly in issues 124&amp;ndash;135 of Dungeon. This document contains material we just couldn't fit in the magazine, but which we still wanted to share to enrich your Age of Worms campaign. The document begins with a slightly edited version of the campaign outline provided to all Age of Worms Adventure Path authors, and represents an accurate picture of the central plot that weaves through all twelve adventures. Individual installments provide plenty of surprises of their own, since each author brings a different approach to each adventure. Likewise, certain plot elements presented here may change slightly as the series evolves in the hands of a dozen different authors. John Gallagher's concept art gives exciting glimpses of what lies ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the outline, you'll find a huge number of stat blocks for scores of NPCs from the mining town of Diamond Lake, as well as helpful tables showing who likes to hang out where. We've also provided some useful information about the region immediately surrounding Diamond Lake, an area that hosts a third of the adventures in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, Keith Baker and Eric L. Boyd's official conversions offer plenty of advice for Dungeon Masters running the Age of Worms in the Eberron or Forgotten Realms campaign settings. I couldn't resist a few suggestions of my own on how to integrate the Adventure Path into the Greyhawk campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
