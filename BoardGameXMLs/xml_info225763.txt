							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gibraltar of the West</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is early May 1863. Ulysses S Grant and over 40,000 Union troops have crossed the Mississippi and now threaten both Vicksburg and the state capital of Jackson. Will Grant cut free from his river-side supply base? Can Pemberton unite with the relief army assembling near Jackson?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Gibraltar of the West&amp;quot; is a free campaign supplement, allowing players to re-fight the pivotal three weeks of the Vicksburg campaign. Players maneuver their divisions across a large theater map with the potential to fight a series of interconnected battles. Our simple rules are only 10 pages, but still include logistics, supply, weather, variable map movement, asymmetrical victory conditions, and historical random events. Did we mention it's free?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A color copy of the theater map is included in the rules, spread out across two pages, which you can cut out and tape together into an approximately 10&amp;quot;x 15&amp;quot; map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign requires the use of ten event cards, representing random events such as bad weather or new reinforcements. The cards are sized as standard poker cards, which could be slid into plastic protective sleeves if you so choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
