							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flames of War: Bridge by Bridge â€“ The German Defence of Holland, September, November 1944</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a supplement for the World War II miniatures game Flames of War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Allies have landed a massive airborne force behind our lines and reports have arrived telling grim stories of a strong British armored attack south of Eindhoven. There can be only one objective: a crossing over the Rhine at Arnhem. I needn't tell you that this would spell disaster for Germany! All along the Belgian-Dutch border, German troops dig-in their heels and put an end to the Allied pursuit across France and Belgium. There, the canals and flooded fields of Holland will slow the Allied advance and give them time to organize a strong defense of Germany. With the outbreak of Operation Market Garden, the German reaction is instant. The II. SS-Panzerkorps happens to be ideally placed to resist the British paratroopers in Arnhem, while a wide assortment of ad-hoc battle groups are organized to oppose the American paratroopers and the 30 Corps along 'Hell's Highway'. These battle groups range in quality and motivation, including Fallschirmj&amp;auml;ger, heavy tanks, training battalions, machine-gun companies, and fragments of SS formations. Strange formations, such as whole battalions of anti-aircraft guns and fortress machine-gun battalions have been called up to block the Allied assault. Despite the motley appearance and equipment of these troops, they all have one goal in mind: to keep the Allies out of and away from their beloved Germany. The F&amp;uuml;hrer himself has issued orders to hold until the last man and bullet are spent in defense of the Fatherland - nothing will make these men fight harder! The defense of the Reich starts here and you will lead your kampfgruppe to glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
