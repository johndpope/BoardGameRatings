							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leopard Women of Venus!</name>
									
			<description>User summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bizarre and wonderful world setting for the QAGS system, based on the works of cult cartoonist Fletcher Hanks. (NO, you probably haven't heard of him.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venus is a hellish nightmare world of hideous monsters and savage barbarians, a world that can only be tamed by the Leopard Women. Armed with comet gun helmets, radium whips, and Flying Saurian mounts, the Leopard Women stand between the human settlers of Venus and total annihilation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leopard Women of Venus is a mind-melting pulp science fiction role-playing game inspired by the works of Fletcher Hanks. Hanks wrote and drew bizarre and memorable work in the earliest days of American comic books. His work is boldly drawn, frequently ugly, and strangely fascinating. Leopard Women of Venus gives you the tools you need to recreate the magic and lunacy of a Fletcher Hanks comic with your gaming group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leopard Women of Venus is designed for use with the QAGS Second Edition rules. It includes the history of Venus, including the story of how humans settled there and how it all went horribly wrong; an overview of the planet&amp;rsquo;s climate, terrain, and exotic locales; full descriptions of the human civilizations of Venus, from the caverns to the jungle; colorful monsters, like the Hypno-Shark, the Man-Eating Tree, and the Quivering Blood Gnats; and character creation guidelines, including rules for psychic powers. For the Game Master, there are sample PCs, a detailed guide to running the game, random tables, and a complete adventure, &amp;ldquo;Menace from Space!&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a combination that does everything but run the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
