			<description>This games comes with the word cards, a spinner to decide which &amp;quot;version&amp;quot; of the game you will play that round, and score sliders.  It comes in a one-piece (except for the cards) blue clamshell in a box. You pick a card and spin the two-hole spinner -- one hole indicates whether you are using &amp;quot;talking only&amp;quot; of if you are performing charades. and the opposite hole, if you land on the words version, will tell you how many words you are allowed to use (in which case your team is allowed &amp;quot;one minute&amp;quot; to guess after you finish saying the 6 - 9 words allowed, but the game does not come with a timer).  Winning requires 10 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
