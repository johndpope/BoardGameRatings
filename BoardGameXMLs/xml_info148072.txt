DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rats in the basement? I&amp;rsquo;ll call the exterminator.&amp;rdquo; [Click] &amp;ldquo;No way I am going down there&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rooftop temple is a single map of a rooftop of an urban building with a cat-like statue in the middle of the rooftop. This product includes image files for use with your virtual tabletop (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rooftop temple is intended for use in modern settings or run down and gritty near science fiction settings. This product also fits horror themed games in these settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tenants are complaining about strange scratching sounds in the basement. The super called in an exterminator to deal with the rats, but the exterminator never made it out of the basement. The exterminator&amp;rsquo;s family put in a missing person&amp;rsquo;s report and the police have been called into to investigate leading them to the apartment complex. When the police disappear, the city gets desperate and hires the group as private investigators. The group investigates the basement finding some normal-sized rat holes. A couple of cat cultists recognize them as outsiders not from the apartment and attack to try and subdue them. If they succeed in knocking them out, they will become sacrifices for the cat god on the roof. If the group defeats them, they find a secret closet with the remains of the exterminator gruesomely killed ritualistically having been clawed to death and the two missing police officers bound, gagged, and unconscious. The group needs to free and rouse the police officers. The police officers tell them the cat cultists are on the roof and tell them that they overheard a conversation that the cat cultists plan to sacrifice them both in the next two nights to their cat god. The exterminator was the first sacrifice to the cat god. The group heads to the roof and finds the cat cultists praying to the cat god. A cat priest or shaman heads the congregation and he blesses the claw-like weapons of his cat cultist followers. All of them wearcat masks. Many of the people here are brainwashed tenants from the apartment building. Its up to the group to defeat the cat priest and the cat cultists, destroy the cat statue, and try and save as many tenants from brainwashing as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
