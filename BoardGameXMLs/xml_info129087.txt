			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunters 2 is a turn-based tactical game in which the player controls a squad of &amp;quot;hunters.&amp;quot; The game is heavily influenced by the classic boardgame Space Hulk, but is more complex. Each member of the squad has a number of action points to spend on movement and combat. The player may freely alternate between characters and sequence moves and attacks in any order. Teammates are equipped with weapons and armor, gain experience and level up, and come in a wide range of classes determined by a combination of two talents. For example, the &amp;quot;Stalker&amp;quot; class is a combination of the &amp;quot;Scout&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Survivor&amp;quot; talents, whereas the &amp;quot;Devastator&amp;quot; class is a combination of the &amp;quot;Combat&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Vengenace&amp;quot; talents. A character's class determines roughly half of their skill tree, with the other half being standard across all classes. One skill point is awarded per level, with 10 being the level cap. This means that a complete &amp;quot;build&amp;quot; results from nine skill point allocations, making long-term planning an accessible but fairly deep part of the game right from the start. All equipment is categorized as common/uncommon/rare/epic/legendary, and can be acquired as salvage, at a shop, or manufactured to spec. The shop refreshes every half-hour. Hunters 2 also features daily missions that refresh at midnight. These are completed outside of the campaign (for extra experience, loot, and cash).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
