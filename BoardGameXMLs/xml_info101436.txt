			<description>After releasing Star Fleet Battles Expansion #1, Expansion #2, and Expansion #3 all of the rules were reformatted into the Commander's Rulebook system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the new format, all rules were brought together and divided into separate topics.  The rulebooks were intended to be separated at the binder and placed loosely in a 3-ring binder.  New rules could be inserted, and each update included a new comprehensive table of contents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commander's Rulebook #1 included the original basic and advanced rules as well as the new rules and errata from Expansion #1.  This rulebook contained the rules and errata from Expansions #2 and #3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who already had the expansions, the rulebooks were sold separately.  For those who were new to the game, they were sold in re-packaged box formats Star Fleet Battles Volume I and Star Fleet Battles Volume II, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Star Fleet Battles&lt;br/&gt;     Star Fleet Battles Designer's Edition&lt;br/&gt;     Star Fleet Battles Expansion #2&lt;br/&gt;     Star Fleet Battles Expansion #3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented-by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
