							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spione: Nest of Spies</name>
									
			<description>Spione is a hidden role game for 5 to 12 players. Each player will receive a secret identity that is either a red spy, a green spy, or a blue bystander. On each players turn they may play an action token that will either take a vote of allegiance, assassinate another player, Defect or secretly change which side you are are on, declare you have diplomatic immunity and are immune to all actions until it is your turn again, inform on another player and cause a vote of accusation, or be used to look at another players allegiance card. The game ends when either a set number of actions have been played, or an allegiance vote shows all spies to be on one color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
