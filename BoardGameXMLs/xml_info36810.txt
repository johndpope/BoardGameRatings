			<description>Kartazma is a Polish CCG whose topic is the  CCG players life. You are controlling a group of characters that are CCG fans. During deck construction you may choose from 3 general types of &amp;quot;heros&amp;quot;: Collector (&amp;quot;Kolekcjoner&amp;quot;), Tournament player (&amp;quot;Turniejowiec&amp;quot;) and Social guy (&amp;quot;Społecznik&amp;quot;). There are also cards that represent locations like shops or clubs where you can play, some stuff cards: cell phones, bags, card protectors and finally some quests that you have to accomplish before your opponent does to win the game (like a good trade or wining 3 tournaments).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to construct 3 decks: a main deck (&amp;quot;Talia gł&amp;oacute;wna&amp;quot;) with exactly 40 cards, character deck (&amp;quot;Talia Karciarzy&amp;quot;) with 10 cards + one main character and quest deck (&amp;quot;Talia wyzwań&amp;quot;) with 5-7 cards. Each of players must also have 3 locations which he will use during that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
