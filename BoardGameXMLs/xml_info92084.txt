							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice BattleShips with Land n Air 07</name>
									
			<description>The game is played on a board like a large chess board, The game board included is just an example You make a board to suit the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are regular dice d6. The are three different colors that represent Navy (blue), Army (green), Air Force (white). As you play your troops will suffer casualties , You rotate the dice to reduce the strength of a piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to control the board, or to eliminate the enemy. You move your troops by aiding each other -- Navy can transport Army, Air Force planes can air-lift Army, Air Force planes can land on carriers, et c.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play is simply&lt;br/&gt;When a unit is adjacent to an enemy unit in your turn you may attack, an attack is resolved by adding all the strengths of the attacking units in the battle, then subtracting the combined enemy strength to reach a positive or negative battle-score. The attacker and defender roll a d6 for further support and add or subtract the numbers from the battle-score total.  A positive result allows the attacker to reduce the enemy force by that number, and a negative battle-score allows the defending player to do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of every turn, a d6 is rolled, this gives the current player one of six combat advantages:&lt;br/&gt;1) bomb any land unit and reduce by 2.&lt;br/&gt;2) move any unit by 3&lt;br/&gt;3) add 1 to every combat this turn&lt;br/&gt;4) build a friendly airfield , next to ant land unit&lt;br/&gt;5) fighter attack reduce any plane unit by 2&lt;br/&gt;6) hide any unit for 2 turns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes optional rules for mines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
