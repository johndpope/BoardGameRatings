			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QB8 is an engaging game of balancing the accumulation and retention of game cubes.  Each cube displays one of four colors AND a number between one and six.  In order to win, a player must be in possession of exactly two cubes each of all four colors AND where all eight numbers on those cubes, when added together, total exactly 28.  You must only have eight cubes in your possession to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not as difficult as it sounds but it does require some concentration and some playing strategy.  The goal of each turn is to acquire a game cube.  While that's not guaranteed, the rules make it pretty easy to accomplish.  At the end of each turn, a player is allowed to &amp;quot;discube&amp;quot; - or get rid of an unwanted cube - thus engaging in the act of balancing which cubes a player retains in their effort to obtain a winning combination of eight game cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
