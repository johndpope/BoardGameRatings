			<description>&amp;quot;A hilarious party game for any number of players. A riot of fun for everyone - take it from me! - Fibber McGee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...by Arrangement with the National Broadcasting Co. Inc.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large deck of yellow cards are placed face down on a table in a loose spread out pile. Each card has a few words that make up a partial sentence on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player reads a story out of a booklet and when the reader encounters a blank line (&amp;quot;_______&amp;quot;) in the story, they pause and another player quickly draws a card and reads what is on it, then the reader continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, &amp;quot;My first encounter came after a series of lessons from _A_perforated_fire_hose_ who had slain nine thousand bulls.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards have points on them, so the player who drew that cards would get some points. When all cards have been drawn, the points are tallied and a winner determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
