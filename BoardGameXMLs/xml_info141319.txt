			<description>In this game of tactics &amp;amp; luck, you try to outsmart your opponent(s) by conquering their pawns, jumping yourself to your Home Zone and taking the best spots on the board.&lt;br/&gt; In this abstract game, the players try to get their pawns from their starting position in the oppenents Home zone, to their own Home Zone on the other end of the board.&lt;br/&gt;This is done by throwing two dice, which have the primary colours, a black, a white &amp;amp; a joker side on them. By strategically using these colors you can jump forward, take over enemy pawns and get into waiting rooms or your home zone. &lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all their pawns in their Home Zone, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Authors note.&lt;br/&gt;Primary moves is actually not as abstract as it first appears once you have played it. The board appearance is random for a reason, that was how I could build player 3 and 4 into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original games relies a lot on luck and quick decision making due to the fact that the drive mech is dice.&lt;br/&gt;The end of 2015 saw a &amp;quot;couldnt see the wood through the trees&amp;quot; breakthough and allowed a new mech to be added in the form of cards that turn the table on the luck factor, making it a more pleasurable game for the planners and thinkers among us, all be it still very light to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;what still never ceases to amaze me is how many variations and styles this 1 simple game can have all based on a few super simple rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
