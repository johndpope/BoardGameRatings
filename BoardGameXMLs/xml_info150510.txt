							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New York, New York, August-September, 1776</name>
									
			<description>New York, New York... is a game covering the invasion of this key American colonial city by what was the largest invasion force - men and ships - ever assembled by the British in 1776.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by one or two players, or more, if they like to argue about who gets to do what. Which would provide an interesting piece of Reality. The heart of the game is the Activation system, which requires the players to purchase (with a constantly varying number of Initiative Points). The game-map uses a scale of ca.650 yards per hex. Each game-turn (there are ten) represents a day of real time. Most units are regiments or battalions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes: &amp;bull;&amp;bull; 1 33&amp;rdquo;x 22&amp;rdquo; game map &amp;bull;&amp;bull; 1 Sheet of 280 counters &amp;bull;&amp;bull; 20 Op Cards (10 British, 10 American) &amp;bull;&amp;bull; 12 Pages of rather Revolutionary rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
