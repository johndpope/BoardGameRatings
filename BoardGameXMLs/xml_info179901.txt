							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wor-Born #1: Atlanteans</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold! The power of the mind...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ages past, the psychically powerful Atlanteans ruled a vast empire that was fated to be destroyed by its own magic. But that doesn't mean players can't play an Atlantean character - someone who's either come from the distant past or secretly descended of the original Atlanteans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wor-Born is designed for Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry, and explores the more unique races of the Realms of Wor - although there's no reason a Referee can't retool them or use them as is for other settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[#1] looks at the Atlanteans, a race of Psionic Humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The template can also be used for settings where the Referee wants to tone down magic or have a race of psychics, such as the Gypsies found in much fantasy horror, or the Deryni from Katherine Kurtz's novels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
