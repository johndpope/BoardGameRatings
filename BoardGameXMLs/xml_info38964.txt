							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Logjam</name>
									
			<description>Logjam is a simple and exciting race game for two to six players.  Each player tries to be the first to move all of his loggers through a treacherous maze of logs. The players build a different maze for each game, and all of the logs can move during play.  Every game of Logjam provides a new challenge, and the winner is never certain until the very end.  While a player moves his loggers through the logjam, he can also try to confound his rivals.  With certain die rolls, he can move the logs to block his opponent's path and open new paths for himself.  He may be able to squeeze an opponent's logger between two logs and make it start over.  Strategy-minded players will try to position their loggers to take advantage of any number that they may roll.  Others will enjoy raising havoc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get the full game here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.rich-and-sharon.org/al/Logjam01.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.rich-and-sharon.org/al/Logjam01.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
