			<description>Nitty Gritty: The Star Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are an eager beaver, here's your chance to get even steven with any funny bunny, providing you don't get into double trouble in which case any hanky panky could become hairy scary.  So don't dilly dally, but get down to the nitty gritty so you can razzle dazzle without phoney baloney - and that, silly Billy, is super duper.  Does this sound like mumbo jumbo?  (From the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 154 printed cards which, when properly matched with each other, make 77 pairs.  Pair examples are: Mellow Yellow / Roly Poly / Plain Jane / Hebbie Jebbies...etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 154 cards has one word and from one to three stars printed on the face of the card.  The number of stars indicates the value of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to win as many matched pairs of cards as possible.  When the stockpile of cards is gone, the player with the greatest number of stars is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
