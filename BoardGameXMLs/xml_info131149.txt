			<description>A children's game set in the universe of the 2011 live action/CGI animated television series &amp;quot;Mia and me&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background story: The elves are trying to find the pieces of a magical instrument, the &amp;quot;magical Trumptus&amp;quot;, which are scattered all over Centopia. The Trumptus is their only hope of chasing away evil Panthea and her Munculus warriors. But where to look for the pieces? They are all over Centopia, and behind every corner there might be an evil Munculus warrior. Cautiously, the players search for the pieces. Will they be able to find all the pieces before Panthea manages to mobilise her troops?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: The Trumptus and Munculus chits are randomised and placed into the slits in the game board. Each player gets an elf board. The Panthea board is placed in the middle of the table, next to the game board. Players take turns rolling the die. If a number from 1-3 is rolled, the corresponding number of chits is taken from the game board and placed in front of the active player's elf board. Then he/she can decide if they want to roll again or end their turn. They may repeat this step as often as they want, as long as they don't draw a Munculus chit from the board or roll the Munculus symbol.&lt;br/&gt;If a player decides to end their turn, they place all the Trumptus chits of their own colour on their elf board. They return the Trumptus chits of other players' colours to the game board (putting them into slits of their choice). Then it's the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;If a Munculus chit is drawn, the player's turn is over immediately. The Munculus chit is placed on the Panthea board. Previously drawn Trumptus chits are returned to the board and the die is handed over to the next player. If the Munculus symbol is rolled, the player's turn is over too. All previously drawn Trumptus chits are given to the players they belong to, and they place them on their elf boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has placed all 8 Trumptus chits of their colour on their elf board. That player wins the game. The game also ends when the Panthea board has been completely filled with Munculus chits. In this case, Panthea wins. Second place goes to the player who has collected the most Trumptus chits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
