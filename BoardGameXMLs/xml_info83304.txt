			<description>From the Book's Opening Paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to &amp;quot;The Feast,&amp;quot; the sixth installment of the Gloria Mundi chronicle for Mage: The Awakening. This story removes the characters from the Boston area and takes them to the quaint little seaside town of Waltman's Neck, which holds a terrible secret. A rogue Thyrsus mage who goes by the shadow name Wendigo has formed around himself a faithful cult devoted to the awful practice of cannibalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mage holds the town completely under his sway, and he has even captured the Vice-spirit of Gluttony to do with as he pleases (as well as a handful of local spirits he has forced to act as his sentries around the town). The characters have a chance to see what the Awakened are capable of becoming if they give themselves over entirely to their own hubris and vice. The characters can also banish the Gluttony-spirit, but the challenge in this story isn&amp;rsquo;t defeating the spirit so much as rescuing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
