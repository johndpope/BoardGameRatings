							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disc-Triangles</name>
									
			<description>Disc-Triangles is one of A-O-A's &amp;quot;Big Games,&amp;quot; with a 25&amp;quot; x 25&amp;quot; board (large for an abstract) and pieces 3&amp;quot; across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a sort of Reversi/Othello variant - as in that game, you try to surround the opposing pieces and flip them over to your color.  The difference is in how surrounding works.  Here, you can do it either Go-style (occupy all points orthogonally adjacent to a group) or with three pieces that form the points of a right triangle (flipping all pieces inside the triangle).  In an additional twist, the outer edge of the board can only be played on when forming a triangle, and otherwise can be used to help surround pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically for 2 players, but claims it can be played by 4 in teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
