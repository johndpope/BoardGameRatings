			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The year is around 2491 A.N. (after the Nuke of Khazan). Technology had swept across Trollworld suppressing Magic. Now that technology had almost destroyed the entire world, magic was slowly returning and the arts of technology were sloly being lost.&lt;br/&gt;        [...]&lt;br/&gt;        In an alternate Post Apocalyptic world where science and fantasy are alive and magic works, there exist numerous lost military facilities and enchanted complexes (call them dungeons if you wish) that are liberally loaded with many types of treasure from science and fantasy, and guarded by every imaginable form of mutated monster, magic, and devious trap.&lt;br/&gt;        Brave men and women of many differend kindred (humans, elves orcs, dwarves, hobbits, leprechauns, and many others) arm themselves and venture within the tunnels at risk of body and soul to seek treasure and experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comments:&lt;br/&gt;Adds a fairly extensive equipment list, a number of high tech weapons, radiation rules, mutation rules, alters the available classes, replaces the spell lists, and adds cybernetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What isn't in here, but you need from a T&amp;amp;T or MSPE rulebook: combat system, advancement system, kindred racial modifiers, low-tech melee weapons, and if desired, skills or talents rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes an adventure by Ken St. Andre, designer of Tunnels and Trolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
