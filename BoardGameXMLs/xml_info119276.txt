			<description>Maken Shao: Demon Sword, originally released without the subtitle as Maken Shao (魔剣爻) in Japan, is an action game created by the company Atlus. The 爻 (shao) used in the title is a very rarely used kanji in Japanese, and is used merely to signify 'XX' (as in the sequel to 'X'). It is an enhanced remake of the Dreamcast game Maken X, with the most significant difference being that Maken Shao is played via a third-person perspective, as opposed to the first-person environment found in Maken X. The game's story is based on Maken X, a genetic creation that can cure mental illnesses. This genetic device has its own mind, and can take control of a persons body through their weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Maken Shao&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
