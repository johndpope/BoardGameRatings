							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pitstop II</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pitstop II, the player again steers a F1 race car. There are other tracks to choose from, like &amp;quot;Vallelunga; Rome, Italy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Brands Hatch; Farmingham, England&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Pitstop, the view was 3rd person, camera hanging a short distance behind the car, and in a corner is an overview of the entire track, with a moving dot marking the position of the player's car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fuel runs out, and the tyre still changes color indicating the wear. However, on many platforms, like the C-64, this is now more subtle, with a colored line, instead of the entire tyre changing color.&lt;br/&gt;Racing slowly erodes the tyres. Pushing other cars of the track is possible, but erodes the tyres at an alarming rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also in II, after a lap, the player can opt to drive his car into the pit. Then the screen changes into a pit view, and the player had to operate his pitcrew: one guy fuelling the car and a few others to change tyres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biggest differences between Pitstop (I) and Pitstop II are the increased number of racing tracks in II, the better graphics and most importantly, the option to play in a split screen mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
