			<description>A two-player soccer simulation cardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draft their squad of 11 from the 22 available players (whose names are parodies of famous professionals) each rated in 6 offensive and defensive categories.  They then pick their 7-man formations, consisting of one keeper and from 1 to 4 players in defense, midfield and attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to move the ball between your players so that you can score a goal. A successful pass moves the ball along the player line or up 1 player line. A successful thru ball or Long pass moves the ball up 2 lines. A successful shot is a goal. Simple right? But if you are unsuccessful in any play, your opponent gets possession and starts their attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a play is selected, the managers will roll against each other in the battle box to see who wins that challenge. Turning over the game cards may just be the difference as they influence the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
