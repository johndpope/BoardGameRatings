			<description>The game board in 17! consists of three home spaces for each player and several &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; spaces connected by paths. On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves two of his seven pieces (5 pawns and 2 queens) along the paths from space to space. Each piece moves a distance equal to the result of one of the dice. (Instead of moving two pieces, a player may move one of his two queens a distance equal to the sum of the dice.) A piece may capture an opponent's piece by landing on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to occupy the opponent's home spaces. Each such occupied space gives a player one point. Occupying all three yields an additional two-point bonus and ends the round. A new round ensues, and the game ends when a player reaches 17 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
