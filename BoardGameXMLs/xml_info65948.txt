			<description>French game that combines some aspects of Gin Rummy (there are no cards in this game though) with Roulette. The goal is to finish 2 predetermined contracts as fast as possible. The players do this by choosing two numbers with their chits (that have also numbers on them). The moment that one of the players finishes his 2 contracts he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
