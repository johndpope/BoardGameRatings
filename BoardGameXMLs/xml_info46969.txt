			<description>Kata Kumbas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An original game set in a &amp;quot;Mediterranean Fantasy&amp;quot;: not the classic heroic fantasy with Nordic influences but an ironic mix of Italian history, legends and fairy tales, in a Medieval setting. All blended with humour that is further evident in the geography: the world is Laitia, that's an anagram of Italia (Italy), and all its region have names that are anagrams of Italian ones. Together with &amp;quot;I Signori del Caos&amp;quot;, that was developed at the same time but was released a few months before, it is the first Italian role-playing game, preceding the Italian edition of Basic D&amp;amp;D in 1985.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardback edition in a single volume, including many advanced rules previously unreleased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
