			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scirmish is a cleverly designed little word game where the aim is simply to discover the six mystery words on your opponent's card. The mystery words are all linked to a central theme and appear in a crossword pattern on the card... Players take turns to call out letters and patterns soon begin to appear. From that moment it's a tense battling race to reveal all six of your opponent's words before they guess yours. Scirmish is a top quality game that comes with enough pre-printed grids to play a hundred times without repetition. Additional cards are currently available free to customers via our web site. Scirmish has sold in numerous countries under the names of Battle Words and Literax (both of which are trademarks of Hasbro International Inc.).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
