			<description>&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Aftermath! is a role-playing game created by Paul Hume &amp;amp; Robert Charette which was published in 1981 by Fantasy Games Unlimited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is set in a post-apocalyptic world in which the characters typically have to fight for food, water, basic supplies and shelter. The rules are reasonably complex and include a few flow charts and tables to enable the Games Master to simulate the world. This leads to a very immersive gaming experience. However, it does require a good knowledge of the rules to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of the Apocalypse is up to the Games Master but it is often reminiscent of the Mad Max films. There is even an expansion (Aftermath! Magic!) to play in a universe dominated by dragons in the style of the film Reign of Fire.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is mostly a dice based system that uses a d20 to resolve combat and skill checks and then uses a table for a 'complex' hit location.  This determines additional effects to the character.  Highly realistic many characters will die after just one hit, so watch out.  Once you get into a firefight someone isn't walking away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Aftermath!,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a boxed set which contains the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Basic Rules book with multiple examples and illustrations of play&lt;br/&gt;     Player's Handbook (Survivors of the Aftermath) detailing construction of characters, equipment and life after the ruin&lt;br/&gt;     Referee's Handbook (The World of Aftermath) detailing construction of the environment and running the game&lt;br/&gt;     Introductory Scenario (Survive!) to allow you to start play easily &lt;br/&gt;     Playaids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
