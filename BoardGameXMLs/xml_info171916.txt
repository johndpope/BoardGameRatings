			<description>Made From Scratch is a culinary card game in which players compete to complete recipes.  The cards that comprise a player's hand consist primarily of ingredients; such as poultry, butter, tomatoes, and spices. In playing those ingredient cards and providing more of the ingredients on a recipe than their opponents, a player gets to claim the recipe and bring it into their prep area. Limited kitchen space forces chefs to try and prep, cook, and score their recipes before they burn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made From Scratch captures the essence and complexity of preparing gourmet dishes and packages it in an easy to learn game that is guaranteed to leave you hungry for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
