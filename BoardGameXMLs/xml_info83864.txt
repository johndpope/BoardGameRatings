							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forge of Imagination: Spark of an Idea</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time comes in the life of every campaign world when the Game Master runs out of ideas. Typically it comes sooner than expected and far sooner than desired. Whether it is because the players are moving in an unexpected direction or simply because as Game Master you are burned out from everything else you have been doing, you need to come up with something or scrap the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forge of Imagination contains both fleshed out ideas and &amp;quot;sparks&amp;quot; to spark your own creativity and give you a helpful push in the right direction. Based on decades of professional experience designing role-playing games and worlds, this book strives not just to list some plots and ideas, but instead to teach you how to develop the sparks on your own. This is another of Board Enterprises' &amp;quot;Simple and Sane&amp;quot; supplements that gives you what you need to work and teaches you how to expand it on your own. Keep your imagination fired, while we give you ideas and pointers on how to generate your own ideas with a lot less wear and tear on your mind. Players will be happier, and you as the game master will be happier and more rested. &lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     over two dozen campaign starters&lt;br/&gt;     over 150 adventure ideas plus 10 adventure starters&lt;br/&gt;     more than five dozen twists to convert old ideas into new ones&lt;br/&gt;     about 80 quick or random encounters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
