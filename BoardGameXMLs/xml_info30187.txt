			<description>Equipment consists of eighty-one wooden tiles. The tiles represent three complete alphabets and three wild cards. One player draws three tiles and composes a word that uses those three letters of not more that nine letters. The other player has to guess the word. Guessing the word within six tries scores the guessing player two points. Guessing the word within eleven tries scores the guessing player one point. Stumping the guessing player scores the other player two points. The first team to twelve points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When more than two play, they play as two teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vex was named in the Games Magazine Games 100 of 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
