			<description>This game is a simulation of a Keirin indoor track cycling race although it can in theory be played with multiple players who can place bets on the outcome of the race. Keirin is a sport where the riders are following a derny (a motorcycle) before they are released in their race. The game is played with 6 riders and 6 different colours and a derny, multiple coloured dice and a track of 60 squares long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2012, Anki added a Print and Play update. The main differences are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) There are 9 racers now, like real in keirin races, instead of six. However, for a shorter game, you can drop some riders (the ones with the highest numbers). Playing with 6, 7 or 8 riders is ok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) You do not need a lot of different coloured dice. You just need as many dice as racers, that is, nine dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c) The motorbike now takes part in the game, even if it's just in the first turn. It is not there &amp;quot;just for the ambiance&amp;quot; anymore.  The rule foir the first throw of rider 1 has also changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
