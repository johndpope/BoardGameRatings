			<description>Cookie and Bibi 2 is a rip-off of the Puzzle Bobble series developed by Semicom in 1996. In this game, the player controls a cannon which shoots different sorts of bricks, each one representing some sort of ball. If at least 3 bricks of the same kind are put in contact with one another, they explode and the player gains points. To clear a stage and go to the next one, the player has to destroy every brick present at the beginning before they accumulate to a certain state. The game has several game modes : The main game is playable with one or two players helping each other ; a versus game mode is also available. This game has one prequel and one sequel: Cookie and Bibi and Cookie and Bibi 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cookie and Bibi 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
