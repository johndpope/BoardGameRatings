			<description>Chocafrix' is a board game that was released with the first edition of the Trade Paperback Serie &amp;quot;Freak's Squeele&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an asynchronous semi-cooperative game for 2-4 players. The game takes place in a story from the Trade Paperback where the heroes of the story have to fight an army of gingerbreat in a giant bakery. One player will be the master baker and take control of the gingerbread army while the other players will play the heroes of the book and try to defeat the baker. All the heroes have movement and attack abilities and a different deck of cards to play their action. The baker can summon new gingerbread every turns. The heroes can fight the gingerbread army: the combat resolution is dice-based with a rock-paper-scissor-based bonus system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 3 scenarios and is replayable since the enemy is also controlled by a player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game name is a wordplay with the cereal brand &amp;quot;Chocapic&amp;quot;, which is why the box does not have a standard game box size but a standard cereal box size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
