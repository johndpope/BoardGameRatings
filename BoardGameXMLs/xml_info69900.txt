							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nile: The Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>Nile: the Dice Game is based on the card game Nile/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nile: the Dice Game, players take on the role of farmers in ancient Egypt. There are five resources that are farmed by all players throughout the game. Players collectively keep track of plagues which eventually end the game. Aside from the seven resource dice, there are three speculation dice which allow players to increase the amount of dice they roll each turn and to modify the results of their dice. Scoring is done as in Nile the card game where your score is equal to the resource of which you have the least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One major difference in Nile: the Dice Game from the original card game is the solo option. In a solo game you are challenging an invisible player whose score increases as you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nile: the Dice Game is fast (10 - 20 minutes), easy to learn, easy to setup and put away, and best of all... FREE!! (at least for now).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
