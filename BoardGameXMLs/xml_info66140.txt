			<description>The players will be able to recognize economic resources and the category type of each one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get two groups of three and four cards of 2 different resource categories. The player determines which cards to keep and discards the extra card. The first player to create two groups of three and four cards places the cards down and must name the two different categories (e.g., capital, labor) shown. The other players refer to a reference card that indicates all the items in their respective categories to verify whether the player is correct. If the player cannot name the two categories, the player on his/her left can name them correctly to win the round. The player with the winning hand gains one point. The game is over when a player reaches a predetermined score. If a time limit is set instead, the winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;42 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
