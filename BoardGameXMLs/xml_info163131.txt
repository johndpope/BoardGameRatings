							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Victory System Character Quick Reference</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I'm Waiting For The Book&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you're trying to get a game together, the last thing you want to hear from everyone at the table is &amp;quot;I'm waiting for the book.&amp;quot;  With all of the options available for special abilities and equipment in the Victory System, that time can really add up!  So, here's a Quick Reference guide to help out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Victory System Character Quick Reference contains all of the charts and tables from the Victory System Core Rulebook necessary for putting a character together, from the generation of statistics through buying equipment and getting your Magic Spells, Martial Arts, Mechanica, Powers, and Psionic Disciplines (if any).  Also included is a back page full of handy charts and rules to help the players out once the game has started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book has been produced to be printer friendly; a minimum of graphics, and none of the text descriptions or rules behind the charts.  This will supplement the Victory System Core Rulebook, but you'll still want one of those for clarification and description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speed things up... grab a Quick Reference and go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
