			<description>game cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your name is David Walker. You are a member of the Apollo XIX crew. On what should have been a routine assignment. You are sent to the moon's surface to collect information about unexpected seismic events detected there. But something goes horribly wrong. As you near completion of your task, an alien ship descends on your crew and opens fire. You watch your fellow crewmen die in an instant, and you find yourself taken prisoner to a secret alien world right in Earth's backyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that's just the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something older than the cosmos itself has chosen you to be the carrier of an ancient legacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your true mission and purpose is still unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
