							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Attack of the Plant People</name>
									
			<description>A two to four player abstract tactical game published in Warhawks magazine #6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the roles of up to four terrible 'Plant People', each with a different special power.  Players alternate placing their vines on the board.  When a square is surrounded on three sides it forms a pod (worth 3 points in combat).  Players have either 8 or 12 pods depending on their special power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When opponent's vines touch, there is combat... loser must remove all of the vines being attacked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to completely choke out all other player's vines and pods, forcing them off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
