			<description>This rare game by Springbok - the &amp;quot;Puzzle People&amp;quot; - is a Solitaire Word Game created by John O. Nilan and published in 1968-69. The object is to start with a &amp;quot;Key Phrase&amp;quot; running vertically on the board, then &amp;quot;build&amp;quot; words from left to right from the Key Phrase - continually building and re-building until you use all 200 letters. There is even a Double Alphabok game which can be played by two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete game includes: Board (w/Non-Slip surface), 48-Page Instruction book (Includes 12 pages of rules, tips, Key Phrases and examples with remaining pages for recording completed games), plastic Sorting Platform/Holding Tray(also holds board &amp;amp; instruction book) and at least 200 Letter Squares (With Non-Slip backing to prevent sliding on board - Game only calls for 200 Letter Squares, but the game usually had extras included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
