			<description>The world has been infected with the Madness Virus which has begun turning the population into blood-thirsty zombies. Help find the antidote formula and save the world before it's too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madness is a fast-paced card game for 2 or 4 players ages 9 and up. There are no turns in the game and so players must think and play quickly in order to win. Match your ingredient cards to the ever-changing MADNESS formula before your opponent matches theirs - But be careful, if you select an incorrect formula you lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
