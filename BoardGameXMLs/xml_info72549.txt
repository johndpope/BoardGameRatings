			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A PS2 game based on the comic book and animated television series carrying the same name. The Japanese title means &amp;quot;Ultimate Weapon Girlfriend&amp;quot;. It's the love story between a tall but sociallly clumsy high school boy and a very timid, physically weak and short girl. Before long, it turns out that the girl, Chise, has gone through a military top secret experiment and has been turned into the Ultimate Weapon; when danger looms, she reacts instantly and instinctively, produces metal mech parts out of her body, can fly and fire all sorts of weapons. Chise has only limited control over these functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is an interactive fiction adventure, where the player goes through the comic book story step by step in simple game scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
