							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Horde</name>
									
			<description>The Horde is a hybrid action-strategy video game developed by Toys For Bob and published by Crystal Dynamics in 1994. It was originally released on the 3DO platform, but was soon after ported to the Sega Saturn console and computers running MS-DOS. It was an unusual hybrid of action and strategy game for the time. It also featured full-motion video sequences featuring a number of actors including Kirk Cameron as Chauncey and Michael Gregory as Kronus Maelor. Video sequences were reduced to slideshows (with full sound) in some versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was bundled with the RealMagic MPEG playback card as a demonstration of the card's abilities to play back full motion MPEG video via the card's hardware decoder, at the time software MPEG decoding was not viable due to the lack of processing power in contemporary processers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The music was composed by Burke Trieschmann and won Computer Gaming World's Premiere Award for Best Musical Score in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Horde&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
