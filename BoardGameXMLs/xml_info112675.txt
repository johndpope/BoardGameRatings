			<description>Severed Union 1861-1865 is a historical miniature war-game, which is the first release from Gordon &amp;amp; Hague War-games.  The game uses 10mm pre-painted war-game miniatures to allow players to relive the greatest battles of the American Civil War.  This game is a turn based in which each player will take turns moving, firing and charging.  There are multiple ways to win according to what style of game you are playing.  There are &amp;quot;take and hold&amp;quot; battles where you must capture key objectives around the battlefield in a specified amount of turns or simply play a &amp;quot;total destruction&amp;quot; game where you must destroy the enemy and run them from the tabletop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The miniatures are 10mm in scale and pre-painted and are ready for battle right out of the box.  The Severed Union Rulebook is free to download from our the Gordon &amp;amp; Hague website.  There is an advanced 40 page rulebook for veteran war-gamers and there is also a 4 page quick-start rulebook for newcomers and children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics are based mainly around dice rolling and measuring.  Maneuvering your units is also very important as you receive bonuses for being on high-ground and in or behind protective cover such as fences, buildings and forests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
