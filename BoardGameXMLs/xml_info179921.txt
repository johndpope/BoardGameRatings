			<description>A lightweight, 2-player game of Time Travel and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draft technology cards each round to keep them to use as influence, or to bid on later in the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then travel back in time, bidding their influence on establishing technologies to buildup the timeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players return to the present day to draft new techs, and build off the old ones, carefully selecting technologies that benefit them the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the third round players gain victory points for techs they influenced, and dependency bonuses are paid out to the owner of supporting technologies. The player with the highest victory point total is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
