							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steve Garvey&#039;s Superstar Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Steve Garvey's Superstar Baseball is a baseball-themed dice game not a baseball simulation. The game is divided into five parts: hitting ground balls, bunting, hit and run play, base running, and power hitting. In every case, a player takes a turn by rolling the four dice and checking the appropriate table for the results. A player could score one or two points each turn. The player who has more points at the end of the game wins. The game comes with magnetic ball and magnetic players, dice, and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
