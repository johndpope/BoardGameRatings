			<description>&amp;quot;Simple World War I Naval Combat rules. Map, counters, and dice game.&amp;quot; Played on a hex map showing sea and land hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: The rules specify that each hex is 600 feet across (one Nautical mile = 10 hexes), each round is one minute, and each counter is one ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players alternate moving one ship at a time. The players may have any of their ships fire some or all of their guns at any time. A gun battery can only be fired once per turn. When all ships have moved once, the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics, including unit costs, are included for over twenty  ships and submarines of the British and German fleets, as well as for shore batteries and mine fields. The rules cover factors such as anti-submarine warfare, aircraft, aircraft carriers, hidden u-boat movement, and torpedoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
