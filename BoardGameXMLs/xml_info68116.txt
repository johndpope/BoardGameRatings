			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orcs of H&amp;acirc;rn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gargun (also called orcs and Foulspawn) reside in the high mountainous areas of H&amp;acirc;rn, where they squabble, maim, kill, and cannibalize each other, or any other species they encounter. The book provides details on Gargun culture, maps of four orc colonies, and six related adventure scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bwaft&lt;br/&gt;A natural cave complex situated high in rugged mountains. After centuries of relative peace, the Gargun of Bwaft find themselves involved in a vicious war with the nearby Gargun of Huxuth. &amp;quot;A Walk Among Tombstones&amp;quot; involves the players in this war, while &amp;quot;Dead of Night&amp;quot; provides them the chance to enrich themselves at the expense of Bwaft's inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ejatus&lt;br/&gt;A cave complex with Araki (small orc) population rules by a Khanu (great orc) elite. These Khanu are highly-organized and dangerous, as anyone involved in the &amp;quot;Dance at the Slaughterhouse&amp;quot; scenario will soon discover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fana&lt;br/&gt;A rich silver mine seized by Gargun six centuries ago, and still held by them despite dozens of attempts at recapture by the dwarves of Azadmere. The orcs of Fana traditionally skirmish with nearby orc colonies, and are always a menace to traverler. &amp;quot;The Last Worst Hope&amp;quot; deals with another dwarven attempt to retake Fana&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Korego&lt;br/&gt;The oldest and largest Gargun colony on H&amp;acirc;rn. The orcs of Korego have a long history of conflict with both the local human tribesmen and merchant caravans. &amp;quot;We Deal in Steel&amp;quot; is a mystery involving arms-running. &amp;quot;To Live and Die in Korego&amp;quot; gives the players a rescue mission in which some things are not what they appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
