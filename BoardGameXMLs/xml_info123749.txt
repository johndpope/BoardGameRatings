							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Army of Civilisation</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Army of Civilisation also contains conversions of all the spells you could need to sway your battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humankind has not the industriousness of dwarves, the savagery of orcs nor the arcane knowledge and eternity of the elvenkind. Men have no one thing that makes them shine above the other demihuman races, they are not beautiful, they are not giants, their senses are dulled compared to their companion humanoids, their minds weaker, they lifespan fleeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what humans do have are towns, villages, cities, kingdoms and empires. Man builds communities; he transmits knowledge from one generation to the next. He creates gods, he creates traditions, he creates history and, so short lived, he strives to leave his mark upon the world before he passes beyond it through deeds and accomplishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man creates civilisation in all its trappings, the inheritors of the land. Man's armies are organised, powerful, working together. Man is the jack-of-all-trades of the races, master of none, but able to work together to create accomplishments that no other race can. Where they are one dimensional, focussed, exaggerations of some aspect of the spirit of man only he is whole, one, able to bring every part of himself to bear in peace of conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man's armies are innovative, adaptable, disciplined. Working together in faith they can stand against a much greater force and destroy it, simply by holding steadfast. Their adaptable, flexible nature gives them a depth to their force that no other race, no matter how ancient or savage, can hope to destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man has spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
