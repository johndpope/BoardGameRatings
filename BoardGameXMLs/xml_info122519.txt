							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holes Wild Miniature Combat</name>
									
			<description>In the mid-2000's, something is opening Holes, corridors into other dimensions, which are destroying the Earth's ecological balance. These passages are filled with hostile aliens and mechanical life-forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective as a Trained Holebusting Operative is to get to the core and destroy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holes has a wicked sense of humor, with such hostile and funky aliens as Brats, Kagoody, Klowns, Zonies, and Rats. It's a great beer and peanuts game, and lavishly illustrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a cross between an RPG and a miniatures game. Players command a squad of 12 humans as they battle their way into a  randomly generated maze of corridors. The game uses a d100 for all combat resolution and lets players choose a few modifiers if they want to expand the No-Frills Combat System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
