							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pomors</name>
									
			<description>The Pomors are the people, who live on the coast of the White sea, or how it was called in the past, Mare Album in the North of Russia. You take the role of brave fishermen, who send their ships to fish and to hunt marine animals at the White sea. You have information about fish stocks, you should wisely use it and send your ships to the best fishing places. You can also try to get ahead of your rivals, by going further than any other into the sea and getting the biggest catch. But don&amp;rsquo;t forget, that sea weather often changes and the storm can cause damage to your ship!&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, in those old times, the only way to keep the catch was to salt fish in barrels. So, along with fish, the Pomors need salt. If your options are limited at the moment, you can stop fishing and sell your salt to the other fishermen. If you correctly set the salt price, you will not only repair your broken ships but also get good earnings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
