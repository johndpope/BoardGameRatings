							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ty Beanie Boo&#039;s Coconut</name>
									
			<description>Ty plush characters are playing hide and seek. Peek under the coconut halves to find them!&lt;br/&gt;Ty Beanie Boos Coconut features 16 playing pieces that look like colorful coconuts halves. When players turn the Coconut playing pieces over, each piece shows either a blue or pink background color. Careful, don&amp;rsquo;t turn over the piece that shows the Bat, he&amp;rsquo;s trying to eat all your Coconuts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players push the die popper, which indicates whether the player needs to find a blue or pink Coconut during their turn. Choose your Coconut and turn it over. If it matches the die, it is yours. If a player turns over the Bat, they must put back one of their Coconut pieces and mix-up the remaining pieces. Collect the most Coconuts pieces to win. The chunky plastic pieces are easy to handle for young players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
