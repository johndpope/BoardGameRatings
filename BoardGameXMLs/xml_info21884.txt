			<description>This game was created by a speech pathologist to ensure that conversation doesn't become a lost art.  The designer found that children that are not used to adult conversation will often reply to questions with one-word answers or an answer not related to what the question that they were asked.  The game is also helpful for adults that have had strokes, brain injuries, or are attempting to relearn or expand their language skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player lands on certain colored game board squares in a train track format, a player chooses one of 240 question cards, divided into the four corresponding color categories of &amp;quot;Wh- Questions, &amp;quot;If I...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tell about...&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;How do you...&amp;quot;.  The game cards have three levels: kids, adults, and both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The companion workbook called ConverStation Graphic Expression teaches people when to express themselves in writing versus conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board game hit the market in June 2005, winning the 2005 Preferred Choice Award from Creative Child magazine as a Toy of the Year Finalist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is published by Say It Right, a small press educational publisher based in Tybee Island, Georgia.  Their website is &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.sayitright.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.sayitright.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
