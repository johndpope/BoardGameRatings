			<description>Each player drives his car on the border of the board. You can start having parkingplaces on the streets of the different cities. Later you can expand there building parkings with several layers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With more layers you get more revenue when other players park in your parking.When a parking has 3 layers it cannot have a hostile take-over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get points by having parkings with 3 layers (1 point each parking), points by having special strategycards (with P1 bonus of 1 point) and by completing your mission card you got at the start of the game (1,2 or 3 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with 11 (2 players), 7 ( 3 players) or with 5 (4 players) points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
