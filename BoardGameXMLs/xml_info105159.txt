							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kid Icarus: Uprising</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;One of the most beloved franchises in Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s long history makes its glorious&lt;br/&gt;return in spectacular 3D. Pit of Kid Icarus&amp;trade; fame is back in a new&lt;br/&gt;game designed specifically for the Nintendo 3DS system by Masahiro Sakurai,&lt;br/&gt;creator of the Kirby&amp;trade; and Super Smash Bros.&amp;trade; franchises, and his development&lt;br/&gt;team at Project Sora. Kid Icarus: Uprising is a fast-paced and actionpacked&lt;br/&gt;blend of aerial and ground-based shooting built on elegantly intuitive&lt;br/&gt;and streamlined play control. This follow-up to the original Kid Icarus &amp;ndash;&lt;br/&gt;released for the Nintendo Entertainment System&amp;trade; in 1987 &amp;ndash; has been at the&lt;br/&gt;top of gamers&amp;rsquo; wish lists for years.&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Fast-paced and action-packed from the streets to the skies&lt;br/&gt;○ Boasting game play that is easy to pick up but incredibly deep, the&lt;br/&gt;game is sure to satisfy novice gamers as well as fans who have been&lt;br/&gt;clamoring for a new installment in the franchise. The hero, Pit, teams up&lt;br/&gt;with Palutena, the goddess of light, who bestows on him the miracle of&lt;br/&gt;flight for limited stretches. With this gift, Pit soars through the skies,&lt;br/&gt;shooting down swarms of enemies, then alights and engages in frantic&lt;br/&gt;ground-based battles against Medusa&amp;rsquo;s underworld army.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Items, weapons and upgrades galore offer an incredibly deep&lt;br/&gt;experience&lt;br/&gt;○ Find and collect numerous weapons and items that offer bonuses&lt;br/&gt;and ability boosts. Players can choose weapons before they send Pit&lt;br/&gt;into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level.&lt;br/&gt;○ Players can choose between a basic Blade, basic Claws and a basic&lt;br/&gt;Orbitar weapon. Blades are well-balanced, Claws have limited reach&lt;br/&gt;but increase running speed and the Orbitars can shoot two shots that&lt;br/&gt;grow in power over distance.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: From the Official Press Release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
