			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cult of Fane - a 3.5 OGL fantasy adventure for 1st Level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of Fane has stood as a brooding monument overlooking the old mountain path between the village of Mazula and Olthorn for a thousand years. Once home to Fane, a powerful wizard who made war on the people of south and who wreaked his terror upon them, he was eventually defeated and trapped in his tower. A terrible curse was put upon that place - that he should never again walk upon the lands of Arrasia and would remain locked in his tower for all eternity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;News, therefore, of lights having been seen above the old tower and the mysterious disappearance of some of the folk of Mazula have set tongues wagging. Now kobolds have appeared in the mountains and people remember the legend: when kobolds return below the tower of lore, so will the evil Fane be Lord once more. So it is with suspicious eyes that the people now turn their attention toward the sinister Cult of Fane who live in the old mansion on the hill overlooking Mazula, as they have done for hundreds of years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the old tales of the Curse of Fane be true? Has the time now come when he will rise from the ashes and renew his ancient war, beginning once again the nightmare of the past?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So begins the experience of a lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cult of Fane can be played as part of The Last Mage of Mount Fane Trilogy or as an independant, stand alone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Details:&lt;br/&gt;- a 3.5 OGL fantasy adventure for 1st level characters by Keith Robinson&lt;br/&gt;- illustrated by Gillian Pearce and Danilo Moretti&lt;br/&gt;- cover art by Anne Stokes&lt;br/&gt;- cartography by Keith Robinson&lt;br/&gt;- 53 pages, including 11 illustrations, 8 maps, player handouts and a bonus trilogy map!&lt;br/&gt;- fully bookmarked PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
