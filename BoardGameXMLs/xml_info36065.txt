							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">French Revolution</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game for 2+ players. Simulation of the French Revolution (starting 1789). Victory: The first player to accumulate 10 Reform points is able to consolidate the Revolution and wins the game. Setup: The most &amp;lsquo;French&amp;rsquo; player begins as the leader of the Revolution.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom card deck made up of five different types of cards: Unrest, Revolutionary Tactics, Reforms, Oppression (Reactionary Tactics), and Anti-Revolutionary. Reform points are scored by first playing Unrest, Tactics, and Oppression Cards to become or remain the leader of the revolution, and then playing Reform Cards, each of which scores one Reform point. Opposing players may negate a Reform card by playing an Anti-Revolutionary card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
