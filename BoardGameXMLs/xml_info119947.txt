			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION ACCOMPLISHED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the original Flying Corps set out in Spring 1997, Empire's aim was clear. To be the best World War I flight simulation ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since then, we've been decorated for our success in the skies, with awards from leading industry names and accolades from devoted players. And now, the best flight simulation has just gotten even better, with Flying Corps Gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See for yourself how breathtaking new advanced add to the challenge of fighting your way through the smoke and thunder of four decisive engagements: The Battle of Cambrai, The Flying Circus, Hat-in-the-Ring, and the climactic Spring Offensive of 1918.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are now seven classic aircraft at your command. The Fokker D-VII joins established favourites, the Albatros DIII, Fokker D.R.I/Triplane, SE5a, Sopwith Camel, Nieuport 28 Scout and Spad XIII. Extensive research, meticulous modeling and advanced programming techniques mean unprecedented historical accuracy - and bring the experience of flying these aircraft to new heights of realism and controllability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This leaves you ready to emulate the success of real World War I aces like Rickenbacker, von Richthofen and Albert Ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below you, the towns, villages, churches and copses of Northern France appear in detail never seen before, based on real aerial photographs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create you own battle scenarios along the Western Front using the new Mission Editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of all, you can now experience the thrills of competing with other players too - either facing them in battle or flying alongside them in squadron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FLYING CORPS GOLD HAS BLOWN THE OPPOSITION OUT OF THE SKY. ARE YOU READY TO DO THE SAME?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astounding 3D high resolution landscapes in 16-bit colour using DirectX&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frame rates in excess of 30fps are possible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Windows 95 Mission Editor fully featured&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supports the CH Products Force FX stick - makes play more realistic and dynamic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single or multiplayer option including modem, direct connect, network and Wireplay for up to eight players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customise the paint schemes on your squadron's aircraft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landscape recreated in minute detail from archive material&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced view system including a new peripheral view mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
