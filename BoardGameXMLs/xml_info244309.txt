							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rockyhill Badlands</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rockyhill Badlands is a set of 25 inter-linked encounters, with their own d100 Random Encounter table. They are meant to create an individual, named region for a GM that looks for a not-so-nondescript area to put his or her next post-apocalyptic dungeon into. The module alone may be used as a free-form hexcrawl with a few ruins to explore and plunder, and a brief adventure hook is included in the end of the PDF as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factions and individual monsters/monster groups are part of the mix [all marked with an &amp;ldquo;(i)&amp;rdquo;]. If such are rolled a second time, they should either be re-rolled  or will have a different outcome the second time (as the PC are interacting with a certain group within the area).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the monsters encountered are part of the Mutant Future(tm) core rules (and refered to by page number), but a handful of new &amp;ldquo;creations&amp;rdquo; are introduced as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Rockyhill Badlands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
