							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What!? My Neighbors Are Demons!!?</name>
									
			<description>Developer Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, poor Selene! It seems our protagonist was a bit too rough with her ex-boyfriend following high school. After being incapable of putting up with Selene&amp;rsquo;s insatiable lust, he decided to break off their relationship. Traumatized from being dumped, Selene became afraid of herself and has chosen to keep the lustful side of her personality locked away deep within her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now in college and living on her own, she has been mostly successful in this endeavor despite a few strange friendships and some lonely nights. Her resolve begins to wane, however, as the woman&amp;rsquo;s calm and solitary life get turned upside down by supernatural forces. Twin demons (a succubus and an incubus), secretly parading as humans, have moved in next to her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the two twins find out that their &amp;ldquo;dear neighbor&amp;rdquo; is having a bit of a personality crisis, their interest in Selene skyrockets. Elated to have a new toy to play with, the demons decide to help in the best way fiendish and mischievous neighbors can&amp;hellip; by making her life just a little more complicated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the twins succeeded in snapping Selene back to her normal self? Or will they make her even worse than she used to be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
