							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Politics</name>
									
			<description>Politics, a new euro styled card game, from No Mana Games. Politics captures the essence of the political arena in a way that is fun and easy to understand.  In politics it isn&amp;rsquo;t just about strategy, it&amp;rsquo;s about how you can manipulate others into handing you a victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Politics support three to five players and plays in under an hour. Players must convince others to back their political agenda while keeping both their allies and enemies in the dark. Politics is based around the principle that nothing in the game can be accomplished without the help of others, but there can be only one winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
