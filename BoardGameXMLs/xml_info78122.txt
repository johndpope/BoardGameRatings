			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dubbed, &amp;quot;The Mother of All Games&amp;quot;, Scorched Earth was a turn-based strategy game where up to 10 human or AI players each controlled a single tank and used a wide variety of different weapons to destroy eachother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game played out in a series of rounds.  Prior to each round, players could purchase weapons, shields, and other items using cash earned from previous rounds.  The gameplay itself consisted primarily of aiming the tank by setting the angle of its barrel and the power of the shot, and then firing the selected weapon artillery-style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons ranged from simple missiles, to napalm, to nuclear bombs, to even the Death's Head, a multiple-warhead weapon capable of obliterating everything onscreen (including the player that fired it) with a single shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scorched Earth was originally developed by Wendell &amp;quot;Sprig&amp;quot; Hicken, and was released as shareware.  The 2D, artillery-based gameplay style was later seen in the popular Worms series of games and numerous others, including several direct clones and &amp;quot;remakes&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
