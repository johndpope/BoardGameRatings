							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Paradise</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Paradise is a sourcebook for Darwin's World that details the Northwest region of the post-Fall United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the fall, the Northwestern region of the United States and Lower Canada was one of the most breathtaking areas on the planet, loved by all who lived amidst the blanket of old growth forests, rivers and mountains. Now the area, known by those who have been there as &amp;quot;The Lost Paradise,&amp;quot; is a poignant reminder of just how much man has lost. The land is more than just ruins and blasted, radiated stretches of land, however. Pureblood human and Mutant alike struggle for survival, eking out a fragile existence in a region rife with dangers ranging from wild beasts, racists and other ideologically intolerant peoples, to inhuman beings bent on the destruction of all who stand in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Paradise is an excellent sourcebook for players who are new to the Post Apocalyptic game setting and also serves well for advanced players looking to start a new Post Apocalyptic campaign, or just more areas to take their existing characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
