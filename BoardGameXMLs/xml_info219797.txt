							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Referee&#039;s Book for the Role Playing Game of Alternate Realities</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Referee's Book exists only as two sections, sequentially enumerated following the Player's Book sections.  It is probable that additional sections were contemplated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Section 8 - Masteries&lt;br/&gt;        Section 9 - Achievements and Improving Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Masteries are discussed at considerable length.  It is apparent that a character's various Masteries were intended to be their most distinctive and powerful features.  Characters were assumed to improve through a basic experience process that would yield increases to Skills (the system is not well developed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document is noted (on almost every page) as &amp;quot;(c) 1984 TSR&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General comments. The manuscript is available for public access in a controlled reading room environment (photography, copies, etc., are not permitted). The loose pages in the manuscript are stored in a folder and the pages are partially unsorted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
