							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sea Stories</name>
									
			<description>Sea Stories is a pirate themed storytelling game for 2-4 players that takes about an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a grid with difficulty ratings surrounded by quick descriptions of the story elements. Start by choosing whether each player will be a Fresh Fish or Salty Dog. On each turn you'll roll the dice and tell a story based on what you roll. The number of story elements you use determines your placement on the board. If the other players catch an interaction you forgot, they'll call hornswaggle and prevent you from placing a piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to get a three-in-a-row wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
