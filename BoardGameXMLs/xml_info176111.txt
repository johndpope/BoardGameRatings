			<description>Bountiful Booty is a push-your-luck, network-building strategy game for 2 pirate captains in-training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of hex-tiles representing islands that players will raid each turn. By playing cards depicting those same islands, players can add an island to their network and gain treasure in the process. They will try to maintain control of as many islands as they can for as long as they can to maximize their booty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When raiding an island players will roll their dice to see how much treasure they'll earn. If a skull is rolled they lose a die and gain no treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with 10 ships and 3 dice. If at any time a player can't place a ship or runs out of dice to roll they have to remove all their ships from the map and they lose all their treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end the player with the most booty wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
