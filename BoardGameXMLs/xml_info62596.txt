			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Goal: Recover Rhiannon&amp;rsquo;s body and soul. Stop Ishaq from opening gateway to spirit world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main Villain: Ishaq the Egyptian Sorcerer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villain&amp;rsquo;s Allies: 200 Norsemen in a longship, given to Ishaq after he had saved the life of their king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre: Action - Thriller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Period: 1121 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting: The village of Baltray, near the town of Droughedha, in the Kingdom of Oriel, Ireland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mood: Ghost story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backstory:&lt;br/&gt;Ishaq, a sorcerer from Egypt, bought a slave girl in Alexandria. After a few years, he fell in love with her and offered her freedom&lt;br/&gt;if she would agree to convert to Islam and marry him. She refused, and in a fit of anger, he went to the place where she lived&lt;br/&gt;and burned it down in a magick conflagration. Afterwards, he was sorry for what he had done. For years he searched for a way to&lt;br/&gt;cheat death in a desire to bring her back from the spirit world. One day, he discovered a way to bring his long lost love back from&lt;br/&gt;the dead.&lt;br/&gt;While gazing into his magick mirror that was a window into the spirit realm, he made a pact with fearsome beings of evil.&lt;br/&gt;Creatures of pure hatred, they exhisted solely as dark shadows, whispering in loneliness. The beings asked Ishaq for a way to break&lt;br/&gt;free of their prison in the netherworld, in exchange for information on how to bring back his lover. Ishaq readily agreed.&lt;br/&gt;Ishaq has long been in search of holy relics, hoping to find one that can be used to house a soul. After saving the life of a Norse&lt;br/&gt;prince, he was given a ship and 200 men to do with as he would in reward. Ishaq has used the raiders to attack a series of churches,&lt;br/&gt;in search of an appropriate relic.&lt;br/&gt;Then he learnt of the small town of Baltray, just to the north of the town, Droughedha in the Kingdom of Oriel in Ireland.&lt;br/&gt;Baltray has an ancient church that was converted from a pagan house of worship long ago, and it houses a Holy relic, a golden chalice,&lt;br/&gt;that he hopes to use in his dark magick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
