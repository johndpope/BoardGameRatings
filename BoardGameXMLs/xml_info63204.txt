			<description>This is a simple dice game, supposedly taking place in a Las Vegas casino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 dice (green, blue, red) with corresponding rows on the game board; at the start of a turn, each player in turn places their pawn on one of the 18 possible results, and all the dice are rolled. A pawn on the right number of the right colour wins the bet times 2, a pawn on the right number but wrong colour gives wins the bet times 1, and a pawn on a completely wrong space wins nothing and loses the bet also. Multipliers are cumulative, so the maximum is 4, if all three dice show the same number and the player has his pawn on that very number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 100 chips of three different denominations, for use in betting. Each player starts with 10 &amp;quot;marks&amp;quot;, minimum bet is 1 mark, and the game ends when there are no more chips in the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules actually suggest a gambling variant for adults, where the players &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; the starting chips with real cash to form a bank which is then shared between the players in relation to the value of the chips they won during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
