			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bonds of Blood and Honour&amp;quot; is an introductory adventure for A Game of Thrones RPG. It is structured around the &amp;quot;Noble House&amp;quot; campaign style. It is not completely scripted, and requires the GM to fl esh out certain details and make important decisions about some aspects of the plot. Additionally, it does not provide stat write-ups for the major NPCs, instead referring to the sample NPCs from the core rulebook. Note that the adventure is written for the d20-based Open Gaming rules, but includes the corresponding Tri-Stat System rules [italicised, in brackets], when appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure assumes that all of the player characters are loyal retainers of or nobles related to House Locke of Oldcastle, a minor house of the North. The players can either use the pre-generated characters found with this adventure, or create new characters to fit into House Locke. House Locke is not detailed in the core rulebook, but is a minor house, similar to House Umber. Its chief members are described herein under Personalities of House Locke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
