			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;Redream is a storytelling card game that takes unfinished and abandoned dreams and allows us to give them their resolution by shifting the elements and audience of the dream. You won't be dreaming your own dream. Some one else will be dreaming it for you just as you'll be dreaming another person's dream. Elements from all everyone's dreams will be mixed together and redistributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a spiritual perspective, by switching positions from dreamer to audience, your dream is freed from the confines of your sensibilities and preconceived ideas. Now it can to roam free to convey its message and find resolution. Moreover from your new perspective you are free to see new facets of your dream as it grows and gain insight and enjoyment. From a fun storytelling game perspective, you get neat opportunities to explore elements of unusual stories and game mechanics to encourage interaction and friendly competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Note: A Game Chef 2015 finalist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
