			<description>This is the game Groups adapted to a Byzantine Chessboard, with 8 pieces aside, instead of 6, as seen in Groups.  In this game players attempt to get their pieces on the board connected into a single group of orthogonally (vertically and/or horizontally) connected pieces, after being connected diagonally only. Pieces start out adjacent to one another, and a player's pieces are all connected diagonally at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, pieces move orthgonally, and stop on an empty space, with players alternating moves one piece at a time until one player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omada is Greek for the word &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
