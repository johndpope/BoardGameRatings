			<description>snippet from the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are W.W.II era Wargames rules using alternate movement and firing. There are limited written orders to enable the command structure, radio links, call of fire etc to be reproduced without slowing the game down.&lt;br/&gt;Limited ammunition is also a feature of the rules, which means players make their shots count, and don't waste time and effort firing at everything in sight like in an arcade game. Coupled with the command structure, artillery and air strikes are called where they are needed most, and not used every turn just because you have them.&lt;br/&gt;Vehicle damage can be cumulative as well as a straight KO, for example a Sherman tank cannot KO a Tiger tank through it's frontal armour at all. The Sherman must get around the side or rear. However there is a remote chance of a lucky hit causing track damage, or a turret jam. The chances are slim, and with limited ammunition are you going to take the chance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aircraft, anti-aircraft and air to air combat are covered but extremely simplified to get a quick result as this is a ground battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an easy to use variable ground scale, so a game can be quickly adapted for a small or large gaming area, or the use of different scale figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules use a scale where 1 figure represents 1 man and 1 model represents 1 vehicle. Typical 15mm and 20mm scale battles require 50 to 120 figures, and 10 to 20 vehicles with no upper limit. Numbers can be in the 100's if 6mm scale is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a points system for those who need one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
