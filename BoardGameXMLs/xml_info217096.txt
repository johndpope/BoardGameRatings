			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all thought about it. What would we build if we could create our perfect city? The only problem is you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. The hipsters, preppies, soccer parents, and rednecks all want in. In Urban Tribes, you control one of these factions and compete for cultural influence over the town. Build businesses and cultural institutions, secure city council seats, and watch your pile of cash and cultural influence grow over time. Strike deals with other players to launch joint projects one moment, like a Yoga Studio for the Hipsters and Preppies or a Scout Hall for the Rednecks and Soccer Parents. In the next moment, use event cards to send lawsuits and campaign attack ads to undermine your opponents&amp;rsquo; best laid plans. After all, only one tribe will end up with the city of their dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban Tribes took first place at the 2016 KublaCon Game Design contest. It is a combination negotiation, territory control, and resource management game for 2-4 players. The territories are sections of town and the resources are Cash, Mojo (the unit of cultural influence), and City Council Seats/Building Permits. The optimal strategy is highly contingent on the actions of your opponents but will certainly include the premise of coopetition &amp;ndash; choosing the right time to partner with which opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
