			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;A classic 1920's era Call of Cthluhu scenario, set in Japan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Setting the Scene:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Dear Sir/Madam,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        It is our sad duty to inform you that Mr Seth Acres, of British origin but a resident of Japan of late, has recently passed away. We know this must come as a great shock to you, and we offer our deepest condolences. As executors of the late Mr Acres' estate, we invite you to attend the reading of his will at his former residence on Kuroiyama Island, near Tokyo Japan. Mr Acres has made provision for all your travel costs, and has already contacted your employers regarding this matter. While we cannot as yet disclose the details of the will, Mr Acres was quite insistent that your attendance at the reading of his will would be highly rewarding. The late Mr Acres left meticulous instructions on the execution of his affairs and following the terms of his will, should you not attend his estate in person, your inheritance shall be distributed among the remaining benefactors. Your passage to Japan and local accommodation before you reach the Acres estate has already been arranged. Please embark from pier 14 on Monday, May the 3rd, at 8 am. Your fare has already been paid, and a car will come to your home for your bags at 6am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        We look forward to seeing you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Yours Faithfully, &lt;br/&gt;        Willhelm Speegle &lt;br/&gt;        Speegle and Sayo &lt;br/&gt;        1-3-7 Shinjuku, Tokyo &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
