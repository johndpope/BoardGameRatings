							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ten Million Year FilmCow Wars Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Ten Million Year FilmCow Wars is a card game starring many of your favorite and least favorite FilmCow characters. It can be played by 2-4 people, and each game lasts around 15-30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you score more points than your friends and/or bus stop acquaintances? I have no idea, maybe. I am not a mystical seer. The veil of time covers even my eyes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by drawing s hand of cards and choosing one to play and one to discard. Each card falls into one of 5 color coded &amp;quot;suites&amp;quot;. The first player to collect one of each suit wins the game. Each card features conditions such as requirements to play, or effects that happen once in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
