							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tri-Animals</name>
									
			<description>This game is designed so that each player starts with six triangular-shaped cards.  Each card, at the tips has a number that must match the card that it is laid down next to, as you strive to empty your hand of cards.  For the 'younger set' there are animals, ranging from sharks to ladybugs, and it, of course, includes dinosaurs.  This way, for kids too young to know their numbers, they can play using the animals as 'the key' to matching their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turn matching one card, if no match is possible they must draw cards from the 'tile card pool,' until there is a match, then play continues to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when when one of the players runs out of cards.  That person is considered the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
