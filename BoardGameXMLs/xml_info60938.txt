							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Karmic Races: Gnomes</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the world was young, the mortal races struggled to survive.  Struggling just to find food and shelter, the mortal races were unable to achieve their full potential.  To speed them on their way to advancement, the powerful Daimonia created the first gnomes.  With their exceptional intellect and innate understanding of mechanics, the gnomes helped guide the early mortals out of the dark ages and into a silver age of technology.  But war and betrayal forced the gnomes deep into hiding, until the world was ready for them to emerge once more and drag the other races kicking and screaming into another new age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karmic Races: Gnomes presents the gnomes as you always knew them, and in ways you never considered.  From the primative Chorcki to the murderous Vaettir to, from city-dwelling Erdeist engineers to forest-dwelling Nomes in tree towns, this supplement offers a new perspective on the gnomish race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn about Gnomish physiology, childhood development, their unique powers, and much more.  Designed for the Karma Roleplaying System, the background information in this supplement can be useful in almost any fantasy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
