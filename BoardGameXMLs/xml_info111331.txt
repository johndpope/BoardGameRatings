							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pit Fighting in the Kingdom of Tursh</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the Kingdom of Beilean and, in fact, throughout many lands, there are a group of individuals whose entire life is spent in constant battle for the enjoyment of an audience. These people can range from criminals who fight for their innocence, champions who fight in stead of their employer, slaves who kill and maim to stay alive and entertain their masters, to brawlers and street fighters who pummel each other in taverns and local faires for a few coins or just the joy of a good fight.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;For the rare few who live in the pits and arenas long enough, they develop skills and abilities that exemplify the up close and deadly art of their profession. The pit fighter template represents what would be called a professional pit fighter or gladiator. For whatever reason, these individuals have chosen to remain (or simply survived and evolved) in one of the most deadly professions imaginable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
