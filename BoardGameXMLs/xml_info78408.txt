							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rings of Medusa</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rings of Medusa was ported to many different formats, including the Amiga (for which it was actually originally created), the Commodore 64, and the Atari. The fantasy setting deals with the Greek mythology, such as the gorgon, Medusa.&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of the son of the king of the realm. His father has become defunct and Medusa, the evil gorgon sorceress, has taken control of the land and is exploiting the king's subjects. A number of magical rings are hidden in the land. These powerful artifacts give their owner the power to defeat the gorgon. This will ultimately be the goal of the player, thereby reclaiming the land. &lt;br/&gt;In the beginning, the game will be about trading and business, enabling the player to raise enough funds to build an army. Once the army has been raised, the game will focus more on strategy. By defeating Medusa's armies, the player will have the rings within reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trivia: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    When no name is entered by te player, the default name of the character will be &amp;quot;Darkvale&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;    The soundtrack is from Jochen Hippel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
