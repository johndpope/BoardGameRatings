							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raze&#039;s Hell</name>
									
			<description>For centuries the Kewletts, a cute and happy race, lived an idyllic existence inside the hallowed walls of Kewtopia. They never mingled with the creatures and beasts outside the gates of their city. They never ventured forth from their perfect world for any reason whatsoever due to the fact that they had everything they needed inside: a wonderful princess, perfect weather, wealth, privilege, the whole enchilada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then one day, the Princess made a momentous and somewhat surprising announcement : the Kewletts for the first time in their history would venture beyond their borders for the grand purpose to purify the &amp;quot;ugly&amp;quot; from the rest of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kewletts' increasingly vicious colonization efforts are going along swimmingly until they run into Raze, an ugly, simple beast who is transformed when he accidentally stumbles upon some ancient artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Raze's heroics spark a swelling underground guerrilla movement, the Kewletts realize they have a real fight on their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Raze's Hell,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
