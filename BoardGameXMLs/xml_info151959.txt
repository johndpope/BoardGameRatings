							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Novelist</name>
									
			<description>The Novelist asks one central question: can you achieve your dreams without pushing away the people you love? The game focuses on Dan Kaplan, a novelist struggling to write the most important book of his career while trying to be the best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal home for the summer, unaware that they&amp;rsquo;re sharing the house with a mysterious ghostly presence: you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read the family&amp;rsquo;s thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you can&amp;rsquo;t help the Kaplans if they know there&amp;rsquo;s a ghost in the house. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to decide how Dan&amp;rsquo;s career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy answers, and every choice has a cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dan&amp;rsquo;s relationships &amp;ndash; to his work, his wife, and his son &amp;ndash; react and shift in response to your choices. With a different sequence of events in every playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each time you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decisions you make will define the Kaplans&amp;rsquo; lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
