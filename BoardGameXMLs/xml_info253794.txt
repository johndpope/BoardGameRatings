			<description>CastQuest is a description based, strategic party game with a touch of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to describe random combinations of creatures, their weapons, and the armour they wear without using the words written on the cards. If this is done correctly, you are awarded with cards from a deck of 'Fate Cards' that contain spells to help yourself progress, curses to make it harder for your opponents, and separate elements to a quest... you need these in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quest elements are made up of 'WHO', 'WHAT', and 'WHERE' - once you've collected a sequence, and successfully described/guessed enough combinations of Creature, Weapon, and Armour - you enter into the victory round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VICTORY ROUND:&lt;br/&gt;Embark upon a quickfire guessing round against a chosen opponent in order to revisit the previous creature, weapon and armour cards from the game. A third player describes this time, but can only use one word to do so - so make sure you're paying attention to everyone's description rounds throughout the game, as it may come in handy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are the one attempting victory and get more correct quickfire guesses than your defending opponent, you have successfully Cast your Quest, and won the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
