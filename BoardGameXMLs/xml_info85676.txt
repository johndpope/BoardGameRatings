							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Plains</name>
									
			<description>Three Plains is a print and play tabletop fantasy wargame, where two or more players compete against each other with &amp;quot;armies&amp;quot; consisting of small figures, which are down loaded and printed off and assembled by the players themselves. All the general rules are described in this eBook and the rules themselves are designed to be used on a tabletop gaming board surface, simulating combat on a battle in a balanced and fair manner. However, games may be played on any appropriate surface, although the standard is a 1 metre by 2 metre tabletop decorated with model scenery in scale with the miniatures. Any individual or group of miniatures in the game is called a &amp;quot;Playing Piece&amp;quot;, whether represented by a single model, or group of similar troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Plains is largely set on the Middle Plain, on the World of 'Many' Names, so called because no race will acknowledge any of the other races titles. Although all have a word for &amp;lsquo;Many&amp;rsquo; and over the years Many has become the bilingual name for their World. The World of Many much resembles an ancient earth long past, with warlords running amuck and empires throwing their weight around and there are some great individuals, who are commonly known as Hero&amp;rsquo;s, Lords and Wizards who face each other on the field of battle usually fighting to the death. This world also has its share of Beasts too, Dragons, Ogres, Wyverns and hundreds more roam and terrorise the lands of Many plaguing the younger races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
