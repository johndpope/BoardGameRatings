							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkest December</name>
									
			<description>Note: There is a 2004 game entry with the same name, but that is the version for ATS (Advanced Tobruk System). This listing is for ASL (Advanced Squad Leader) version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically this apears to be a reprint with upgrades combining two previously published modules from Critical Hit into one.  The modules are: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Devils in the Woods: The Battle of the Bulge 1944&lt;br/&gt;(2) Sudden Full Contact: The Battle of the Bulge 1944&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;Moving images of the Battle of the Bulge often include German soldiers in their long greatcoat scuttling across the fields from their dark forest lairs, the men of the Volksgrenadier divisions. Now YOU can push cardboard around while you play out the epic stand at Hotton on three fully remastered maps from Devils In the Woods/Sudden Full Contact in one updated edition that includes bonus counters and a total of 20 scenarios in all. All of the scenarios are laid out in the new format and owners of our recent Nordic Twilight/BDF II releases should have all the combat counters needed to play without needing to dig into their standard-issue collection when combined with the new counters provided with ASLComp DARKEST DECEMBER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 2 counters sheets and three historical maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
