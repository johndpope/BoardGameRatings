							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twisted Po-Ke-No</name>
									
			<description>It's all in the luck of the cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player places a chip on their Po-Ke-No board as cards are drawn and called out, hoping to be the first player to get a straight line, 4 corners, center or even a cover all.  Just when a player thinks he is going to win-OUCH-someone draws a joker, One-Eyed Jack, Ace of Spades or even a Two, now everything changes and the game is totally TWISTED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This zany variation of the original Po-Ke-No Game will provide endless hours of family fun!  Easy to learn and easy to play, Twisted Po-Ke-No is fun, wacky and a delightfully different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
