			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard Living Spycraft tournament for a team of up to six 1st-level agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agency has many enemies, and some of them seek victory by obtaining sophisticated technological edges. One of them, which for now shall remain nameless, has managed to plant several moles within the Agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kurata Matarou, an Agency &amp;ldquo;procurer&amp;quot; stationed in Tokyo, is one such mole. The Agency&amp;rsquo;s enemies contacted Kurata and recruited him with a great deal of money. Kurata now covertly secures advances from various high-tech companies in Tokyo during Agency &amp;ldquo;investigations.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kurata's superiors recently ordered him to investigate Surada Technologies, which was working on the development of a sensor processing chip capable of making ultrafast adjustments based on variable input. The Agency believed this chip would prove useful in improving its standard-issue chameleon suit, permitting it to maintain invisibility even in poor-weather conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
