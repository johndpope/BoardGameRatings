							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Tank</name>
									
			<description>Death Tank is a 2D multiplayer versus shooter, set on a hilly terrain. Although similar to Scorched Earth, Worms, or Gunbound the gameplay is real time instead of turn-based. It supports up to 7 differently-colored tanks with a range of weapons to battle it out. The terrain on which this occurs, an ever-decreasing yellow landscape, is completely obliterated by the players during gameplay or otherwise gradually whittles down to a flat plain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreisbach, working with Snowblind Studios, developed a standalone version of the game for Xbox Live Arcade. It was released on Wednesday, February 18, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A version of Death Tank Zwei is included as an extra in this release, which can be unlocked by shooting down a supply plane in the main game. There are a number of minor differences between this new version and the original; it lacks the title screen (and Death Tank theme), options and player selection screens. The game has an upper limit of four players (instead of the original seven), and there are a number of changes to the names of the weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Death tank&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
