			<description>Rally On is a rally racing tabletop game that uses a risk and reward dice system to play out events during each rally stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rally On has been a dream of mine for the last five years. I have always been an avid rally and all around race fan. I started to design a game based on what I wanted a table racing game to be and something that I had never played before. Once, I got together with Ben M, the game really started to pick up steam. He brought the same passion I had for making a fun and exciting table top rally game. When we decided to bring on randomly laid out stages every time you play, dice driven events and a driver confidence system really brought the project to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing a different track varies the game dramatically. Never again will you have to have to play the same board over and over again or are you forced to spend money to buy a new track, just to add variety. The confidence system allows the player to push their luck with a smaller risk of an event happening, but the catch is that you only have a limited number of confidence points to start the entire rally with. The points are also carried over stage to stage, so you have to be careful not to use all yours up at the beginning or you won't have any left for later stages. This really helps to determine how hard you want to attack a turn or how fast you want to push your driver. You also get penalties for running out of confidence, so that is always on your mind. There are various ways to regain confidence points and also many ways to lose them. During Event rolls you might gain more back by taking a turn perfectly or lose a point for botching it.  At the end of each Stage the players each get four driver points to spend to repair drivetrain or add confidence points. You can also use those to buy more Pace cards. Pace cards are various cards that the players can use to benefit themselves or play against their opponents. There are six, six sided dice that the players use to play out events throughout Rally On. Each die side has a unique symbol that corresponds to an event that could happen to player. Some are good and some are bad. Depending on how hard you are pushing your driver determines how many dice you will be rolling for the event. You could come out a head and gain a few extra movement spaces, shave some time off your current run, damage your car, lose time or wreck. Don't forget you always can use your precious confidence points to re-roll an event die if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Rally On is to complete each stage of the rally with the least amount of time ticks. It is meant to be played as a three stage rally, but you can do less. At the start of each turn the player decides if they will up shift or downshift their gear. Once that is determined they roll the corresponding gear die. They then move that number of spaces on the stage. Each time the player comes up to a turn tile they have to decide which lane to take the turn in. Each lane has a maximum gear the player can enter in. The player has the option to attack the turn in the inside lane or outside lane. The inside lane is usually safer, but slower. The outside lane will be faster but adds a higher chance of rolling a bad event, due to rolling a higher number of event dice. This makes the outside lane a higher risk and you could potentially take damage, slide, spin off track, lose time or even gain confidence for a perfect turn. At the end of each stage the players tally their time. The player with the least amount of time wins that current stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
