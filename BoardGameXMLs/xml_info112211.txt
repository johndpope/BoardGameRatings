			<description>A Super Nintendo game was released in November 1994 by Kemco.  A Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version was developed and completed, but not released. This version, intended to be published by Vic Tokai, was made when ESRB was in place and had a T rating. It featured alternate case and cartridge artwork than the SNES version. The fully finished Mega Drive/Genesis prototype was finally leaked to the public domain in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stone Protectors features 10 levels in which the heroes - Clifford, Cornelius, Chester, Maxwell, and Angus - battle The Predators throughout their mission to retrieve Zok's crystal and bring them all back to the kingdom. Weapons can also be acquired but only used by certain characters. Depending on the difficulty setting, the game's ending scene also features different music in which the Stone Protectors are seen performing as a band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Stone Protectors&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
