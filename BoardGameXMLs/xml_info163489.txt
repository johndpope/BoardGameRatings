			<description>Welcome to Combat soldier. You must lead your troops to victory in midst of defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tactical desicions you make can send the enemy fleeing the battlefield or witness your own men dying. This game combines detailed skirmish combat designed for fast play but with enough realism and grit to make it realistic and accurate to real combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale of Game- The turn are supposed to act as if they were fought simultaneously. This is 30 seconds in the game world for a Skirmish&lt;br/&gt;game, Each inch is equal to about 1 foot in the game for skirmish actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organization: This game is meant to be played at a skirmish level. But we have included rules for other styles of gaming which is perfectly fine, but should stay towards platoon-company battles due to the skirmish nature of these rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played with any miniatures you like! They do not have to be from any specific company or manufacturer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
