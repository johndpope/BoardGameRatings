							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bradley&#039;s D-Day</name>
									
			<description>Bradley&amp;rsquo;s D-Day, is the third game in the Campaign Study Series.  It is a two-player tactical/operational simulation of the combat action on the American Sector during the first two days of the Normandy invasion, 6-7 June 1944.  The game looks at the American efforts all along the right flank of the Normandy landings. While Utah seemed relatively easy, it was there, at Omaha Beach, where the Germans came closest to derailing the greatest sea-borne invasion of all time. Behind both beaches, two famous airborne divisions were scattered all over the countryside, and fought by twos and twenties to accomplish a semblance of their missions. Call it the &amp;ldquo;Longest Two Days,&amp;rdquo; because that is the time-period covered in the game. Forty-eight hours of some of the most critical action in American history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key units are all here, including engineers with special abilities, DD-tanks,  parachute and glider landings, and even railroad coastal artillery. One defining feature of the game is unit deployment; a unit can be deployed in one of two modes: Movement Mode allows for the greatest movement but the weakest combat (which is not to say those units can&amp;rsquo;t fight) and Combat Mode, which allows the strongest fighting abilities (but still some movement for most units).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bradley&amp;rsquo;s D-Day&amp;quot; offers an intriguing scale, a moderate level of complexity, and an ease of play that will make this game either a fine addition to your Overlord collection, or a good first start for those who have not already focused on this campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Turn: 2 hours of daylight or 4 hours or nightime&lt;br/&gt;Hex 800 meters&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company/Battalion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Equipment&lt;br/&gt;One 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; full color map&lt;br/&gt;Two counter sheets (320 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 20 page rule book&lt;br/&gt;One Terrain Effects Chart&lt;br/&gt;No dice (game owners need to supply two six-sided die)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
