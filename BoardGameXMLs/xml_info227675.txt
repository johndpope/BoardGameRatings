			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of the Trenches... Death!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In revolutionary Russia in 1918, a strange band of visitors from another world gets caught up in the greatest conflict the Earth has ever known. The First World War rages across the globe, bringing an end to the old order and setting the stage for the coming century. In these times of turmoil, one common goal unites the stranded adventurers and an Allied army deployed in Siberia: finding a double agent lost behind enemy lines and, with him, the path to Grigori Rasputin&amp;rsquo;s hideaway. Such an alliance is more dangerous than it seems, but by triumphing over an intricate web of secrets the heroes shall arrive first at Rasputin&amp;rsquo;s lair!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the Siberian Line is a 13th-level adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that can be played on its own or as a complement that can be played on its own as a radical side-trek in any high-level campaign, or used between parts one and two of the fifth volume (#71) of the Witches of Winter Adventure Path. Inspired by real-world historical events, this adventure takes the PCs to the Siberian front of the First World War and the bloody campaigns between the Allied powers and the Russian Red Army. Following the tracks of the famous Trans-Siberian Railway, the PCs must defeat Bolshevik soldiers, snipers, and spies, an occult samurai order, and even conquer a city! Grab this epic 64-page adventure today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
