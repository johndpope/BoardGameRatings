							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peanuts Gag Grab</name>
									
			<description>A board game for 2-4+ players with a Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Peanuts theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 decks: &lt;br/&gt;-   The Gag Deck - These cards form the board. They are claimed by players and are worth gag points. In order to be claimed the player must move his pawn onto that card and discard 2 Kid cards of the indicated type. &lt;br/&gt;-   The Kid Deck - There are 2 basic types of Kid Cards: main characters and Peanut gallery.  There are 4 sets of main characters: Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Lucy, with 10 identical cards in each set.  There are 12 Peanut Gallery cards each listing one supporting character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a 6 X 6 grid with each space containing 1 face-up gag card. As gag cards are claimed during play they are replenished from the Gag Deck. The game ends when a gag card needs to be replaced on the board, and there are none left in the Gag Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with their pawns in separate corner spaces of the board and with 2 Kid cards in hand.  Players take turns, with each turn comprising 5 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 2 Kid Cards from the top of the Kid Deck and put them in your hand. If your pawn is adjacent to any opponent&amp;rsquo;s pawns, you may trade Kid cards from your hands. Trades must be agreeable to both parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Roll Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Roll one die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may move your pawn a number of spaces equal to the number you rolled in roll phase OR less. Moves may be orthogonal or diagonal. You may not land in the same space occupied by another pawn though you may move through (past, over) other player&amp;rsquo;s pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Claim Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may claim the Gag card in the space your pawn currently occupies. Each Gag card lists 2 Kid cards that must be discarded in order to claim it. Place the claimed card into your Gag pile.  Replace the gag card you just claimed with the top card of the Gag deck. If there are no Gag cards left, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.   End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The secondary character cards in the Kid Deck have a variety of extra uses: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard 1 card to increase the result of a roll by 1 or 2. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard 2 cards to draw 3 Kid Cards and discard any 2 from your hand. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard 2 cards to cause a target Gag card on the board to be discarded and then replaced. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard 1 card to get a second move roll.  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard 1 card after you have made a Claim to get an extra Roll, Move, and Claim phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most gag points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
