			<description>This game has a board on which are mounted seven interlocking gears. To begin, you take Picture Disks (depicting Bozo and his friends) and place them on the faces of the gears. On your turn, you spin the spinner and rotate the center gear a number of notches equal to the number spun. You then check all the disks to see if any figures are standing on their heads (upside-down). If there are, you remove and keep them, replacing them with new discs from the stack. The player with the most discs, when they've all been removed, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
