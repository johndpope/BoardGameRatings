			<description>Volfied (ヴォルフィード Vorufīdo?) (also known as Ultimate Qix on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis or Qix Neo on PlayStation) is an arcade game released by Taito in 1989. A port for MS-DOS has been developed by Empire Interactive and published by Taito in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is an updated version of Qix, with extra features and a futuristic science fiction aesthetic, rather than Qix's abstract geometry style. The player pilots a small spaceship instead of a simple dot and the enemies come in the form of various aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall gameplay is identical to that of Qix. However, the main enemy is no longer a collection of lines - instead it varies between levels, and is always accompanied by smaller enemies. When the player's spaceship succeeds in claiming a section of the level, the side where the main enemy is taken as &amp;quot;the outside&amp;quot;. Any smaller enemies ending up on &amp;quot;the inside&amp;quot; are killed, resulting in point bonuses. In order to complete a level, the player must claim at least 80% of a level's area. Previously, the limits were 75% in Qix and 70% in Super Qix. Each level in Volfied has a unique background and enemies. As the player claims areas of the level the cleared area graphic is replaced with the graphic of the next level. Grey boxes also appear on the field - these give the player a random power-up when collected. Power ups can grant the player speed or even weapons. There is a special completion bonus on certain levels, often attained by shooting the main enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Volfied&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
