			<description>From IF Wiki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Emily Short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Pierre, the adopted son of a wealthy Count in 18th century France. You are wearing a dashing hat, and carry a sword (inside a swordstick) and a snuffbox. As a member of the nobility, you also have the magical talent known as the Lavori d'Aracne which will let you create magical links between similar objects. Unhappily, you desperately need money. You returned to your childhood home, hoping to ask the Count for help, but no one knows where he's gone. Maybe there's money or something you can sell from the estate. You begin your hunt for treasure from the kitchen garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
