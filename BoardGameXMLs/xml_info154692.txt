			<description>The Antares Galaxy System is a merging inter-planetary commerce system, however, not all is blissful and peaceful in the Antares System. One Planet, Xanthar, has grown particularly powerful under the oppressive leadership of a power-hungry, ruthless and brutal ruler, T&amp;rsquo;arNak!  Meanwhile, you and the other players are Free Merchant Traders, buying commodities from a Planet with a large supply and selling them to Planets in need. Now, it is getting a bit tricky and dangerous as T&amp;rsquo;arNak&amp;rsquo;s Star Legions are increasing their presence and enforcing their strict trade regulations. The citizens of the Antares System need brave, heroes like you to help them throw off  the yoke of  T&amp;rsquo;arNak&amp;rsquo;s oppression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Players, is to gain the most Star Credits (SC) before the end of the 20th Round. The Player with the most Credits is the winner. In addition, the Heroes will undertake various missions to thwart T&amp;rsquo;arNak&amp;rsquo;s operations. The game automatically ends when the first Hero successfully completes 10 of these &amp;ldquo;Special&amp;rdquo; missions.  If playing solo, the goal is to survive and gain 10,000 Credits or complete 10 Special Missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find Galactic Smugglers at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
