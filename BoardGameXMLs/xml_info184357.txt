							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wilson Gridiron Strategy Football</name>
									
			<description>A rather rare football simulation from Wilson Sports. Play happens through use of cards, dice, a gridiron board, and a wheel for offense and one for defense upon which players select their chosen plays and then compare results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: I contacted Wilson Sports Equipment, and they at first told me that Wilson never made sports games, then, when I insisted that I had one in front of me, said that they had no knowledge of any such products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
