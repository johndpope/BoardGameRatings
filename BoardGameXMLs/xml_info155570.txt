							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wrath of the Orc Lord</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers are hired (or convinced via threats) to kill a  rogue orc general. They track the general&amp;rsquo;s army to their camp but realize that they can&amp;rsquo;t do the job with the army around their target. They set out for a nearby castle (braving unnatural  weather on the way) and capture it. The rogue general brings her orc army to the castle, and there is a huge battle. The  adventurers use the chaos of the battle to get close enough to their target to attack the rogue general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first of three interlinked adventures: Wrath of the Orc Lord, Domain of the Dwarf King, and The Elf Queen&amp;rsquo;s Enchantment. These three adventures form The Orc War Trilogy. Trilogy normally indicates sequential action, but these adventures take place simultaneously and cumulate in a fight against the same foe. As such the end of this adventure might not see these characters &amp;lsquo;winning&amp;rsquo;, instead they set up the fight for next adventure, and it is finally won by the characters in the final adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
