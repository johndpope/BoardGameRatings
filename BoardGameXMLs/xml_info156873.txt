							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dino-Pirates of Ninja Island Basic Game: Location and NPC Sheets</name>
									
			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Here at Scratch Factory we're big fans of making the DM's job easier; that's one of the key reasons we picked Old School Hack as the foundation for the new DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND role-playing game. You really can't beat Old School Hack for super-easy game mastering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But we also really kind of sneakily LOVE filling out forms. We're addicted to character sheets, and have spent many long hours poring over how to fill out every field in our Campaign Planning Guide, and other such treasures. It's one of the things we've always cherished about tabletop role-playing games, and we wanted to make sure that the new DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND provided some of that love for the DM, not just the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So check out these fantastic Location and NPC sheets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy-to-print, half-page forms that help you keep your notes organized, even if you're making them up during play! Keep track of minions and bad guys, potential treasure or secrets to be discovered. Have your bad guys easily statted up before the big combat, or make them up on the fly and keep track so they're consistent for next time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You never know, your players MIGHT notice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, you'll have fun filling them in, and hopefully the process of doing so helps you think through your next encounter so you're better-prepared than ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
