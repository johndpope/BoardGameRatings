							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Challenge Austria</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Austria in all its facets is at the center of Challenge Austria. From landscape to music, history to sport, one should not only have their red-white-red knowledge up to date, but also be ready to shine in their negotiation skills since questions are not only answered, but also bought and exchanged. During the game, players have a number of question cards in their possession and can answer only those about Austria as a whole and those about the region of the country in which their game figure is currently located. Thus, you might want to trade cards with others, offer them cash, move to new locations, or pay to return cards that are too difficult to answer. Too pay too much, though, for in the end the first player to collect a previously agreed upon sum of money wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
