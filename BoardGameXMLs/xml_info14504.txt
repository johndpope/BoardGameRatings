							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruhrpott-Tour</name>
									
			<description>This game has nearly the same concept as &amp;bdquo;Deutschlandreise&amp;ldquo;.  Players must optimize their route to visit six randomly dealt places in the Ruhr-Area (&amp;bdquo;Ruhrpott&amp;ldquo; is a local slang word for Ruhrgebiet&amp;ldquo;)in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ruhrpott Tout all participants sit in the same car and therefore they must constantly argue with all other players about which route to take. Each player has a set of destination cards which show the destinations he has to visit. Therefore it must be co-ordinated continuously whether to continue straightforward, to the left, right or even back. The first has no more places to go wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two versions of the game (black map for night and white map for day) with no difference in rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
