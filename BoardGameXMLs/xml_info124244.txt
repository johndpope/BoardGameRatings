			<description>Ruffian-like real-time strategy with parody plot, which moves in the near post-apocalyptic future. Based on &amp;laquo;Mad Max&amp;raquo; action film, the game was being developed from December 2003 to April 2005 (for 16 months), supported by recreated licensed technology &amp;laquo;Blitzkrieg&amp;raquo; of Nival Interactive. Significant modifications and RPG elements were added to the original RTS gameplay. First of all, it is the story line combining all 29 missions and 7 heroes with unique alterable characteristics. The story of their struggle for survival with the cruel auto-bands takes place at the ruins of American southern states and it is illustrated in detail in cross-mission comics. Another game particular feature is its ironical and absurd humor, all characters' speeches, dialogs and quests are imbued with. Such bluntly cynical approach to the pathos of classical movies about &amp;laquo;go-it-alone heroes&amp;raquo; of the future imparted specific singularity and fun to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features&lt;br/&gt;29 events-saturated missions;&lt;br/&gt;30 comics episodes, consequently revealing the intriguing plot to the player;&lt;br/&gt;46 types of once peaceful vehicles, transformed into infernal weapons of war;&lt;br/&gt;7 heroes with various RPG characteristics and set of skills from mission to mission;&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity for heroes to use any military equipment available in the mission;&lt;br/&gt;Realistic American post-nuclear landscapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
