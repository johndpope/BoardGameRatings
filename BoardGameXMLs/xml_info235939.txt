			<description>Blots is new monster-themed party-game, when players try to explain as many words, as they can under one minute. There are 6 different ways of explanation (and you will use all of them during the game!), 6 difficulty levels and one major twist - players do not split into the teams, but each time somebody guess the word - a pair marker of this two people advance on the score track. So, the winner of the game will be a pair - but pair of those, who better understand each other in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
