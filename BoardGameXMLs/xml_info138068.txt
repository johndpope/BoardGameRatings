			<description>A swedish game from sometime in the 1960's where you manage a dog kennel. You buy dogs and enter them into competitions in different countries, breed them, sell puppies and try to make your kennel the most valuable of all the players. The game board has one path that everybody has to follow and you spin a wheel to move. Every square you land on says something that alters your situation in some way. Maybe you get to mate your dogs or they get sick. At the end of the trail the player with the most valuable kennel wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
