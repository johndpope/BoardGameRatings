							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scan Command: Jurassic Park</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You command a dinosaur and build its energy, strength, and other abilities by adding DNA via the real-life barcode scanner provided with the game. The scanner can read almost any type of barcode and it beeps when it collects DNA power-ups that can be used for your in-game dinosaur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must guide your DNA skill enhanced dinosaur through ruined laboratories, swamps, and inside a volcano to defeat the villain, Dr. Corts. Several dinosaur enemies and puzzles must be overcome by using the right mix of DNA power-ups, collected by scanning barcodes from common household products in your home or the grocery store. Once you collect DNA, you upload it to the game and decide how to boost or enhance your Velociraptor's, T-Rex's, or Spinosaurus' skills to complete missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
