			<description>CROSSTALK The Game of Precision Communication. It's a race to duplicate the (hidden) tile pattern of your teammate, using verbal and non-verbal communication. A complete game has four rounds, where each successive round uses more limited channels of communication. In the first round, all players may talk freely. In the second round, only the pattern-giver may talk. In the third round, only the pattern-builder may talk. In the fourth round, no one may talk and communication is performed using only hand signals. Points go to the partnership which completes a pattern first, provided they do so correctly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
