							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fortress of the Ur-Mage</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortress of the Ur-Mage is a tournament deathtrap dungeon for the 5th Edition of DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS roleplaying game, taking characters from 3rd Level to 10th. It features a competitive head-to-head mode, where multiple parties delve the dungeon at the same time. Competing bands of crusaders can hinder each other by stealing relics, laying traps, freeing monsters, and manipulating the dungeon environment itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product comes with a 98-page dungeon-crawling adventure, as well as 7 full size player handouts, a fully numbered and unnumbered map, 84 pages of thirteen pregenerated characters (one of each class, shown from levels 3 through 10), and 25 pages of printable cards featuring over 100 new magic items!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that the gods tasked Death with keeping the secrets of magic locked behind his Black Gates. And so the fallen races remained blind to the ways of magic, until one man challenged and defeated Death in a battle of wits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In victory he claimed Death's wand and became the first mortal to perceive the mysteries of the black art, only to be driven mad by the revelations. These half-remembered legends tell too of his sundering of the world and his construction of a dread fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ur-Mage opens the doors of his fortress once each decade, allowing the heroes and demigods of the realm to enter. Legend has it that a great prize waits within the fortress, the Wand of Death itself, and a crusader bearing the wand could command the dead, shatter the planes, and slay gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the games begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the gates open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
