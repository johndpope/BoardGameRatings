			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many ways, Diablo is a really great opportunity for a Dungeon World game. It&amp;rsquo;s a well-developed world with lots of scary stuff going on, but plenty of empty spaces. The heroes in the game weren&amp;rsquo;t able, unfortunately, to stop the Lord of Terror in his tracks, but maybe your characters will have a better time of it. Presented here are the Steading and Campaign/Adventure Fronts that represent the setting and loose plot of the first of the very excellent Blizzard Diablo games. I&amp;rsquo;ve provided entire arcs for each danger&amp;mdash;maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to save Leoric before he&amp;rsquo;s doomed to become the Skeleton King? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll stop Lazarus from leading the villagers into the waiting arms of the Butcher?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s no map, so you&amp;rsquo;ll want to create your own or free-form discover the ruins below Tristram with your fellow players. To further customize these Fronts, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to put together a few new monsters (certainly the Fallen Ones and Goatmen deserve a little attention!) and maybe throw in some magic items to suit your needs. Fans of the series will, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, be happy to discover a Broadsword of the Bear or wield the Optic Amulet in their quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pay special attention to how the Fronts interact. There are some that overlap&amp;mdash;particularly around the host/Prince Albrecht. If the players save Albrecht or clue in to crazy old Lazarus early, Diablo will go looking for another host. I suggest Wirt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
