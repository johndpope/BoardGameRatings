			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bite Me! Wererats Skulks out of the Walls and into Your Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vermin! Sewer scum! And those are the polite names people call them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living hidden inside of and underneath great cities, wererats have to fight the prejudices of other races&amp;mdash;including other lycanthropes&amp;mdash;and the extermination attempts of civic-minded reformers just to stay alive, let alone to thrive in their hidden society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bite Me! Wererats is a 19-page supplement describing a race of natural shapechangers who just want to be left alone in their claustrophobic, vermin-filled underground warrens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bite Me! Wererats Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for creating wererat characters using the Bite Me! lycanthrope system, including new racial traits, archetypes (the Bully Slayer and the Sewer Druid), and feats (from Lost In The Crowd to Swarm Caller)&lt;br/&gt;    New wererat spells (from close quarters to virulence), magic items (from helm of ratkind to slimming oil), and equipment (from air sweetener to rat scent)&lt;br/&gt;    Details of wererat life and society.&lt;br/&gt;    Two completely statted (in both human and rat forms) ready-to-use NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
