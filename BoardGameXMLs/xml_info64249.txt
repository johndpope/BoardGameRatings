			<description>Family / management game for 4-6 people, from 12 years, with a playing time of about 1 hours. The game was commissioned by DHV in Amersfoort. Aim of the game is to a successful conclusion of negotiations for a PPP project to implement. The negotiations take DHV addition, a number of interested parties participated. The project can only be implemented if all participants on a number of key decisions agreed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PPP Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of global warming, the oceans are warmer. The water expands, with the inevitable result of the rising water. This leads to big problems for certain small low-lying islands, especially in the Pacific, which are often wholly or partially independent. Meanwhile some small islands have already completely disappeared under the sea. Currently we are considering for general evacuation of the population (10000 persons) of such an island to Western Australia. But of course you can also take measures to reduce the impact of rising sea levels to overcome. The package of measures forms the backdrop of the PPP game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players representing the various stakeholders: the island government, developers, financiers, tourism and the bourgeoisie. (Environmental movement). Also a player takes the role of DHV in itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
