							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rose Meadow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You leave a half dead litch hanging in a meadow somewhere and what do you get? Nothing good. His power has to drain somewhere and if there&amp;rsquo;s no proper vessel, evil is going to infect the very roses growing up around him. That&amp;rsquo;s what happened in Port Morganti. Go to the meadow outside town there and you&amp;rsquo;ll find a Mother Rose of  ominous power with uncounted numbers of pale, human shaped minions grown up around her. Though the fondest hope of the litch&amp;rsquo;s progeny is to finish the half dead thing off, the roses have become a valuable commodity used to make an efficient poison. If the litch goes, what happens to the roses? If the roses go, what happens to the litch? Can the world get by without the poison? Walls of roses are cutting off Port Morganti. No time to lollygag. Save the colony, save Port Morganti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
