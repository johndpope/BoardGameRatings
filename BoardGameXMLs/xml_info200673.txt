			<description>This 1897 educational card game consists of a deck of 48 plain undersized cards, each printed with either a question or an answer in French. The 24 questions and 24 answers are divided equally among the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player calls out a question, and the player to his left must offer a suitable reply. If he cannot, the next player has an opportunity and so on round the table. When a question is answered, both the questioner and the answerer get to discard those cards, and the player providing a correct answer gets to ask the next question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to empty his hand unless a question is called out that no one can answer, in which case the game ends immediately and the player with the fewest cards in hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule card says the cards include a vocabulary of more than 200 words and introduce &amp;quot;the various changes of the Articles, Adverbs, Pronouns and Verbs. It can be used with success as a novel and pleasing way of studying the French language.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
