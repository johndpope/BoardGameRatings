							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wordner</name>
									
			<description>A party-style card game where players use their creativity to finish prompts by building off of starter words. These are judged by another player who selects his/her favorite. The player who submitted this is then awarded a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with one player being chosen as the judge. A blue prompt card and an orange starter card are pulled from the deck and read out loud to everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining players finish the prompt by writing a phrase that incorporates at least one of the starter words. These phrases are known as wordners, and may make starter words plural, change their tense, and add other words to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players submit their wordners on a piece of paper to the player on the judge's left, who reads them out loud. The judge selects his/her favorite, and the creator of this is awarded a point represented by the round's blue card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the player to the judge's left becomes the judge and a new round begins. The first player to collect 5 blue cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
