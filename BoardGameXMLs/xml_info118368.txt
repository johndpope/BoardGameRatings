			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: The Mystic waves his hands and an oval vortex of energy opens in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Well, here we go again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Hey! A little awe for the strange mystic please.&lt;br/&gt;Player: Why, because he can open a portal? Big deal.  I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic portals occur in most fantasy worlds, used as a method of quick transport, as a way to move large numbers of people or to open doors to other realms. Unfortunately, all too often these wonders of magic have a cookie-cutter appearance - oval-shaped openings of blue or purple energy. A portal&amp;rsquo;s appearance however could vary depending on who cast it, whether it&amp;rsquo;s permanent, where it&amp;rsquo;s located and where it goes. Well never fear - Healing Fireball Publications is here with a set of tables that will give all your portals a unique feel and appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is designed to create unique magical portals, from permanent structures adorned with a variety of magical and mundane decorations to temporary energy vortexes used to make temporary passageways. These tables allow you to create portals with a wide variety of shapes colors and various effects and decorations. All this and it&amp;rsquo;s only 50&amp;cent;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
