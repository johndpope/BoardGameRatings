			<description>Get ready to add some spice to your game night with Spicy Games! Each of the spice bottles hold all of the pieces you need to play a game. Each game takes 2 minutes to learn and 10 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokens are numbered 1 to 40. Each player received 4 random tokens and 10 chili pepper markers. At the beginning of the round, each player antes 1 pepper marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The start player will place a token face down and claim it is higher than X. Players can challenge or the next player may place one of their tokens face down saying it is higher than X (what the previous person claimed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of placing a token, you may challenge someone and place 2 of your pepper markers in the pot or you may challenge out of turn by placing 3 peppers. Reveal the card, if the player was lying the challenger receives all the peppers. if they were telling the truth, that player received the peppers. Players then redraw back to 4 tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player is out of peppers and whoever has the most peppers at that time wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
