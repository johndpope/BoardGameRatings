			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kagerup, d. 01/01/1996&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear friends,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been a long time since we've been together. Four years I think; so it's not too soon enough to see you again, I think. Therefore this little invitation to spend the winter holiday together with the undersigned. My parents are going to Norway for their vacation. So, the house will be empty. Except for me, who will be taking care of the dog - so you can come, if you want to be with me. And who knows maybe there will be time for some role playing? At least I have something up in my sleeve that should be of interest. In any case, the living room is as atmospheric as it always has been, and our own little &amp;quot;poltergeist&amp;quot; awaits impatiently to spice our nightly affairs. I would love to have you here. Well, enough rambling.  Come and see me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope to see you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carsten N&amp;oslash;rskov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C.U. no later than 01/02/1996. The address and phone number are still the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as two PDF files - a 64-page scenario, and 9 page print-and-play handout packet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
