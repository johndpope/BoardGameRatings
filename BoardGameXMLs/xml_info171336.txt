			<description>Card game. Objective is to be first to collect three sets of cards. A set consists of a Job card + a Skill associated with the job + 2 x Personal cards (being adjectives associated with the job).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also Guess, Swap and Challenge cards which are used to allow cards to be questioned, in case the owner of the set has played cards that don't match to the Job card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Job card is always face-down but other cards are exposed, allowing opponents to consider these cards and make a guess as to the Job card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a lot of bluffing because if you can complete a set with the wrong cards, it still counts to your target of three sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 30 second timer is included so that the challenges have a limited time to prove or disprove their opinions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
