			<description>Everyday Strife features 104 unique playable cards, each with its own value and function. Players attempt to win by holding specific categories, combinations, or values of cards. They draw cards and also attempt to steal them from other players. Various mechanisms are provided for countering steal attempts and sabotaging the efforts of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game integrates rock-paper-scissors for some of its competitive events, as well as special requirements for playing certain cards, such as using phrases and accents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
