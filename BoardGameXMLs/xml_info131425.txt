							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Canites</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canites are a race of humanoid canines. They are a vagabond race. Their ancestral homeland is all but forgotten. Some historians believe that the homeland of the canites was destroyed many years ago. The Pantheon scholars believe that the canites are a result of the dream rifts centuries ago. This is the case in a campaign set in The Hunt: Rise of Evil. The canites are a race based on a dream of an autistic child whose only constant companion was a loyal dog. Although, he could not contact the awakened world his dreams were powerful. He always wished that his dog could speak and be more like &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo;. Because of the power of his dreams the canites were born on Gothos and became a viable race. In a different campaign, canites should be a race that has a mysterious (even to the canites) and long-lost homeland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
