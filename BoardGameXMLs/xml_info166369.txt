			<description>A two player abstract game played with two sets (black and white) of triangular pieces on a hexagonal board. The board has 96 triangular shapes in blue, yellow and red. Players alternate playing one piece at a time trying to form complete hexagons of their own colour. Red areas cannot be played on until they become the only exposed area in a hexagon and at that point may only be played on when the play would creat a complete hexagon all of one colour, in which case that player wins.&lt;br/&gt; Should no complete uni-coloured hexagon be formed when all legal plays have been made there is a point scoring system to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
