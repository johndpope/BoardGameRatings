			<description>From game manual&lt;br/&gt;Moskva 1988. Top C.I.A. man Felix Hoover (Codename: 'The Cleaner') has infiltrated the K.G.B. Headquarters. His mission is to steal the top secret blueprints to Soviet Spacecraft Suya 2. Felix however, is discovered by the K.G.B. gards and they are quickly on his trail. Beware, the Russians will show no hesitation in shooting to kill. While you are in action, you should try to collect western cash which will help you in your escape. This is done by opening doors, of which there are a total of 75 between you and the escape key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
