							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Droidz</name>
									
			<description>Gauntlet-style arcade game created by     David Lyttle and S. Lyttle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something happens when a machine realises that it is less intelligent then someone or something else.  It begins to educate itself.  The machine in question is one of the Droidz, convenience robots created by man to do menial tasks so that he can go off and relax.  The Droidz don't have much of a brain to speak on, so in order to learn more effectively they have formed a kind of collective intelligence.  Gathered in the holographic Recreation Centre, they are hoarding all the technology they can get their grips on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must drive a reconditioned Mk III battle walker into the complex, get back as much of the stolen technology and destroy as many Droidz as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
