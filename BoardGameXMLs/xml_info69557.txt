			<description>User summary: A fast-play set of miniature rules for ship-to-ship combat in the Star Trek universe published in Issue 18 of Battlegames Magazine. They adapt Full Thrust to hex-play and replace damage rolls with a draw deck. Two scenarios are included with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requirements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will require these rules, several six-sided dice (d6), ship diagrams (provided), miniatures or counters representing ships, and a hex-grid. Micromachines make excellent and inexpensive miniatures in roughly 1/3700 scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control 1-5 space ships and plot simultaneous turns. Movement is 2-D cinematic flight with basic momentum incorporated into the the movement mechanic. Games end when one side reaches its break point or accomplished its scenario objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is based on variable numbers of d6s (depending on weapon and range). When ships reach damage thresholds, players draw a card from a damage deck and apply the results (usually bad, sometimes good).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full stats for Federation and Klingon ships as well as ship status displays are available in the magazine and on the Battlegames website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.battlegames.co.uk/dispatches/dispatches_fanscifi.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.battlegames.co.uk/dispatches/dispatches_fanscifi....&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
