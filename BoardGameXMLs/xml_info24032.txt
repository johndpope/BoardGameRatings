			<description>From the Pennsylvania Packet, March 1, 1783:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The subscribers beg leave to offer to the Public, a new invented GAME at CARDS, called ORTHO, designed not only for amusement, but instruction in the orthography of the English language ; instead of the four suits, or pips, in common use, these cards are furnished with four sets of the English alphabet, having such certain powers assigned to the respective letters as to admit of variety, ingenuity, and entertainment in the play, with the additional and important advantage of insinuating a correctness in spelling, and a knowledge in the operation of letters in the formation of words.  These Cards, neatly ornamented and made up in packs of 104 cards each, with full Directions how they are to be played, printed on the wrapper, are made and sold by the subscribers, at their Card and Paper-Hanging Factory, in Walnut street, above the New Gaol, Philadelphia, and may be had at most of the shops.  Price, but the single pack, 7s 6d, with a large allowance to purchase by the dozen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDWARD RYVES &amp;amp; CO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N.B. The above CARDS are likewise Sold by the Printer hereof.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glossary of terms --&lt;br/&gt;orthography -  the art of writing words with the proper letters according to standard usage&lt;br/&gt;gaol - chiefly British variant of jail&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
