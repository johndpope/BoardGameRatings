			<description>The SC-3000 was the computer equivalent of the SG-1000.&lt;br/&gt;The SC-3000 sold for &amp;yen;29,800 (USD$386.81) in 1983 and was marketed as a computer for beginners. Since games were compatible with both the SC-3000 and SG-1000, and since the SC-3000 was also able to run computer applications, it outsold the SG-1000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Users were able to create their own programs and games on the machine in BASIC, as well as machine code. A speech synthesis unit, light pen, and several other third party accessories were also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sega SG-1000&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
