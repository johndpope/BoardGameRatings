It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Stage One: Kevin Searle; Stage Two: Jason Dettman; Stage Three: Allan Dotson&lt;br/&gt;Stage One Title: By Horn and Claw&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;For a seemingly endless time you burned in the fiery pits. Scourged of your previous life by immortal&lt;br/&gt;fire, you have been left with little but the memories of the crimes that brought you here.&lt;br/&gt;Now you are plucked from the fires by the Demon Captain Vex, servant of Lord Malphitheor, to be&lt;br/&gt;used in his schemes against rival Demon Lords. If you serve your Lord (and backstab the right souls)&lt;br/&gt;you might be able to work your way up the demonic hierarchy. One day you might even be a Demon&lt;br/&gt;Lord yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
