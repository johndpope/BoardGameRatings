							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Underwater Ruins of Naga-Noth</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naga-Noth was home to a culture of necromancers and psions in ancient times when the lands to the Empire were ruled by the small peasant villages of stone age culture. Naga-Nothans used the main land as hunting ground for slaves and also demanded corpses as tribute (which they converted into undead servants). Many tales of ancient heroes actually describe battles between tribal heroes and minor servants of the island of Noth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Naga-Nothans thought themselves rulers of the world and this hubris could not go unpunished for long. Several powerful sea spirits, among them the 7 dragons of the waves, assaulted the island and made it perish under the sea. Today, the cities of Noth are littering the Southern Sea. The building style is similar to that employed in the shattered empire today but there is a lack of colours and a tendency towards strange building materials (such as bone and magically preserved skin).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The merchant quarter was once situated next to the port and saw the passing of many magical and psionic items. The illithids established an outpost nearby to raid this quarter and take its goods. Of particular interest is the library of quintessential necromantic knowledge that is rumoured to exist somewhere under these buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
