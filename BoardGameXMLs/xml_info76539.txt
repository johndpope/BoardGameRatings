			<description>Textile is a tile placement game for 2-4 players. It's designed for nestorgames' game system Nestortiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's objective is to &amp;quot;knot&amp;quot; a piece of &amp;quot;textile&amp;quot;, which is made of smaller parts, so called &amp;quot;patches&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players freely choose any colored tile from a supply and create the patches by putting tiles together and always following the main rule of allowed color patterns: the same color may not occur on any two orthogonally or diagonally adjacent tiles. If a player decides to add a patch (or if the patch reaches its maximum size of five) it is &amp;quot;knotted&amp;quot; to the main textile in the middle of the table. The players then score points by the formula &amp;quot;knotting sides x size of the patch&amp;quot;. After all tiles are played, the winner is the one with the highest total score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
