			<description>It's not easy being a dungeon. Especially since those grubby humans started some stupid crusade to pilfer and rob every last gem and ore from your beautiful depths after you've spent millennia cultivating them. Well, you may have been carved from the earth at night, but it sure as heck wasn't last night. Everyone knows that treasures kept by dungeons hold mystical and dangerous powers; that's probably why those invaders want them. Well, it's time to fight fire with fire. Who knows... maybe with a little &amp;quot;convincing&amp;quot; that adventuring party is willing to make a donation or two to your fine collection. One thing's for sure, they picked the wrong sentient cavern to mess with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
