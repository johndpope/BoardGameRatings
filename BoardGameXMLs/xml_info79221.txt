			<description>RayStorm is a scrolling shooter developed by the Taito Corporation (now part of Square Enix). Originally released in Japan as an arcade game in 1996, it was later ported there to Sony's PlayStation game console in 1997, to the Sega Saturn (under the name Layer Section II) in that same year, and to Windows-based personal computers in 2001. In North America, it was released for the PlayStation by Working Designs in June 1997. The PlayStation version was also released in Europe by SCE Europe. It was re-released in 2010 with improved graphics, as RayStorm HD, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set hundreds of years in the future. Players must pilot their &amp;quot;R-Gray&amp;quot; spacecraft through eight vertically scrolling stages and shoot down enemy ships and vehicles to prevent the forces of the Secilia Federation, a rebellious group of colonies, from destroying Earth. The arcade versions let each player choose one of two ships; home ports include additional ships and features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Raystorm , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
