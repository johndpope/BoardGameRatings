							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadowed Earth Veiled Adventures #02: The Temple of St. Benjamin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the rocky cliffs, an ancient temple stands proud, casting an ominous shadow on the village below. It&amp;rsquo;s an empty structure from a forgotten time; or at least it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be empty. The temple once offered religious services to the villagers and provided a resting place for their deceased. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s plagued by the undead and their necromantic master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Temple of St. Benjamin is a standalone Shadowed Earth adventure, powered by the Entropic Gaming System, usable at different character ranks. It&amp;rsquo;s nominally set in the latter half of the Dark Ages or during the period of the Crusades and involved a necromancer and his occult followers. The ossuary and church should be placed on a cliff overlooking a village, preferably near a large body of water. Ideal locations include Bulgaria, Croatia, England, Francia, and the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veiled Adventures #02: The Temple of St. Benjamin  is not a standalone game and requires the Entropic Gaming System core rulebook. Although designed to be used within a modern Shadowed Earth setting, such as Judgment Day, the OGL material can be used with any Entropic Gaming System product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
