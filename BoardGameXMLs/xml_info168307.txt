			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 4-6 characters of level 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out in the middle of the twisted moorlands lies the fabled Temple of Evil... Or so they say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when two young sisters on their first adventure fail to return, apparently dead, on an expedition arranged by two other adventurers who happen to return unscathed, the girls&amp;rsquo; father asks you to investigate whether there has been any foul play involved; and you rather think that there has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Dollar Dungeons are standalone adventures designed to be logical, entertaining, challenging and balanced, and easily integrated into any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure has enough material to last two to three playing sessions and enough experience to raise four characters of the appropriate level up by one extra level. Treasure is commensurate with the encounter challenges faced. Scaling information is included for adventuring parties of five or six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigative adventure is mainly set within the boundaries of a wealthy but remote town, though some of the activity also takes place in the moorlands that surround it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
