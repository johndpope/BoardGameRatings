			<description>Anki DRIVE is a racing game like no other. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics to take the best of video games and combine it with the best of physical games. It&amp;rsquo;s a video game in the real world. You hold the cars in your hand, and the track rolls out on your living room floor.&lt;br/&gt; You can play ANKI Drive against your friends, or against an AI-enabled opponent. The more you race, the more points you earn, which you redeem to upgrade your cars&amp;rsquo; weapons and capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anki Drive is a new breed of game... It combines elements of video games, real world interaction and RPG style leveling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cars are equipped with virtual weapons and other items. Each car has energy, you use this for your weapons and you could say your HP. If you run out of energy and you take damage from another car you get disabled. The car that disabled you gets a point for the KILL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play until someone gets 5, 10, or 20 points. At that time the game ends and the cars stop. You are assigned UPGRADE points for your performance in the match, that you can use to upgrade weapons or car performance. These points follow the player not the car, whereas the upgrades (most at least) follow the car. Just like a CCG you can trade the car with another player and the upgrades go with the car. If you earned UPGRADE points and have not spent them they stay with the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more you play the better upgraded and equipped your car becomes, but you still have to drive it yourself. So even a poorly equipped car with a very good driver can win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While not 100% a video game or an RPG it has the best of all worlds... Think CAR WARS for the modern day!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
