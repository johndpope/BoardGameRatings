			<description>Genies is a bidding game about the world&amp;acute;s most famous scientists. Each player tries to hire scientists in his academy to score in three rankings in eight different disciplines. Therefore the players have to simultaneously make secret offers for five scientists each round. After each second round, there is a new ranking. Action cards can give the players special incentives concerning the profile of their academy. After the third ranking the player who has scored the most points in all rankings combined wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
