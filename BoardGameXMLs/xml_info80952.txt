			<description>Jungle Speed is a video game version of the Asmod&amp;eacute;e card game of the same name, Jungle Speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Jungle Speed, animated jungle animals play a card game where the object is to be the first one out of cards.  The cards have shapes and patterns in different colors on them and are flipped by the players one by one around the table.  If two players have cards that match the same symbol, regardless of color, both players must grab for a totem pole in the middle of the table. The player who successfully gets the totem, give his or her cards to the one who was not as fast. Adding to the fun / confusion is that the patterns on the cards are purposefully similar but not the same, so players may try to grab the totem when they are not supposed to.  The penalty for knocking the totem over, or taking it when you aren't supposed to: taking all of the flipped over cards on the table.  There are also special cards which modify how the game is played, such as having all players grab the totem at once, or to match on color rather than pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The video game version also includes the card game's expansion, Jungle Speed: The Extreme Expansion.  Players can choose to play with or without the expansion by ticking a check box.  The expansion adds different pattern cards and other new special cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jungle Speed uses the motion control of the Wiimote or nunchuck to mimic the card game's action of grabbing the totem pole.  Players can also set records in the game for things like the fastest grab, or the most cards gained, or the most wins in a row.  Jungle Speed uses up to 4 Wiimotes with 4 nunchucks to support up to 8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
