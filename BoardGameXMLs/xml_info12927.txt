			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;An exciting word game requiring logic, imagination and intuition.  A game for any number of players, as individuals, partners, or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no right or wrong answers here!  You simply have to match your answer to that of your partner.  From a three-letter word fragment, you select a word or words that the letters might stand for or would logically contain those letters.  I know that sounds complicated, but it really is not. (i.e. USA - United States of America; LTR could be letter, later, litter, etc.)  Some are easy, others more difficult.  You may choose what level you play on and receive your score accordingly, or roll the dice and take your chances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why LOCUTION? As your teacher would say, &amp;quot;look it up&amp;quot;.  OK, so it's not an exact description of the game, but it's the best I could do on my first attempt at something like this.  I had an idea that I thought some people might enjoy, and friends agreed -- so here it is!  Not having the resources of a big game company, I am doing the best I can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe this is a great game for groups -- even large groups -- with participation by all players.  The first time you play it, you'll get your money's worth; after that, it's free!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, sorry gals, the guys have the advantage here, so guys against gals is not recommended.  It seems that men's limited vocabulary gives the guys an edge!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
