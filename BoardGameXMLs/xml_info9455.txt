			<description>Made by Mattel in 1969, this game is a sort of 3-D tic-tac-toe with a twist. It sort of looks like modern 3D art work with its bright colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played on the outside faces of a 3x3x3 cube. So there are 9 positions per face, and 6 faces, so there are 54 positions in which to play. To win you have to make a straight row of five dots in five different colors, without putting any dot next to a dot of the same color. The row of five must be orthognal, not diagonal. Obviously for 5 places it has to cross at least two faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-4 player variant too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
