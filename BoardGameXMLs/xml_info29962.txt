			<description>Smart aS is an educational aid with a unique equalizing system that allows a struggling student to compete competitively against a gifted student or adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smart aS targets everything from colours, shapes to phonics, reading, writing, spelling and maths right up to sixth grade and beyond with additional extension curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is as simple as: throw dice, complete maths equation and move counter that amount, draw card and answer question corresponding to square colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone starts in the Green section the easiest game. This allows the players to understand how to play. Then each player slowly progresses as he/she masters the ability and skill to the Yellow Section, then the Blue Section and the Red Sections of the Rules &amp;amp; Instruction book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the first few games where everyone is in the Green Section, additional games can have every student /player on the different Colour Coded Levels of the Rules &amp;amp; Instruction, playing together at the same time. This allows a child or less able student to play competitively against an able student or adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
