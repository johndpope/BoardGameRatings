			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time ever, you can actually talk to your favorite Pokemon. Tag along with Pikachu as it goes through its daily routines, taking field trips, going fishing and having picnics, becoming better friends with each passing day. Pikachu will hear and react to the words you say. The more you speak the closer friends you'll be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Talk into the microphone, see Pikachu react. Your voice travels to Pikachu through the N64 Voice Recognition Unit and microphone - both included.&lt;br/&gt;- Pal around with Pikachu - together you'll gather cooking ingredients, fish for favorite water Pokemon, and even hunt for buried treasure on a deserted island.&lt;br/&gt;- Speak to Pikachu using a variety of key words and phrases. Friendship is based on communication, and there's plenty to talk about!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
