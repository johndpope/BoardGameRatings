							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninja: The Way of the Tiger</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'I will vanish into the night; change my body to wood or stone; sink into the earth and walk through walls and locked doors. I will be killed many times, yet will not die; change my face and become invisible, able to walk among men without being seen.' This is the convenant of a ninja of the Way of the Tiger, taught to you by your slain foster-father Naikishi. Before you were ever known as Avenger, before your quest for vengeance would change the world of Orb, you were to face great evil in the idyllic Island of Plenty. You are the youngest of five Initiates of the Inner Circle challenging to become Grandmaster of the Five Winds. Your journey will lead you from ancient cities, across towering mountains, and into wild forests. There is evil stirring in these lands, determined to destroy you and your allies, and it shall turn your challenge into the greatest ordeal you have yet faced. THE WAY OF THE TIGER is the role-playing adventure classic now revised and expanded for today. You choose the skills and martial arts moves to defeat your enemy, gaining knowledge and honing your abilities to use in further books. ARE YOU READY FOR THE WAY OF THE TIGER?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
