			<description>Outrun your formula rivals on the city freeway!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The excitement of the arcade racer comes to the table top. 2-4 players compete in open wheel racing on the city freeway. Reach top speed, dodge traffic, pass junctions and turbo in a battle to tame the Formula Freeway!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;Race by selecting High or Low gear followed by drawing one of two movement cards from the race deck. Decide to play this card or to move another racer in the hope that the second card will be better strategically. Win by driving through all freeways of the race distance and crossing the finishing line first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;Switchable double-sided mats creating an infinite rolling freeway and randomly closed junctions with traffic cones. Selectable gears, turbos and moving traffic vehicles. Choose to race less junctions or tackle the full distance of all five freeway junctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INCLUDES&lt;br/&gt;Two double-sided mats, four race cars with turbos, ten traffic cars, two cones, gear &amp;amp; movement cards and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
