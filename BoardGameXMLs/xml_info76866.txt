			<description>Aliens have attacked El Cadron, a small border town in Texas. The player has arrived to save the townspeople, who&amp;rsquo;ve been disappearing. The aliens have clever ways of disguising themselves as townspeople. the player's mission is to do away with them, but they can&amp;rsquo;t be killed with regular guns. The player is armed with four BattleCams, with a stunning particle beam that stops the alien temporarily. The player must rid the world of the Reticulan menace before the entire area is destroyed by a nuclear bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground Zero: Texas is a full motion video game, created for the Sega Mega-CD in 1993. The game relies heavily on video footage, with which the player interacts. It contains 110 minutes of interactive footage from four different cameras. It was directed by Dwight H. Little, who is also known for the films Marked for Death and Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ground Zero: Texas,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
