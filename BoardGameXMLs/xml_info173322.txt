			<description>In CQ:Heroes, up to 4 players take turns collecting heroes and sending them out to gain victory points for your tavern.  From the mighty Paladins and Wardens of the King's Guard from Game Pack #1 to the powerful Great Wolves and Berserkers from Game Pack #2, Savage Beasts, each player will try to create a powerful combo of heroes to defeat even the toughest locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes from Game Pack #2 - Savage Beasts feature Pet heroes that can be controlled by the Beastmaster skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Pack #2 - Savage Beasts includes the Adventure Deck: Desert Temple which features all new cards including a new card type: Raid Boss.  These encounters are much tougher than normal encounters and are placed in the location area when revealed.&lt;br/&gt;The new objective in Desert Temple is to defeat 3 of these Raid Bosses to open up the Throne Room.  This triggers the final battle where all players make last party of heroes to battle each other for the room's treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple and engaging: Although it's simple to learn and play, turns can become quite involved with all of the hero abilities and how you combo them during your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone plays to the end: No one is eliminated during the game and all players count their victory points at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick flow of play: Because you draw up your hand at the end of your turn, you are then able to plan your next turn while others are taking theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accessible: Only 1 deck is needed for up to 4 players.  Extra decks can be used separately by each player or shuffled together for everyone to share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to collect: No mystery packs.  Each deck has all the cards you need to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast: The game sets up in less than a minute and plays in about 10-20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the first player, each player performs the following 4 actions in order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATTACK: Attack 1 encounter OR skip your attack to add one additional Hero to your Tavern on the next step&lt;br/&gt;TAVERN: Place 1 hero in your Tavern (2 if you skipped your attack)&lt;br/&gt;DRAW: Draw your hand back up to 5 cards&lt;br/&gt;REFRESH: Draw and add 1 new Adventure card to the dungeon hall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
