			<description>The playing surface is long and oval-shaped, and the playing spaces are narrow and angled. The basic rules of race games are used, with turns missed and players moving backwards and forwards as directed. The game is played anticlockwise. The centre of the circuit shows a vivid, modern illustration of a motorcycle race in progress, with illustrations of cycles and people in each corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
