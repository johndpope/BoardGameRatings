			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Timeship is an innovative an imaginative role playing game that allows players to adventure in strange eras and places as themselves, not as fictional characters who have been created by a few dice rolls. An elegantly simple system starts players at average ability levels, then allows each player to evaluate him or herself by improving some and reducing others. The result is each player creates a gaming character that mirrors both their positive and negative abilities, based on their own judgment.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Timeship comes complete with a rule book containing all of the information necessary to get the players ready, well organized rules of play and THREE Time Capsule Adventure Episodes; a set of maps for the Time Capsules, a pad of player character sheets and a Timelord Screen containing the most commonly used charts and tables.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
