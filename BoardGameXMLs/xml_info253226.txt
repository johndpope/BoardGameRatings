			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock Your Vampiric Potential!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, before there was a dhampir race, playing a vampire in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game was a difficult and frustrating task. The vampire template was clearly not designed with player characters in mind, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t support the wide variety of interpretations of the vampire myth now available in fantasy media. Necromancers of the Northwest proposed a solution to that problem with Liber Vampyr: Secrets of the Blood, a book that presented a customizable version of a playable vampire, which not only gave you great control over your vampiric powers (in the form of vampire feats), but also gave you control over which weaknesses you possessed, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Liber Vampyr revolutionized the world of vampire PCs, there can never be too many options, and this book provides a small infusion of extra vampiric power to your campaign. Included are four new revenant weaknesses, three  new vampire feats granting exciting new vampiric abilities, and a selection of five new skill unlocks specifically for vampires and vampiric characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for new tricks and twists for vampires in your game, this book is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
