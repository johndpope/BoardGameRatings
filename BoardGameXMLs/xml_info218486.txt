			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strength in numbers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SUPER SYNDICATE is a large group of criminals who have banded together for mutual protection. With a membership of 24 villains, the bad guys in the SUPER SYNDICATE know that someone's always got their back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small groups of them execute their plans to pull off burglaries, robberies, and the occasional roughing up of rivals. Meanwhile, additional groups may be in hiding looking to cut-off the cops or any meddling heroes. If it all goes wrong, there are even more ready to bust their fellows out of jail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our first ever team book has 41 pages of sinister goodness including the background on the team, details on the preferred jobs and partners of the members, affiliated street gangs, 13 full fledged members with story ideas, and 11 minor members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SUPER SYNDICATE is here! Better call for back-up, heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
