			<description>With the same mechanic as traditional Risk a new challenge in playing cards to conquer the planet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you already know traditional Risk, you'll enjoy this thrilling adventure between 40 countries. The First player that achieves their secret goal or common goal will emerge victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you shuffle all the country card and give it evenly to all the players. Then give a secrect objetive, wich consist in having determined countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must attack other players countries to conquer them and try to complete your objetive before other do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;also, if in your turn at least you conquer 1 country you can draw a special card wich can help you to get close to the objetive or complicate your rival's objetives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great element of chance in T.E.G.. They're now replaced with dice cards, which each have 3 numbers in decreasing order. They're evidently an important part of the game: of the 137 cards, 56 are dice cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat between two players happens comparing two dice cards that players select from their hands. The one being attacked can even choose to grab the first dice card from a deck facing down, to leave the result completely to chance. The concept, again, is the same as the original: chance, with a certain degree of player control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
