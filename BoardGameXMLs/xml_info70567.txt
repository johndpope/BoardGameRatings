			<description>PSX was a Sony digital video recorder with fully integrated PlayStation and PlayStation 2 video game consoles. Since it was designed to be a general-function audiovisual device, it was marketed by the main Sony Corporation and was released only in Japan on December 13, 2003. It was the first Sony product to utilize the XrossMediaBar (XMB).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system became widely criticized due to a very high price, and customer interest began decreasing. As a result, the PSX was never released outside Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;PSX (DVR)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
