			<description>From the Book's Opening Paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the second installment of Gloria Mundi, the demo chronicle for Mage: The Awakening. The players' cabal has been drawn into something arcane and dangerous through no fault of its own. In the first story, &amp;quot;Gazing Into You,&amp;quot; the characters risked losing their minds and souls grappling with spirits formed of pure vice. They found the mage responsible for loosing those spirits upon the world and responded to his ardent pleas for help. And, assuming all went well, they banished, destroyed, or trapped one of those spirits. But they have no time for rest or recuperation before they must confront another of these beings, one much more dangerous than the Sloth-spirit they encountered before. This new spirit - that of Wrath - has already possessed and claimed a mage whose shadow name is Amelia, and she is out for blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
