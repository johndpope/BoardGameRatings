			<description>From the website/Press Release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life is a resistance to what came before it, and what comes after. The universe of things is the illusion, as is the sense of birth as our beginning and death as our end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a primal level you know this to be true: the squareness of this world has made your mind wander, and in dreams you've been given glimpses of elsewhere. You remember what this elsewhere felt like, because you've been there. Think back of when you were a child: late at night you wake up for nor reason, your eyes go to the closet, it's dark. Remember what that felt like. The details don't matter -the details are gone. It's the scent what stayed with you. Others disregard it. Maybe you tried to, and can't. You suspect right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hidden wars do rage all around you; and you suspect right every time you feel their echoes whispering down the back of your neck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the next step. Let Belief be your key, your door and your doorknob. Let it guide you to a place where you can will anything into existence by simply hoping (or fearing) it&amp;rsquo;s already there. Because it most certainly is. Dreams and nightmares, Cogito Ergo Mundus - the Shadowside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter The Shadowside, a paranormal-themed RPG set in modern times and based on the Jacob's Ladder system, an innovative visual device which resolves conflict through the properties of geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
