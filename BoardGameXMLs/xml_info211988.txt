			<description>It's time for the annual Coney Island Hot Dog Show where competitors worldwide will compete for the coveted title of Wurst In Show!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hot Dogs, you will need to craft a variety of frankfurters quickly and accurately using your ingredient cards, but you are working with a head chef that is trying to mess you up. In order to gain a point, you must win one round, take a detriment card and then win the next round. You could say you need to win &amp;quot;at your Wurst point&amp;quot;! If nobody succeeds, the chef scores. Play continues until all players have been chef. To win you have to make 'em fast, make 'em right and do it all before the other players ketchup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
