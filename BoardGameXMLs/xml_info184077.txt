			<description>Stack high to win, stack wide to win, just don't let the stack of furniture fall!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is hanging in the balance...think you can stack one more table or one more chair without toppling the pile? Then grab a piece of furniture, and get ready to play! Players take turns stacking tables or chairs any way they can, until one of them topples the pile all over! Be careful because the entire game is a balancing act! The player with the fewest toppled furnishings at the end of the game is the winner or if you'd rather, be the one to finish stacking all your furnishings first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some may know the game Chairs... this is incredibly similar except you have both tables and chairs, not just chairs to work with! This variation of the game &amp;quot;Chairs&amp;quot; provides new surfaces &amp;amp; chair shapes to stack and balance. Think you can balance that round table on the square chair with holes in it? How about putting that 3-legged chair upside down on a short long coffee table piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with 3 different color tables and chairs of varying shapes and sizes. Add a new play element to your game night with the game, &amp;quot;Tables and Chairs&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
