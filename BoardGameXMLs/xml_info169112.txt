							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mushroom Inn</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every adventure needs a safe place for the players to rest. This is such a place. The mushroom inn is an underground inn you can use in your adventure where the players have gone underground. Situated next to a mushroom forest and an underground river it works perfectly as a starting place for any kind of adventure where the players will venture further down in the darkness looking for treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf is in letter format and consists of three different versions of the map, two coloured and one black and white. One of the coloured maps and the black and white version has a grid attached to it. The map works for any type of Fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
