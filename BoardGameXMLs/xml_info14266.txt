			<description>Each player starts on a different one of five possible paths through Sherwood Forest. Paths are different in length, and they always lead from one end of a game board (there are four of these) to the other. Players take turn rolling a die. On a roll of 1-5 they move forward accordingly. On a roll of 6, a player can either add a new board to the track (and choose the alignment of the board, to ensure his/her own path is short and those of others are long), turn a board around, or extend the game by taking the oldest board away and adding it to the end of the route. The first player to reach the edge of the forest is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
