			<description>Players would first choose a pilot (difficulty) to be as, and then attempt to complete a set of missions in an operation area. The number of operations the player could do, depended on the difficulty, with the higher difficulties having more access; the number of operation areas in the game total around six. Each mission is often introduced by briefing with the player given information about what to expect, or what to destroy. Each operation area has a boss at the end that the player has to overcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the game, the player can find power-ups, ranging from ammo for the main guns, ammo for secondary weapons, or energy for the Sioux/T1's shields, and even pick up an extra gun for both vehicles' main weapons. Weapons range from a fast hitting &amp;quot;Razor&amp;quot; gun, a laser cannon, missiles, smart bombs, and more. Enemies ranged from helicopters, tanks, rocket buggies, flying robots, and stationary guns. Environments that the player deals with include wide open valleys, a volcanic island, a massive underground base, and the ice fields of Greenland complete with an alien city. The player often operates from the cockpit of the vehicle they are in, but can look around or even switch to 3rd person view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Assault Extreme Assault]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
