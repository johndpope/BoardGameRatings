			<description>Jenga Pink Girl Talk is the original Jenga (1986) with pink blocks containing questions orientated for young girls.&lt;br/&gt; The tower consists of 54 wooden rectangular bricks, in layers of 3, placed at right angles to each other. Each player in turn, removes one brick from anywhere below the highest complete story. The player that pulls the block out of the Jenga tower needs to answer a question before she stacks the block on top of the tower, at right angles to the blocks immediately below it. A complete 3-block story must be completed before starting another. Only one hand may be used at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player to stack a block without making the tower tumble over wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;● What is your favourite flower? ● What is your worst fear? ● Name someone you have a crush on right now. ● What is one goal you would like to achieve this year? ● What is your favourite clothing store? ● What is your favourite song? ● Describe one of your secret talents? ● What is your favourite food? ● What is your favourite sport? ● What is your favourite colour to wear? ● What was your favourite vacation? ● What is your favourite restaurant? ● Who was the last person you talked to on the phone? ● When was the last time you cried? ● Name your favourite music group or singer. ● What do you like most about yourself? ● What is one of your favourite TV shows? ● What is your favourite holiday? ● Who is the last person you were angry with? ● What is your favourite season? ● What is your favourite movie? ● Who is the last person you said &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; to? ● What is your dream car? ● What is your favourite book? ● What do you want to be when you grow up? ● What is your favourite hobby? ● What is your nickname? ● Who is your favourite movie star? ● If you were an animal, what would you want to be? ● What is your favourite cereal? ● If you had one wish, what would you wish for? ● What is your favourite subject at school? ● Who is the last person that made you feel good about yourself? ● What is your favourite candy? ● What is your most embarrassing moment? ● What is your favourite magazine? ● What is your favourite game? ● What is your favourite sport to watch? ● Who is your closest friend? ● What is your most overused phrase? ● Who is the last person that text messaged you? ● What is your favourite reality show? ● What is one thing you wish you never did? ● What bothers you most about other people? ● What is your favourite drink? ● Who is the most daring person you know? ● What animal would you most like to have as a pet? ● What country would you like to visit? ● What is the last thing you spent money on? ● Who is the last person you text messaged? ● What is your weakness? ● What is your favourite website? ● Who is the funniest person you know? ● Who is your hero?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
