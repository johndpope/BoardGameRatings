							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Business Game Delft</name>
									
			<description>This is a board game published in 1996 to celebrate Delft's 750 years as a cultural city. It appears to be published/supported by a host of Dutch business, particularly those based in Delft. One of the businesses is Jumbo games. Several forewords from the various companies involved in the game are found in the rules book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a 12 X 12 square grid superimposed on a map of Delft. The object of the game is to place tiles on the board, with the coordinates determined by rolling two dice (with opportunities for two re-rolls). When a square of four tiles is on the board, it is considered completed and is turned over to show an 'object worth seeing'. Rolling doubles allows one to roll a special die, which could result in an extra turn, being allowed to place two tiles anywhere on the board, or missing the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when someone has completed five objects worth seeing. Scoring points is based on where the tiles in completed objects lie. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
