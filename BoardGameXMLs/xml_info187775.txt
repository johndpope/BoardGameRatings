							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hammersong&#039;s Legacy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been a century since the War of All Gods has ended, and the land of Cameria has yet to heal from the devastation. The Duar Protectorate stood guardian over the people of the Shattered Territories, under the watchful eye of the great warrior-king, Ollum Hammersong. Despite the twisted monstrosities that roam the wilderness, the people of this realm have made their first steps toward recovery. Now, however, the great king is dead, and not everyone in the High Courts of the Duar Protectorate holds such noble goals as their former liege. A Regent's Council rules temporarily, while agents of the High Court of Balmordak travel abroad in search of the king's missing heir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hammersong's Legacy provides a strong foundation for running a campaign set in this post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. This sourcebook provides full details on the Gods of the New Order, the sentient races that inhabit the region, the history and culture of Cameria and the Duar Protectorate, the village of Rynoc's Reach to serve as a base of operations, a wide and varied range of over sixty adventure seeds, a small fantasy bestiary of more than sixty creatures and more. In short, Referees will find a rich and vibrant setting for their fantasy campaigns within this sourcebook, which in turn will provide hours of joy and entertainment as players and Referees alike explore the shattered realms of Cameria and discover the secrets of Hammersong's Legacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
