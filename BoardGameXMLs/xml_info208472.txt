			<description>This second set of scavenged food sources features a wide variety of foodstuffs &amp;ndash; from canned goods and heavily processed treats to consumables recently acquired from the surrounding terrain. There&amp;rsquo;s a special bit of interest placed on late summer/early fall harvest time in this one. If the GM happens to want to detail the findings of a remote farming location where the local survivors have relied on simple, common sense gardening and farming then this is the particular set for you. Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also plenty of canned and processed goods to found in the list as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
