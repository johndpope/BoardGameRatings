			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll be having conniption fits when the playing board is flipped upside down. Watch closely as the colored disks start tumbling into new color sequences. Will they land  in winning color combinations for you, or for your opponent? Yikes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, players drop their discs down the vertical slots. But first, they must decide to flip the board before, or after, they play, creating brand new disk dilemmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flip your way to 4 in a row to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
