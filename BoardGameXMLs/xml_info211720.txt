							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battletech Combat Manual: Mercenaries</name>
									
			<description>Some soldiers fight for king and country, some for honor and glory, others for liberty or loved ones. We&amp;rsquo;ll fight for that too, whatever your cause, as long as the check clears.&lt;br/&gt;For over forty centuries, mercenaries have plied their trade and been instrumental in toppling empires or holding the tides of war at bay. And as mankind expanded to the stars, soldiers of fortune rose to new heights of power. Business is booming, yet along with those riches comes a dangerous life and the scorn of many who see only filthy lucre-warriors. It&amp;rsquo;s a dangerous life, but as long as you keep your &amp;rsquo;Mech intact and your bottom line balanced, the universe is yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BattleTech Combat Manual: Mercenaries contains information on the soldier-for-hire trade and their place in the Inner Sphere. This manual takes a look at some of the most renowned mercenaries of the 31st century, detailing their histories, tactics, unit crests, paint schemes, and notable personnel. This Alpha Strike expansion includes special rules for unique character abilities, faction-specific rules, force-building, and a mini Technical Readout&amp;mdash;everything you need to field your favorite mercenary command on the tabletop or create your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
