			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;... If It Doesn't Bleed, You've Got a Problem!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Explorer's Society barely scratched the surface of the Weird West (tm) with the 1877 edition of Rascals, Varmints, &amp;amp; Critters.  Unfortunately, the book never made it to the public.  The Society, never one to give up on a challange, is taking another shot at it.  This time, they've called in a few experts to help them with their research.&lt;br/&gt;If you're lucky enough to get your hands a copy of these notes, you just might stand a chance against the horrors and abominations prowling the mountains, prairies, deserts, and even the waters of the Great Maze itself!&lt;br/&gt;If you're a Marshal, you can reload your cartridge belt with a passel of new abominations as well as details on some legendary horrors, like Dracula, El Diablo Negro, Frankenstein, and Springheel Jack.  Rascals, Varmints &amp;amp; Critters II also contains some optional rules for those times when heroes catch one of the more unpleasant ailments the Weird West has to offer - vampirism and lycanthropy!&lt;br/&gt;This 128-page supplement for the Origins Award-winning Deadlands roleplaying game lets loose a whole stampede o' new critters on the Weird West.  Hunting season is open!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
