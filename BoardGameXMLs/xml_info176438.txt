							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cthulhu Madness: Midnight in the Graveyard</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's 1923 and you are in a graveyard. Bad things are about to happen. Real bad things... Hope you survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an intermediate level Engle Matrix game. This now comes as a story telling game. Players take turns moving character tokens on a map to set up scenes and create sections of the narrative. Each addition to the story is evaluated in terms of how likely it is to happen and how well it fits with the overall story. This evaluation determines the number that needs to be rolled for the new segment of the story &amp;quot;to happen&amp;quot; and to be added to the main narrative.&lt;br/&gt;The player who contributed the most significant elements of the story is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
