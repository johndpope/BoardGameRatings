			<description>This game is a 3D four in a row (Qubic), but represented on a simpler 4 X 4 board. The board is a 4x4 grid and each player has 4 different size rings of his color. The sizes are such that the rings will nest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to complete &amp;quot;a line of four&amp;quot; 4 rings of same color to win the game. Three kinds of alignments on a &amp;quot;line of four&amp;quot; are possible: same size of rings across 4 spaces, 4 different progressive sizes across 4 spaces, or 4 concentric rings on the same square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interestingly enough with this set you can also play Four Score. To play Four Score, you must play from smallest to largest ring in a particular playing space (or visa versa). The object again is to make a &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; of four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
