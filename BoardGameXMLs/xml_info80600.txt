							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes is a stealth action video game developed by Silicon Knights and Konami that was published in 2004 for the Nintendo GameCube video game console. The Twin Snakes is a remake of Metal Gear Solid, developed and first published by Konami in 1998 for the PlayStation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Twin Snakes features graphical improvements over the original, new cut scenes written and directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, and gameplay functions originally introduced in the sequel Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. The game also includes a revised translation with re-recorded voice acting using most of the original English voice cast. It uses the same engine and items as Metal Gear Solid 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For The Twin Snakes, Metal Gear Solid's gameplay was altered to resemble that of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. While all of the original areas and enemies were kept, new ways for the player to combat them were introduced, such as the ability to shoot using first person view. Enemy AI was also improved, giving enemy soldiers the ability to communicate with each other and detect the player more intelligently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Info:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although The Twin Snakes was largely developed at Silicon Knights (mostly programming), its cut scenes and models were developed in-house at Konami and directed by Japanese film director Ryuhei Kitamura, reflecting his dynamic signature style, utilizing bullet-time photography and choreographed gunplay extensively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite receiving generally favorable reviews, The Twin Snakes has also drawn criticism. According to GamePro, the game has a &amp;quot;flagging framerate and bouts of slowdown that occur when too much activity crowds the screen.&amp;quot; The new gameplay elements from MGS2 have also been criticized as unnecessary, as the level design is virtually unchanged from MGS1, and even &amp;quot;spoil the challenge ... and completely ruin at least one boss battle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The January 2009 issue of Game Informer placed The Twin Snakes at #11 on their list of &amp;quot;Top 25 GameCube Games&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
