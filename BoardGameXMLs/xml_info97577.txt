							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Community Challenge for Miami: Fort Lauderdale</name>
									
			<description>This is a Florida trivia game about the Miami and Fort Lauderdale area. The board features a variety of local landmarks and tourist attractions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game each player is given four &amp;quot;challenge cards&amp;quot; which correspond to spaces on the board. The object of the game is to become the first player who &amp;quot;captures&amp;quot; and controls all four of his or her challenge spaces. Players capture a space by correctly answering a trivia question. Spaces can be taken away from another player by demanding a challenge when a contestant's token lands in the square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes two booklets -- Level I and Level II, with Level II questions being more difficult. Also includes the board, six tokens, a die, 24 challenge cards, and a storage insert. &lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
