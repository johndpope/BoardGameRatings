Casualties have been high, the many graves surrounding the church attest to that. The remaining Norman crusaders watch over the church from the bell tower.

Players can take the role of the Norman crusaders and priests defending the church or they can play as the Seljuk Turks trying to overcome their defenses and push them out of their land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norman culture began when Vikings were ceded the land of Normandy by France. These Vikings adapted by incorporating the local Romance languages and Romanesque architecture as well as converting to Christianity. Norman Churches were copied from original Frank designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norman Church has several examples of Norman Romanesque architecture characterized by features like high arched doorways and a fortified tower for defense of the church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norman churches were most commonly found in the United Kingdom, eastern Ireland, northern France, southern Italy and Sicily, Malta, Cyprus, and the Principality of Antioch (This area is part of Turkey and Syria in the present) during the Crusades (The height of Norman influence was 1000-1100 A.D. The culture became Anglo-Norman after their conquest of England before finally becoming subsumed as part of the English culture as their culture mixed with their Anglo-Saxon subjects.) Churches in Italy often incorporated more Islamic, Lombard, and Byzantine architecture giving rise to a Sicilian Romanesque style of architecture. Most surviving Norman churches in modern times are in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
