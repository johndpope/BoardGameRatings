							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Ride Kursk: Air Enhancement</name>
									
			<description>The Death Ride Kursk Air Enhancement provides players a significanlty more detailed window into the air operations and their effect on combat operations in the XLVIII Panzer Korps area.  Units are modeled as flights and significant parts of many squadrons are reflected in supporting both sides.  At this time the Germans had local area air superiority for a time, but this would finally end after the battle and the Red Air Force became a force to be reconed with on its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original system made Close Air Support (CAS) a fairly easy mechanic to understand and implement.  This enhancement provides just the right amount of sophistication, while still remaining easy to learn, and forces both sides to do more planning for the air part of the campaign.  In the end that part of why we play, to see how the planning takes place to support your ground combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will now be able to have air to air combat, interception of enemy CAS, and the possibility of hitting friendly troops with air strikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has to be the most fun of all the enhancement packages so far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This enhancement package was recently updated with an expanded set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This enhancement comes in a photo envelope.  Components include:&lt;br/&gt;(1) counter sheets&lt;br/&gt;(16) pages of rules&lt;br/&gt;German Airfield Chart&lt;br/&gt;Russian Airfield Chart&lt;br/&gt;Airfield definition card&lt;br/&gt;Close Air Support results and targeting determination chart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
