			<description>WARLIKE uses Deep hand and deck managing aspect with a large array of different options to move miniatures on battlefield map. Is similar to miniature war games.  &lt;br/&gt;Each card is representing a Unit from a different Fantasy World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Deck reflects your personality. &lt;br/&gt;Your Cards represent the Units, Equipment, Spells and Tactics you have at your disposal as you play.&lt;br/&gt;Your Life and the lives of your trusted armies will depend on your skill as a strategist. To win this endless war, you must ultimately destroy the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is pretty short in length for a war game.&lt;br/&gt;Each army plays different, each has a distinct appearance and background.&lt;br/&gt;Players can customize their Faction Decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game:&lt;br/&gt;    Players set up the two different resource regions consisting using up to five Villages or Locations cards. &lt;br/&gt;    At the start of each turn, active player draws 2 cards, which are played onto the battlefield during play. All of them are promoted to more powerful movement style using own Skills. Most of these Units have special abilities (e.g., teleportation, Jumping, Double Attack &amp;hellip;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rules are stoopid simple, and yet the different clans and their cards are all so brilliantly constructed that this quick-playing game can easily hog all your table-time.&lt;br/&gt;This is an incredibly deep game, and it takes a number of games to internalize your own options, much less your opponent's. &lt;br/&gt;The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This miniature-like card-board game was inspired by Heroscape, HeroClix, MTG, Mage Knight Board Game, Mage Wars and other cool games themed around a fantasy style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
