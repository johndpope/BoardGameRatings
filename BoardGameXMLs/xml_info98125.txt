			<description>Remove jokers. Deal each player 4 cards - 2 face-down and 2 face-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn they will normally play a card to a central pile using any one of their 4 cards, draw a card to replace the one they just used, then announce the sum of the cards in the central pile. Aces and faces are worth 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sum may not exceed 25. You may not play a card that would bring the sum above 25. If neither of a player's face-up cards are valid plays, they have the option of discarding any one of their cards and replacing it with a newly drawn card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, after a player's turn, the value of the central pile reaches exactly 25, they sweep aside the pile - scoring one point - and the next player plays the next move, starting a new pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score 3 points has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
