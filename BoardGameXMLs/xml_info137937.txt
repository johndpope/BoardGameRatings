			<description>A dinosaur-themed memory game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 49 dino cards (7 different species in 7 different colours) and 7 T. rex cards are shuffled. Nine of them are placed face-down in a 3 x 3 grid to form the &amp;quot;dino hide&amp;quot;. The remaining cards form the draw deck. The T. rex token is placed at the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game starts, the 9 cards in the dino hide are turned face-up and players try to remember them. Then they are turned face-down again. &lt;br/&gt;The start player takes the top card from the draw deck. The dino from this card is the one he/she has to find in the dino hide. He/she turns over a card from the dino hide. &lt;br/&gt;- If it is the same colour or same species as the one on the search card, the player wins that card and puts the search card in its place, face down. Then he/she gets two more tries. A player's turn ends when he/she has either won three cards or turned over a card that doesn't match the search card.&lt;br/&gt;- If a player turns over an incorrect card, his/her turn ends immediately. The search card still takes the other card's place in the hide, but the original card is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;Then the next player's turn starts, and he/she takes a new search card from the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has won three dino cards, the T. rex gets wind of the dino meeting. The T. rex token is placed in front of that player. It stays there until another player collects three cards and T. rex runs over there, or until a T. rex card is revealed. If a T. rex card is revealed (either from the draw deck or the dino hide), the T. rex chases away one dino owned by the player that the T. rex token is currently at. That player loses one of his/her cards, but also gets to put the T. rex token into the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;The player who has revealed the T. rex card gets to takes the card. It counts the same as any other card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the draw deck has been exhausted. The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
