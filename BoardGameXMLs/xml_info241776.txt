			<description>The Diana was one of the six Mahonesas-class frigates built at the Mah&amp;oacute;n shipyard in Minorca, based on French and British construction techniques and improving upon them &amp;ndash; She was the fastest ship of her class. It participated in the evacuation of the Spanish forces at the Siege of Roses during the French Revolutionary Wars.
