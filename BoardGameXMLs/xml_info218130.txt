			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one is pretty simple&amp;hellip; try to keep up.&lt;br/&gt;Stack the blocks up three by three to build a tower.&lt;br/&gt;A player starts by removing a block from the tower and choosing to either answer the truth or do the dare on the block.&lt;br/&gt;After answering the truth/doing the dare, the player stacks the block on the top of the tower. Then the next player goes.&lt;br/&gt;If a player refuses to do the truth or the dare on the block, that&amp;rsquo;s ok, they can put that one on top of the stack and pick another (note: you can choose to set a limit to the number of times a player may skip before starting the game).&lt;br/&gt;BEFORE STARTING THE GAME you need to decide what the punishment will be for the person who knocks over the tower. We tend to go with spanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: There&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that a block will get pulled twice in the same game (because you put the blocks back on top after pulling them, genius). When this happens, whoever pulls the block the second time must choose the truth/dare that wasn&amp;rsquo;t done the first time the block was pulled. Once a block is pulled twice in one game, don&amp;rsquo;t stack it back on top, just take it out and don&amp;rsquo;t use it for the rest of the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
