			<description>Personology is a boardgame controlled by a video tape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you'll have to guess the name of a famous personality. You'll be presented a blurry picture, a quote or something similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you guess correctly within 7 seconds you get to roll the dice and double your movement.&lt;br/&gt;If you guess correctly between 8 and 15 seconds you get to roll the dice and move normally.&lt;br/&gt;If you fail to guess within 15 seconds the other players can try to guess themselves. If another player guesses correctly, he steals your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each correct guess also gains the player a chance card. These cards break the rules in various ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to reach the finish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
