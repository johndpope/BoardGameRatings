			<description>This game reimplements the popular Italian game Mercante in Fiera with new graphics, contents and game flow:&lt;br/&gt;1) the illustrated cards are a tribute to some modern board games (example: the farmer of Agricola, the king of Caylus, the panda of Takenoko, the hut of Stone age);&lt;br/&gt;2) includes a board and coins;&lt;br/&gt;3) in addition to the &amp;ldquo;classic version&amp;rdquo;, there is a &amp;ldquo;modern version&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game flow of the modern version:&lt;br/&gt;- At the beginning all cards are distributed to players (there is therefore no auction phase).&lt;br/&gt;- In turn, each player plays the role of the merchant and can see 3 losers cards for free or spend coins to see a winning card. He then has to try to conclude a deal with a player by selling, exchanging or buying a card. After doing this, he reveals a loser card. &lt;br/&gt;- In one round, each player plays the role of a merchant 2-3 times according to the number of players. Then, players reveal the winning cards and earn the correspondent coins.&lt;br/&gt;- After 3 rounds, players earn or lose additional coins according to the number of completed deals, and whoever has the most is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
