			<description>Race around the world with Phileas Fogg and his faithful companion Passepartout. Explore the depths of the world's oceans with Captain Nemo. Set forth today on your own extraordinary voyage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extraordinary Voyages is played in a series of rounds, over multiple boards using each player's individual deck. A player may draft a card, play up to three cards from their hand, or go adventuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Around the board will be various goods you need to acquire while adventuring, but the main goal is to finish any one of the three maps before any of your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
