							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Season Harvest</name>
									
			<description>Season Harvest is a resource-gathering game played on a modular board made of cards.  There are four card types: summer, fall, winter, and spring.  As you play cards to change the seasons in spaces on the board, seeds grow into trees which eventually bear fruit.  Your goal is to harvest as much fruit as possible and end the game with the most fruit in your basket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the basic game is competitive, Season Harvest also has several cooperative variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/292/season-harvest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/292/season-harvest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
