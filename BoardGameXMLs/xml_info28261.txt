							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pursuit: A game about the history of civil rights since 1954</name>
									
			<description>Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Six players, each representing a young black person, compete. (The part of a player may also be taken by a team of two or three players.) The game is played on a board showing a map of the 48 contiguous states. The map contains a red track, a blue one and a green one. As the players move around the tracks, their purpose is to achieve the highest possible goals in five areas: education, housing, jobs, public accommodations and voting. Final score for each player depends on: (1) the goals he set for himself at the beginning; (2) his ability to achieve those goals; (3) the region of the country in which he is located; (4) the time at which he tries to achieve his goals; and (5) a certain amount of luck.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
