							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sea Devil</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prince Ravas was first believed to be a villainous ocean menace, named Sea Devil (PL 11) by the press, when he appeared naked in New York City demanding answers to why his home was being threatened by sinking iron vessels. Eventually, the misunderstanding was resolved and Sea Devil helped the Allies defeat the Nazis. He disappeared from the surface world for many years. Now, friends of the Challenger Foundation, Ravas occasionally returns when his help is requested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
