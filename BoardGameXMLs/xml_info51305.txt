							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frontiers of Alusia</name>
									
			<description>The Frontiers of Alusia is the first in a series of adventure maps designed for use with SPI's DragonQuest... The Frontiers of Alusia is fully compatible (with some alteration) with all currently available Fantasy Role-Playing games...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The region portrayed in Frontiers of Alusia is a thinly settled, semi-explored wilderness.  The only significant population centers are the Brastor Holding and Barony of Carzala, which conduct trade with each other via the Sweetwater (dowriver to Carzala) and across the Sweet Riding (upriver to the Brastor Holding).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remainder of the region is thinly settled by humans along the coast and the more accessible stretches of river.  Small tribes of Fairy Folk, Earthdwellers, and Giants are also scattered through out the frontier, and the area abounds with all manner of game (including many fantastical creatures).  The Wilderlands of Gilarni are lightly populated by small family groupings of Elves, and the Hills of Aldri are generally considered sacred to their kind, but no major Elf kingdom exists in the region covered by this map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
