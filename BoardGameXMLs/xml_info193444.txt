			<description>The board shows the 20 characters in the game. At the start of the game a character card is delivered to each player. The player assumes the character assigned. Question cards are shuffled and delivered to the different players. On each turn, each player uses a question card to find out the character of the opponents. The questions are printed in the cards and must be answered with a yes or no. The players always answer telling the truth, except four special characters (the wizard and the star always lie, the unmarried always says no to all questions, and the president will answer whatever he like).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player consider he knows the identity of all the rest of the players, he identifies them. Each player then put into the answer box if the identification is correct. If the player matches all characters, win the match, if not, the game continues until someone guesses all the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
