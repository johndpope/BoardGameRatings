A FANTASY GAME ABOUT PRIORITIES TM is a party game for ages 16 and up that really makes you think but in a fun way. As the millennium unfolds it is evident that people are searching for more depth and meaning in their lives. If You Had To Choose...? is a soul searching game that helps people discover what's really important to them and to others by asking thought provoking questions about their priorities and values in life having to do with love, money, relationships, spirituality, etc. But it does this in a fun and humorous way using fantasy which allows people to enter into totally imaginary situations. People want to escape their everyday lives and If You Had To Choose...? lets them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will predict (by betting with chips) how others will answer and then attempt to persuade them to change their minds in intense discussions. Players, through answering, predicting, persuading and discussing will have eye-opening revelations about themselves and others and also have a great time in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS: Instructions, 660 questions, 330 cards, 20 marker cards, 200 chips, 1 sand timer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 10 players ages 16 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
