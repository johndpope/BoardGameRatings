			<description>Can you outmaneuver the other players and control the finish?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finish Line is a simple game of moving cars from start to finish. Except everyone is moving every car, and everyone is trying to get the cars to finish in a different order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player can move up to five cars one space, or remove a stop sign from the board. Optionally and in addition, a player can place a stop sign, or use one of a limited number of &amp;quot;shift chips&amp;quot; to move a car, move a stop sign, or draw a new Finish card. The goal for each round is to get as many cars as possible to finish in the order on your Finish card. The goal of the game is to be the first to have 10 cars finish in the order on your card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamic of Finish Line changes depending on the number of players, so that an effective strategy for a two-player game might be of no help at all in a four-player game. Adaptability is key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
