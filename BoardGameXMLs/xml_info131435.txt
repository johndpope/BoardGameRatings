			<description>Greed is a concise and fascinating eurogame from substantial developer of board games - Reiner Knizia. In addition to a good mechanic this game can show off a peculiar look styled as picture post cards of the Russian 19th century lifestyle designed by Oleg Ershov.&lt;br/&gt;The game is of the sort when rules understanding takes 15 minutes but mastering of playing skills requires indefinite time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will play a role of a pre-revolutionary businessman beating up among the winds of city life and trying to make money in these fickle conditions &amp;ndash; you are not surprised, are you? Bargaining with proper people, using contacts and getting biggest profit by turning the circumstances to your own advantage.&lt;br/&gt;The most skilled merchant wins the game. And what is the better evidence of business success then undertaking profit? That&amp;rsquo;s why the winning point counters look like cash notes and for the mostly successful ones &amp;ndash; like gold bar cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player acquires two &amp;ldquo;Фарт&amp;rdquo; cards, one &amp;ldquo;Big Фарт&amp;rdquo; card and 10 more cards with random characters (8 cards if there are five players). Characters have positive and negative values. The first ones add the winning points, the others withdraw. &amp;ldquo;Student&amp;rdquo; is a special character which has a neutral, zero value. These two card types differ at the back so as to know how many &amp;ldquo;Фарт&amp;rdquo; cards each player has at the hand. Players shouldn&amp;rsquo;t hide this information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Define by any suitable way who will start the game. Further the turn will dispose clockwise. In your game-business action several card piles will be formed &amp;ndash; one for each player and one in the center. Only upper cards make sense during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player should put a card from his hand during his turn. Cards with positive or negative values can be placed to the own pile or at the center. &amp;ldquo;Student&amp;rdquo; card can be placed to any pile except the one with upper &amp;ldquo;Фарт&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Big фарт&amp;rdquo; card on it. These cards can be played only to the own card piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;ve got all needed contacts and character positions at the table brings you delight and rejoicing, it&amp;rsquo;s time to catch up a moment of gain and hit the jackpot playing &amp;ldquo;Фарт&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Big фарт&amp;rdquo; card. It&amp;rsquo;s placed near player&amp;rsquo;s pile and incites the instant count of all cards values at the table. Sum up the positive values, subtract negative and acquire or lose the sum of cash notes equal to the outcome. It&amp;rsquo;s simple! Though not as simple as it seems because all other &amp;ldquo;Фарт&amp;rdquo; cards at the table also work at this moment. In this case their owners are swept over the commercial tide and they get or lose the congruous sum of banknotes. If &amp;ldquo;Big фарт&amp;rdquo; has been played or provoked the sum of points, positive and negative as well, doubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When everyone plays all the cards the round ends. Then there can be more rounds at will. The amount of rounds can be equal to the number of players to let everyone to make the first turn for the most unbiased result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firstly, the game is logical so the word &amp;laquo;фарт&amp;raquo; obtains a bit different meaning then luck or risk. It can be associated with business acumen, enterprise and skill to use the chance. Remember: maybe business path loves the lucky ones but respects only gentlemen who are sober-minded and prudent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
