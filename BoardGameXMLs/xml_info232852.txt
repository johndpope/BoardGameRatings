							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alien Architects</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are exceptional monuments, buildings, and statues on Earth that have left archaeologists wondering for millennia about their origins and construction. The Great Pyramids of Egypt, the Moai of Easter Island, Stonehenge of England, the Ball of Twine of Kansas; could early civilizations of humans have designed and built these with limited technology and knowledge? Or is it possible (even probable) that we, on this planet, have been receiving help from more advanced cultures from other worlds? In Alien Architects you take on the role of an extraterrestrial who has traveled across the galaxy to compete with other aliens to build monuments on earth throughout human history. Collect or steal resources, blueprints, and technology in order to prove that you are the greatest builder in the universe. And why not have some fun with the humans while you&amp;rsquo;re here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
