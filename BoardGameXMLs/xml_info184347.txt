			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cinis is published as a single, massive, PDF document or as a series of chapters, each a PDF document.  Both version are identical except in division into files (note the single-file version is not bookmarked and is somewhat difficult to use because of its length).  A separate pair of files contain maps of Tigmar, The World of Cinis.  A robust character sheet also is available for download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation in Cinis is fairly involved and the system offers quite a lot of flexibility.  Characters have eight Ability scores (Intelligence, Memory, Perception, Will, Dexterity, Reflexes, Strength, and Constitutions) with scores generated randomly (3d12, pick high).  After random generation players can &amp;quot;tinker&amp;quot; with their scores using a series of adjustments.  Characters then define a Starting Occupation which in turn leads to a restricted skill pool for Skill selections.  Characters next create a Lifeline, or character history, which will modify skill scores.  In general, increasing age increases Skill scores but decreases Ability scores.  Final adjustments are made for Physical Life-style.  In addition, characters choose Race, physical traits, Religion, and Faith.  The final step of character creation is equipping the character which is more straightforward then generating the statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat and opposed skills are resolves through processes which utilize d12 rolls against target numbers.  There are numerous modifiers for situational effects.  Damage is handled through effects tables.  Magical effects are detailed in separate chapters and unwilling targets receive resistance rolls.  The magic system is fairly complex, with various Fields working as specialties.  Priestly magic is based on Religions and Cults and is somewhat less complicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core book also includes three major sections on Tigmar, The World of Cinis.  This is followed by sections of major personalities, minor races, and languages.  The core book also has a section on magic items and a section on monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three supporting files are available:  two maps of Tigmar, and a combined character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
