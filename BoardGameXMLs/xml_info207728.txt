			<description>Game description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimo+ is the reimplementation of Optimo!  It contains the base game and an expansion for younger players (7+) with different cards and rules, but using the same mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimo! is a fast-paced word game in which you have to be the quickest to find the best word with each round's setting. In each round, you have a combination of six cards with constraints (letter or lexical). These constraints can be a requirement (i.e. you must use the letter &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; or you must have six letters in the word) or a ban (i.e. you can't use verbs or you can't have a word with 4 or less letters). Then you must find a word that corresponds to at least 4 constraints, then trigger the timer to give the other players 30 seconds more to find a better word than yours. Pondering if you should find a 5(or 6)-constraint word or go fast with a 4-constraint word to get the fastest-player bonus but risk losing it all to a better word is the core mechanic of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimo kids is an easy and fast-aced word game in which you have a combination of 4 cards with constraints (letter, lexical and theme) which can be requirements or bans. Players must find a word that fits the 4 constraints or launch a &amp;quot;dare&amp;quot; to the other players, leaving them 30 seconds to come up with a word or else, the &amp;quot;darer&amp;quot; wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
