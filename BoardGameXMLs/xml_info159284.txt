							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conquest of Ironrod Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local nobles of the region have sent word to your group requesting a meeting. Later that day you find the Black Raven roadside tavern and are met at the door. After being escorted to a back room which has seen its share of shady dealings you are propositioned with an offer to investigate and depose a set of local nobles who are brothers. Rumor has it that the Ironrod brothers, who have been overtaxing the citizens, have now employed humanoids as guards. This is forbidden and if true, the brothers need to be brought to justice immediately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is part of my 'original' series and has been used as a filler or side trek adventure. It is suitable for a group of adventurers of 2nd through 4th level. While part of the Filbar realm it is easily adaptable to any campaign and most systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
