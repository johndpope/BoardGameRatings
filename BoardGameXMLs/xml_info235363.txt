							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eschaton: Sigils of Ruin</name>
									
			<description>Sigils of Ruin is an expansion for Eschaton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the great battle at the end of days, each player chooses one of six special characters to act as champion for their cult deck. This champion will play alongside other cultists, but will influence the overall play style of the deck in a direction defined by the champion&amp;rsquo;s affiliation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partnered with each champion is a corresponding avatar. Through the ritual invocations based on their champion&amp;rsquo;s affiliation, a cult will eventually be able to summon their avatar to join their deck. These avatars are not only powerful characters, but the direct path to the Sigils of Ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the avatar has served their purpose on the mortal plane, they can be sacrificed to channel the cult&amp;rsquo;s corresponding sigil. When conjured, these sigils are immovable auras that bestow their cult with unique abilities and victory conditions. Although no two paths are the same, they each demand equal favor from the Dark One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
