							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carmen Sandiego: Junior Detective Edition</name>
									
			<description>Although not a version of Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? by name, Carmen Sandiego Junior Detective (sometimes referred to as Carmen Sandiego Junior Detective Edition, Junior Detective Edition, or Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego: Junior Detective Edition) is essentially a simplified version of it for pre-readers. Allgame says the game &amp;quot;is geared for younger users, with only 14 cases to solve&amp;quot;. The lead characters of the FOX animated series Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?, Zack and Ivy were included in the game, along with Stretch - &amp;quot;ACME's crime-tracking dog&amp;quot;. The French game of the game is &amp;quot;Mais o&amp;ugrave; se cache Carmen Sandiego ? Edition Junior&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Production notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Zack, Ivy, the Chief and Carmen Sandiego seem to have the same voice actors as in Earth, Carmen's appearance is different than in the show. Aside from including these characters and the fact that the user is addressed as &amp;quot;Player,&amp;quot; the game has little to do with the Earth show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACME's Stretch the Crime Dog and Stretch's nemesis Carmine, Carmen Sandiego's pet cat, are introduced in this game. According to the game manual, Stretch captured so many V.I.L.E. agents as a puppy that ACME gave him &amp;quot;The Golden Snout Award,&amp;quot; its highest K-9 honor. Stretch later appeared in one episode (&amp;quot;The Remnants&amp;quot;) of the Earth series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Carmen Sandiego Junior Detective&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
