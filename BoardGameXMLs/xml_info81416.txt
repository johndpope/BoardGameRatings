			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wheels On Fire is a role-playing game of car combat based on d10 dice pools, counted successes, and opposed rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be set either in pre-collapse Autoduel Earth, or post-collapse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Autoduel Earth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Autoduel Earth is the world as it is now, only full throttle. There are two periods of consequence, pre-Collapse and post-Collapse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pre-Collapse game takes place 10 years into the future. International politics have now become entirely an exercise in the application of force. Every televised sport has become more popular, more violent, and more profitable. Except for baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pre-Collape game most resembles a modern action-adventure, plus duel racing. While 'pure' races are still run, major racing leagues incorporate Duel Racing. In Duel racing tracks have stunt elements like ramps, water segments, ditch jumps, and lightless tunnels. Also, Drivers are encouraged to cause their opponents to crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Post-Collapse games can really get crazy. Include liberal doses of anti-arena fanatics, apocalypse preaching villains, industrial sabotage, and highway piracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
