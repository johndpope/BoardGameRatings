							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spaceward Ho!: Sci-Fi Combat and Role-Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The superdreadnought's shields were flaring in numerous locations, with more impacts every second, as they angled away enormously dangerous energy beams and deflected mass-driver rods. The titanic monster of a spaceship was engaged with an equally huge enemy carrier, and none had stood in it's way so long before...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be as simple and versatile as possible. It aims to strike a good balance between the detail needed to give each vehicle its own character, and keeping information concise enough that large forces can be quickly created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any unit can be created, from the lowly and ubiquitous space marine, all the way up to planet-crushing space stations and superdreadnoughts. The game can even be used to simulate huge organic monsters able to go toe-to-toe with huge military spaceships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spaceward Ho! Lends itself very well to use as a rules-light role-playing game, but where many sci-fi role-playing games run into trouble when characters are confronted by vehicles and spaceships, Spaceward Ho! copes with these confrontations with ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
