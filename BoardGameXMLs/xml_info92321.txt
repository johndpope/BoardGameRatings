							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: The Black Thorns</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Adept Jeremiah Rose, ComStar's stunning victory on Tukayyid was a crushing personal defeat. After losing his 'Mech and his command to the Clans, Rose resigned his commission with the Com Guards and returned home to seek a place with his family among the famed Northwind Highlanders. When the Highlanders rejected him, Rose refused to give up. He set out for Solaris VII, where he gained a new BattleMech, new comrades, and a renewed sense of purpose. Thus the Black Thorns were born...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recreate the exciting adventures of Jeremiah Rose and his Black Thorns in this scenario pack for BattleTech. Based on the events of the novels Main Event and D.R.T., this book includes a history of the Black Thorns, as well as MechWarrior game statistics for the main characters of this elite mercenary unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Thorns never played a particularly large part in the game canon for the BattleTech universe, and are mostly detailed in a series of novels. This scenario pack contains 15 or so assorted scenarios that allow players to replay major and minor battles from the Black Thorns novels, and also adds four new 'Mechs to the BattleTech game; 3 Clan 'Mechs and 1 ComStar 'Mech. The 'Mechs were reprinted in the BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058 a year later, so if you already have that expansion and aren't interested in the Black Thorns, there's not much reason to get this sourcebook. On the other hand, if you're a big fan of the unit itself, then this is probably a must-have expansion, so you'll be happy to hear that the current licence holder has it available as an electronic book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
