			<description>From the mind of award-winning designer Dr. Reiner Knizia comes this simple and addictive card game! It&amp;rsquo;s an exciting battle of skill, luck, and nerves in Reiner Knizia&amp;rsquo;s Poison. As potion-makers brewing magic elixirs, players play numbered Potion cards into one of three, colored cauldrons, being careful not to overfill them. The player who overfills the cauldron must take all of the cards that go with it, including any of the deadly Poison cards that were mixed in! Players with either the most or least of a Potion at the end of the game might just have a chance of surviving the potions lab and winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
