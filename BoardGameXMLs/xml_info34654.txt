			<description>Stop Light is the amazing magnetic maze game.  Magnetic traffic lights change like magic at any of 100 intersections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to play.  In the first a card is drawn and the first person to get their car to the location first wins that card.  Another card is then drawn and play continues in this fashion until all 18 cards have been collected.  The winner is the person with the most cards.  The alternate way to play is the Cross Town game.  The cards are not used in this one and the winner is first player to cross town by hitting the fewest red lights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnets are placed in the plastic base according to the instructions and then the game board is placed on the base.  As the players car moves on the board the magnet in the bubble in the car may flip from red to green depending on the magnetic action caused by the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
