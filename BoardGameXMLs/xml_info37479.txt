			<description>The Pharaoh is getting old and he does not have a successor.  One day he gathers his closest advisers and issues a challenge: &amp;quot;Build me a pyramid. Whoever contributes the most shall be the next Pharaoh!&amp;quot;.  Who will rise the challenge and become the new ruler of the land?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and draw event cards to maneuver their pyramid-building blocks around the board and into the pyramid at the center.  Points are scored for each block added to the pyramid.  Bonus points are given for blocks that end up on the outside of the pyramid.  Players need to manage their supply of building blocks carefully since the board is cleared after each level of the pyramid is completed and buying back the blocks costs points.  After the pyramid is completed whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
