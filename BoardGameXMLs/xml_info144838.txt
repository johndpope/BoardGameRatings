			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Caverns Old...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hall of Iron was to be the first of hall of King Thraindan's new empire. But when jealousy, betrayal and a terrible curse took hold of clan, his people were destroyed by treachery from within. Now the Hall of Iron has been discovered and its riches lay untouched for generations. But who knows what terrors await those foolish enough to enter this tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King Betrayed is a short stand-alone adventure for use with Labyrinth Lord and other old-school fantasy role-playing games. Designed for 4-6 player characters of 3rd-5th level, this module provides material for an evening of adventure as well as plot hooks that can easily be transformed into an entire campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
