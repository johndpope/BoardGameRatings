			<description>You're a movie monster lurking in the streets of late 19th century London. You're killing like it's goin gout of style. But in the wake of the Ripper murders, it's not as easy as it sounds. There are gangs of hard-nosed ruffians, and bonnies with their silly hats and batons, and the insipid reporters, all trying their best to get in your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
