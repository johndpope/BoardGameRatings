			<description>Road Trip Adventure, also known as Road Trip or Choro Q HG 2,  combines elements from racing and adventure games, and is widely considered to be the best of the Choro Q series due to its large seamless world which the player can freely explore. The game takes place in a world where there are only cars and no people. Road Trip Adventure was released on the Playstation Store for the PS3 on February 15th 2012 as part of the PS2 Classics release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you start a new game in Adventure Mode, after the player chooses their name and currency a scene appears where the President says that he will organize a World Grand Prix, where the winner would become President himself. After that you are transported to a Q's Factory (place where the player changes everything in your car from wheels to engines). This Q's Factory is located in Peach Town, a gentle classic-styled city. The main goals of the game are to become President and to get all the stamps. Stamps are earned by doing other cars favors such as deliveries or simply by visiting houses and also by completing mini-games. A secondary goal is completing your picture album. To take pictures you have to visit a Quick-Pic Shop appearing on the map with a black mark. After you take the picture, the owner (always a pink Toyota Vitz) will tell you where the next shop is located. Another goal is completing &amp;quot;My City&amp;quot;, your own city. To complete it, you must talk to many different cars in all the towns and sometimes they will ask you if you know somewhere to start a new life or to build their shops. After the city completed, you should have besides regular houses a school, a Fire Department, a police station and the group of 4 factories (composed by a Q's Factory, a Body Shop, a Parts Shop and a Paint Shop), among others. To get into the World Grand Prix,you must have two teammates. To acquire teammates, simply talk to other cars and if they are recruitable they may ask you to consider allowing them to join your team. However, you must have a licence of b or higher to gain teammates that are fast and worth your time. Of course your teammates' qualities depend also of the parts you give them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, you are asked to specify a name for the currency used in the game. Money is a large factor in Road Trip Adventure. It is used to trade parts and deposit in banks, and to advertise. To win money, you can race, sell parts and advertise. There are five shops where you can advertise, the coffee shop in Peach Town (10 of your currency per km), a noodle restaurant in Fuji City (20 of your currency per km), a cake shop in Sandpolis (30 of your currency per km), a wool shop in White Mountain (40 of your currency per km) and a coconut shop in Papaya Island (50 of your currency per km). Each shop gives you some money for each kilometer you drive with their respective advertisement. You can also put one sign on each of your teammates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are around 20 mini games in Road Trip Adventure. Completing them inherits money, stamps and parts. These mini games include Soccer, Roulette and Drag Races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Road Trip Adventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
