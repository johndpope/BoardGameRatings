			<description>The Bermuda Triangle has been know for its treacherous sea. An adventurous band of pirates has set its sights on an island known for the treasures it conceals. On their way, they must overcome mysterious, suddenly appearing, whirlpools that will instantly drag their boat to the bottom of the sea. Will you be able to navigate your boat to the island in this mystic sea, amass the treasures and make your way back safely? Will you outsmart competing bands of pirates trying to get their hands on the treasures before you?  &lt;br/&gt;Bermuda Pirates is a highly original game where players&amp;rsquo; boats are literally captured by the sea on their way to the treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory, dexterity, and sharp observation skills will be put to the test to prevail in this captivating game for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bermuda Pirates, each player must push their boat with only one finger and reach the treasure island in the center of the board and grab some treasures. Avoid the whirlpools (magnets) as your boat might sink and you will need to start again! First player to get 4 different kinds of treasures wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
