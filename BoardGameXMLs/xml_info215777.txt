			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Shadow of the Demon Lord Adventure for Novice Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legend of the Beast of Valderhalen Hollow is a tale long told, but rarely told the same. In some versions, the Beast is a horrific monster that captures and devours the good-hearted, the kind, the innocent. In others, the Beast is a savior, a true protector of the very things it is so wrongly accused of devouring. And in others still, the Beast is but a dragon like any other, a fire-breathing hoarder of treasures and time. But one story persists above all others: that of the Beast as the keeper of the Savage Ornament, a profane blade whispered to hold the power to slay anything, even the Beast itself. In truth, the Beast &amp;mdash; like all subjects of fable &amp;mdash; is all of these things, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Knife in Your Hand is an adventure for novice characters that forces the group to make tough, life-changing (and possibly life-ending) decisions in a world where nothing is clearly black or white, but instead grey, with splashes of red. It offers a story of triumph and survival, and the myriad ways in which those two intertwine to define our lives. In the end, the characters must choose how best to use the weapon given to them, for a blade does not become life, or death, or redemption until it is wielded by a hand that makes it so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
