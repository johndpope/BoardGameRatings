			<description>A new communicative action and party game for 4-8 (or even more) players.&lt;br/&gt;A phrase that is composed of two single words put together, such as car door  (in German these words are written as one word), must be explained to your co-players, via cutting the phrase out of a piece of paper and tearing the phrase apart.&lt;br/&gt;It is decided by rolling an action die, whether you have to cut / rip the phrase apart alone or with the player to your left. Without words, both have to communicate the phrase to the other players, within a set time limit. &lt;br/&gt;All payers play at the same time, with everyone yelling their ideas into the round, hoping theirs is the right phrase.&lt;br/&gt;The winning team uses the trashed paper to make balls for the victory points they win (2 or 3).&lt;br/&gt;Every player has a garbage can to put his victory &amp;quot;balls&amp;quot; in.&lt;br/&gt;On the end of the game everyone empties his garbage can and counts his victory points&lt;br/&gt;A guarantee for fun and excitement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
