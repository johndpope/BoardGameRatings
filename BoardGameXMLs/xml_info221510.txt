							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Bachiko Takashi</name>
									
			<description>Bachiko is as loyal and devoted to her lord as any can claim to be. She lives and breathes to protect the Takashi line as her father and his father before. A masterful swordswoman, hours spent in the service has given her a sixth sense for danger and she alone has foiled many cowardly attacks against her masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This model can be used as a unique profile or as the second model for the Takashi Retainer Profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister contains one model, one 30mm base and one full colour profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
