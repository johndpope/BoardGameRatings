			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disasters have befallen Metro City and it's up to the fine folks of the Emergency Dispatch Center to save the day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emergency Dispatch is a fast paced co-operative set collection dice game for 2-6 players. Players move colored dice representing various types of emergency equipment around a map of a city. Tiles are placed representing emergency calls that need to be answered. The emergencies are resolved by rolling the dice to get the required combination of symbols. Successfully resolving emergencies earns players bonuses that will help them on future calls. The game is won by solving a minimum number of emergencies over 8 turns without accruing 8 failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
