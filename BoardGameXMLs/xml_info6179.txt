			<description>Labyrinth of Minotaur [Minotauros] is an ancient board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a real ancient game from ancient Crete with boards found dating to  about 1.000 B.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many boards, with Labyrinths on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2-4 players. Each player has seven pawns. Pawns must have the signs of Minos era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also there are three dice with ancient Greek shapes on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest die roll plays first. All pawns must enter the board make a run and then return to the beginning. The players chose the board.&lt;br/&gt;Boards can be on a big board on both sides. Player who manages to exit all his pawns is the winner. Each square has its own sign; each sign has a command to do (i.e. go 10 spaces, back 5 spaces etc).&lt;br/&gt;So the board game has the following items:&lt;br/&gt;1. Some Colored Boards with Labyrinths.&lt;br/&gt;2. Seven pawns different in color and shape for each of the four players.&lt;br/&gt;3. Three dice with different shapes each one.&lt;br/&gt;4. Many other items.&lt;br/&gt;Of course there is a 32-page leaflet with some information for this game with many photos from ancient Crete and from Greece. (The island of Deus)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
