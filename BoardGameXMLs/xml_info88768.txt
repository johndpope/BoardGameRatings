			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure for acolytes in their second to forth ranks in their careers. It is a horror scenario, and is meant to be difficult. Players will almost certainly Burn Fate Points, but successful play may be rewarded with a fate point, if the GM deems the players have deserved it. The scenario should take about two gaming sessions to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure uses two heresies and some Imperial discord from Disciples of the Dark Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is Prol I, an Administratum run planetoid in conflict. The Administratum has run out of room in its data valuts on Prol I through IX. Prol X is proscribed. The Centurists wish to use Prol X, proscription be damned. The Pyratics seek to burn the old and unused records on Prol I, the setting for this adventure. Recently the Pyratics have secretly moved in people and are preparing for the &amp;quot;Great Burning.&amp;quot; While the population is listed as 400 caretakers, the real population is ten times that. See The War of Words, Disciples of the Dark Gods, page 166 for more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
