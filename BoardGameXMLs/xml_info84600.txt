							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">rpgKids v1.5</name>
									
			<description>A very simple RPG consisting of opposed die rolls using a d12, while encouraging kids to think creatively, perform simple arithmetic, and have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new version contains a few tweaks that people had been making and applied them to the rules. There is also a new healer class and some added materials:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fully bookmarked, 24 page PDF also includes funny and kid friendly hand drawn tokens for both heroes and monsters, character cards and a printable 1&amp;Prime; grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not all, because it also includes a full introductory adventure, designed to show all the rules of the game at work, within the context of a fun quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;rpgKids is suitable for kids from 4 years old, up until they can grasp a more complex game like D&amp;amp;D or some other rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
