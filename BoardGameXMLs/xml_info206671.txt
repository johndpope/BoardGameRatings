			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon takes a common spell and provides you with a number of alterations and additions to add excitement and useful options for your next adventure.  Each issue of Avalon Spell Books will focus on a new spell, discussing different versions of the spell, providing different components that can be used to alter the way the spell works, and even adding feats and new magical items linked to the spell in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Delayed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While many spellcasters do know the o-level spell of stabilize, few of them use it often. The reason is that pretty much any healing magic can do the same stabilization trick, only better. Yet easy availability of this orison and its close range - when compared to touch-delivered cure wounds spells - grants it enough usefulness to survive in the spell lists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spell that taps body resources to fight off death still has some potential, and new uses for it are possible. The simplest of them require trained use of Heal skill, while more complicated ones bring development of new spells and magical items into existence, all of them increasing chances of survival for those who got unlucky enough and dropped to negative hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
