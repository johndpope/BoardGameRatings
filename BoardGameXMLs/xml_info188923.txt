							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Celts Guide: The Lands of Albion</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wind swept isles of Albion have long held the popular imagination, and legends are still being invented about the Celtic peoples. In modern times, the Cornish, Welsh, Scottish, Irish, and Manx are the heirs to the Celtic line. In ancient times, the Celts were spread across continental Europe and the Isles. They held great kingdoms and were skilled on horseback, at crossing the oceans, and at strength of arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is much difficulty in separating reality from myth regarding the Celtic peoples, especially given their own penchant for interweaving their myths with reality. Theirs was an oral tradition, and much was not written down until far after. This feeds our view of the Isles being a place fogged in myth and legend. They fought against the Romans, terrifying even the most trained of Legions, traded with the ancient Greeks, built castles on the barest of ocean rocks, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ultimate Celts Guide is a sourcebook for Savage Worlds that seeks to convey a handful of polished gems made from the myth and history of the Celts, ensuring you can utilize these people and their legends in your games. Remembered for their ferocity in battle, their bravery that bordered on foolhardiness, and their love of land and place, the Celts are as much a people of story as they are people in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Celts Guide includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A brief history of the Celtic people.&lt;br/&gt;    Ranks within Celtic society.&lt;br/&gt;    A look at the Celtic lands.&lt;br/&gt;    An overview of Celtic mythology.&lt;br/&gt;    Options for creating Celtic characters.&lt;br/&gt;    Non-player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;    A Celtic adventure.&lt;br/&gt;    ... and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Celts Guide can lay the groudwork for a historical or alternate history adventure set within the Celtic lands of old. It can also be used as a guide for creating Celtic characters within fantasy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
