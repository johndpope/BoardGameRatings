			<description>Classic card game by Robert Abbott, created in 1956 but first published in 1963's book &amp;quot;Robert Abbott's New Card Games&amp;quot;, later revised and edited in a private run as Auction 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have got to bid poker combinations for cards in an open line in the middle of the table - with these cards they should improve their hand and get the best possible poker combination for when the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a card is drawn from the pile and added to the line, afterwards there's an open auction - the cards in the highest combination are exchanged for the last cards on the line. The remaining cards on the line dictate the score at the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the highest score after four rounds or the first one to achieve 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
