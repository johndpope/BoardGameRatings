			<description>from the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is the complete Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons tournament adventure used at the Denver Gamers Association convention, Ganghis Con held in May 1980.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, in a far away place, an awesome weapon was invented that threatened to destroy the world. A great battle was fought over this weapon and as a result, it was tossed into the deepest part of the ocean. The weapon was thought destroyed and the world was safe once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years passed, and rumors began circulating that religious fanatic named Cimosco was attempting to find the final resting place of this weapon of awesome power. If he managed to find and restore this weapon, its horror would once again be unleashed on the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cimsco searched for years and finally found the resting place of the terrible weapon. He enlisted the aid of the sea-dwellers and raised the remains of the artifact. What emerged from beneath the sea was nothing more than a coral-encrusted lump, but repeted blows with mighty sledges released the weapon from its stone like bondage. Four centuries of coral ans salt had not harmed it in any way. Until a way is found to destroy the weapon once and for all, its hellish power threatens all living things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
