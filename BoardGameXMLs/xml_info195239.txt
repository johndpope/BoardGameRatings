			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ISOL, each player takes on the persona of an adult trapped in the Eidolon (the children's dream). Through cooperative as well as competitive storytelling, your group will weave fantastic tales of the challenges faced, the monsters bested, and the traps avoided. While playing the game, always try to remember that the Eidolon is a childish place - this is where the children fantasize and dream! In ISOL, you cooperate to tell exciting stories, but you also compete against each other to escape the Eidolon - only one adult will make it out. Will it be you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses simple d6 for action resolution though multiple dice of different colors are required.  The game was published as a series of posts to an online competition forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
