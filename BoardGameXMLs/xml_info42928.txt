			<description>This game is a competitive word scramble challenge. Each player comes up with a five letter word, takes some letter tiles, and jumbles them in front of him. All players reveal their word, and everybody simultaneously writes down the the unjumbled words of their opponents. The person who does this first declares Stop! and each player collects a chip for each correct word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this point the rules get weird. A winner is declared when the player who is first to accumulate enough chips &amp;quot;bets to Win&amp;quot; and either makes it or slips back into the competition. No where does it mention what you need to &amp;quot;bet to win&amp;quot; I'd just play to a certain chip total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
