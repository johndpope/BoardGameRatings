			<description>Caporetto, 1917&lt;br/&gt;Catastrophe for Italy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the standards of the Great War, Caporetto was a remarkable battle.  Within a month, the Austro-Germans inflicted over 300,000 Italian casualties at a loss to themselves of only 100,000, and had shifted the front over 100 miles.  But they fell short of a decisive victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caporetto recreates this spectacular offensive.  Modifications to the Great War in the East Standard Rules account for infiltration, naval fire support, changes of command, heroic &amp;quot;last ditch&amp;quot; leadership, and much more.  The game poses different problems for each Player, with the Austro-German player impelled to push his advance as fast and as far as possible and the Italian Player forced to retreat, often in the face of certain losses to his rear-guard units, in order to rebuild his shattered line.  But despite the inherent imbalance of forces, the game is tensely balanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the The Great War in the East Quadrigame.&lt;br/&gt;Folio edition contains Standard rules, Special rules, 17&amp;quot; x 21&amp;quot; map and 200 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
