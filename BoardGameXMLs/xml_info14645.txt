			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children will cheer and grin from ear to ear as they create their own newspaper headlines! 110 word cards are color coded to reflect nouns, verbs, adjectives, and prepositions. Players are dealt 7 cards, and will try to construct a sentence using those cards. It can be zany, goofy, and completely off-the-wall, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s grammatically correct: Huge Monkey Eats Acrobat! Kids will learn sentence structure and build their vocabulary, all while cracking themselves up with their nutty headlines. They can even build upon someone else&amp;rsquo;s headlines with words in their own hand: Huge Monkey Eats Acrobat On Skyscraper! Now that&amp;rsquo;s headline news! Players earn points for each card they play, and the first to 30 points, wins the game. Game comes with 110 playing cards and game instructions. For 2 &amp;ndash; 4 players, Grades 1- 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
