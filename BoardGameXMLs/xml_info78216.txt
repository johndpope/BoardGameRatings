							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain</name>
									
			<description>Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain is a real-time strategy computer game. The game emphasizes empire building and customization. Instead of using a single large map as do most of the current real-time strategy games, Pax Imperia revolves around star systems connected by wormholes  or jump points, which connect a system of star systems in a large web. The game allowed for the player to customise the species that they were to play to a high degree. Players could focus on construction, reproduction, research, espionage, or the acquisition of money. Players could select special qualities, such as having psychic powers or an aquatic physiology, and could tailor their species to be better at peaceful colonisation or conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different planets had different types of atmosphere, so that certain species could more easily colonise some than others, and each planet additionally had different quantities of natural resources, similar to the Space Empires series of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the Master of Orion series of games, Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain is not a turn based strategy game, but is instead real time. The game speed can be adjusted during the game, to speed up moments and slow down important parts in which a lot of interaction is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
