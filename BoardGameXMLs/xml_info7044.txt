			<description>(from the instruction booklet)&lt;br/&gt;LIMIT UP is a board game which simulates commodity futures trading and which stresses good money and portfolio management. LIMIT UP players learn not only how the commodity markets work, but how to trade in them as well...&lt;br/&gt;The object is to accumulate as much wealth as possible through the buying and selling of commodity contracts. Players trade in seven commodities: two grains (corn and wheat), two meats (cattle and hogs), one industrial metal (copper), one money instrument (T-Bills), and one precious metal (gold). These commodities differ in their volatility; the higher the volatility, the greater the opportunity for both profit and loss...&lt;br/&gt;LIMIT UP makes you part of the commodity world. You can speculate on the expected price movement, protect your crop, balance your portfolio and limit your risk, or use high leverage. You compete with government policy, weather, and other market forces.&lt;br/&gt;No commodity trade would be complete without an &amp;quot;inside track&amp;quot;; someone always seems to know more than others. In LIMIT UP, you know who is the &amp;quot;insider&amp;quot;, and you can watch that trader adjust his or her portfolio to profit from the news.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
