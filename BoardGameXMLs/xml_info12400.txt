							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I&#039;ve got a Secret</name>
									
			<description>An elaborate adaptation of a simple game show created by comedian Allan Sherman, the first player to hold one card from each of four chance card piles declares &amp;quot;I've got a secret!&amp;quot; The others have to guess what statement the cards comprise. (Example from the rules: &amp;quot;I am a bow-legged baby sitter who stands on his head while taking a shower.&amp;quot;) A running score is kept of guesses, and the first to 100 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One episode of IGAS around the time of the game's release had special guest Don Ameche use it to construct his secret (which only differed from the example in the first two cards, using &amp;quot;bald-headed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;garbageman&amp;quot;). The segment was basically no more than a plug for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
