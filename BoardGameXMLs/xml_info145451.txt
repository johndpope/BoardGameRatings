							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fall of the Lion Gate</name>
									
			<description>In December 1941 the Japanese Empire invaded British Malaya, driving down the peninsula towards Singapore, Britain's main naval base in the Far East. The campaign was a hard one, fought between two enemies who had little understanding or appreciation of their opponents. The end result was a military disaster the like Britain had never seen before. With this huge supplement of 21 scenarios for I Ain't Been Shot Mum, Robert Avery presents us with an option of fighting a linked campaign or just as individual stand-alone games. Can you stop the Japanese juggernaut?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
