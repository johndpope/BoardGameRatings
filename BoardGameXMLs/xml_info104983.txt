			<description>Source:   The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On June 28, 1914 in the center of Saraevo Gavrilo Princip shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife. Those shots began one of the bloodiest wars in the history of mankind - the First World War. For four long years the earth trembled from gun explosions, the air was whistling with bullets and the sky was covered with smoke and ashes. It was the first war with such amount of troops to take part in it, and with military operations going on earth, in the skies and seas, even under the water. Weapons of mass destruction were used for the first time... Now you have a chance to see it with your own eyes and try to change the history in &amp;quot;The Entente game&amp;quot;.
