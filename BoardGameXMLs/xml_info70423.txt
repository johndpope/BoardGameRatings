							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soul Collector</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death comes to all creatures, either as a terror or as a quiet final mercy. Soul Collectors are death's emissaries and ambassadors, creatures that can walk between the worlds of the living and the dead at will. Soul Collectors are empowered by death, and are able to absorb the souls of the dying into their own bodies. Soul Collectors run the gamut from cruel necromantic serial murderers, who torture their victims to death and than enslave their spirits to kind hearted exorcists who lay unquiet spirits to rest. Others act as mediums, helping the dead sever their ties to the living world, or as &amp;Atilde;&amp;cent;&amp;acirc;&amp;sbquo;&amp;not;&amp;Euml;&amp;oelig;forensic necromancers' who use their supernatural gifts to avenge the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soul Collectors tend to be lonely souls, with more friends in the realms beyond than among the living. Soul Collectors make no distinction between the living and the dead, and are as apt to laugh at a joke told them by the soul of a child who died of the Black Plague in 1223 as they are a living friend's comment, and are as likely to take the advice of a merchant who perished in the French Revolution as they are to listen to their living mentor. Some see them as morbid and fatalistic, and many (even mages and other heroes who are used to the supernatural) find the Soul Collector subtly terrifying. After all, the Soul Collector is a constant reminder of the mortality all humans share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
