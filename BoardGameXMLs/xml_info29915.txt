			<description>Originally published as Say Hey! Its Willie Mays' Own Baseball Game, An Oliver Game (c) 1954 by Toy Development Co., Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later published as Willie Mays &amp;quot;Say Hey&amp;quot; Baseball Game by Centennial Game Co. in 1958.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with three spinners, one for the pitcher, one for the batter and one for the fielder. If the pitchers spinner indicates a strike or a ball then the batter can either take the pitch or swing at it. If he decides to swing he uses his spinner to determine if he in fact hits the ball and where it was hit to or if the batter misses it. Then the fielder has the opportunity to catch or field the ball. If the ball is in play a batters dial decides if the hit is a single, double, triple or home run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for trying to bunt or steal. Things like wild pitches and passed balls are posible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
