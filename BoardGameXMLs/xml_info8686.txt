			<description>This game can be used at home or in a classroom. It consists of cards containing words that are missing some of the vowels and a spinner with all the vowels on it. Players simply take turns spinning the spinner trying to get the vowels they need on their cards. The first to complete their card wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great teaching tool for beginning readers and can be a lot of fun to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
