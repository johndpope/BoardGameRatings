			<description>TAPESTRY&lt;br/&gt;An Interactive Destiny&lt;br/&gt;2nd Place, 1996 Interactive Fiction Competition&lt;br/&gt;Winner, Best Story; Finalist, Best Writing in the 1996 Xyzzy Awards&lt;br/&gt;Written by Daniel Ravipinto&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a symbol and a tool. It is your past and your future. It is all things, in time. You, Timothy Hunter, have lived, and like all things mortal you have died. But the aftermath of that lifetime is anything but simple...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faced with creatures beyond your ken, the fruition of whose inscrutible motives hinge on your decisions, what will you do? Will you face who and what you once were? Or will you try to change things for the better? Or the worse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for the 2nd Annual Interactive Fiction Competition, TAPESTRY is about the morality of choice, and some of the viewpoints humanity has held about fate and accountability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
