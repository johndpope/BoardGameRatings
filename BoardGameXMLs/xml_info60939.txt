							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Karmic Races: Orcs</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends claim the first orcs came from the belly of the daemon-lord Orcus himself, and served in his terrible armies to crush the mortal realms.  Long persecuted for the crimes committed while enslaved to their daemonic master, the Orcs now seek to make their own way in a world hostile to their very existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karmic Races: Orcs offers storytellers a new spin on one of fantasy's most maligned races.  Unlock the secrets of their terrifying creation, their persecution by the other mortal races, their rise against the daemon Chathoc, and their ultimate liberation.  This supplement introduces four sub-races that can add a new dimension to your games, as well as hints and advice on using Orcs in modern era games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed for the Karma Roleplaying System, Karmic Races: Orcs contains plenty of background information that can be used in your current games.  Get new inspiration for using orcs in your games, and explore new ideas that will challenge your players to view the race in a different light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
