			<description>Egg Monster Hero (エッグモンスターHERO) is a role playing game spinoff of the Hanjuku Hero. Egg Monster Hero was released on the Nintendo DS in Japan on March 24, 2005, and was the first game Square Enix published for that console. The game plays using the stylus for the most part. The stylus is used to drag Egg Monsters towards the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the 141st best-selling game of 2005 in Japan, selling 92,096 copies.  A mobile phone version of the game became available in Japan on June 6, 2005. The game was apparently intended for a North American release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of the series' main character, the young Lord of the Almamoon Kingdom. While the Lord has the power to summon powerful monsters out of a magical egg, he is usually found slacking off, since the world is at peace and there's nothing to do. Because the young Lord's stupidity is continuing to accelerate, Sebastian, his minister and educator, takes him to an island to train him back into shape. But unbeknownst to the Lord and his tutor, trouble is heading their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hanjuku Hero&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
