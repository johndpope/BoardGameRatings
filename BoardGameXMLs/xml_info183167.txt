			<description>A scenario for WFRP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henri Murzeau is a Bretonnian exile living in the Empire. He has worked as an Imperial excise man for fifteen years, but a visiting dignitary objected to a foreigner working for the Emperor and he was fired. Henri had dedicated his life to the job and all he was left with was some savings. He had no family of friends. Henri decided to end his life, but he lacked the courage to do so. Instead he hired a local criminal group to do the job for him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
