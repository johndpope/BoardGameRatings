							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robot Maze Race</name>
									
			<description>Equipment: Each player needs a pencil and a sheet of paper marked as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two 10x10 grids of squares, each grid should have rows labeled with A at the top through J at the bottom. Columns should be labeled with 1 at the left to 10 at the right. These grids will be referred to as your secret grid (the maze your opponent is trying to navigate) and your open grid (where you are trying to navigate the maze made by your opponent). You should not show your paper to your opponent at any time in the game.&lt;br/&gt;     Space to write down your robot's program each turn.&lt;br/&gt;     Space to mark your robot's health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot Maze Race is a maze-solving game. Each player tries to program their robot to maneuver through a disorganized warehouse without bumping into too may crates or walls on the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An entry into the About.com: 2005 Deduction Game Design Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
