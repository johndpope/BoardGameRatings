			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take charge of America&amp;rsquo;s World War II struggle to run its railroads so as to win the war most quickly and efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players vie to build a rail system that can move the most men, weapons and supplies needed for the Allies to win in the European and Pacific Theaters of Operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives for each turn are generated by Operation cards (such as the buildups for D-Day and the Manhattan Project). The design is based on actual World War II US Army railroad doctrinal publications, and the map is divided into the historic transportation zones, showing critical cities and track lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by two-to-six, and cooperation becomes necessary because, if certain operational requirements are not fulfilled, the Axis wins World War II and the players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
