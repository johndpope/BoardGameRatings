							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Powers: Enhanced Senses</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a Sensation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special abilities come in many flavors. But if you don't notice the enemy sneaking up on you, you can't attack or protect yourself. If you don't notice tiny clues, you can't solve mysteries. Improved senses can solve your problems -- or save your life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Powers: Enhanced Senses is your guide to sensory powers. Use it in a wide range of campaigns, from biologically realistic science fiction to four-color supers. Five power frameworks let you play a brilliant detective or enlightened sage; an animal or cyborg; or a full-fledged superhuman. Choose from over 70 abilities, many with two or more variants, to design exactly the super-senses your adventurer needs. Infrasonic hearing, inner awareness, super-balance, and more could be yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you'll find more than powers in these pages. Enhanced Senses brings together game mechanics from many previous supplements, clarifies them, and extends them. You'll learn how to apply existing modifiers more broadly, and you'll discover newly defined modifiers and new variants of familiar advantages. You'll also gain more details on existing Sense rolls. Want to know how much light a candle or a crescent moon gives you, how hard it is to read an eye chart, how much hearing damage is caused by a rock concert, or how fast you can read Braille? The rules are here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on recent human and animal research -- from bat sonar to mole noses -- Enhanced Senses shows you how to describe realistic sensory powers, or set realism aside for the amazing abilities of comic-book heroes. Taking your GURPS game to new levels of insight has never made more sense!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
