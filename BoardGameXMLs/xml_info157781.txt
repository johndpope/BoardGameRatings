							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Caves of Ortok (Swords &amp; Wizardry)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4-6 Adventurers of Level 3-5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, the great wizard Ortok broke apart his treasure vault and secreted his collection in multiple hidden caches throughout the world. Some of these caches have already been found, but many more remain undiscovered. Rumors suggest that one such cache may be found in some caves nearby. However, that is not all that the caves hold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caves of Ortok is one of a range of prepackaged modules that are designed to be dropped into play during existing campaigns or adventures, or even to just be used on their own, by discerning Gamesmasters everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version is the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry edition  of the product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains a challenging scenario that will take between 4-8 hours to complete. Maps, supporting digrams, and handouts for players are included in the PDF. Also included is an archive file containing both GM and player maps for the product in 300dpi PNG formats for you to use in your VTT of choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
