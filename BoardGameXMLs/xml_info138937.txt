			<description>Ten years ago, Utrecht, God of Justice, disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knows if he&amp;rsquo;s dead, lost, or in hiding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utrecht&amp;rsquo;s followers, his Knights, first lost their magic and then the respect of the people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some Knights left the order and joined the worship of other gods. Others joined the army and fought for reasons other than their faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some stayed loyal. They fought and died for Justice. All that remains of them now are their names carved in stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some remain, like scattered embers of a fire that once lit the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
