			<description>(Translated from the Japanese rulebook):&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this game is to collect the most money for your marriage. But it's not just any money. It's the treasure of the dragon that you (think you) defeated.&lt;br/&gt;As the players enter the dragon's lair and start collecting treasure, the dragon will eventually awaken. The players must then run away from the maddened dragon, while holding onto as much treasure as they can. But if they have a lot of treasure, they'll be slowed down. If the dragon gets them, not only will they get hurt, but they'll also drop the treasures, one after the other! So stack you items carefully, equip and re-equip, trip the other player's legs as much as you can and run for your life.&lt;br/&gt;The player who gets out with the most treasure is declared the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
