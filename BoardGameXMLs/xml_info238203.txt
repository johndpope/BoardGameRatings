							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Shadow Emissary</name>
									
			<description>The Shadow Emissary was once the Shadow Effigy, a puppet created by the Swamp Hag Zoraida to infiltrate the Ten Thunders. The puppet performed his duties perfectly, during his time working infiltrating the Ten Thunders he started to feel his bonds to the Swamp Hag weaken as his loyalty and allegiance to his new brothers grew. After the Cataclysm he emerged as the Shadow emissary, in a form drawn from the hearts and sprits of the Three Kingdoms; a Dragon, stern and regal, speaking with a voice of wind and thunder. Let his mother see him now, and tremble!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten Thunders Box Set, containing a 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic, Stat Cards and Upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Shadow Emissary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stat Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Shadow Emissary&lt;br/&gt;    8 Shadow Emissary upgrade cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
