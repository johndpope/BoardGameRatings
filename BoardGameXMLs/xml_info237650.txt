			<description>Welcome to Dungeon Spawn, a storytelling game in which you will develop the history of a society of dungeon residents - goblins, giant rats, or maybe even oozes - through generations of invasions by &amp;ldquo;heroic&amp;rdquo; adventurers, discoveries within the massive cave complex they inhabit, and (of course) internal strife. Will your tribe of kobolds rise to fulfill their draconic aspirations? Will your albino dwarves craft something marvelous within their home? You&amp;rsquo;ll find out as the story unfolds over a couple of hours. You&amp;rsquo;ll need some paper, pencils, index cards, and some twelve-sided dice - not to mention two or three friends to share the story with you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative game, at least most of the time: during each phase, you&amp;rsquo;ll represent different factions within your chosen society, but you&amp;rsquo;ll change roles through the game. At times you&amp;rsquo;ll represent the best interests of your society, but at other times you&amp;rsquo;ll be asked to challenge them and inflict pain upon them. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a Gamemaster, unlike many role-playing games. Instead, the game itself will provides opportunities for challenges, and your group will work together to flesh them out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
