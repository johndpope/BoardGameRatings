It was released first in Europe on February 28, 2004 before arriving in North America nearly a full year later on February 1, 2005. The story is based loosely both on the original short story by Ray Bradbury of the same name and follows more closely the plot of the 2005 movie. The game was also originally also planned for home sixth generation game consoles, including Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo GameCube and the Sony PlayStation 2, but these were canceled as of December 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot and game play:&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the exploits of Travis Ryer, who is a Time Safari guide and biologist. After a tourist kills a butterfly in the prehistoric era, the future feels the consequences when they return. Ryer must then go back in time to prevent this from happening. The main special feature provided to Ryer is the Time Freeze Disruptor, which can slow down his surroundings while he continues to move at regular speed (similar to bullet time).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;A Sound of Thunder (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
