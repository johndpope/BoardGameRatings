			<description>Fantasy board/card game in which the players are wizards fighting for control of an arena whose concentric circles yield progressively greater magic power. (There is also a very strong source of power that moves randomly around the board.) Wizards can make direct physical attacks on one another, cast offensive or movement spells (using two shared Fate decks -- cheaper and weaker Primary Fate cards and stronger and more expensive Secondary Fate cards), or summon elementals to fight on their behalf. The last player with a wizard or elemental left in the arena wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approximate playing time is a guess and will probably depend on the number of players and their temperament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer created this game when he was a sophomore at Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa, OK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
