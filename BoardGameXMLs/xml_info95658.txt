							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sickness in Springdale</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt; In this adventure, the PCs attempt to save the town from a deadly illness by finding a source of Lady&amp;rsquo;s Staff, a plant that cures the affliction. To do so, they need to travel through the Lady&amp;rsquo;s Woods where they will meet a series of challenges to gain her favor. During the course of their travels, they find that their town is not the only one with the disease, the local goblins and elves are sick as well. If they gain her favor, she provides a ritual that multiplies the plant, providing enough to heal the town as well as the elves and goblins. If they fail, they will find their trip difficult and arduous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sickness in Springdale is the 3rd offering in the 6-Pack Adventure series from Postmortem Studios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
