			<description>Players spin a spinning peg on the baseball diamond shaped game board.  The board has locations markered for hits and outs.  If the peg lands on an out, then the batter is out.  There are 4 Stands that represent hits.  Hit 1 for a single, 2 for a double, 3 for a triple and hit all four for a home run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there was also this non-electric entry, from 1945 -- Whiz Baseball.  The artwork and yellow box are rather reminiscent of that for Senior Model 66-B. The red bits seen on the gameboard at right are not lightbulbs, but wooden pegs. A small top placed on the inclined lower sixth of the board was spun with the fingers, and the pegs it knocked over and the holes in which it landed determined the result of each play -- similar to Milton Bradley's much smaller 1957 version of Swat Baseball.
