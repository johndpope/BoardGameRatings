			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Zaxxon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alone and in alien territory, where survival is the main objective, success is but a dream. As pilot of the latest class X3 star fighter, your mission is to destroy the enemy base and to succeed where so many have failed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against seemingly impossible odds, you must avoid enemy ground to air missiles, destroying their vital fuel supplies to replenish your own. More than a game, more of a happening, you will journey into a graphically stunning, three dimensional world, where reality is victory...or defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you survive the lightening attacks from enemy aircraft and ground based tanks, your problems are far from over. A baffling maze of defensive walls and force fields surround the enemy base. Once through these, you have met the ultimate challenge - THE FORTRESS. With iron nerve, agility, skill and a little luck, you will survive. Without...you will not. Remember...the Fortress awaits you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Author: Mat Newman&lt;br/&gt;Loading Screen Design: Michael Hutchison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
