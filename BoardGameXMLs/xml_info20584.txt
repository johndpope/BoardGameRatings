			<description>This is a tailor made game for the Dutch police. &lt;br/&gt;This game requires some pens and paper, which are not included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your pawn starts at start.. Throw the 12 sided die and move that many spaces.&lt;br/&gt;You draw a card with 15  random words on it. You pick 1, 2 or 3 words off of the card according to the number of eyes on your field. Don't show the card to the other players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another player draws a card with sentences on it and he/ she picks a sentence for you. You have to start your 1 minute story with that sentence and try to get all your words in the story. If you fail to get all your words in the story, you get zero points, if you succeed you get 50 points per word. (So the max is 150 points per story)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players can now guess which words the storyteller has used, for every correctly guessed word the player gets 25 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every 150 points you get an eye token and after that you start counting again, so if you have 175 points you get 1 eye token and have 25 points left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special fields called Raa..Raa..! fields. If you have an eye and you end on a Raa..Raa..! field you are allowed to lay your eye on that field. If there is already an eye of somebody else there, you are allowed to remove that eye and give it back to the owner.&lt;br/&gt;If you receive your 4th, 5th or 6th eye, you can use those to block an other player. Just lay your eye in front of his pawn and the other player, that player must now skip a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge:&lt;br/&gt;If you end on a Raa..Raa..! field you can choose between either skip a turn or accept the challenge. The challenge is pick 4 words and use those in an 1 minute story. If nobody guesses the words, the storyteller gets 250 points. If one player guesses all 4 words he receives 100 points and the storyteller loses 150 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
