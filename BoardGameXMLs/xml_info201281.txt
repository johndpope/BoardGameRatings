							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apocalypse: The Game of Nuclear Devastation</name>
									
			<description>This was the Games Workshop licenced version of The Warlord that only had half the original mapboard (Western Europe), was only for 4 players, and had some amended game-rules. It went on to earn a dedicated following of its own but GW never developed or re-issued the product after the initial release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game start was different, decided by random allocation of city starting locations. Radiation markers could be cleared away as an entire turn action of non-fighting and non-moving armies. H-Bombs were removed from the game completely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually the GW licence would expire, and ownership and rights would revert to Mike Hayes, who then went on to re-publish his 2012 Classic Warlord version with the full map and H-Bombs restored and rules re-organised for the more classic gameplay from the earlier Red Box and Blue Box versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
