			<description>&amp;quot;Fame &amp;amp; Fortune: Win Fame while you gather a Fortune!&amp;quot; In this Whitman game, players use a spinner to move along a convoluted track that includes gender-specific career tracks [for girls, nurse, actress, stewardess, secretary, housewife and teacher; for boys: star athlete, jet pilot, cowboy, fireman, explorer, and scientist) and a &amp;quot;luck track&amp;quot; to collect &amp;quot;lucky gold coins.&amp;quot; Whomever reaches the end of the track [&amp;quot;the pot of gold&amp;quot;] with the most gold wins [yet another life-lesson for kids].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the game is undated, based on the logo style, it would appear the game dates to the early 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
