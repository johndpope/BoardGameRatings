							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dixit: The Dictionary Game</name>
									
			<description>From  instructions: Dixit - The Dictionary Game is a unique, fast pacing, thought provoking word game for 2-4 players involving crossword style word making with an original scoring system that enables the players themselves to decide where and how a word score may be multiplied. No player  possesses letters, the choice depends on the throw of dice every time. &lt;br/&gt;There's a Collins Minigem Dictionary to act as a referee and add ingenious twists to play.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player scoring the most points at the end of play by clever word making and shrewd usage of the changing possibilities offered by the playing circuit. Strategy and good word searching together make a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
