			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been given the great honor of fulfilling His Majesty&amp;rsquo;s decree to make a weekly action television series about the evil machinations of the vile foreign powers and cowardly traitors. The latter will be personified as fantastic super villains to be defeated by His Majesty himself (played by a body double) for the glory of the One True State. Week after week, the people of The One True State will see the futility of corruption and the glory of His Majesty!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, all of The One True State's scriptwriters and similar intellectuals are currently being reeducated, so you will have to improvise. Surely seasoned actors like yourselves are more than up to the task!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
