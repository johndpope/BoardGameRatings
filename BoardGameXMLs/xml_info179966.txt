			<description>All The cheese of 80's B-movies converges into one alien zombie infested town. And you must survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SO what makes this so 'Deluxe'?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well its because it also includes the first expansion IT'S A TRAP!!! before its released separately. 40 more cards plus the New Trapping Dynamic AND ALIENS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time for a survival game that doesn't take it self so seriously! You are a mercenary dropped into the overrun town of Wellsville. Your only ticket out is by retrieving survivors, searching for the antidote and murdering the undead (or your fellow players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel through the overrun town, gain access to buildings by drawing door cards, and collect Loot cards to find rewards. Use looted weapons to increase your attack rolls, defend against zombies, Alien Bio-weapons, Idiot Strippers and your fellow players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware the Event cards as they change the dynamics of the whole board, and either help or screw everyone. Amass 10 survivor points by any means necessary and get to the choppa to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay involves rolling dice for movement and battle, and card pulls for reward, door opening and mass events. So much variety you'll never get bored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Easy battle mechanics that allow you to collect zombies, or pick off other players,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Play as a zombie when you die and wipe out the other players to win alternately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
