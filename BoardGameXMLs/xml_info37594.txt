			<description>Name of the game is really that long, it means translated:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Following the paths of the engineers Hanzelka and Zykmund from Prague to Capetown with the 8-cylinder Tatra&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The engineers were employees of the Tatra Motor Works in Czecho then, and in times when car driving was still an adventure, especially in Africa, they made this journey to demonstrate the durability of their famous streamline car, the Tatra 87.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The journey lasted from 1947 to 1949, and was full of incidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even some books about it were published, and this game followed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is extremely scarce, and what makes it special is that the wooden game pawns are shaped like the abovementioned streamline car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest is pure nostalgia, roll-and-move and some card-drafting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box and gameboard are extremely large: Box measures 20 x 15 inches, the board is 4 times as large !!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
