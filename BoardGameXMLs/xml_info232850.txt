							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadball: 1909</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baseball at the turn of the 20th Century: Parks were enormous, pitchers went the distance all the time, and won as much as they lost.  Hitters hit singles and doubles, but the long ball?  Not so much.  But strategy comes more in to play, including the squeeze and the hit and run to get your runners home.  In this expansion, you can try out baseball the way it used to be, with awesome handlebar mustaches and teeny-tiny gloves.  This is an alternate set of rules for Deadball, designed to reflect the statistics and mechanics of an earlier age of the National Pastime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
