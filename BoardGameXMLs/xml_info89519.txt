							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dewy&#039;s Adventure</name>
									
			<description>Dewy lives in a mythical fairytale world protected by the Tree of Seven Colors. One day the evil Don Hedron attempts to cover their world in darkness. However, Don Hedron and his Dark Water are repelled by the Tree and the fairies of the land. After a long period of peace, Don Hedron returns one day. The Tree of Seven Colors soon becomes ill and is unable to protect the land as he once did. With hope fading, it puts all of his remaining strength into Dewy, the only one who will be able to free the world of the evils presented by Don Hedron, like he did 1000 years before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features seven worlds with puzzles and enemies. The Wii Remote will be utilized to control Dewy and his surroundings. The remote is held horizontally and tilted to move Dewy around the screen. The D-pad can be used to either heat or cool down the environment, causing changes in Dewy's state. Heating the environment will cause him to turn into a cloud of steam and allow him to strike enemies with bolts of lightning. Cooling the environment will cause Dewy to turn into ice and freeze his surroundings. The Wii remote can also be moved in a fanning motion to create gusts of wind or side to side in order to create earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dewy's Adventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
