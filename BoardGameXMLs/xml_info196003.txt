							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cornerstone: The Song of Tyrim</name>
									
			<description>Cornerstone is an open world action adventure, with an emphasis on exploration and combat mixed with physics and player choice. A game inspired by TLOZ games and Dark souls.  &lt;br/&gt;The world is structured like Wind-Waker with a series of islands connected by a vast ocean, almost all areas are accessible from the start. The main method of transportation between islands will be by Ship (there will be fast travel).&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re aiming for an art style that invokes a sense of wonder but at the same time has the ability to charm your socks off. Stylized geometry with simple textures but with realistic rendering, also inspired by the Viking culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
