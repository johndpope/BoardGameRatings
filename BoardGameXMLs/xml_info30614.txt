							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In Pursuit of Nothing the Seinfeld Board Game</name>
									
			<description>From the manufacturer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all have a friend like George, who is as cheap as the day is long. In this game, each of the players is having lunch with this &amp;quot;George,&amp;quot; with the goal of contributing NOTHING to his lunch tab. Playing is simple:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players, in turn, choose a question by value/difficulty. Answer the question right - transfer a portion of your contribution to another player (i.e., the value of the question). Answer the question wrong - another players transfers the value of the question to you. The first one to Nothing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
