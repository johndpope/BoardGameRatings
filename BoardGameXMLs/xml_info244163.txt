							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sherlock Holmes and the challenge of Irene Adler</name>
									
			<description>Irene Adler opens her own detective agency in London ... Sherlock Holmes remains phlegmatic on hearing the news, but should not he take this competition seriously? He will know it soon, because a murder and a kidnapping have just happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step into the shoes of Holmes or Adler and solve these investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play alone or challenge another player and try to be the best detective!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sherlock Holmes and the challenge of Irene Adler is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
