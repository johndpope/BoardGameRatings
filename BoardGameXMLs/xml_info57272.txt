							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Story Engine Universal Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any game. Any story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're holding the cutting edge of roleplaying rules. The Story Engine is designed top to bottom for &amp;quot;story games&amp;quot; without the vestiges of wargaming that shackle so many other &amp;quot;storytelling&amp;quot; games. We've included Story Bones, our free online introductory version of the rules to help you get started as quickly and easily as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Engine uses relative instead of linear scales, fitting everything from super-heroes and high fantasy to film noir and murder mysteries. The rules adapt seamlessly to any genre, giving you fluid, fun games that focus on the story and not the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action is resolved as whole scenes through a bidding process; players spend their resources to increase their chances, turning crucial moments into dramatic scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A fusion of dice and diceless Role-Playing, the Story Engine provides an excellent balance between both of those systems of gaming. Cinematic in origin, each part of the ongoing campaign is broken down into scenes and takes, all of which are designed to keep the story flowing smoothly. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Shadis Magazine, March 98&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Engine is the second generation of the ground-breaking Hubris Game Engine. It can be used with any game world, setting or story. Story Engine comes with the complete Maelstrom &amp;quot;plug-in&amp;quot; for use with the Maelstrom world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;- Complete game rules, including the introductory Story Bones rules&lt;br/&gt;- The Maelstrom Plug In for use with the Maelstrom Storytelling world&lt;br/&gt;- Two Scenarios: The Airship Murders and The Long Sleep&lt;br/&gt;- Fiction: Adventures of the Black Rose and Should / Die Before I Wake&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
