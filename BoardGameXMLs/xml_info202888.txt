			<description>This 1951 game by J.W. Drueke is played with a &amp;quot;Bug Box&amp;quot; about 4&amp;quot; x 5&amp;quot;, with a clear plastic lid, red sides and a green felt bottom. Inside the box is a single D6 with a different letter on each side: B, H, L, T, E, F. The name of the game appears on the felt along with an outline of a bug that has a round body, round head, two eyes, two feelers, six legs and one tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a sheet with 12 small boxes, each good for one game. Players take turns shaking the box, and the letter that appears determines what part of the bug they can draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They must roll a B in order to begin drawing the bug, and then an H in order to draw the head. After that, they may add whatever piece of the bug corresponds to the letter on the die. First player to complete a bug drawing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
