			<description>Treachery on the high seas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weigh anchor and set sail in this strategic pirate game that puts you at the helm as you race to bring home the most treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Golden Age of piracy was no time for a weak captain. Pirates needed fast ships, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannon fire. Tradeoffs between strength and speed, often times, weighed heavily in the outcome of battles. In the quest for riches, pirates would seek to plunder hidden treasures and the ill-gotten gains of other captains. Treachery, betrayal, and danger beset even the most cunning captain. Do you have what it takes to command your ship and pillage enough doubloons to claim victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scourge of the Seven Seas is a competitive or cooperative game for one to six players, each commanding a pirate ship on the high seas. Captains travel in search of hidden treasure and ship upgrades while fending off attacks and bribery attempts. The first captain to claim twenty points of treasure wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Scourge of the Seven Seas is to be the first player to deliver twenty points or more of treasure to their home port. You score points by taking turns moving your pawn between home port and an island full of buried treasures. At the start of the game you are dealt five cards which you use to determine the initial speed and strength of your ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you may search for treasure, deliver treasure to your home port, draw cards at a trade port, attack other ships, or attempt to bribe dock workers. As the game progresses, players may visit trading ports to draw additional cards to increase their ship stats. You can attack other player&amp;rsquo;s ships to plunder their riches or discard cards to bribe disloyal dock workers and steal the treasures at their home port. Attacking can be risky as you might become the victim; whereas sneaking into a home port and bribing would best be done with a fast ship for your escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many different strategies to win competitively. The goal in team or single player mode is for at least one player to gain twenty or more points of treasure before Davy Jones releases the Kraken. Each player chooses a ship from a fleet of six different ships (Galleon, Frigate, Man O&amp;rsquo; War, Schooner, Corvette, or Sloop) with varying abilities. In cooperative mode, you and your team must do battle with Davy Jones as he tries to block you from delivering treasures.  All the while, a doom clock counts down to Davy Jones becoming strong enough to release the Kraken on your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
