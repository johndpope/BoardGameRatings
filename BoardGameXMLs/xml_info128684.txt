			<description>Collection of 6 boardgames based on the use of magnetic marbles (clickets) as game pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains six games. Each of the games is a combination of the nature of the magnetic marbles (e.g. magnetism) and strategic or random placement of the marbles on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to place or remove those magnetic marbles without moving or disturbing the marbles still occupying holes on the gamebord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLACTO HARLEQUIN is a game of dice, not unlike the traditional game, but combined with the magnetic force of the 'clickets' the game gets a somewhat wider perspective. Apart from the placement of the clickets of the board as the throw of the dice indicates, the players have tot take the magnetism in account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same principle goes for CLACTO DICE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLACTO FISH is about removing clickets from the gameboard without disturbing the other clickets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLACTO 4 AND 4, CLACTO TACTIC and CLACTO SNAKES all have the placement of clickets on the board as subject, without moving or disturbing the clickets allready placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
