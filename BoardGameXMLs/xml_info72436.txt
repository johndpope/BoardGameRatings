			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against All Odds! You've just been chosen for what's probably the toughest assignment you'll ever have tackled. Your mission is to neutralise the menace of the evil Yelov and your orders are brutally simple: either you capture him or you void him!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yelov has back-up from a fearsome team of cosmic warriors, but against such unyielding might your own support crew is almost hopelessly outnumbered. As you skip through time and space in your cosmic racer, arcing perilously close to the dying sun of Yelov's home planet Sirius, you'll have only split seconds in which to make the key decisions on which so many innocent lives depend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
