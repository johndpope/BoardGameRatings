							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninja Burger: No Honor Edition</name>
									
			<description>This No Honor Edition of the Ninja Burger RPG is a PDF version of the Gencon 2008 premier. It uses the same rules as the 2nd Edition Ninja Burger RPG, but strips away some of the surface matter to get the game back to its original Beer &amp;amp; Pretzels Roots (or is that Sake and Pocky?) The big difference? No Honor, of course! Who needs to worry about honor and &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; when you expect to die on your first delivery? If you survive, you get Survival Points. But you probably won't survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its big brother, this edition features the rules-light PDQ (Prose Descriptive Qualities) system, the same system used by Truth &amp;amp; Justice, Zorcerer of Zo, Dead Inside and other such games produced by Atomic Sock Monkey Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will purchase this book or you will DIE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
