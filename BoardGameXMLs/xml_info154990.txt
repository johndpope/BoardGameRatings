			<description>The players start at the train station and try to get their car to the hotel (or reverse) as soon as possible. The first to arrive at his destination, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The moves of the cars are determined by a die. When a player rolls a 6, he has to move the turntable under the game board one notch further with his steering wheel. This changes the traffic signs and the traffic lights. If a car arrives on an occupied space, an accident occurs and the arriving car has to head for the repair shop. Each player starts with 6 gas markers. For every 1 he rolls, he has to spend 1 marker. The markers can be regained at the gas station. If all markers are spend, the player has to withdraw from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
