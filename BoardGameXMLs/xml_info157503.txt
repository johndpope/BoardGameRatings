			<description>This is a simple trivia game played on a map of Berlin. Movement is decided by a die. There are five categories of questions about Berlin, which the players have to answer, if they get on a space marked with a:&lt;br/&gt; A = General knowledge&lt;br/&gt; K = Culture&lt;br/&gt; W = Economic&lt;br/&gt; P = Politics and History&lt;br/&gt; S = Super questions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the answer is correct, the player may advance as many spaces, as indicated on the card. If the answer is wrong, the player has to move 3 spaces backwards.&lt;br/&gt;On a space marked with an &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; the player has to draw an event card and follow its instructions. The first player to reach the end (Ziel) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published 1989, so the game board still features the Berlin Wall between West-Berlin and Ost-Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
