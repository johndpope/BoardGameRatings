			<description>Each player forms a word from letter cards. These he/she places face-down in front of him/her. A die rolls determines the number of letters a player can flip open at the neighbor to the left. When a player thinks he/she knows all words, the game is interrupted and everyone has 30 seconds (stopped by sand-timer) to write down all the words. Points are scored for each recognized word and if other players don't recognize one's own word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
