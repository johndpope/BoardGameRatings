			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Blaster is a generic SciFi RPG in the 26th century where mankind&amp;rsquo;s unity has been sundered by war and where a few good men can still make a difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More like Firefly and Buck Rogers (the 1930&amp;prime;s version) than Star Trek you will form a team of adventurers who have a small starship which they can use to explore, travel, trade and fight against the dying of the light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual both the core rules and the setting are single page affairs and are completely compatible with other titles in the Dead Simple RPG series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;These are set of generic SF rules for a group of characters who have won, been left or otherwise acquired a small starship which they use as a base to trade, smuggle, travel and hire themselves out for various missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
