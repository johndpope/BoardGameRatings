							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Price of Love</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A three-step adventure set in Montaigne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIGH PRICE is planned as a two-part story, but can be fit into a single night. Blended with the personal storylines of your players or with Steps in your Campaign Story, it can run over three nights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In glittering Charouse, courtly lovers carrying rich presents to their beloved are being waylaid, robbed, and badly injured.  The robbers have an uncanny foreknowledge of their victims' gifts and routes, and a disturbing talent for escaping the law.  As robberies with violence escalate to murder, it becomes clear that the city needs Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIGH PRICE includes two downloadable PDFs: a 10-page adventure and a 6-page document for player characters, including 5 pre-generated characters for a quick start to your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
