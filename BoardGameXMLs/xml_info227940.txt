							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fun and Fishes Aquarium Game</name>
									
			<description>At the start of the game each player selects a set of six tokens, e.g. fish or crab tokens, and one colored peg.&lt;br/&gt;Players spin the pointer in turn and a six is required before a player can move.&lt;br/&gt;Having scored a six, the player pegs his token in to the lowest hole of any of the four tracks and moves it up the track according to the numbers scored in turn. Each time a player scores a six he gets an extra turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the end of the track is approached the exact number must be scored to put the token into the corresponding aquarium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all his tokens in the aquarium wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
