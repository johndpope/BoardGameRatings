			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Glimpse the Beyond is very much like the real world on the surface. Countries, politics, major religions and popular culture are virtually indistinguishable from the world outside your window. Beneath the normal facade of daily life, lurking in the shadows and hiding under the cover of night, dark forces reach into the world trying desperately to get a foothold. Most humans never encounter these dark forces. Of those few that do, the majority are driven mad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glimpse the Beyond is a Role-Playing Game in which players assume the roles of Magi, rare individuals who study the arcane arts in an attempt to understand and possibly control that which Should Not Be. One player, caled the Guide, crafts a story set in this world, using the rules in the Glimpse the Beyond corebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Glimpse the Beyond Guidebook focuses on storytelling techniqoes, helping the Guide craft stories of magick, wonder and cosmic horror. This book includes numerous ideas for campaigns, rich setting material and a list of tips for those who wish to run a Glimpse the Beyond game. Also included are twelve pregenerated Non-Player characters to help the Guide flesh out their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
