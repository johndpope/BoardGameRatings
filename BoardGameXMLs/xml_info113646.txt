			<description>1950's game named after a very popular radio and television show at that time. The programme consisted of questions (by post and by an audience watching the recording) and a panel of four academics would answer them. Not a quiz show, it was just deemed by the BBC that it would educate the country (which, in the BBC's mind, needed educating).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is an electronic trivia type where players are asked questions and then plug the sensor into a hole in the question sheet. If they are wrong, nothing happens, but if they are right a bulb lights up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
