							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dungeon of ClockWerk</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ClockWerk was meant to be the wizard Kontiuum&amp;rsquo;s greatest achievement, a sustainably powered clockwork automaton given life through his genius. He constructed a self-defending and dynamic maze filled with devilish traps within which he could work undisturbed and when Clockwork was brought to life he was initially incredibly pleased. When ClockWerk asked for smaller versions of itself he readily agreed and only regretted the decision when ClockWerk allied with his little brothers and drove the wizard out after smashing his prized possessions and laboratories to pieces. ClockWerk, just like his old master, desired to be left alone to tinker and build things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
