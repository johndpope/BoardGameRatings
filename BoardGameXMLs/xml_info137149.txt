			<description>DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;You're excited about your first day at your new job - a Zookeeper at your local Zoo.  You just didn't know what was in store for you.  You arrived -- just as the animals have escaped!  You must work together with the other zoo staff to recapture all of the animals.  But be quick!  Some of the animals are scary or dangerous.  If all of the patrons leave before the animals are recaptured, the zoo will close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE:&lt;br/&gt;Recapture the animals before all of the patrons leave the zoo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Players collect activity cards, or team up to attempt recapture animals by using colored custom dice.
