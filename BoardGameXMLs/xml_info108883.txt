			<description>Legend of the Cipher: The Game of Hip Hop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend of the Cipher (LOC) is a race to the top in professional hip hop. In order to succeed, you&amp;rsquo;ll make Moves, collaborate with Allies, put on Shows, employ Crew, experiment with Venture strategies, and buy Shine. As your Hype and Cash grow, your Career will evolve with your Opportunities, and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn to count your Bars as you kick your rhymes in a cycle of Ciphers and Battles that lead to the acquisition of skills, wisdom, and respect. Strategic deckbuilding and card play gives rise to multiple lyrical Battles and Ciphers in a revolutionary game that concisely emulates the reality of hip hop today... ALL of hip hop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend of the Cipher is a deckbuilding game, where players start with a basic deck that produces Bars and Cash, which they will use to acquire Opportunity cards each turn to add to their deck. Each turn, players must also perform at Shows, using their Bars to attempt to out-rap the other players. This involves actual rapping, although one can easily play the included variant without raps. Successful raps will be rewarded with Hype, which is used to level up your rapper, in turn increasing both your hand size and production of Bars. The objective of LOC is to be the first player to level up enough to become a Legend of the Cipher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
