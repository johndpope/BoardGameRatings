			<description>From the front page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A D&amp;amp;D Living Kingdoms of Kalamar Adventure&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for 1st- to 13th-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future of the Principality is now in the hands of the Prince and military. However, it appears as if your participation in the effort will be found elsewhere. This event is the third in the series Strike to the Heart. It is recommended that all PCs that play it have a degree of patriotism for Pekal. Non-patriots are welcome to play however be aware that rewards may be limited and danger escalated. It will be helpful if the players have played the first two events in the series A is for Assassin and B is for Brothers prior to playing this. It can be played out of order but it is not recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
