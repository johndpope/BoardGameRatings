							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: WW1 – Ace Cards Promo Pack</name>
									
			<description>With this promo pack, you can add historical Ace pilots to your Wings of Glory games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WW1 Wings of Glory rules now include &amp;quot;Ace skills&amp;quot; and how to use them. A pilot (or other crew member) may now be an Ace, and each Ace may have one or more special abilities. These abilities &amp;quot;break the rules&amp;quot;, and give to his plane additional bonus and special capabilities - for example, ignoring certain jamming results, getting an aim bonus, getting away with risky maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ace Cards included in the Promo Pack go even further, by presenting real WW1 pilots and giving to each of them a selection of Ace abilities based on actual historical documents of their fighting skills.  The pack includes 7 famous personalities: the &amp;quot;Red Baron&amp;quot; Manfred Von Richthofen, Max Immelmann, Willy Coppens, Silvio Scaroni, Lanoe George Hawker, Jean Navarre and Frank Luke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Ace is represented by a card with his photo, indicating the period in his career which is represented by the card's abilities, as well as historical data about him (including the number of recorded victories), and his skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skills are then presented in individual cards, each card including the description of the skill and how it modifies the Wings of Glory rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
