			<description>Two groups of fish battle for supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a set of sixteen fish (two each of eight different kinds) which square off on an 8x8 grid or chess board. Each turn a player rolls two dice and moves up to two fish the distance shown on a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fish are rated with Force values ranging from 0 to 7. A fish with a higher Force value can eat a fish with a lower Force value by landing on it. However, two weaker fish can be positioned to eliminate a stronger fish when their combined Force totals are equal to or greater than that of the larger fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three weakest fish have special abilities &amp;ndash; the Flying Fish can jump over other fish, the Minnow can use both die rolls in one turn, and the Puffer cannot be eaten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who eliminates all opposing edible fish or who occupies all four center spaces of the board at the end of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
