			<description>minizoomerz - miniature racing on a grand scale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game website : &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.minizoomerz.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.minizoomerz.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The minizoomerz Basic Game is a miniature motor racing game for 2-4 players aged 10years and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is freely available as a print and play .pdf file from The Big Play's online store - &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thebigplay.co.uk/store&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thebigplay.co.uk/store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 14 page .pdf file includes all the rules, tokens and counters you need to get started racing. A 'figure 8' circuit is included and introduces players to the Wild Canyons terrain. All you need to add are three six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to move at fast speed to allow them to make maneuvers or go flat out at Furious speed. This decision dictates the number of dice they roll and the options they have during their move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can pick up Fatigue during the race which can have an adverse effect on their performance at the later stages of the race. However, this can be managed and creates an ongoing 'risk assessment' aspect to the game in addition to choosing when to switch lanes and other situational decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an accessory pack available for the game which includes 4 plastic miniature racing cars, 3 dice and 4 Special Ability cards which add an extra dimension to the games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basic Game is also supported by expansion 'Toolkits', the first of which is the Wild Canyons which adds extra 'track sections' allowing players to design and create their own tracks and circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    minizoomerz: Wild Canyons Toolkit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
