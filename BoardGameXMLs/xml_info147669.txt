							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Svavelvinter Quick-start Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One year ago, in June 2012, the Swedish RPG Svavelvinter (Winter of Brimstone) was released by Fria Ligan. Based on Erik Granstr&amp;ouml;m's The Fifth Conflux series of novels, with its peculiar style of Renaissance/Babylonian fantasy, Svavelvinter RPG was a big hit &amp;ndash; the first print run sold out in three months and it was awarded Best RPG of 2012 by both the Fenix RPG magazine and the Boningen games blog. [...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what kind of game is Svavelvinter? Ruleswise the main sources of inspiration are story-driven games like Burning Wheel, FATE, Solar System, Lady Blackbird and Apocalypse World. The game lets you choose between two specific styles of play &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;character driven&amp;quot;, that supports a Story Now agenda, and &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot;, which is focused on more traditional adventuring. [...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tracorian world is similar to Renaissance Europe of the early 16th Century, but with notable differences. It is an animistic world where living clouds, mountains and winds coexist with dragons and other mythical beasts. Life clings to the surface of the continental shields of gigantic beings submerged in the magma below. These shields have been forged into a world sphere in order to protect the burning Furians within. The entire world shows many signs of having been put in place according to some divine plan, but the actual work has been delegated to befuddled servants. In this way reality is a flawed and poor implementation of a divine design. Magic works, but rarely quite as expected. Magicians are feared but also suspected of interfering with the divine plans even further and are often hounded by clerics. Most powerful of all are those who know &amp;quot;The High Speech&amp;quot;, the forbidden words of the gods' that command creation and reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
