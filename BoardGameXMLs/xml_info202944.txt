							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bajevar Critter Book</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To call Bajevar (pronounced BAH-hay-var) a Campaign Setting would be inaccurate. A true campaign setting shows a full world with maps and descriptions of regions. This ain&amp;rsquo;t that. Instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll call this an Adventure Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book you will find some of the monsters which may be encountered across Bajevar, in addition to the creatures in the Cypher System Rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the companion Bajevar Guidebook you will find some hints and clues as to what the world is like. You will discover the four races of the world along with some of their societies and habitats. You will discover guilds, gear, new artifacts, and even a few new skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will, if you put all the pieces together, discover the flavor of the world. What you will not discover is the world itself. You can build the world however you like. It is yours to create.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
