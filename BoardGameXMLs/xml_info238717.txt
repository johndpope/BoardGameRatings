							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Bataille d&#039;Austerlitz 1805</name>
									
			<description>La Bataille d&amp;rsquo;Austerlitz happened more than 200 years ago, but despite its place in the dim recesses of our collective memory, it still has bright place in the pantheon of notable military historical events. Austerlitz, more than perhaps any event, established the Napoleonic legend, and preserved a nascent French Empire for another decade.  It remains as important an event as any in the history of the French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is on six 22&amp;rdquo; by 32&amp;rdquo; maps. The game also features over a thousand full-color counters; a commemorative disc that has nearly a hundred pages of rules,  10 scenarios, articles and player aids; and various charts. An alternate allows you to play the entire battle by interconnected scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, La Bataille d&amp;rsquo;Austerlitz 1805 developed by utilizing much more recent research regarding orders of battle; the geography of the area reflecting as it actually was in 1805; and the growth of technology providing a superior graphic product of unit counters; maps and other playing components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
