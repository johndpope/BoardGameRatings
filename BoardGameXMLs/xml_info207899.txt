			<description>In the year of grace 1012 in the lands of the good King Louilepou, three brothers dream of belonging to the order of the knights of the monarchy, knights without fear and without reproach who are capable of traveling crazy distances, of killing the most dangerous of thieves, and of defending brave peasants. One of these three brothers is you, but the road to becoming a knight is extremely long!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Knights, you have to travel the vast royal lands &amp;mdash; crossing snowy mountains, haunted lakes, and dark forests &amp;mdash; in search of bracelets of bravery. You might find yourself face to face with a troll, an old wizard, or a warrior, and you must solve riddles to discover hidden compartments, to learn fighting techniques, and to collect magic items. Your success depends on your choices because you are the hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
