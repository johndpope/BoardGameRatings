			<description>Investing is designed to teach potential investors where is the best place to keep one's money under various economic conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's main equipment is a standard fifty-two card deck. Each rank has been assigned a different type of investment. For example: aces represent retail stocks and tens represent silver. Each player gets five Business Trend Cards which let the players know each investment's value during the five possible economic conditions: recession, stability, depression, stagflation, and inflation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, poker chips are distributed among the players equally. A die is rolled to determine the economic condition for this hand. Players proceed to play Draw Poker using the appropriate Business Trend Card to determine the value of one's own hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instruction booklet gives the rules for four other variants of poker but all other poker variants could be played using this deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
