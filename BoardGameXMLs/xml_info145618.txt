			<description>Gener&amp;aacute;lov&amp;eacute; (Commanders) is a dynamic war game in which the players test their skills on the battlefields of Napoleonic wars. Through skillful planning, careful preparations, commitment and a little luck, one player will emerge victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gener&amp;aacute;lov&amp;eacute; (Commanders) differs from other wargames by simultaneous order planing and resolution, by the austere elegance of Chess, and by the incredible variety of combat situations on mere nine battlefield spaces. Infantry, cavalry and artillery clash in a series of fights in which the victorious player usually is the one who positioned his troops more skilfuly and better used unit abilities in a combat. Even a slight twist in another section of the battlefield can influence the outcome. Situation is constantly changing and it is usually not until the last moment one can be sure of victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules offer a range of optional mechanics and is suitable both for beginners and for seasoned wargamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
