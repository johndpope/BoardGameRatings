							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Swordsman</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the European arts of fencing to the Asian discipline of kenjutsu, the use of swords in combat has been codified and romanticized for centuries in nearly every culture in the world. Even in the modern day, when guns have supplanted melee weapons almost everywhere, the sword is viewed as a symbol of what a weapon should be. The first object designed solely to kill other human beings, and a signifier of honor across cultural lines, the sword represents deadly intent better than perhaps any other weapon in history. The Swordmaster has dedicated himself to reviving the lost art of the blade. At close range a Swordmaster is more than a match for any combatant, a veritable killing machine. One on one, the Swordmaster&amp;rsquo;s power is even more undeniable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
