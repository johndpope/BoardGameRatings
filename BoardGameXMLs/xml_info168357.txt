							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tome of Horrors 4 (Sword &amp; Wizardry)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This massive tome of never before seen monsters will be done in our characteristic textbook bound hardcover style, but this time in full color! Featuring over 300 new monsters from our design team led by Scott Greene and illustrated by Chris McFann, it provides new fiends to terrorize your players with for years to come. Both Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry and Pathfinder versions available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One can simply never have enough monsters. The greatest trick a GM can play is to show up with something new that the players have never heard of before. Anyone who has been doing this for very long knows the drill, &amp;ldquo;Goblins, ok, fighters to the front so they get multiple attacks&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;a troll! Get fire and acid ready!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine what happened to the first group of players that encountered a nilbog&amp;mdash;and watched it grow in size as the fighters each hit it 5 times. What about a pyrohydra&amp;mdash;fire had no way to stop it from growing new heads&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Oh my, what do we do now?&amp;rdquo; may have been the next battlecry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not always necessary to make every monster a death-dealing enigma; however fear of the unknown is one of the strongest tools in the GM&amp;rsquo;s arsenal. It keeps players on their toes and makes the game more fun. Certainly the old mundane standbys need a place at the table (and the miniature case); after all, what is a dungeon without a troll or ten?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
