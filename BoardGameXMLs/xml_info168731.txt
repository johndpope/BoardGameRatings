			<description>Prepare yourself for an extraordinary journey like never before as you encounter the World of The Sacred Rings. This first-person point-and-click adventure is the sequel to Aura: Fate of the Ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as Umang as you awake and find yourself alone in a strange, dark and unwelcoming world. Clenched in your fist lies a series of rings &amp;ndash; the Sacred Rings that grant the holder unlimited power and immortality. Quickly you realize that a rival clan has tracked you down and that they want the Sacred Rings&amp;rsquo; power for their own evil purposes. You must protect the Sacred Rings and return them to the Keepers ... the only ones who will be able to watch over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
