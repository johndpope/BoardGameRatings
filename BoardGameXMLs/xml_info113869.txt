							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coup d&#039;Etat</name>
									
			<description>Early wargame on the conduct of a coup d'etat in an unnamed city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From ad copy: &amp;quot;Brian Shieldhouse has made a special study of insurrection in Latin America, the Middle East and Europe. over a number of years and Coup d'Etat is the result of extensive researches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The takeover of a city involves much more than its capture, block by block, and Coup d'Etat faithfully reproduces lhe fascinating interplay of tactical considerations which arise.  Is the loyalty of the Police suspect? Will the locally based army units defect? Can control of the broadcasting station be neutralised bv seizure of the newspaper offices? Is the underground railway in reliable hands? Can the deadly power of the air force be rendered ineffective by jamming its operational wavelength? Should all electric power be cut off, and if so for how long? etc. etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fascination of Coup d'Etat is the way in which these and many other questions are resolved; each solution itself has an immediate effect on the course of the battle and produces the next tactico- militarv problem.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
