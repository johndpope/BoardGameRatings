			<description>This is a word game, where you try to name things that start with different letters. On your turn you roll a die and one other player takes a card and reads a category from the corresponding line. Now you try to name as many things from that category as you can. You have on note block with alfabet and you can cross out all the starting letters that you could use. When you run out of time, it's next players turn. On your next turn you get new category and try to get the remaining letters. First player who can cross out all the letters is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
