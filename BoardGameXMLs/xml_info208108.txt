			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ferali is a disk-flicking game system that comes with nine different game variants that can be played on a octagonal game board with different disk types that come with the game. &lt;br/&gt;The variants are described in more detail below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Rainbow: pocket seven disks in the colors of the rainbow in the correct order (violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red). The first player to pocket on set of all seven colours wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Race to 16: this game uses red and black numbered disks. The first player to pocket exactly 16 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Poker: each player gets a set of cards and has to pocket the disks with the same numbers as the cards. The player to do this first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Snooker: use to the Ferali game table to play a variant of Snooker using numbered disks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Zero is hero: similar to Race to 16. But now a score of zero has to be achieved by adding and subtracting the numbers on the disks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Word builder: this game uses disks with characters. Each player pockets disks, writes down the letters, then returns them to the board. Players compete for a predetermined period of time, then they make as many words as possible with their noted letters. Whoever has created the most words wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Cricket: using red and black disks, a cricket game is played on the Ferali board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
