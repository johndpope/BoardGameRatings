			<description>from What Is This:&lt;br/&gt;This is a game designed to let you explore perilous fantasy worlds of sword and sorcery, where adventurers embark on dangerous quests and do battle with formidable foes. The theme and core of this game is quite obviously based off of Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson's classic role-playing game and the various iterations of it that followed. Mechanically, the game takes many influences from the works of Vincent Baker, John Harper, Eric Provost, Kirin Robinson, Adam Koebel, Sage LaTorra, Jason Morningstar, Clinton R. Nixon, and Michael Wight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its core, the game's adventuring system is largely inspired by World of Dungeons and its predecessors. For combat, Old School Hack served as the primary model for phased rounds and combat zones. Experience is driven by a system derived from The Shadow of Yesterday. The relationships between the adventurers are culled from various Fiasco playsets. The style is of classic dungeon-delving, dragon-fighting, old-school adventure. I'll admit it is mostly constructed with borrowed materials, tweaked and slapped together into a fantasy frankenstein of sorts, but I thought there was enough here to warrant a name and layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
