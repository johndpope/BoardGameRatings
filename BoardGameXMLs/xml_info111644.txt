			<description>DKT, das kaufm&amp;auml;nnische Talent, is an Austrian equivalent for the well-known &amp;quot;Monopoly&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your object is not to be the last still in play, but to be the first to pay back your debts and thus win the game. Players start with 2000 units of money and choose 1 to 3 start actions, depending on the number of players, either buying a plot of land or taking out a loan. Player rolls the die - first he moves a tourist marker and implements the spot reached for him. Then he moves his own marker and implements the game reached - special spots or buying, building, paying rent or either paying back a loan or taking out an additional loan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this dynamic version there are a few major changes, which make for interesting decisions and the game quicker:&lt;br/&gt;You move two tourists with a third die.&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, you have to pay back your starting money.&lt;br/&gt;The Hotel is not just a fifth house, but is worth 100 for each house in the area/city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
