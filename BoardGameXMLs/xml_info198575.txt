			<description>Each player gets the same number of newsstands, one lottery ticket, a pawn and 18 game token (money). The newsstands may be placed on any space in the color of the players pawn. The remaining newsstands can be bought by the players. The players move the pawns around the board according to the results of their dice rolls. Whenever a pawn lands on a space with the newsstand of another player, the owner of the pawn has to pay 3 token to the other player. If a pawn lands on a space with a circled number, the player has to take an (often humorous) event card and follow the printed instructions. The lottery tickets have value for one lap around the board. At the beginning of each round the Player may renew his ticket for 2 token. Lottery winnings are distributed by event cards. After an agreed on number of laps the player with the most money wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
