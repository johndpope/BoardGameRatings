			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Room is an adventure-puzzle game that pays tribute to old school &amp;quot;point and click&amp;quot; games but renders its world in full 3D and allows the player to fluidly shift their perspective as they examine complex objects. During each chapter of the game, the player is presented with an intricate safe or cabinet and must methodically figure out how to unravel its mysteries. There are typically dozens of small ways to interact with the central object; the player must methodically work their way past all manner of locks and mechanisms to fully &amp;quot;crack&amp;quot; the safe. As they progress, they find notes left behind by the creator, whose research takes on an increasingly ominous cast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
