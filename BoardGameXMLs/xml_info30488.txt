			<description>Husaria is a set of miniatures rules designed to simulate land warfare in Eastern Europe during the period 1558-1699.  Given the subject matter, there are many rule elements designed to convey the unique context of war in the East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each figure represents 60-100 men.  The units are portrayed by stands of figures and represent what in the West during this period would have been brigade-sized groupings.  There is a clever interactive system for players to build armies from detailed army lists for all the varied armies of this period:  Polish Commonwealth, Cossacks, Tatars, Ottomans, Muscovites, Lithuanian, Swedes, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a very large list of leaders with micro bios as well as a listing of important battles from the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
