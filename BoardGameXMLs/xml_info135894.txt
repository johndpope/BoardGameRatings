			<description>Self-published statistical golf game. System designed to play very quickly, allowing for whole tournaments to be played in one evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics for nearly 1,000 golfers are provided and around 100 courses to choose from. The statistics have been generated from the 1940's to the early 1990's. All dice rolls are compared to various charts to get the result of a tournament eventually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is as per normal golf so the winner is the one with the lowest number of shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
