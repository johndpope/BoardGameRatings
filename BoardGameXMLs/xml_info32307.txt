			<description>Stafaspili&amp;eth; (The Game of Letters) is a lot like Scrabble but without a board. Players get 8 tiles with a letter on each and the goal is to get rid of all the tiles from the hand. Each tile has a value which is used when a word is formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each word that can be read from the new one is counted. For example if a player puts down 'house' he gets points for both 'house' and 'use'. The player who finishes first gets the points from the tiles in the hands of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
