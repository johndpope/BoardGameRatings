							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Order of Vampire Hunters: The Varacolaci Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This expansion includes a new species of Vampire and a previously unseen Elder that introduce a new game mechanism - Vampire ranged attacks - that can be easily integrated into any Hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box contains&lt;br/&gt;11 Highly Detailed Plastic Miniatures:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Varshi, a Varacolaci Elder&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 5 Varacolaci&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 5 Varacolaca&lt;br/&gt;3 Vampire ID Cards.&lt;br/&gt;15 Vampire Encounter Cards.&lt;br/&gt;4 Vampire Activation Cards.&lt;br/&gt;1 Rule Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Varacolaci are an evil strain of Vampire, recently seen aiding the other Creatures of the Night, although they have a long and secret history that is well known to the Order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally from rural Romania, the Varacolaci have always been well hidden. Ignorant peasants have created colorful&lt;br/&gt;myths about these monsters, myths the Order has done nothing to dispel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Varacolaci are not the animated corpses of suicides or unbaptized babies. Stories of their enormous tongues are just that, stories. No, the truth is far worse. Varacolaci are a further corruption of the Vampire, a Vampire infected with&lt;br/&gt;a large and muscular parasite. The parasite lives inside the chest of the Varacolaci and emerges through its mouth to feed, mistaken by the locals as a giant tongue. The parasite controls&lt;br/&gt;the host and, in return, feeds it symbiotically. However you name it, Hunters must approach the Varacolaci carefully, as they can attack from a distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rejected as abominations by the other Creatures of the Night, the Varacolaci were so well hidden in the past century that the Order wondered if they died out. No such luck. Varshi may be the first Varacolaci Elder, at least he is far more cunning than any Varacolaci before. It is Varshi that has led the Varacolaci from&lt;br/&gt;their hidden lairs to advance the Night&amp;rsquo;s cause. The Order has yet to determine Varshi&amp;rsquo;s agenda or why the Night is tolerating&lt;br/&gt;his presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
