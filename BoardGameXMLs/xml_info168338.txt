			<description>In this game, your challenge is to build or share a roadway built by others to navigate from one side of the board to the other. Drop a traffic cone to protect a route you like, or &amp;quot;Bypass&amp;quot; one you don't. Make sure to watch for other players' roadways to 'break' them up before they have a complete route. Be the first person to complete a route to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, play one of your roadway tiles somewhere on the game board. You don't have to play the tiles in any particular order, and your route doesn't need to be straight - but over the twists and turns it must eventually create a path joining your color on both sides of the game board. Remember that all players share the roadway system, so try not to help someone finish ahead of you. After playing a roadway tile, draw a replacement and then the next player on your left takes their turn. Only after a tile has been surrounded on all four sides, players may stack a different tile on top of it, changing the route dramatically!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
