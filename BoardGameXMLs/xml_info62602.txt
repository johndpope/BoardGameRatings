			<description>Puck Attax is a new multi-player collectible hockey card game.&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for kids and features NHL player card discs.&lt;br/&gt;The game allows players to manage their teams and face off against friends in head-to-head gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Puck Attax game card is in the shape of a hockey puck, featuring player image, player name, team logo, and position and player ratings. Each player disc has an offence and a defence rating. There are two rounds called shifts. The player mat has spots for 14 NHL player discs. The mat is broken in two by a centerline and each side of this line has 3 forward 2 defence a goalie and shootout spot where your discs are to be placed face down. Gamers take turns deciding whether they will be on offence or defence.  They then pick a face down disc and the game becomes a game of war where players simultaneously flip over a player discs and compare offence and defence ratings. The higher of the two ratings scores a goal. You go through 6 turns in 2 shifts keeping track of goals (a tie in ratings equals no goal) if after two rounds the score is still tied you go to the shoot-out player and the game is decided by a tie breaker...&lt;br/&gt; Every NHL team is represented and special foil game cards featuring hockey&amp;rsquo;s top stars will are included. A starter box includes random game cards and play-mat, and enough cards for one player to ice a team. Additional booster packs of 6 cards can be purchased to add different players to your bench&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
