			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The wind billows your cape. It's truly beautiful up here above the sky. You rarely get to notice anymore. The lush cloud tops spread out before you. The sun warms your face. You wish it could stay this way forever... or even for a few hours. But it cannot. Squaring your jaw, you turn downward, falling to earth. Under the clouds, the city waits. A fire burns in the north ward. The bank's familiar alarm chimes in the east. Far off on the water, something rises from the deep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your legacy calls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resolute: Legacy is the latest version of the Resolute game system. The little game of big adventure gives you all you need to create supers ranging from street-level brawlers to earth-shaking titans, and everything in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This revised, streamlined and intuitive superhero system features:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A single D12 (or optional 2D6) dice mechanic for all action resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Complete rules for building all types of superhero characters, including detailed listings of over 60 abilities, and rules for customizing your abilities to fit your character concept.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Rules for superhero-scale combat. If you want to pick up a car and throw it at a foe, project a force field, or crush your opponent in your bare hands, Resolute allows you to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A simple bonus system that scales all the way from characters who can barely lift 50 lbs. to those who can lift in excess of 500 tons.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; An evocative backdrop that provides seeds for ongoing campaigns, 12 adventure hooks, and rules for character advancement and refereeing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Rules for vehicles the supers can purchase and use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
