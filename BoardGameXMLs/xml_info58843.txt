			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Feats grant characters a variety of options to develop and excel in their chosen paths.  For psionic manifesters, the feat options are sometimes limited.  That is, until now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreamscarred Press is proud to release High Psionics: Psionic Feats, a compilation of more than 70 feats, most brand new and never before seen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are new general, psionic, mantra, and epic feats for use in your psionic campaigns.  With feats that grant additional psionic power, like Bodily Reservoir, to those that allow tactical maneuvers, such as Astral Skirmisher, and even feats that heal the character, like Psionic Metabolism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With feats that can be selected from first level into epic levels, this release has something for every psionic character.  Don't let your character suffer from lack of choices - pick up High Psionics: Psionic Feats today!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
