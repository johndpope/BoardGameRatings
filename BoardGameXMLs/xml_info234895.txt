			<description>A STORY DRIVEN SUPERNATURAL THRILLER&lt;br/&gt;Past Cure is a cinematic, story driven experience where the player follows the struggle of a broken man searching for the missing pieces of his mind. With intense cutscenes and intriguing story items throughout the levels, the players can unravel a story that will keep them guessing til the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreams vs. Reality&lt;br/&gt;Ians mind is torn between the gritty real world and the nightmarish horror of his dreams. Past Cure contrasts between the cold, brutal combat orientated levels of the real world, to the more puzzle solving and survival gameplay in the abstract dreamworlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action vs. Stealth&lt;br/&gt;Be bold and engage your enemies with time bending gun battles and brutal jaw crunching combos. Or pick the stealthy approach where evasion tactics and slick stealth takedowns allow you to outsmart your enemies in silence. Choose the right approach to each situation as there are pros and cons to each playing style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MIND BENDING ABILITIES&lt;br/&gt;Unleash the unlocked power of Ian&amp;rsquo;s mind against those who unlocked it. To truly master the Past Cure experience, players must utilise time manipulation and astral projection to gain an edge on opponents and overcome obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
