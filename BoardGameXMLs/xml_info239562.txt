							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Janus Influence</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interstellar Ambassador Brandt Vaslovik has an impeccable reputation and great powers of persuasion, both of which he uses to keep the mad whims of Exaltarch Vuud IV of Ardanis in check. But the ambassador's reputation is in jeopardy when he suddenly begins promoting the extremist ruler's views. It's discovered that the ambassador's sudden turn is due to his family being held hostage, and the PCs are called in to remedy the situation. But can they pull off a rescue and return the family before the ambassador is forced to forever cement ties between the insane sovereign and the interstellar government via a critical speech?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Janus Influence is a one-page, no-frills adventure for Cepheus Engine and other tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game) starring characters of varied career backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
