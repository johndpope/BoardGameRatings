			<description>Step by Step uses excellent components to create a climbing game requiring thoughtful placement and sound planning. The game board is a square frame holding nicely-made square pieces. To begin, the frame is populated with one level of pieces on all spaces, except for the center on which five pieces are stacked and stabilized with a rod through the middle. Each player gets a large ball that fits on the hole in the pieces, and the starting position is determined based on the number of players (2-4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the goal being to get your ball onto the center tower, you progress by moving your ball anywhere on the same level you start and then placing another piece on an adjacent space (adding a level to that space.) You can move down the structure for free as long as you don't skip a level, but once you move onto a higher level in your turn it is over. Using this mechanism, players try to craft a path to the top of the tower that can't be used by others or use their ball as a blocking point to keep someone off the level you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
