							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tricky Bid</name>
									
			<description>Tricky Bid is a trick-taking game in which half the cards in hand will be used for bidding and the other half for tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before each trick, each player takes turns placing a card face-up on the table, which represents his bid for that trick. The player who leads then plays a card, and each player follows suit if possible, with the highest card on suit (or the highest trump, if one was played) winning the trick. The cards in the trick are thrown away, however, and the winner of the trick keeps only his bid card and all other bid cards of the same color. Since bidding is done in turn order, all but the starting player can decide to join in on a bid (by playing a card of the same color as the lead player, thereby raising the stakes) or start a bid in a new color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score points based on the bid cards they collect, and the player with the most points after each person has dealt once wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
