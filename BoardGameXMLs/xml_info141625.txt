			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trickery plays like conventional trick-taking games like Bridge and Hearts, but changes the rules with each round of play, allowing for thousands of different combinations. Last hand, 9s were worth double, diamonds were trump, 5s were worth extra points, and the Queen of spades was on everyone's least wanted list. Now Aces reverse value, the fifth trick you take gives bonus points, 7s negate the entire trick, and the choice of trump goes to the highest bidder. Next hand &amp;ndash; who knows?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
