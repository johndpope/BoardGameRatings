							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">First Over Germany</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead the first B-17 bombing raids over Nazi Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In October 1942, when the U.S. first launched its daylight bombing raids against Hitler, it was the men of the 306th Bombardment Group in the lead. Now, First Over Germany allows you to join these courageous fliers on 25 real-life combat missions over the death-filled skies of Nazi Europe. As you strap yourself into the pilot's seat, you can't help but wonder: &amp;quot;How many missions can I survive?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand pick your ten crew members to fly your very own B-17 Flying Fortress. Start out flying training missions in Utah to raise your crew's efficiency and experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, fly your B-17 to Thurleigh, England where you become group leader of the 306th BG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This user-friendly flight simulator gives you the feel of flying a real B-17. You and your crew must deal with flak, mechanical/engine failures, fuel usage, bailing out, and falling out of formation. You engage enemy fighters in realistic animated combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are judged by your bombing accuracy. With each successful mission, your crew's efficiency rises--along with your rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survive all 25 missions, and we'll salute you as General!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
