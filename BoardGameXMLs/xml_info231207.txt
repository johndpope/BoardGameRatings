							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon&#039;s Interest</name>
									
			<description>The war just ended. You spent almost every coin for the war, so now you need more funds to rebuild your kingdom. You have no choice but to beg the dragon for help. &amp;quot;Money for a new harbor? Interesting. I am happy to help you with all my treasure, but...&amp;quot;, says the dragon, as she stares through tiny glasses on her nose, &amp;quot;...how much should you pay back?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't have to worry about the financial crisis for now &amp;mdash; but if you don't pay the debt on time, the flame from her mouth will bring an end to your kingdom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dragon's Interest, players are going to borrow money from the dragon to build their own kingdoms. To pay the interest, players have to manage their money and knights carefully. Players are also able to activate their buildings' special abilities and buy buildings from their opponents. If someone cannot pay the interest, the game ends immediately. The player who can pay the interest in the last round and has the most victory points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
