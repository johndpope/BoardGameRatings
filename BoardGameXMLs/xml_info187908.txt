			<description>In Authentic Professional Football Game, players use a stack of cards to simulate the plays in a football game. The offensive player chooses his play and then picks a card. Each card lists a result for all possible plays. The player checks his chosen play and applies the result by moving a football marker on a football field board. Downs, first downs and scoring work as they do in American football. Kicks (kickoffs and punts) are resolved by drawing one card for the kick distance and another for the return distance. When a play results in a penalty, interception or too-short field goal, another card is drawn to show the result. When all the cards in the stack are used up, a quarter ends. The deck is then shuffled and the next quarter begins. The second half (or third quarter) begins with a kickoff. As in a typical football game, the player with the most points after four quarters wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
