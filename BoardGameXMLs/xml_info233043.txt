			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guildbreakers: Battle for Agawan is a two-player tower defense card game. It plays like a miniatures game, but it needs only a minimum of table space and can fit perfectly in your pocket. You assume the role of a Guild Master, scrambling to stake your claim on the valuable ore deposits of Agawan Island. You must build up your base, recruit your troops, and smash down your opponent's base before he does the same to you. This fast-paced strategy game distills concepts from miniatures games, collectible card games, and real-time strategy games into a quick and portable card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle for Agawan's streamlined game system is a card game that has no shuffling and a tactical combat game that has no board, no rulers, and no dice rolling. Instead, players can freely select cards from their own customized army pool of twenty Base and Character cards. Base cards build up your rate of production while Character cards are used for engaging in combat. Special Character abilities and stats, combined with a deterministic support-based combat system, encourage mixed forces and dynamic counterplay. Battle for Agawan uses neither grid-based maps nor measurement-based movement, instead abstracting the field of battle into four simple rows. This minimalism allows for extremely quick setup and portability while preserving the core tactical elements of movement, range, and positioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
