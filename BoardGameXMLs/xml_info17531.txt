							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gold Town</name>
									
			<description>From the Designer/Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Gold Town is a very unique historical PDF tile-boardgame recreating the real-life experience of Old West miners during the early 1870s in the gold mining town of Whitewash City. A lot of care and research was undertaken to ensure the historical accuracy of Gold Town. It's not only fun to play, it's also educational! To play, just print it, cut out the components and play -- everything you need is included, except two six-sided dice, a pencil and paper.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
