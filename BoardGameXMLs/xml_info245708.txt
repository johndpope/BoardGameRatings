							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unknown Armies Book Four: Expose</name>
									
			<description>Digital-only book written by Greg Stolze for the UA3 kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's in this book?&lt;br/&gt;This book is what happens when we release the chains holding Greg back and tell him to &amp;ldquo;go nuts.&amp;rdquo; Book Four: Expose includes several new rules, new ideas, and new insights into the world of Unknown Armies that you can accept or reject as you desire. The content in this book is pure grade AAA Greg, packaged for your perusal with all the gristle and bone intact. Most chapters feature Greg&amp;rsquo;s reviews of Unknown Armies-adjacent film and literature and how those works show us the shared reality&lt;br/&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re experiencing through Unknown Armies. Many also include new creatures thematically appropriate to the chapter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of what you should expect:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adepts: Musing about practitioners of magick.&lt;br/&gt;Antagonists: Thoughts on throwing horrors in the path of your cabal.&lt;br/&gt;The Bigger Picture: Contemplating the larger objectives and scale of Unknown Armies.&lt;br/&gt;Character: Insights into internal narratives. &lt;br/&gt;Features and Identities: Plenty of identity-related rules to add to your collection.&lt;br/&gt;The Dead: Beyond the veil of the living, and what to do with what you find there.&lt;br/&gt;Normalcy Besieged: Taking on the mundane humdrum of what we think of everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;Statosphere Stuff: More avatars and the notion of claiming places in their name.&lt;br/&gt;Symbolism: Hippy-trippy analogues and metaphors and how to implement them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
