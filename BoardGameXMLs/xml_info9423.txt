			<description>A 4x4 version of Bingo in a metal box with art by Ulrike Fischer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Being the first to cross out a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row of four numbers twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a sheet from the notepad. It shows a 4 x 4 grid, into which each player writes the numbers 1 to 16 in a distribution of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns randomly drawing a chip (also numbered 1 to 16) out of the bag. They say the number and everyone crosses out that number on their sheet. This is repeated until a player has crossed out a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row of four numbers. This player gets to stamp a crown on their sheet and a new round starts.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect two crowns wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
