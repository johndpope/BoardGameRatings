							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zombie Rises</name>
									
			<description>The cemetery is dark, barely lit by the moonless sky. The graves are still in the blustering, howling winds. You awake in this desolate place. But you are not alone. There are others, fellow captives, near you. And the dead, beneath you. At least, you hope they are dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You glance around to find the main gate, closed, and locked with a combination. Stumbling towards it, you notice a figure reaching through the gate. A dead man with a bloody note in his hand. You grab the note and see the clues. The clues to your survival and freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A muffled scream breaks the silence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your fellow captives dreadfully turn, hoping the source is not near. You grab the hanging lantern, and light it, revealing some headstones. The appear to be dirty and must be cleared to find the numbers to the combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summoning courage, you step forward, but hear the bloodthirsty, muffled scream again. And again. It's getting closer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you figure out the combination to the gate, before The Zombie Rises?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zombie Rises is a cooperative game, pitting you and your fellow captives against the Zombie. Working together, you must keep the Lantern lit and uncover graves to find the numbers to unlock the gate. Move quickly, collect tools, clear obstacles, and break into mausoleums, all with the goal of gaining your freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the deck is stacked against you. Pull The Zombie Rises card six times, and you&amp;rsquo;re all dead. Guess the combination before then, and your lives are spared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
