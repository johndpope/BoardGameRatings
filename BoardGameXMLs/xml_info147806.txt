			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Ehdrigohr and may the crows be your guides!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ehdrigohr is a land where the nine tribes must survive the terrible things that walk the lands from sundown to sunrise. Immerse yourself in a fantastic world of cultures, myths, and legends. Magic is everywhere and with it the people can bend reality to their will or break it and unleash even more terrible things trapped in the emptiness called the Twain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ehdrigohr is a roleplaying game focused around storytelling, high drama, and horror. Players will create heroes and heroines who hold back the tides so the people can see another day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powered by Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Taken from introductory and site text.]&lt;br/&gt;In Ehdrigohr, tribal people in a broken world strive to unify while struggling against the horrors that wait for the night to fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ehdrigohr is a Fate Core System based tabletop role-playing game. It is inspired from the mythology and lore of tribal peoples from across the world but has a particular foundation inspired from Lakotah stories and folklore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ehdrigohr you get to play a character struggling to survive in this recovering world. It is a fantasy game of high heroics, myth and culture, powerful magic, and survival horror. The tides of darkness are overwhelming but this is not meant to be a game of nihilism. It is about hope. Your characters are the mythic heroes who do impossible things that push back the terrible tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are multitudes of paths to greatness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A warrior, imbued with mystic martial arts who fights on The Line?&lt;br/&gt;     A storyteller who keeps the peoples' spirits up and empowers their hearts to fight another day.&lt;br/&gt;     A wandering peacekeeper that ferrets out the infiltrators and hatemongers who work to break the nations.&lt;br/&gt;     A reality weaving Way-walker who travels the wild places seeking the breaches where the creatures trapped in the Twain have broken through the pale into the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Culturally, Ehdrigohr is a non-traditional fantasy world. Rather than fantasy seen through a Euro-Medieval lens, Ehdrigohr is instead crafted to take inspiration from the myth and folklore of tribal, and indigenous, cultures around the world with particular inspiration from traditions of the Lakhota people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though it is a human-centric world, each of the cultures of Ehdrigohr promises to have its own flavor steeped in magic. These are not &amp;ldquo;primitive&amp;rdquo; cultures but nations that have chosen their own interesting paths and traditions in their effort to survive the ravenous hordes that come in the night. Though it presents a different flavor of fantasy, there is a point of entry for many styles of play. There is high adventure, political intrigue, delving, social plays, secret societies, monster bashing, monster fleeing, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanically, Ehdrigohr relies on the Fate Core system to deliver its fun and focus on dramatic storytelling. The mechanics have been tailored to the ideals of the setting, though you can still expand on it with ideas from other FATE-based games out there in the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to being a fun game and an interesting world to explore Ehdrigohr is also a game of allegories. It examines our relationships with each other and the powerful force that is depression and how it whittles away at us, sending terrible thoughts that come when we are in dark places, bring us shivers, and cause us to fade. We hope to inspire people to hold strong in the darkness and fight your way through to a new light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So please join us. Make a character, choose your place, and hold the line in the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
