			<description>Eliot Ness, former leader of the legendary Untouchables, only wished to spend the rest of his life working in his diner and not thinking much of the cesspit of corruption his city, Santa Esperanza, had degenerated into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course things rarely go as planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one day children start to disappear and the police just turns a blind eye to this, Eliot decides to take justice into his own hands and find, by any means necessary, the culprit and bring him to justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if it means burning his peaceful life to the ground and getting involved in gunfights with assassins and thugs alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aided by some unexpected characters, the player will control Eliot through the increasingly morbid and decadent scenarios to find the clues needed to solve the cases in the 5 episodes that this season of Blues and Bullets brings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
