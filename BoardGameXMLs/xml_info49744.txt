			<description>starMaximiser&amp;reg; gives an appreciation of the energy rating system which closely resembles that used in Australasia and the Americas, enhancing one's knowledge in information that may need serious consideration when shopping for the most energy efficient household appliances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules in starMaximiser&amp;reg; make it so hard for players to hang on to their best home appliances (i.e. those that are energy efficient). With a dice in the works and picking up cards in turn that have been shuffled, it means that you will need lots of luck to get to the finish line first&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
