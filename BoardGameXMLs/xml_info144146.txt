			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Honor is everything.&lt;br/&gt;Money does not exist.&lt;br/&gt;And the World Really is Out to get YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play in a world where technology is slow to advance, tribes are divided by great geographical expanses, magic is scarce, trade is fraught with peril, dinosuar-like beasts co-exist with people, and the very environment poses danger to your party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tunse'al is a tribal, fantasy setting with four playable races that are outside the norm. The swamp-dwelling Kresh are an amphibious, genderless race committed to ensuring their sacred land, The Wetlands, is safe from greedy destruction. The cold-enduring Gelid use their pathfinding ways throughout the long stretches of the Baarek Mountains to explore and make peace wherever possible. The towering, red-skinned, two-horned Korrin pursue all things with passion in their free-form society of The Footlands' jungles. The thick-skinned, nomadic Gales with eyes resembling a snake's wander The Drylands' sands in search of desert gems, tar, and other commodities no one else would have any hope obtaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Skin Eaters of The Dreamlands round out the dominant races, although they are only at the GM's disposal. They are the treacherous, twisted cousins to the Kresh. In her madness, their creator, Sa'ra, made the Skin Eaters dependent upon others' skins in order to live. They are not mindless, but no tribe trusts them as historical attempts to have a respectable relationship have always ended in bloodshed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In conjunction with a Savage Worlds rule book, this guide contains enough to get you started on your own campaign and to fill in or stretch out sessions when players are absent or things go offtrack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Released for Free RPG Day 2013.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
