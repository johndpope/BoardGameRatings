			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kickle Cubicle is a cute puzzle game. The main character is a little creature whose home has been turned into a frozen wasteland. He has the power of freezing breath and must turn objects into ice cubes to be pushed along the ice floes. The cubes destroy enemies as well as create bridges to access other parts of the floe. There are four lands, each with a boss battle at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
