							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hegemony</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hegemony players assume the roles of Officers in a faction seeking power and influence.  Each faction consists of seven to nine officers and each game consists of four factions striving for victory against the other factions.  The game master will thus need to enlist around thirty players who are committed to a multi-week campaign.  The playing location will also need to be adequate to simultaneously house four groups with some measure of privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This peculiar game is very structured with specific times allocated for certain tasks.  One of the prime functions of the game master is to enforce these time restrictions and ensure the game proceeds according to schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
