			<description>[Taken from the introductory text.]&lt;br/&gt;Freeport, City of Adventure, is Green Ronin&amp;rsquo;s signature fantasy city, and one with a long history. The company&amp;rsquo;s second-ever release, Death in Freeport, brought the City of Adventure to the attention of gamers back in 2000. From that humble 32-page adventure, Freeport grew to be a storied city featured in many books and home campaigns. This culminated in The Pirate's Guide to Freeport, a systemless sourcebook describing the city in full detail and offering dozens of plots, adventure hooks, and NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the success of Dragon AGE, the first RPG built around the AGE (Adventure Game Engine) System (AGE), it was only natural to look at using AGE to run Freeport adventures. The meat of the material in this PDF was originally written to explore that idea and published as an article in Kobold Quarterly in 2010. Now that Green Ronin is publishing AGE branded PDFs like the Battle &amp;amp; Loot and AGE Explorations series, it seemed an opportune time to revisit Freeport. You can use the material presented here to run a Freeport game proper or incorporate it into the setting of your own AGE fantasy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
