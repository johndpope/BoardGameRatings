			<description>Back of game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STRATEGY AD 3-D SIMULATION&lt;br/&gt;Expert military consultant William Owen, from recent conflicts, has brought his knowledge to bear on computer gaming with an end result that looks and feels more realistic thanever before. All aspects involved in the running of an army have been considered, so that now you can place yourself in command of either side, at any level in the Chain of Command. Over 130 templates of the most significant military forces from 56 different nations of the last 50 years have been included to gain an insight into real conflicts such as Korea, Vietnam, and Operation Desert Storm. Enter the battle field in one of the 152 military vehicles. Tanks, APC's, Helicopters can all be controlled using weapons from wire-guided missiles, rockets, homing missiles, and machine guns supported by laser rangefinders, tracer rangerfinders, night vision and gun stabilizers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
