							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Counter All Terrorists!</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Counter All Terrorists&amp;quot; challenges its players to defend against a series of terrorist attacks on the United States. The game may be played solitaire, or by up to six players. As the title suggests, the object is to counter terrorists' attacks on the &amp;quot;White House, Pentagon, CIA, FBI, Air Force One, and many military bases and cities across the United States.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an unusual title in terms of historical insight, having been published in 1986 and embellishing its instructions with Albert Einstein's quote, &amp;quot;imagination is more important than knowledge.&amp;quot; The game treats a subject that few would take seriously at the time -- though, in hindsight, its designers also failed in imagination for the weights given the various terror targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
