			<description>Waterloo: Quelle Affaire!, designed by Alessio Cavatore and illustrated by Peter Dennis, is a hex-based boardgame that allows two players to recreate what is arguably the most famous battle in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The units in the game are activated by cards that represent the Commanders of the various army corps, as well as Stratagem cards that add more fun, strategy and unpredictability to the battle. These cards are full of quotes both from history and from famous Napoleonic movies: &amp;ldquo;By God, sir, I have lost my leg. &amp;ndash; By God, sir, so you have.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We shall match them with our lancers!&amp;rdquo; Nobody can resist reading these with the right accent&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge You win the game by destroying half the total combat strength of the enemy army. This task is easier for the French when only one army faces them. However, if Wellington&amp;rsquo;s forces survive long enough for the Prussians to finally arrive, the tip of the scale will swing in favour of the Allies, and the French are probably going to find themselves fighting for their life. And nobody can be sure exactly when the Prussians are going to appear in the East&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
