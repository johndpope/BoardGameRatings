			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bulletproof is a game for 2-5 players that blends tactics, strategy and luck as players compete to build criminal empires. Characters use corruption, bribes and many other secret weapons to interfere with other players, acquire territories and put money in their safe. Action cards can be used to finish jobs, steal territories, call in favors or stored in your safe to pay off debts. Territory cards and the sets that they form include special abilities that are activated by &amp;ldquo;Finish a Job&amp;rdquo; action cards. Make sure to visit the Black Market, it might have the territory or action card that you need to build out your empire and beat your rivals. Finishing a job allows players to create unique and clever combos for stealing territory, filling your safe or ruining another character&amp;rsquo;s plans. While building your empire be sure to fill in your safe with action cards or you might be forced to give up your territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
