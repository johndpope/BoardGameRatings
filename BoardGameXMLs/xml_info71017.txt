			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the civilized nations of Exodus, the Imperial Alliance provides a neutral forum for political negotiations, diplomatic relations, and international trade. While they have made incredible steps towards keeping peace and unifying the empire, breaking down longstanding racial and political tensions between the varied nations remains a difficult task. To placate social unrest in its most volatile regions, the Alliance initiated an outreach program based on the construction of protasylums, independent settlements governed by Alliance consulates and mostly occupied by Alliance troops. Political rivalry between the remaining chancellors has weakened the overall authority of the Alliance, spinning Protasylum-Six precariously towards political implosion. Now the shadows quell with Dominion warlords and hungry splinter-cells of Protectorate insurgents, all waiting for the collapse of the Alliance leadership and poised to seize control of the strategically located settlement. The Alliance hires the players to investigate and negotiate with some of the growing street gangs to attempt to quell potential uprisings. In particular, they are concerned with Yvonne Korsiv, a fanatical Armanian insurgent rapidly gaining notoriety as a strong anti-Alliance voice. Players are sent to investigate her group and determine if she might be negotiable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
