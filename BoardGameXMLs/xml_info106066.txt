							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Multitap 2</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Super Multitap 2 was released shortly after Super Bomberman 2 and was only sold unbundled, as opposed to the Super Multitap which was only sold with Super Bomberman.  The Super Multitap 2 still featured four (4) additional controller ports but this time around was shaped to look like Bombermans face.  It is a unique Super Famicom accessory that is compatible with all three player plus Super Famicom Titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all Super Famicom controllers the Super Multitap 2 is compatible with all NTSC Super Nintendos, but not with PAL consoles (without a hardware modification).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
