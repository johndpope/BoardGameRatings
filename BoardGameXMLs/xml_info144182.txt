			<description>The goal of Galtoni is to connect 4 balls in a straight (diagonal or orthogonal) line. Unlike in other games with this concept, however, there is a randomizer involved, as the game is played on a type of Galton box. Players take turns inserting a ball in one of the openings at the top of the slanted board. It hits a series of pins which deflect it, before falling into one of seven slots at the bottom. The first player who manages to form a straight line of four balls in his/her color is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;There are two neutral balls included as well, which both players can use for their lines. &lt;br/&gt;In a variant, the balls are randomly drawn from a bag, so a players sometimes insert balls that belong to the other player, trying to put it into a useless position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
