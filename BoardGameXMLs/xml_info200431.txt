							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Switcheroo Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This 1968 card game is visually a spin-off from the hit movie, but the mechanism is essentially the same as Crazy Eights. This deck has 44 cards in four suits, each numbering 1 to 11. Each number has an illustration of a character, with the 8s being Chitty Chitty Bang Bang the car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of five cards. The rest are face down as a draw deck, and the top of the draw deck becomes the card to match. Each player in turn must play a card from hand that matches either the number or the suit. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang cards are wild, can be played on any card, and allow the player to specify the suit that must be matched by the next player. First player to empty his hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no other special or &amp;quot;pick-up&amp;quot; cards that usually figure in Crazy Eight games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
