							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So What&#039;s The Human Called, Anyway? III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So your PCs have wandered into a nearby town. Perhaps they are relaxing in the tavern talking with the locals, haggling with a merchant or trying to gather information about a nearby ruin from a sage. Then they ask &amp;ldquo;so what&amp;rsquo;s this bloke called, anyway?&amp;rdquo; At this point, the GM normally uses the first name that pops into his head (probably &amp;ldquo;Bob,&amp;rdquo; or the one he used minutes ago for another NPC) crushing the players&amp;rsquo; suspension of disbelief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s The Human Called, Anyway? III banishes this problems by providing hundreds of names of African, Arabic, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Slavic, South American and Spanish origin. Divided by culture, these handy tables enables the busy GM to generate literally thousands of unique names for use in his campaign. Players can also use the tables herein to create cool names for their PCs that suit the background and flavour of their GM&amp;rsquo;s campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featured Cultures:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    African&lt;br/&gt;    Arabic&lt;br/&gt;    Chinese&lt;br/&gt;    Italian&lt;br/&gt;    Japanese&lt;br/&gt;    Slavic&lt;br/&gt;    South American&lt;br/&gt;    Spanish &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
