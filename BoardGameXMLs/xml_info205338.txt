			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Traders is an easy to learn game of trading goods across the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over several rounds divided in 2 phases:&lt;br/&gt;1) Trade goods phase&lt;br/&gt;2) Deployment phase&lt;br/&gt;During the 1st phase, players scour the galaxy in search of trade goods they will later sell to planets in distant solar systems. Acquiring trade goods is very quick and simple. Players&lt;br/&gt;draft cards from a deck of goods and add them to their hands. The first player draws cards equal to twice the number of players (for example, 6 cards for a 3 player game) chooses one and passes the rest to the next player. The rest of the players do the same, except for the last. The last player, chooses 2 cards then passes the rest to the previous player. This happens until the first player takes the last remaining card. (example: Nick, John and Mary have 6 cards to draft. Nick goes first chooses 1, then passes 5 cards to John. John also chooses 1, then passes 4 cards to Mary. Mary chooses 2 then passes 2 cards to John. John chooses 1 then passes the last card to Nick.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the 2nd phase, players deploy their trade goods gathered from the 1st phase on planets of their choice. But the real reward is not money. The real reward is the trade agreement that may be established with a planet. If such a trade agreement is active, a player may benefit from it later on the game.&lt;br/&gt;Planets are divided in Age I and Age II. Age I planets provide trade agreements and just a few credits, while Age II planets provide lots of credits but no trade agreements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
