			<description>2 players roll dices and try to get their pawns out on the playing board. The two players have their own side of the board. When a pawn is out there it can be moved one line further, if the player is successful with the dices. The aim of the game is to manage to place all pawns on the line in the middle of the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
