							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quadraughts</name>
									
			<description>The classic game of draughts for 4 people. Same objective as draughts: to eliminate all your opponents pieces, and same rules as draughts / checkers -- jump over opposing pieces to capture. But Quadraughts requires a lot more skill and strategic nous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique 13 by 13 square grid board with 4 sets of different coloured draught pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4 players or 2 teams, for all the family, aged 6+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 4 (or 2 playing 2 colors each)&lt;br/&gt;Board: 13 x 13 squares alternating black and white. Some squares have coloured spots.&lt;br/&gt;Pieces: 12 each player (in 4 distinct colors)&lt;br/&gt;Placement: The pieces (men) are placed on the squares on the first three rows in front of each player, on the appropriately colored spots.&lt;br/&gt;Moves: Men move diagonally across the board on the black squares, one square at a time, in a forward direction. Kings (see below) may move forwards or backwards.&lt;br/&gt;Commencement: The players decide who should begin and players take it in turns to move, in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;Capture: A piece is captured by jumping over it and removing it from the board. Several pieces may be captured in a single move by making successive jumps with a single piece. The men captured do not all have to be of the same color. If a capture is possible, it must be made. Failure to do so results in &amp;ldquo;huffing&amp;rdquo;, the removal of the offending piece by the opposing player.&lt;br/&gt;Crowning: A man which reaches the farthest row of the board, ON A SPOTTED SQUARE is crowned as a king by placing a second man on top of it. It can then move both forwards and backwards. If the man lands on a square (on the farthest row) that is not spotted it returns to any spotted square of the first row of the board to begin again. If all the spotted squares on the first row are full than the man moves to the nearest spotted square to the first row.&lt;br/&gt;End: The game ends when three players either lose all their men or can no longer move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
