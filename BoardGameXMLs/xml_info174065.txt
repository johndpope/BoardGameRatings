							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pan tu nie stał! Demoludy</name>
									
			<description>Pan tu nie stał! Demoludy is a reimplementation of a Reiner Knizia game Gem Dealer. This game is also a sequel to the game Pan tu nie stał! (which is a Polish version of Great Wall of China).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics were wrapped into a theme of 70's and 80's in communist countries of eastern Europe. In this game players take a trip from Poland, travelling by popular in that time cars and try to collect a set of items bought in four (out of five) different countries. The countries presented in the game are: GDR (German Democratic Republic), Czechoslovakia, HPR (Hungarian People's Republic), Turkey and USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round is an auction. The starting player takes one tile of a chosen color (country) and place it in the middle of the table. She then make a starting bid which has to contain at least one card of a matching color. The next player may present a higher bid or pass. After every bid or pass a player draws one new card from the deck and adds it to her hand. The player who already passed is omitted. The auction continues untill all but one player pass. The winner takes the tile, puts it in his car and starts a new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect a set of four tile in different colors is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features advanced rules. In this variant in order to win the players have to collect the four color set of tile with a value of at least 10. There are also action cards which can help to it's owner or mess up with other players' cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demoludy vs Gem Dealer - differences&lt;br/&gt;- In Gem Dealer starting player receives one card less than the others. Every player gets 5 cards at the beginning of Demoludy.&lt;br/&gt;- In Gem Dealer there is a rule that if you lose a bidding contest while using wild card 10, you lose one of your previously gathered gem. There is no such rule in Demoludy.&lt;br/&gt;- There is an advanced variant in Gem Dealer in which you have to gather 5 different gems, while in advanced variant of Demoludy you need 4 different items with a total value of 10 or more.&lt;br/&gt;- There are no action cards in Gem Dealer which are in Demoludy.&lt;br/&gt;- Demoludy also contains the expansion for Pan tu nie stał! (Great Wall of China): Bazar R&amp;oacute;życkiego (which would be translated to: R&amp;oacute;życki's Bazaar)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
