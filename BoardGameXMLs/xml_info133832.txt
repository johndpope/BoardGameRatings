			<description>Future Pinball is a freeware 3D pinball editing and gaming application for Microsoft Windows. Similar to Visual Pinball, Future Pinball is a simulator and editor, but does not emulate hardware found in physical pinball machines. Tables are designed using 3D models found within the editor, and rendered using a 3D real-time engine. Pinball table layout, graphic design, and audio are provided by users during the construction and development of table design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Pinball allows users to create original tables based upon a default table which only contains flippers, slingshots, shooter lane, and shooter. Additional playfield components are added from a library containing surface, guide, objects, rubber, targets, lights, triggers, ramps, and displays. User created artwork can be added to the playfield, plastics, and backglass translite. Game coding is required, and is accomplished through Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) via an embedded script editor. The program uses Newton Game Dynamics for physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Pinball completed tables can be downloaded and played in the same application. Standard computer keyboards are often used, although there are a growing number of custom pinball cabinet designs that interface buttons to the software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Future Pinball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
