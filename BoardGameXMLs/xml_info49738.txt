			<description>A fan made expansion designed by David Fair and available for download from the Geek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/fileinfo.php?fileid=21763&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/fileinfo.php?fileid=21763&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board: (full size PDF, needs to be cut for printing, 24x18&amp;quot; single page)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/fileinfo.php?fileid=21762&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/fileinfo.php?fileid=21762&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map is designed for 4-6 players, and incorporates a number of rules variations, including a modification of Ted Alspach's chain delivery mechanic, and a creative new rule that allows players to place factories onto cities. The factories, in thematic fashion, mean that cities will gain more goods, as each time a delivery is made to the city, two more goods are placed onto it. Factories also give bonus income to their owner when a delivery is made to their locale, but they also increase end of round expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
