							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Channeler</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes magic isn't about finesse or manipulation. Sometimes it's about power. Raw, unadulterated power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The channeler is a spellcaster who channels his power through his own body, trading hit points for spells. On one hand, he can achieve heights of arcane prowess his fellows can rarely glimpse; on the other hand, every spell saps a bit of his strength, leaving him even more vulnerable to the attacks of his enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4th installment in our Summer Class Blitz, the channeler is one of the most interesting yet, granting players a whole new level of tactical planning as they balance their health and their power, finding the best way to wield their untold might without leaving themselves open to attack. Both tactical players and power gamers will love the new approach to power that's presented in our newest class: The Channeler!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
