							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bike Race Game</name>
									
			<description>This cute children cycling game was produced in New-York by the Master Toy Corporation. It featured a  small board with wholes in it(29x29cm) with 4 cyclists. The cyclist were pinned on a pawn that allowed it to put it in the wholes on the track of the cyclist (each cyclist had it's own separate track) on  the board. What makes it original is that movement was not determined by dice but by a spinning device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
