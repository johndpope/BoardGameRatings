			<description>From the publisher&amp;acute;s website:&lt;br/&gt;The first entry into the history of car racing, the victory of horsepower without horses. Go ahead gentlemen, the world awaits you! The racers speed along trackless roads and deserted landscapes to win the most exalted of prizes, and the glory for being the most daring of drivers. The first and greatest race in the annals of history can only be won by someone who, defying all odds, manages to drive his automobile through the finish line. We can admit though, that beside their skills the racers have to posses a small amount of luck as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play simultanously the cards with numbers 1-6. Now player reveal the cards and starting to move their cars in increasing numbers on their cards. If Your car ends the turn on the place where is another card or obstacle you must put Your car back  to the space from which they started the movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player who finishes first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
