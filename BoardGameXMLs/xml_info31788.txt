			<description>Muffin the Mule was a children's television program made by the BBC through the late '40s and the '50s. This game displays characters and events from the television show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically &amp;quot;Strip Jack Naked&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Beggar My Neighbour&amp;quot; with players playing the top card from their deck to a pile in the centre of the table. If a numbered card is played then the next player must pay cards in succession equal to the number on the card. If while paying out that player turns over a numbered card then the next player must now pay for that card. If a player pays cards to match the required number without revealing a numbered card themselves the player who player the numbered card collects the entire stack from the centre of the table and adds it to the bottom of their own pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has the addition of 2 Peregrine the Penguin cards. When one of these is revealed the first player to shout &amp;quot;Muffin&amp;quot; instantly wins the centre pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player has all of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
