							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pawn Mob</name>
									
			<description>This is a two player abstract strategy game played on a chessboard (simulates a brawl between two mobs in an enclosed area). This is played with eight pawns per side. Pawns start from the opposite extreme ranks. White moves first. Movements are as per pawn movement in chess. But opponent's pawns are not captured when they come in diagonally to each other. Instead they are pushed one square backward orthogonally. If there is no space to move orthogonally (square occupied by another pawn or there is no space in the board) then the attacked pawn is captured. One point is awarded per captured pawn and for each pawn which reach the opposite ranks. Game ends when no more pawns can be moved for either side. Player with most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game rules will be uploaded soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
