							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Prix 3</name>
									
			<description>From the manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the most advanced Formula One racing simulation ever made. Grand Prix 3 is specifically designed to give you the complete racing experience. Whether you're new to the game or a Grand Prix 1 or 2 veteran there's plenty in this simulation for everyone. No matter what your experience of racing games, you'll know that Grand Prix 3 is an instant classic, achieving new heights of performance, accuracy and attention to graphic 3D detail. Designed and written by the legendary Geoff Crammond, Grand Prix 3 is the answer to all Formula One racing fans' prayers: it has the real teams, the real drivers, the real cars, the real engines, and the real tracks. In fact everything you could ever want to tackle the Formula One World Championship Season. Complete!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the cars are always the stars of this simulation. It's not just that they look so perfect (which they do in abundance) but they handle just like the real thing (so we've been told by real Formula One drivers). Springs, dampers, wings, gear ratios, brake balance and ride height are just a few of the items that are realistically adjustable and that will truly affect car performance and handling characteristics. And you can study the effects of these adjustments by downloading telemetric data into the highly accurate performance analysis utility that will help you compare different car setups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Prix 3 simulated the 1998 Formula One Grand Prix season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
