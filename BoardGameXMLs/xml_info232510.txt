			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 30 million players could not be wrong - old-school lumberjacks are now available in the world of tabletop games! &lt;br/&gt;In Timberman players take on a role of lumberjacks and explore woods for the most valuable lumber. But be careful because there are dangerous bears in the woods...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only a player who can place their lumberjacks in the most efficient way and score the most victory points will be a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 different kind of tiles in the game: tree tiles (worth 1/2/3 points), lake and stone tiles which are bostacles and bear tiles. At the beginning of the table each player draws 3 tiles from a bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take their turns one by one in a clockwise order, starting from the first player.&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you can take the following actions (in order):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. You must place one of your tiles next to the tiles already placed on the table, following the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you chose so, you may also add another of your tiles next to the tiles already placed the table, following the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. You may add one of your lumberjack tiles next to the tiles already placed on the table, following the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. You must randomly draw 1 tile from the cloth bag (even if you placed 2 tiles on that turn) and add it to your hand, unless there are no more tiles in the bag in which case, you skip this step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the next player in a clockwise order takes their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
