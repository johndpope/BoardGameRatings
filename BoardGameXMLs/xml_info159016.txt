			<description>subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;Roleplaying in the Warhammer 40,000 Universe with the One Roll Engine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the cover&lt;br/&gt;Dark Reign 40K is a microgame based on Arc Dream Publishing&amp;rsquo;s Wild Talents. It presents the characters and concepts of Games Workshop&amp;rsquo;s Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game with the speed and simplicity of the Wild Talents rules set&amp;mdash;the “one-roll engine” (O.R.E.). The rules in Dark Reign 40K are a simplified version of Wild Talents.  It is meant to be easy to teach to neophyte gamers and playable with all the speed, excitement, and flash of Warhammer 40,000 itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary:&lt;br/&gt;This is a fan-created set of role playing game rules designed around the One Roll Engine as presented in Wild Talents,but heavily adapted to the tropes of the Warhammer 40,000 Universe.  A source of setting information for the Warhammer 40,000 Universe is required to make use of these rules; no setting information beyond setting-appropriate character creation features is contained in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NB:  Wild Talents rules are not required in order to use these rules.  The Dark Reign 40,000 rules are self-contained and not backward compatible with the Wild Talents rules: e.g. terminology for dice, attributes and some other rules features are different from the Wild Talents definitions, skills and abilities are different, different hit location charts, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
