							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Road by Any Other Name</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Road by Any Other Name takes place during a sweltering hot day on a lonely and deserted section of ravaged road in the middle of a blasted wasteland. The sun is high and the winds are perfectly still. A lost and patch-worked force of High-bred soldiers with their unusual shaman-guide and two odd conscripts run into arag-tag band of Churl survivalists and their odd &amp;ldquo;mounts&amp;rdquo;. Both groups are struggling to survive in the blasted wastes, and both have resources that the other can use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've teamed up with Skeleton Key Games and tailored A Road By Any Other Name, to fit perfectly with SKG's OMEGA TILES 01: Ravaged Roads product. If you pick up SKG's PDF, you have a ready-made map for this encounter &amp;ndash; and we show you how to build the map inside. All the rules and background information you need to play are also right inside the pdf. We give you the complete scenario setup, the breakdown of the forces, counters for all of the characters and creatures you'll be using and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So grab your dice, grab your friends and get your Untold Encounter on - TONIGHT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
