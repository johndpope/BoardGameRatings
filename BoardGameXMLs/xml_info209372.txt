			<description>This is an undated promotional game by packaged food giant ConAgra that pushed three of its brands. The game comes in a 9.5&amp;quot; x 14&amp;quot; envelope, and consists of a rules sheet and two folded and perforated sheets of glossy cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One sheet is made up of the playing field, stadium and 8 player cards, while the other has 18 player cards, 16 fly ball result cards, 16 ground ball result cards, 16 batter and runner figures, two dice (one red and one blue), and assorted signs and markers. The baseball stadium, scoreboards and the dice need to be assembled after separating the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draft their teams from the pool of 9 red and 9 blue players. The red players are long ball hitters and use the red die; the blue players hit more ground balls and use the blue die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each at-bat, the batting player rolls the appropriate die, which produces ball, strike, foul, fly ball or ground ball. When the ball is hit, players take one of the fly ball or ground ball cards and follow the results, which range from home runs to double plays. The usual rules of baseball apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
