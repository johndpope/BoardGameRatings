			<description>The Beautiful Game: TCG (Trading Card Game) is a tabletop board game incorporating an optional trading card system to introduce more player cards and tactical 'Event Cards'. It is a 2 player game that can be played for any duration, but it is recommended that players play 60 or 90 minutes, broken down into two halves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with players choosing their teams. In the Kick Off Edition, players will draft their teams face-up from the pool of players. The player cards are then assigned to a number which corresponds to a player piece on the pitch. The game is then played using the stats on the player cards and rolls of the D20 against these stats when necessary to perform certain actions such as shooting or tackling. The game is quick and fluid to play and involves no measuring of distances other than counting spaces on the pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra tactics and gameplay elements are introduced to the game via 'Event Cards' &amp;ndash; a 50 card (minimum) deck of cards that can help you or hinder your opponent. The Kick Off Edition features pre-constructed Event Card decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing the game, the player in possession of the ball (the attacking player) leads play but the defending player is still heavily involved in influencing how the attacker can play. The defending player chooses to try mark attackers and can play Event cards to hinder their chances in order to try win back possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who has scored the most goals at the end of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
