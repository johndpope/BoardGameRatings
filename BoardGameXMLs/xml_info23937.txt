			<description>Players compete &amp;quot;to gain the least amount of weight by answering questions about Diet, Nutrition, and Health.&amp;quot; The playing surface rings the board in an 8x8 square. Pawns move the number of spaces indicated on a die roll. The game lasts for five rounds of five turns each, for a total of 25 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player &amp;quot;gains weight&amp;quot; either by landing on the buffet space (thereby overindulging) or landing on a colored square. If the latter, the player must correctly answer a question from a supplied card to avoid the weight gain. (The cards give both the correct answer and its rationale, to provide an educational experience for the players.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players &amp;quot;lose weight&amp;quot; either by landing on the &amp;quot;Fat Farm&amp;quot; or by correctly answering a question when landing on the &amp;quot;Slim Chance&amp;quot; space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players sent to the &amp;quot;Pig Pen&amp;quot; must wear a supplied Pig Mask until their next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
