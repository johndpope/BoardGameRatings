			<description>Pigsy's Perfect 10 acts as a prequel to the main story where players take control of the character Pigsy. Since the player takes the role of Pigsy, the gameplay has also changed due to his difference in character and build compared to Monkey. While Pigsy can still climb over terrain, he cannot scale buildings as fast or athletically. Instead, Pigsy utilizes a mechanical grappling hand attached to his own to reach higher places and swing over obstacles and large gaps. When in combat, without the same fighting skills as Monkey, Pigsy instead wields a long-ranged rifle and grenades. Stealth is also a preferable approach to gameplay, requiring at times to avoid combat altogether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Enslaved:_Odyssey_to_the_West,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
