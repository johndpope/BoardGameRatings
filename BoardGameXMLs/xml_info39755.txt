			<description>The NextGen Decision Game was created, according to an Dec. 2, 2008, article in the Brisbane (Australia) Times, by &amp;quot;a disgruntled staffer of Virgin Blue&amp;quot; who &amp;quot;worked for the budget airline in its Brisbane headquarters until last month, when he was knocked back for a promotion and subsequently resigned.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a variant of Snakes and Ladders with action cards. Players start in the &amp;quot;hangar&amp;quot; and the winner is the first to advance to the 50th space, known as &amp;quot;decision.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the newspaper article, the action cards range from &amp;quot;CEO on holiday - go one step back&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;We are perceived as a hyperactive child with a personality disorder - decide if you go three steps forward or back.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available as a PDF here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/multimedia/virgingame.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/multimedia/virgingame.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
