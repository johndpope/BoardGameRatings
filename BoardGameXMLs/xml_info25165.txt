			<description>Justified Ancients is 10 page element-based set of ancients period miniatures rules.  &amp;quot;Designed for experienced wargamers, these rules are 'rules light' and it's assumed that players know their Cataphracts from the Schiltrons, how to move a unit by wheeling from the outside edge and all that malarkey.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you haven't guessed by now, the rules are written in an amusing style (e.g. &amp;quot;In a Turn each player gets to Do Stuff.&amp;quot;), but the rules are not designed to be a joke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit requires a dice score in order to move, reform,  charge, etc.  Melee combat is done by adding a D3 to the units base modifiers.  Results are based on the overall difference of the modified die rolls.  Stands which are damaged in combat can become disorganized, depleted, or dispersed (removed from the table).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
