							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkness Comes: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Sometimes when a family moves into a new house, it's not the best place to live. It does, however, turn out to be the best place to stay forever...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness Comes is a co-operative board game that tells a story of a family trying to escape from a haunted house. The game begins quickly. The set-up is gamified as the players use their cards to create the initial situation on the board. They decide which areas are haunted and which doors are closed, how much time they need to escape, where they can find useful items, what they should do before leaving the place. Every card they play increases the tension, and strange things start to happen: Menacing shadows gather, and family members' faces disappear from photographs. All these events prepare us for the forthcoming nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the main phase of the game begins. The house tries to ensnare the characters inside or kill them. Trying to find their way out, the family members encounter many kinds of horrors. Every time it happens, they decide whether to strengthen the house, hurt themselves, or change their plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters co-operate and support each other by transferring love points &amp;mdash; but sometimes they have to risk their sanity to survive. And sometimes they lose their minds. That's why the rules of the game can change. The possessed character may decide to side with the sinister house. It comes as no surprise for horror fans when the father of the family gets mad and finds the axe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
