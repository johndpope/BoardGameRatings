							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battles of 1866: Koniggratz</name>
									
			<description>One of the three games split off from the earlier War of the Empires: Battles of 1866 project from APL, this game covers the most famous battle from the Austro-Prussian War... Koniggratz.  Rather than the five smaller battles in the Frontier Battles installment, this game focuses on one huge battle between the Prussians and Austrians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses the same system as War of the States: Gettysburg, 1863 and War Of The States: Chickamauga &amp;amp; Chattanooga which is similar to the Rome at War and Eagles Of The Empire series as well. In this game, the units are Prussian, Austrian, and Saxon infantry brigades artillery batteries, and cavalry regiments. The pieces are moved around topographic maps of the various battlegrounds. Combat is resolved using by rolling a number of dice equal to the total combat strength of units involved in combat, with hits scored on a result of 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
