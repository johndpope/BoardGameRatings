			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Face of Change&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some call me a Changeling for my ability to alter my appearance at-will. I have a gift most people would kill to have, but being able to change shapes isn&amp;rsquo;t always fun and games. Sometimes I feel like I don&amp;rsquo;t even know my own identity anymore, and many of my kind suffer from severe personality disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I use control animate powers to alter my physical form and I&amp;rsquo;m adept at changing the shape of others, too. Anything made of organic material is fair game as long as it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t kill me to touch it. I once knew another changeling who tried to save his own life by turning a bear into a billy goat. Too bad for him the beast mauled his face before he had time to transmute it. If he was smart he&amp;rsquo;d have just turned himself into a bird and flown away, but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to think like that under pressure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psi-punk Archetypes: Changeling is all about people with the ability to alter living material at-will using the control animate psychic power.  This supplement provides further insight into the archetype and offers suggestions for skill selections, Gifts, Faults, and Gear that would be useful to any changeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
