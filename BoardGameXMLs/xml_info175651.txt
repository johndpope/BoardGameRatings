							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heavy Hippos</name>
									
			<description>A cooperative children's game in which distinguishing the weight of objects is a central element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game: 6 wooden hippos (two light ones, two medium-weight ones, two heavy ones) have to be moved to the finishing spaces that correspond to their weights. If the players are successful, they all win together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it is played: Players take turn rolling the die and completing the corresponding actions (moving a hippo 1, 2 or 3 spaces on the board, switching two hippos, moving 2 hippos one space each). During each turn, they lift the hippo and comment on whether they think it is light, medium or heavy.&lt;br/&gt;(The weight category is specified on the underside of the hippos' feet, but no peeking is allowed during the game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
