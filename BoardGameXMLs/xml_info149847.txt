			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a very short (about two hours) adventure for RealTime designed as an appetizer and warm-up, a way to get players used to how RealTime works and to work out kinks in the process. It's intended as either the first or, even better, second exposure to RealTime for both player and GM. In essence, it's one extended encounter, but it still offers a taste of almost everything RealTime has to offer, a chance to use just about every rule in the game, and a good exposure to the excitement and time-focused action of RealTime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Starting situation:&lt;br/&gt;The game will begin with the PCs' team being on duty in response-ready condition at the DARRT office in Dennison, MA...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 14:00 exactly, a call comes in over the intercom from Judy Terrence, their dispatcher. &amp;ldquo;Okay, attention, DARRT team Romeo Tango Fiver, hostage situation in progress at Chronos Veritas corporate headquarters, New Dimensions Industrial Park, route 182 exit 88 south. Attempted burglary went sour; suspects appear to be armed. Little information available at this time. Ship out in ten minutes, more information will be provided en route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
