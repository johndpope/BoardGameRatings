							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enviro-Quiz</name>
									
			<description>ENVIRO-QUIZ is a fascinating, scientifically documented and interactive game, and is very relevant to current concerns about air pollution, climate change, the different threats to the environment and endangered species, the solutions to improve the environment and to protect wild animals. This game is an enjoyable aid towards making children (and adults) more aware of environmental problems, and encouraging them to take action to ensure a viable environment - and a better future for everybody. While ENVIRO-QUIZ is a game of environmental awareness, it is most definitely also a game that is fun and easy to play. Everyone loves question and answer games, whatever the subject. The game is designed in particular for children and adolescents, families and educators. Help with reviewing and validating the information, and with developing the game, was provided by well-known worldwide organizations, including the IUCN - World Conservation Union. The Instruction booklet provides many different ways of playing depending on age, number of players and the time available. It&amp;rsquo;s a great traveling game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
