							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Metal Warrior 3</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third entry in the Commodore 64 Metal Warrior series. Whilst out on a night of drinking, Ian, Phantasm and Goat - members of the 'war-metal' band Cyberpriest - are attacked by special forces, with Ian and Phantasm getting captured. Players control Goat (and later another five playable characters) as he attempts to rescue his bandmates and seek revenge for the attack. Like the first two games NPCs can be interacted with, and an inventory bar allows for items bought or collected to be carried and used when necessary. This game is far more of an RPG than it's predecessors: players can switch between multiple characters, all characters have improvable RPG statistics (agility, strength and vitality) and there is a day/night cycle which affects various aspects of the game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freeware downloadable for Commodore 64 emulators - technically possible to run the games on a real Commodore 64. The GBA release is a ROM to be used with a GBA emulator. The ROM can somehow be copied to a suitable cartridge for a real GBA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
