The point of puzzled ISN'T to eliminate all of the lines, there's a story here, and it explains the gameplay. It kind of goes like this: There was a village of men and a village of women and the two were always at war so the gods built a tower/wall between them so they couldn't fight and so after a while both villages got tired of it, and sent a messenger, a boy from one and a girl from the other, in hot air balloons, to the top of the tower to petition the gods to remove the barrier between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
