			<description>From the Book's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are about to discover a world where governments conspire to keep the population ignorant of the most important events in our history. A world where secret agencies operate beyond any control, possessing unlimited power to suppress the truth and carry out their illegal duties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A world fighting a silent war against an Alien enemy of incredible abilities and unfathomable motivations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A world you know nothing about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information contained in this booklet is for the referee only. To maintain suspense players should read no further. Here you have all that is needed to run many sessions of game play set in a modern world of Alien&amp;shy;Government conspiracy. This campaign pack has been written for the STOCS lite system (by Wasteland Games) but it's also possible to use any other suitable rules you have lying about. The information in this booklet is a mixture of background material and some scenario ideas to get you started. All of this information represents just one piece of the jigsaw that is the world of Phase I. This world, cowering beneath Alien invasions and conspiracies, is a background for the STOCS lite RPG. Further releases from Wasteland Games will reveal more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The breakdown of the booklet is as follows; first we present an introduction to The Lie where the events leading up to Alien&amp;shy;Government conspiracy are presented. Included in this section is a brief analysis of The Roswell Incident which is vital to understanding the nature of UFO based conspiracy. The following sections deal with the government agencies actively involved in the cover&amp;shy;-up, the Aliens themselves and the private organisations known collectively as the UFO Underground. Notes on refereeing and possible styles of play are also included. Due to the vast scope of this subject only details really pertinent to game&amp;shy;play are included. Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
