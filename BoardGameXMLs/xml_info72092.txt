							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hell on Wheels: a Warpspawn card game</name>
									
			<description>A Warpspawn game simulating the emergence - and rapid disappearance - of &amp;quot;vice towns&amp;quot; as the Union Pacific Railroad was laying down tracks in the 1860's to link the east and west coasts of the USA.  Each of 2-6 players bids to become RR Supervisor, who controls the order of activities in that turn, then spends their filthy lucre to build civilized establishments (schools, post offices) that bring in tax money and &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; establishments (saloons, gambling halls) that bring in more filthy lucre if they have lots of customers and mayhem. The game was just made available by Lloyd Krassner's Warpspawn Games, rules available on the Warpspawn website and e-group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
