			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign provides enough content and suggestions for 12-16, 4 hour sessions. It takes a group of players from level 1 to 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign is designed as a barebones foundation to allow DMs to have a multitude of flexibility with a modicum of story. Most of the people and places the players will encounter have not been fleshed out.  While this may put pressure on the DM to prepare for what happens through the course of the campaign, it allows your players to contribute significantly to how that story unfolds.  My goal was to give greater control of what the world feels like, and looks like, to the players. If your group wants highly detailed descriptions, and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that work, this product is not for you.  But, if you often engage your players for help in building a collaborative narrative, then this campaign might be for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
