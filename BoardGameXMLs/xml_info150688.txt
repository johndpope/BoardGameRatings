							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Crypt</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 1&amp;rdquo;=5' battle map of an ancient crypt.  This map is perfect for an old fashioned dungeon like dive, exploring the abandoned crypt where ancient heroes have been buried for a millennium.  Has this crypt been infested by the undead?  Are your players looking to loot the graves of dead adventurers and heroes?  Have local bandits decided to make this crypt their base of operations?  Has a powerful vampire decided to take up residence in the crypt's dark interiors?  Perhaps a powerful necromancer has come here to raise an army of undead servants from the corpses of these long dead heroes.  Whatever you decide, there are plenty of uses for a map such as this!  The dangers await.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     75&amp;quot;x39&amp;quot; in size, though some of that is due to wasted &amp;quot;white space&amp;quot;.  There is nothing to do about the wasted space, however.  If you choose to avoid wasting printer ink on the wasted white space, you may wish to go through each PDF first and figure out exactly which pages you want to print.  This way your cartridges are spared.&lt;br/&gt;     Full Color Version &amp;ndash; This is a printer intensive, full color version of this map.&lt;br/&gt;     Printer Friendly Full Color Version &amp;ndash; This version reduces the load on your ink cartridges by replacing inaccessible earth areas with blank white space.&lt;br/&gt;     Printer Friendly Lights and Shadows - Another printer friendly full color version, however this one features torch lights and shadows.&lt;br/&gt;     Black and White version &amp;ndash; A black and white version that replaces the inaccessible earth areas with blank white space.  Meant to be the least printer intensive of all of the maps.&lt;br/&gt;     A map key is included to help you understand the areas of the map better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
