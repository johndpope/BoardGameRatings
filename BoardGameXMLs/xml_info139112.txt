							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Maintenance Mummy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the shadow of Mount Terror lies the Tomb of Zuul-Tem. It has remained undisturbed for a thousand years, haunted by the cures of the ancient Necromancer who was supposedly laid to rest there. His knowledge, his treasure, and his power are said to be there with him. You and your group have planned an expedition there; an untouched crypt for a millennium. It is said to be trapped with devices of such lethal cunning that most men will die of fright. And it&amp;rsquo;s yours for the taking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It takes effort to make sure that all of the treasure stays put and the legend of the crypt stays intact. Traps need to be reset, and that is a huge undertaking. Even trying to do it by hand subjects the owner to the trap inside. Thus, the Maintenance Mummy was created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With stats for the Savage Worlds, Ingenium, and &amp;AElig;ther systems, this whimsical addition to a dungeon solves a long-time question in fantasy role-playing: how is everything still even working?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
