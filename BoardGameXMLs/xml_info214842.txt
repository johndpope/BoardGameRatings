							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughter at Splinterfang Gorge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years ago a brutal bugbear chieftain united the goblinoid tribes of the Meirlara Forest and nearly wiped out all traces of the elves there within.  A stroke of chance fate turned the tide and the dreaded bugbear warlord Spragnokk was defeated.  His loyal kin hid his body away in a sealed chamber and then the world forgot about Spragnokk... until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now his bloodline continues, and they have plans to resurrect their fallen &amp;quot;great chieftain,&amp;quot; to bring ruin and revenge upon the elves that handed them defeat decades past.  The goblinoid tribes have once more been gathered, and their bloody revenge is imminent, except fate has yet once more placed new champions to stand in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They just don't realize it yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slaughter at Splinterfang Gorge is a challenging, 70-page adventure for an average party level of 5, but suitable for 4th to 6th level characters.  Encounters also include scaling advice to fully challenge more powerful characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is also in a dual-stat format, fully suitable for either the Pathfinder(TM) or fifth edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons(TM) roleplaying games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
