			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Readers can imagine themselves as the main character of this interactive story, a girl who has her eye on a super-fun costume for a party, but can&amp;rsquo;t afford it. To earn a little money, she starts her own business doing things like hosting bake sales and making deliveries. Her friends think her business is such a smart idea that they want to join in, too&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;ll be fun to work together! But when they start bickering about the right way to do business, she wonders just how smart her idea was. Can she save the business and her friendships? And when she finds out that one of her friends needs money much more than she does, can she find a way to help? With more than 20 different endings, girls can enjoy this book again and again to see how different decisions change the story. This book comes with a limited-time access code to innerstarU.com&amp;mdash;an interactive online world&amp;mdash;plus, a secret access code for even more endings online!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
