			<description>The gameboard is long and oval-shaped, and the 100 playing spaces are narrow and angled. The basic rules of race games are still used, however, with turns missed and players moving backwards and forwards as directed. This particular game is played anticlockwise. The game has five fences with a fallen horse and rider at the second. The centre illustration and the corners depict the race goers, the grandstand, coaches, horses and men and women.  In each of the corners is a scene from a horse race and in the space between the start and the finish the scene of gathering the horses ready for the race with the starter and his flag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
