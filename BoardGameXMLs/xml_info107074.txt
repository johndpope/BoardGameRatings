			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This XBLA release brings forth a bare-bones digital representation of the classic boardgame, Shogi. Westerners will probably feel most comfortable comparing it to chess. It features much of the same jargon, and come familiar moves. However, there are even more rules to keep in mind while playing it. Since that is the case, this game offers an ample selection of tutorials. Players can choose between two different backgrounds and playing piece designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played as a single-player vs AI in a tournament structure. It can also be played vs a live opponent, either locally or via the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
