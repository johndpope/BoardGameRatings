			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you want to fight the undead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We introduced The Holy Knight to rid the world of evil in the name of the gods. But even a blessed warrior of all things good and pure needs a bit of tactical help every now and then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garret's Guide to the Undead is the first guide pulled together from the notes of Sir Garret Thom. Without Sir Thom, the civilized world would have been much darker and under the yoke of its vampiric oppressors. His followers saw fit to pull his wisdom together for future generations of knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garret's Guide to the Undead details nine different types of undead as well as some rumors and theories that may have slipped in over the years. Use this content as a player or referee (GM) for your Mazes &amp;amp; Perils campaign or adapt it for use with your favorite OSR fantasy system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
