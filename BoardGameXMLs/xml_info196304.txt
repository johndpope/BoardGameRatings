							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Entropy Game</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds in phased turns, with players taking sequential actions.  The player with focus is known as the Now-Coordinator of Entropy and makes a narrative contribution, subsequently transferring play to the next player by utilizing a key phrase.  Another player may interrupt the process using other specific key phrases.  Attempts may be met with rejection which confers (minor) physical punishment on the offender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free-form game would probably best be utilized by players already familiar with storytelling systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
