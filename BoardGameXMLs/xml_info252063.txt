			<description>Laplace is a two-player abstract strategy game in which your goal is to play all of your pieces before the opponent can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 7x7 grid, and the players each have pieces of a different color. A piece of a third color is placed in the central square on the game board. On a turn, a player places one of their pieces into an empty space on the grid. If a player creates a square of four pieces and at least three of those pieces belong to that same player, then the player immediately places another piece on top of those four pieces; if the placement of that piece also creates a square meeting the same condition, then they place a piece on top of that square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, as more pieces are placed, they collectively form a pyramid, with the bottom layer being 7x7, then the next layer 6x6, and so on. Whoever places their final piece first wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in Laplace is identical to that of Upper Hand, but with the action taking place on a larger initial playing area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
