							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1558: Hanfrieds Erbe</name>
									
			<description>The players are brought into the year 1558 and face each other as citizens and students. With strategy and a little luck they try to push through their interests in the blossoming university town of Jena.&lt;br/&gt;Designer Prof. Ingo Alth&amp;ouml;fer developed &amp;ldquo;1558 - Hanfrieds inheritance&amp;rdquo; exclusively for the Jenaer university's 450 year anniversary. A short game, not only for the break between two lectures. Printed on ecological hemp cloth. Unusually packed in a silver aluminum cylinder. Limited Edition.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;The special reason for using hemp cloth for the board was a word joke (hemp = Hanf in German): Hanfried == Han(f)fried == Hanf-Fried. The price of the game was exactly 15.58 Euro, motivated by the year 1558 when Jena University was founded.&lt;br/&gt; Information from the designer: I realized one very personal copy with wooden board (instead of hemp cloth) where the (neutral) Hanfried piece is a real silver coin. Two pictures of this item are found in the picture gallery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
