							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Op Tile</name>
									
			<description>Op Tile is aimed at adults, unlike most of Schaper's line.  The main equipment is a set of plastic tiles in various rectangular shapes and sizes (also in different colors, but this has no effect on play).  Players get tiles via die roll and place them on individual boards in an effort to cover as many spaces as possible and to get the high-scoring tiles on bonus multiplier spaces.  There are action cards to add some variety (place a tile on an opponent's board, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No publishing date is printed on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
