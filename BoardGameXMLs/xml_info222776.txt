							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Back to the Dungeon Role Playing Game Book 5: Other Classes and Races</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greeting mere mortals and have a seat! Here have a flagon of mead and light up your pipe. SO what is this game Back to the Dungeon RPG? IS it a blatant challenge to the &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; Fantasy RPGs out there? NO It is not. It cannot be. I am just a guy with a computer and access to a laser printer and sometimes copy machines. IT is just MY set of house rules of how I want to run a game. Simple and easy rules with great stories and action and adventure! Many class and race options all in a simple framework. Try this game out as your &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; fantasy game when you have nothing prepped or when not everyone shows up for the main game. With less rules and more options to try, it might just become your new game. This book features a few fantastic races by the very talented RPG Blogger Charlie Warren! It also includes rules for Psions and Warlocks! Make sure and check out the SLAYER! A deadly class inspired by heavy metal album covers, dark lyrics and the forces of Chaos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
