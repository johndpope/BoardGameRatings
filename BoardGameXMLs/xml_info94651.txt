			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Ordinary People, a game about, you guessed it, ordinary people. &amp;quot;Why,&amp;quot; you ask, &amp;quot;would I want to play a game about Ordinary People? I AM an ordinary person, and I certainly wouldn't want to play a game about me.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ordinary People is about ordinary people in extraordinary, and extraordinarily dangerous, situations. It's not a game about a group of office workers, or a family on a cruise. It's a game about officer workers when a group of terrorists breaks takes over the office, and they have to fight for their lives to escape, possibly thwarting the terrorists in the process. It's a game about a family of four on a cruise, when the ship is hijacked by pirates, or perhaps the ship sinks and they wind up stranded on a deserted island alone. Or not so alone...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ordinary People, you start as a normal person with normal skills and hobbies, and your game master throws you into dangerous situations where you either grow, learn to use your skills in new ways, and persevere, or flounder and probably die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this game, you will need a group of friends, this document, copies of the character sheet from the end, and 2 d10 dice (ideally per person), used as percentile dice to make all the rolls in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
