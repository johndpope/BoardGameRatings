			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cubicity is a 2D physics-based puzzle game. You play the role of Seamus, a curious guy who can't seem to keep himself out of trouble. Help him figure out how to make it home in one piece!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cubicity offers unique gameplay: Seamus can't fly, but he never touches the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead, he hangs by a rope and harness as he maneuvers his way through 60 challenging levels across 5 worlds. He'll need to acquire new weapons and learn new strategies in order to solve the increasingly difficult puzzles that block his path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part action/adventure, part puzzle/strategy, you'll need to be both smart and quick-fingered to reach the end. Are you up for the challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Find your way through 60 new brain-twisting levels.&lt;br/&gt;    Explore five different worlds using new weapons.&lt;br/&gt;    You can play the pc version using your xbox controller.&lt;br/&gt;    Achievements system.&lt;br/&gt;    Enjoy The game support of HD graphics, 1080p+&lt;br/&gt;    You will have the opportunity to defeat the nefarious Dr. Shmeev Shmobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: while the game site and the Steam description promote the Xbox 360 controller compatibility, this game does work with keyboard &amp;amp; mouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
