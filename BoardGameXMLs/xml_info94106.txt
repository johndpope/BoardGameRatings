			<description>Treasure Mathstorm is an educational computer game intended to teach children mathematical problem solving. It is the unofficial sequel to Treasure Mountain!.&lt;br/&gt;The Master of Mischief has used a weather machine to freeze Treasure Mountain. To thaw it, the player must collect sufficient treasures using snowballs.&lt;br/&gt;The mountain, as in Treasure Mountain!, is divided into three levels. Unlike the previous game, to advance to the next level, the player has to complete various challenges- the first relating to telling time, the second to inequalities and basic algebra, and the final simple computation.&lt;br/&gt;Snowbullies, evil flying snowballs, serve as the main antagonists.&lt;br/&gt;Once the player reaches the mountain's peak, they find themselves in a room with The Master of Mischief sitting in a chair inside. The player obtains a treasure from an elf and then jumps out of the window. The player then puts the treasure on a shelf inside the starting cave and can then go up the mountain again until the treasure chest is full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Treasure Mathstorm!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
