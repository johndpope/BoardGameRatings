			<description>The game is based on the film Finding Nemo, specifically scene in which the father tries to get Nemo back. Players play as Nemo&amp;rsquo;s father and need to collect the words &amp;ldquo;M A R L I N&amp;rdquo; in order. This is a print and play game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, a 6 sided dice is rolled to determine the movement of father. Then players should collect the words &amp;ldquo;M A R L I N&amp;rdquo; in order. The player hove to land exactly on the words, not pass through them. You can&amp;rsquo;t return the way. If you pass through jellyfish, you have to miss a turn. When you reach Nigel&amp;rsquo;s box, roll the dice to the goal. With odd numbers, you can finish. But with even numbers, you have to move to seagull box. The player that reaches Nemo first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
