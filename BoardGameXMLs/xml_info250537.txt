			<description>An abstract shape matching and spatial reasoning game for anyone who can be trusted with scissors. &lt;br/&gt;Players take turns cutting out shapes from scrap paper and fitting them into existing shapes without going over the lines. Points are scored by fitting into existing shapes while covering over your opponents shapes. Points are lost by going over the edges and being covered over. First player to 10 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
