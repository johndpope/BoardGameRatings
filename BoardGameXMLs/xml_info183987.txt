							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Power Dome</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While hiking in the wooded mountains of Oregon with a friend, you come upon something that's really out-of-this-world. A glowing dome, purple and translucent, just big enough for one person. You can't contain your curiosity. But when you touch it, you fall through to another time, far in the future, when humans are kept as slaves by a menacing race of aliens. Your only chance to escape is back through the dome, but you can't get there while you're in captivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you try to explain who you really are and ask for your master's mercy? Should you try to slip away and find the way back to the Power Dome on your own? Maybe you should lead a revolt and inspire all the other humans not to take it anymore. What will you do? What &amp;quot;can&amp;quot; you do? Read and find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
