			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low rolling hills dominate the landscape far and wide, some larger than others and often apparently arranged in groups. The latter might be hard to notice though as many of these low hills and the ground in between them are partially overgrown by trees. Much more noticeable are the columns of stone slabs surrounding some of these hills and topping others. What few know these days is, that below the trees, stone columns and the long grass every one of this hills is a grave, containing heroes of old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often these heroes were buried among their ancestors or at least as close bye as was possible which would explain the grouping of the grave hills. On more than a few occasions they were buried with slaves or servants. Sometimes even with their whole families and countless riches for their afterlives. Not everyone interred here with their lords or relatives was buried out of their own free will though, leading to stories of the restless dead haunting this place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
