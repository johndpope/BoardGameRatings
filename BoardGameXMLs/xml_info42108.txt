			<description>Artifakes is a humor game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  Two players portray destitute archaeologists burying their own items, trying to scam their way out of debt through duplicitous dealings with the museum's chief inspector.  First, the players seed the ruins of Stonehenge with their worthless junk, then they take turns calling the inspector to dig sites, artificially valuing their own artifacts, while rightfully debunking their opponent's.  Your &amp;quot;finds&amp;quot; grant you points, and everything of yours that the inspector approves is just another thing that can go back into the ground to be dug up tomorrow!  That worthless junk your opponent shoved into the ground gets tossed into a trash heap, never to be profited from again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
