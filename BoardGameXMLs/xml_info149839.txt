			<description>Each round in Befuddled, you roll 14 word dice and try to find words before a timer runs out. A special die rolled at the same time determines the minimum word length for that round; at the same time, special &amp;quot;shake-it-up&amp;quot; cards add restrictions, e.g., forbidding the use of an &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; to make words plural, removing two letter cubes from the current roll, or playing a round with your opposite hand. Each word that you alone create out of the rolled letters is worth one point if it's exactly as long as the minimum word length; longer words are worth more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who first passes a point threshold &amp;mdash; or alternatively, the player with the highest score after a predetermined number of rounds &amp;mdash; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
