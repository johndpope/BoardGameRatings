			<description>Power hungry politicians, bold and brazen criminals and the full arm of the law all come together in this back-stabbing, bullet-flying card game about law and order in South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life can be tough in the streets of South Africa for those on the right side of the law. You may be a politician elected into position on the promise of cleaning up the streets. You will need the help of other politicians and the combined forces of the law to rid your region of its 10 major crimes. If you do it before time runs out you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those on the wrong side of the law, life can be equally tough, fighting the law and trying to scratch a living. You may be a criminal seeking to expand your empire on the streets of South Africa. You need to work against the law keepers to keep crime out there before time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is assigned a secret identity. Either a politician or a criminal. A starting hand of 6 cards is dealt to each player. There are 10 separate crime cards, each with a negative value. Theses are turned over one at a time until solved. Crimes are solved by placing positive cards from your hand on top of the negative crime card until the number reaches 0 or greater. However, their are negative valued cards as well that delay the process and 12 special cards with various functions. The criminals have ample opportunity to delay the process of crime solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the 10 crime cards are solved before all the cards run out, the politicians win. Otherwise, the criminal (or criminals) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
