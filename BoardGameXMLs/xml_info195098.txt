			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merlin Ambrosius, adviser to King Arthur, sired by an incubus, is said to be wizard, druid, priest, prophet, bard, and madman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merlin was not a man of combat, although he certainly had the powers to punish those who would attack him - he could enchant his foes, cause them to sleep, summon the aid of dragons, and raise a deep fog; however, he was not one for flashy fireballs or bolts of magical energy. He saw his role as one of advice and influence, aiding King Arthur time and time again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
