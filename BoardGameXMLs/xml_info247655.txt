			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no! There goes Tokyo!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Surbrook, Evil Beagle's resident scholar and master-of-cleverness, turns his gaze to another region of popular culture as he explores the genre launched by 1954's Them! Irradiated monstrocities are a whole new kind of challenge for your heroes, coming from an old-yet-still-compelling source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic Monsters is a concise, easy-to-consume, immediately useful treatise on how to create and use freakish monsters from atomic nightmares in your campaign. Sections include - &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    It Came from Beneath the Sea: Where do these things come from?&lt;br/&gt;    Them! What are these things, what do they want, and what do they eat?&lt;br/&gt;    Crush, Crumble, and Stomp: The weapons of the beast!&lt;br/&gt;    And much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael finishes up by giving you three sample creatures in Hero System 6th stats to launch at your heroes and ruin their world - Atomic Wasps, a Giant Sea Scorpion, and Radioactive Sentient Slime Mold (from Space)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
