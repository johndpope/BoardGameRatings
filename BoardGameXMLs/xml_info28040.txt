			<description>The aim of the game is to be the first player/team to successfully complete a given route across the board. Each player receives a Route Planner card which determines start and finish points, which may be on the same track or different ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a d8 for movement and must travel along one of six tracks, each of which represents a different style of puzzle or problem. Where different tracks cross a player may change routes by successfully answering a question from any of the tracks that intersect there. Players have to change tracks at least three times during the game, even if their given route both starts and finishes on the same track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six tracks or Lines correspond to different types of puzzles or problems, the idea behind the game being to develop and test different thought processes. The six lines are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sequence Line - the puzzle here is to identify the missing part of a sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Code line - here one has to break a code or cipher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Process line - the aim here is to take in the information at speed and to deduce the correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Memory line - here a player is given a look at a card with a variety of information on it, and is then quizzed on a particular aspect of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Perception line - similar to the memory line, problems here relate to observational skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lateral line - an exercise in lateral thinking regarding the subject detailed on the card. A player has to identify a series of objects that are related to the card's subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these puzzles and problems are subject to a time limit -  a sand timer with a 30s limit is included in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains a board, six decks of 40 cards, one for each line, 15 Route Planner cards, 25 Risk It cards (which may be played when landing on a Risk It board space and have both beneficial and unhelpful effects), and six sets of playing pieces and counters to mark when a player has changed lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
