			<description>Ufo Bub is a game that combines arcade, skill and a large dose of humor, winning the heart of kids and not-so-kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bub is a little and scary martian whose main hobby is to tune his asspace battleship, but he can't find the part he is looking for. One day he found what he thought to be an antenna part, but which turned not to be so. Now the evil army is on his hunt with not-so-good intentions... or that we think as they are blowing his ship to pieces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ufo Bub we must help our little friend to defeat all the enemies on his way, including evil bosses who rule each territory. Only then we will be able to recover the lost parts for Bub to repair his ship and fly away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
