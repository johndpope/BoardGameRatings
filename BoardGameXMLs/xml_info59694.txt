			<description>In this game, insects (from the popular children's classic &amp;quot;Biene Maja&amp;quot;) try to reach a leaf in the middle of the playing area. The cardboard figurines are propelled by air - each player has a beehive with a hole at the bottom rim. When he or she hits the hive with a hand, it contracts and air is pushed out, propelling the figurines towards the target (or beyond, so the player has to run around the table to try again from the other side).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
