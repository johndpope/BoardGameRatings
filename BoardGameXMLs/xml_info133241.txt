			<description>Author's tagline&lt;br/&gt;A human astronaut has crashed on an alien planet. He or she is trying to repair his or her spaceship and get home. Meanwhile, the natives of the planet have their own crisis. What will happen when these cultures collide?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;One player takes the astronaut role, the others play the natives. To represent the language barrier, the astronaut talks gibberish and has to rely on body language and vocal tone to get his intentions across. He needs the help of the natives to repair his damaged ship, but to the natives, he is an interruption of their day-to-day lifes, and may even be seen as the reason for a mythological crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
