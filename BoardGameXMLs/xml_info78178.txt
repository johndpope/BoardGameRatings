			<description>Aaargh! is a video game released in 1988 in which the player controls a giant monster, either an ogre or a lizard, with the goal of crushing and destroying everything in its path across different lands and periods of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to find five Roc's eggs hidden among the destroyed scenery. Once an egg was discovered, the two monsters would fight for possession of the egg in a one-on-one battle. When five eggs are found, the monsters make their way to the volcano, working their way around the lava flows to reach the top and claim the Golden Egg for the ultimate victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is inspired by the arcade game Rampage and was designed for Mastertronic's Arcadia Systems, an arcade machine based around the custom hardware of the Amiga, making its eventual conversion to that machine relatively straightforward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Aaargh!,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
