							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The St. Franks Football Game</name>
									
			<description>An extraordinary game.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on any reasonable sized table. 2, 4 or 6 players can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This must be a forerunner of football games like Subbuteo. But, instead of little footballers that you flick, in this game you where the football boots. The diagram illustrates this rather well. You kick the ball literally with your boot-encased finger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow for free kicks, throw-ins and penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a warning that your boot fingers must be on the table at all times, so that should be very friendly with six players, three a side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
