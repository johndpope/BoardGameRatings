			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mercenaries all nodded their agreement. Dahn&amp;rsquo;tyu spoke up. &amp;ldquo;Maybe we can lure the big ones out, into this cafeteria. If we can take them out in small groups, we should prevail. The smaller ones do not seem to be much of a threat, but I am uncertain about the bloated one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dahn&amp;rsquo;tyu reached out with his psionic powers. &amp;ldquo;I do not detect any movement throughout that ventilation system, nor do I hear any scratching on the other side of the door. I do not believe they are aware of our presence. We should proceed with the plan and take out as many as we can in this room. The bloated one did not look small enough to fit through the door.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mercenaries nodded their agreement. &amp;ldquo;I can lure them out with my handflamer. It should startle them enough to at least investigate,&amp;rdquo; said Sthol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Mercenary Breed 2.0!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercenary Breed is a science fiction action and adventure toolkit and sandbox setting for Legend.
