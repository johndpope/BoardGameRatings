			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working for a salvage company as a reclamation technician is rarely a dull job. Most of the time you&amp;rsquo;re diving into waters to recover something that belongs to someone else, because you were paid to retrieve it or because there&amp;rsquo;s profit in recovering and selling it. But that water is never the beautiful, peaceful, shallow sea you see on holovids. It&amp;rsquo;s too deep for casual salvagers to attempt, or in waters teeming with dangerous creatures, or located in areas frequented by violent insurgents or protected by Incorporate soldiers. Any way you look at it, it&amp;rsquo;s not an easy job. So when a client shows up at your door with a fairly simple job, you jump on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The client in this case was a bottlenose dolphin who went by the name of Surfjumper. She was a courier and transporter, specializing in delivering small cargoes discreetly. Her latest job was hauling a cargo pod of scientific monitoring equipment and the resulting data from a small island about 700 kilometers north of Second Try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The haul went without incident until approximately 62 kilometers south of Summer Island, a lesser white appeared at the extreme edge of her echolocation and assumed a hunting pattern. Surfjumper attempted to lose the white by using the terrain, but she couldn&amp;rsquo;t maneuver quickly enough with the cargo pod. She dumped the cargo pod, noting the coordinates, and proceeded to evade the white. However, when she circled back, the white had returned to the area where she dumped the pod. It refused to leave the area, forcing her to abandon the cargo pod and seek help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being an independent courier, she had no resources to call on, so she came to your company to hire you to retrieve the cargo pod for her. She will pay the standard rate plus danger money, even if the white is no longer in the area. The water is just over 600 meters deep, which is not that bad. All you have to do is return the pod to her at Dock Berth 94 in Second Try as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy money, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
