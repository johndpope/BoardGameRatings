			<description>Winner of a Major FUN Award, and more recently a Dr Toy ~ Best Picks for 2008 Award...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triagonal can be played and won in several ways...&lt;br/&gt; Win by forming a line of tiles or, by forming a large 3 x 3 x 3 Triangle of 9 tiles or, if the board goes through to completion, by winning the majority of board sectors ~ plus any Bonus points you may have earned during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several other different games to play too, all of which can be played on our unique board including ~ one game which plays without the board at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing any of the 'Die Included' game option:&lt;br/&gt;Players require some die throwing luck, but also, planning skills to place their won sector formers into the board to their best advantage and without leaving openings for opponents to gain from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With skill and being observant, a player on their turn could win one or several sectors from their die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus Points:&lt;br/&gt;Players can earn themselves 'Five' bonus points for Each (and every) Hexagon formed in their colour tiles.&lt;br/&gt;Bonus points are added to the 'Final Tile Count' and could dramatically change the outcome of who actually wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What mood are you in today.?:&lt;br/&gt;Choose a game option to suit your mood... Using None, One or Both custom die for different types of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are Seven Game Options on the game box and 'More' additional FREE game options which can be downloaded from the publisher's website. &lt;br/&gt;Note: The additional game playing options were created after the game had been produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game playing options include:&lt;br/&gt;Pure Strategy, Chance, Quick, Solo, Team, Gambling (Fun or Real), Line Em Up 4 to 7, How Many (requires maths), Pass Over (no board), Exchange and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Include Exchange into your game and you could Turn Back Time by exchanging opponents tiles for your own, and maybe obtain that lost five point hexagon or even instantly win the game..!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whichever option you choose to play:&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for the Instant Win, Bonus Hexagon and Line Forming opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triagonal can accommodate 1 to 4 players Ages 5 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play Triagonal almost anywhere because game pieces are located and retained in the board during play but, are instantly cleared ready for the next challenging game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Triagonal components are injection molded:&lt;br/&gt;Including the white triangular game board, 84 black Sector Formers, 120 Scoring Tiles (30 of each in red, yellow, blue and green).
