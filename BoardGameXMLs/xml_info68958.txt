			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pull the Plug on Granny is a strategic game simulating the American health care reform debate of 2009-2010.  One player plays the Democrats and one plays the Republicans.  The Democrats win by creating a bill with a sufficient number of agenda items on it (each element of the bill has a certain number of Agenda Points), and having enough congressional support for the bill to pass.  The Republican player wins by preventing one or both of those things from happening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pull the Plug on Granny uses the basic CDG mechanic from Twilight Struggle.  It was designed from the ground up as a print and play, with a small board and a short deck.  Rules and game combined will take 15 pages, and if you have some card sleeves around, you can probably be playing in under an hour for just the cost of the ink and paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
