			<description>A game of Chess for 3 players, Noris Schach (Noris Chess) is played on a hexagonal board divided into triangular cells, with a bight of 5 cells taken out of every other side, leaving a total of 106 triangles and three corner areas of the board where pieces will begin from.  Each player has the normal complement of Chess pieces, but for an extra Pawn and another piece called the Cardinal, which moves like a Queen but cannot capture and can only be captured under narrowly defined circumstances involving both other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is then played according to the usual rules of Chess, but for the complications of an extra player and additional directions of movement resulting from the triangular cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
