							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ravensburger Spiele Minis: Mausefalle</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Spiele Minis&amp;quot; is a series of small surprise boxes (i.e., you don't know what you get) from Ravensburger. They are meant to be carry-on or gifts, suitable for children (&amp;quot;Mitbringspiel&amp;quot;). Some of the cubes contain actual games, others contain magic tricks, puzzles etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player holds a cup while the others have a mouse by the tail (they are in the middle of the table touching by their noses). Then the player holding the cup rolls a die and must quickly catch the mouse of the color indicated by de die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the player with the corresponding mouse can move his mouse trying to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player holding the cup catches the mouse, they receive a victory point. If not, it is gained by the player owner of the mouse (who will have the cup now).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If another &amp;quot;mouse&amp;quot; moves its owner must move around the table in 4 feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player reaches 5 victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
