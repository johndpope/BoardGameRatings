							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flames of Freedom: The Philadelphia Affair</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers web site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spring, 1776. Boston is free. The Second Continental Congress works to create a new nation. But as they debate, shadowy forces prepare to strike back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Philadelphia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;William Penn's model city is one of the richest in the Thirteen Colonies. It stands at the heart of the Revolution. Home to book shops, thinkers, and a growing intellectual class, the city hides those with knowledge of a more questionable nature. With the leadership of the Revolution here, the city is awash with plots, and dangers. It is here that many plots are about to meet - and it is far from certain who will stand the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Philadelphia Affair is the second volume in the epic Flames of Freedom campaign for Colonial Gothic. In this book you will find our guide to the great city and a ready-to-play adventure which takes up the Heroes' story after the events of Boston Besieged. As Congress works, the Heroes scour the City of Brotherly Love for a friend's missing son. Not all is as it appears, and soon their simple assignment turns into a race against time - to prevent a tragedy that could kill the American independence before it has even begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Richard Iorio II and maps by Gabriel Brouillard (Colonial Gothic: New France and Under Pashuvanam's Lush), The Philadelphia Affair is your guide to the colonies most important city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
