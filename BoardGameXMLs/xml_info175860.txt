			<description>Barricado is an abstract strategy game of tile placement and area control. Each turn, players get to choose between controlling the layout of the board (by placing a tile) or claiming territory (by placing lines of tokens). The player's goal is to connect dots of their own color with a line of tokens to block other players from doing the same and to end up with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The layout of the board and the barricades built upon it is always different on each play-through, as each player's strategy (and the number of players) affects the others. Optional rules can adjust play time for different audiences, as well as provide for expanded strategy for advanced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
