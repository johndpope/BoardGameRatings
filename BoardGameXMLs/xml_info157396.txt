			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of The Legend of Zelda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've been following the craziness of Ludem Dare for a while, and kept hoping some of my free time would line up with one.  Well, it just so happened that last weekend there was a 48 hour mini-jam that coincided with a relatively calm weekend.  I decided to jump in and see about cranking out a game.  Due to some amazing weather I ended up spending about half the weekend outside doing yard work, and worked on this game when I needed a break from the weeds.The theme of the jam was &amp;quot;de-makes&amp;quot; which meant all the participants were invited to re-make a game of their choosing in a low-fidelity, low-tech or otherwise deconstructed format.  After kicking the idea around in my head for a while, I decided to de-make the original Legend of Zelda.  My de-make would be to rebuild the game, but with a viewport of just 16 x 16 pixels.  No interpolation, no cheating, just 16 x 16 blocks of one color each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To figure out if this crazy idea even made sense, I did some tests in photoshop to make sure the various pages of the world map would fit into the 16 x 16 limit.  Fortunately the Zelda map screens are all a tile grid of 16 x 10 tiles.  This fits nicely into my limit with a few pixels to spare for the status area at the top.  The final content actually fits into a 16 x 14 pixel rectangle, so I beat my limit by 32 pixels!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
