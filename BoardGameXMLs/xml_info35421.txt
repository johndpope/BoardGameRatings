			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nasty ticks in big burgers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tasty hamburger ingredients are placed on the table. Each player gets four ingredients on his hand and tries to build delicious burgers which get high scores. But hey, what's that? There's a tick between the ingredients. Try to get rid of it as fast as possible. Put it in a burger and hope that no one notices. Fortunately you also can put it in an opponent's burger. But he may give you his burger then and you mustn't refuse that nice 'gift'.&lt;br/&gt;Bluff: Place your ingredients face-down on the table. So no one knows if it's cheese, salad, onions or a little tick. When your opponent gives you that burger, you'll get extra-score. Find the right strategy and the right face-expression to convince your opponents. When the cards are turned face-up, it's getting funny. Tick-Burger is a funny mixture of strategy, chance and bluff for the whole family.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
