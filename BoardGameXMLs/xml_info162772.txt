							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heritage of the Egyptian Gods</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock a New Kind of Mythic Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, your character&amp;rsquo;s mythic path tells you about the kinds of abilities in which he specializes, and perhaps even gives some clue as to his ultimate mythic destiny, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about where he came from, and what made him mythic in the first place. For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic rules allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book centers on the heritage of the Egyptian gods, which represents characters whose mythic power comes from one or more of the deities in that ancient and mysterious pantheon. Characters with this mythic heritage can gain abilities associated with any of the ten deities in the pantheon, and each deity has three such path abilities, for a total selection of no less than 30 mythic abilities. Bend others to your will with the power of Horus, god of the pharaohs. Destroy undead abominations with the power of Osiris, god of the underworld. Blind your enemies with your radiance using the power of Ra, god of the sun. All this power, and more, can be yours to command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
