							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure Time: The Epic Gassy Jake Game</name>
									
			<description>A Gassy twist to the fun game of Hot Potato Game. Soft plush Jake doll with 4 different electronic &amp;quot;pooting&amp;quot; sounds. Great for both indoor &amp;amp; outdoor play. Quickly toss Gassy Jake from player to player and don't be caught holding Jake as he emits his gassy sounds. If you do, your out. There are 4 electronic &amp;quot;pooting&amp;quot; sounds emitted by randomized timer. So you don't know when the sounds are going to be automatically activated. The featured authentic sounds are &amp;quot;as heard on&amp;quot; the actual show episodes. There are several ways to play for different skill levels. WARNING:: THIS GAME IS CAPABLE OF MAKING YOU LAUGH UNCONTROLLABLY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
