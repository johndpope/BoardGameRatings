							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deck Plans #1: Klingon G1 Gunboat</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the pack:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Klingon G1 gunboat is a workhorse of the Deep Space Fleet. Used during the General War as a patrol ship, and for base and planet defense, it found a second lifetime of service after the war. Thousands of these were sold off (most without their weapons) for use as survey, asteroid mining, or planetary prospecting craft as the galactic economy boomed and the demand for new resources escalated. This pack includes complete 22x35: plans for the upper and lower deck (with both square and hex-based playing areas) plus a third sheet showing variants and special purpose models of the basic G1 design. Completely compatible with all forms of Traveller including GURPS Traveller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes complete crew of 27 warriors from nine different planets of the Klingon Empire!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
