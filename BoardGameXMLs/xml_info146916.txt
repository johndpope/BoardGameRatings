			<description>The turkeys on the farm are feasting away, but they must be careful! When Thanksgiving comes around, those turkeys that have made the deepest impression on the farm owner make perfect candidates to appear on the Thanksgiving dinner table. Would you, as a turkey in this game, be able to pig out with all that yummy food, but without becoming a dish yourself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Turkey Day! is a simultaneous-move game with each player taking the role of a voracious turkey. In the beginning of each round, each player takes one of the Action tokens in his/her hands, and places it, face down, on the playing surface in front of him/her. Then, all players turn over their tokens simultaneously and take an action: either grabbing some Food from a Hen House (i.e. Eat), or exercising to trim down a bit&lt;br/&gt;(i.e. Lose Weight).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two goals in this game: first, getting a balanced diet by obtaining a variety of different Food cards &amp;ndash; the wider the variety and the more the Food cards a player gets, the better the score; at the same time, each player should try to avoid getting marked Chubby whenever the Farm Owner makes an inspection to identify candidates for his Thanksgiving turkey dinner. At each inspection, the chubbiest turkey (as indicated by the highest number of Food cards held) will be given Chubby Markers. When Thanksgiving comes around, the turkey with the most Chubby Markers will be sent to the dinner table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of Thanksgiving, the survival turkey with the highest score wins! How to collect as many Food cards as possible, while avoiding getting Chubby Markers, is the key to winning this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
