			<description>The Crazy Credit Card Game!&lt;br/&gt;Charge It! plays like real life. Big spenders bargain hunters and cash savers all have fun shopping and spending rolling the dice and moving around the board. Vacations, TVs and concert tickets are just a few of the possibilities to charge when players qualify for the Quik Charge, American Success, Recover and Bold Credit Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decide how to divide the payday cash between expenses, credit card debts or savings. Shoppers beware - it is easy to get caught in the alluring trap of unlimited purchasing power. Debts can pile up and the bank may revoke credit cards if payments are not made on time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Charge is to acquire the right combination of &amp;quot;paid up&amp;quot;  credit cards, purchased items and cash.  There may be some players who believe it is un-wise to have many credit cards.  Some may fail to get good credit.  These players may choose to win with one credit card, one purchased Item and $4,000 cash.  Can you guess how the other players will try to win?  Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
