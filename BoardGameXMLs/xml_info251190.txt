							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Desert Sabre: the Operation Desert Storm Ground Campaign</name>
									
			<description>Desert Sabre is a light, fast-playing solitaire or team-play game of the Allied Coalition ground campaign in Operation Desert Storm to liberate Kuwait, defeat the Iraqi Army and Republican Guard, and seize key objectives to compell Iraq's removal from Kuwait in February 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played on a small (7x7 hexes) map of southern Iraq and Kuwait, the game includes 10 units representing select U.S. and Allied divisions, regiments and task forces.  Iraqi units are not included, as the challenges the Allies faced advancing into Iraq and Kuwait are represented by a &amp;quot;C3I&amp;quot; die-roll to move mechanism of increasing difficulty as Allied units advance, reach key phase lines, and attempt to occupy up to 10 objectives on the map within four one-day turns (a fifth turn may be enabled by die-roll). Primarilly designed for solo play, up to three players can seperately maneuver the three main Allied higher commands: XVIII Corps, VII Corps, and the Allied and Marine joint task forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaching historical objectives will result in an Allied operational victory (taking about 6 objectives).  Players may explore, at the risk of adverse &amp;quot;pol-mil effects&amp;quot; rolls, reaching additional objectives that offer prospects for a strategic victory.  As a quick set-up, quick-playing game, the player can readily replay history to explore chances for a different, historical, better (or worse) outcome to the last great ground offensive of the 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
