							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Ruins 2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a Modern Ruins, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;That building looks mostly intact, if we can reach it, maybe we can find some shelter in there!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Ruins Volume Two is an expansion to the Modern Ruins. The main features of the map are a brick covered vehicle in the northwest, a crushed car with no windows in the southeast, and two center buildings that are covered in rust. The center buildings appear somewhat intact on the outside, with some of the outer walls collapsed. Inside the buildings appear to have parts of the roof caved in. Some stairs are intact leading to what is left of the second level of the main building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in modern or post apocalyptic settings. This could also be used as a modern ruin found in a near or far future scientific setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center buildings have a lot of strange rust on them. Unlike the first modern ruins map, this area appears very dry except for the plants around the northwest car. The area could be affected by some sort of acid rain that has accelerated the growth of rust on the buildings and burns plant life it comes into contact with, making most of the plants a dying brown color. It does the same thing for animal life. The group could be caught up in an acid storm and forced to run to the center building. They find the roof mostly collapsed and are forced to huddle under some of the second level scaffolds that are still intact. Some complications could be those second level scaffolds falling down upon the group or something malicious that has evolved to live in the acid rain, such as a mutated humanoid that secretes a counter acid to survive in the acid storms and sees the group as an easy meal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
