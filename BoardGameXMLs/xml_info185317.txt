			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ForeSight is easy to learn, remember, and play...ForeSight is versatile...ForeSight keeps out of your way...ForeSight is about more than just combat...ForeSight runs lean and mean...ForeSight is definite (or at least not too vague)...ForeSight is the kind of role-playing game I want to play...This edition of ForeSight is the result of many years of play-testing and tinkering...ForeSight has one rule for resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assuming you know what a role-playing game is, in order to play ForeSight you really only need to learn one rule. It&amp;rsquo;s called resolution. A chapter of this book is devoted to this rule (don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s full of examples). Resolution is used when someone wants to do something (&amp;ldquo;perform a task&amp;rdquo;) and the game master (GM) doesn&amp;rsquo;t know for sure whether it&amp;rsquo;s completely impossible or incredibly easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resolution rule is used to determine the outcomes of tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
