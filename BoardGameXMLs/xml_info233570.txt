			<description>DinoHunter is a 2-4 player game with the goal of capturing dinosaurs loose on an island before your opponents.  Up to six dinosaurs can be captured using your colored dice as posts and your colored cards as high voltage electric fences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players roll five dice in a Yahtzee manner to match card from their hand.  With a match of dice to cards, players can play these sets to the island board to construct segments of electric fence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a fence completely surrounds a dinosaur or dinosaurs, the game ends. Players receive points for capturing the dinosaurs (5 points each), having cards as part of the enclosure (2 points) and dice as posts holding the cards (1 point each).  At games end, everyone scores, sometimes leading to a surprise winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games are lightning fast (5-10 minutes)with simple rules but surprising depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
