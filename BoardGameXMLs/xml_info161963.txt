							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Notorious Beer Game</name>
									
			<description>Adult board and beer drinking game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules: All players start at Home. Each player throws the dice, moves their piece, and follows the instructions in the box where they land. If you take a beer card, you must immediately carry out the task given on it, after which you place the card on the bottom of the deck. Each finger of beer that you drink (approx. 2cm) counts as one point. A Killer counts as five points if you empty the glass in one go, or three points if you take your time. If you ail a task, it will cost you five points. Leaving the table without the permission if the other players or beyond the scope of a task costs you ten points. The winner is the player with the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box contents: playing board, dice, 4 beer pieces (beer caps), and 32 beer cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
