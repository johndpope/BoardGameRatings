			<description>A Two-Round Living Greyhawk Duchy of Urnst Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the best of intentions can create the greatest of evils, and other times even the best laid plans can be thwarted easily. In both regards, this is one of those times. It is up to you to finish what others have started and rid the Duchy once and for all of one of its greatest evils. Be well prepared and willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish the greater goal. Sacrifice and loss are inevitable whenever great deeds are to be done, so be ready to give your all and be willing to do whatever it takes, and if you have a little more, it probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to bring it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two round module for APL 10-16 set in the Duchy of Urnst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this module requires a great deal of preparation and has a tendency to run long. Please allow for both of these circumstances. This module is recommended for a balanced APL party and should be approached with caution (if not avoided completely) by unbalanced or underpowered parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the conclusion to the Teranor story arc, as well as a finale to Mystic Bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
