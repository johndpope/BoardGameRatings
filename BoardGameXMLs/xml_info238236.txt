							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Comic Book Vigilante Archetypes Volume III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the Hero Your Game Deserves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vigilante from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Intrigue offers you the chance to play the sort of hero usually found only in comic books, and, in fact, many of the archetypes for the vigilante seem to be direct references to famous heroes from comic books. But while the existing options allow you to access a wide variety of power sets of existing super heroes, there are some major gaps in the vigilante&amp;rsquo;s offerings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents three new archetypes for vigilantes, each patterned off of one or more famous comic book superheroes. The miraculous savior always has the tools she needs to save the day, and can not only stop her foes in their tracks, but undo the damage they&amp;rsquo;ve done, to ensure a truly happy ending. The unseen wonder can make herself or others invisible, and can create telekinetic force objects to aid her in a variety of ways. Finally, the vengeful rider transforms into a frightening, flaming skeleton, and delivers white-hot vengeance from the back of a trusty steed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
