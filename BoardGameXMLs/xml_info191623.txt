			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1192. The Third Crusade is drawing to a close, many soldiers are returning home after years of warfare. Richard Lionheart, absentee King of England, has disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;England has suffered for years under the burden of the Third Crusade. Now it suffers again under the rule of King John. Tax collectors travel the countryside, hunting down every last farthing owed to the King. Knights hold the border lands through a mix of fear and mercenaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this greets you as you are discharged from the boats, members of an army that no longer needs you. Unable to return to society after what you have seen and done, you were looking towards life as a bandit or mercenary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thankfully, your life is destined for something more. You have been approached by those loyal to the King and offered a commission. You will go forth and remove those who act with treason in their hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are now one of the King's Men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
