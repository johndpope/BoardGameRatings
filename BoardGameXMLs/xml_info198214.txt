			<description>Shindra is a tactical 2-player boardgame opposing the gods of two civilizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to have more cards on the board showing your color than your opponent's at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game progresses with each player placing a card on a 4 by 4 grid and flipping the neighboring opponent's cards with a cascading effect. Once the grid is full, the player with the most cards in their color wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play a partnership game with 2 boxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
