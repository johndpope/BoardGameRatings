							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Cards</name>
									
			<description>Monster Cards is played by two (or possibly more) players, who make their own cards that contain the name of an object or concept (e.g. &amp;quot;a broken chromosome&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;butterflies in your stomach&amp;quot;) and a picture of the object or concept, which they then draw at random from their pile of creations and vote for which of the cards showing &amp;quot;wins&amp;quot; the confrontation. New cards can be added at any time so long as they are shuffled into the pile, and anything that can be imagined is suitable for a card, with the more specific and all-ending usually the better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectators are encouraged to chime in with their opinions and logic to convince others of who the victor should be. The winner takes both cards, and the players continue through until they feel they are finished. If a &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; occurs, and a decision cannot be made between the shown cards, players may either return their own cards to their hand, or agree to play a &amp;quot;tie-breaker&amp;quot; where they continue to play cards on top of the originals until a decision can be made, and the winner collects all the cards used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most cards by the end of the round wins, and all cards can be returned to their rightful owners, or the players can opt to &amp;quot;play for keeps&amp;quot; in which case players would keep all the cards they have acquired throughout the game to use in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
