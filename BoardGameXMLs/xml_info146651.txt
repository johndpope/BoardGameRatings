							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</name>
									
			<description>The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a science fiction video game in the X-COM series, developed by 2K Marin and released by 2K Games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on August 20, 2013 in North America. The game was in development under different titles by three different studios since 2006. It was unveiled as a first-person shooter titled XCOM in June 2010 and it has been repeatedly delayed and changed since then. In April 2013, the game was rebranded as The Bureau: XCOM Declassified in its final version of a third-person view tactical shooter with strategy video game elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the United States in 1962, the game tells the story of the CIA special agent William Carter, working for the United States Bureau of Strategic Emergency Command, tasked with investigating and stopping an extraterrestrial incursion on American soil, all while keeping it a secret and erasing all evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bureau is a third-person shooter with an emphasis on squad-based tactics. The player controls William Carter and commands two additional agents in each mission. Carter has his own unique abilities, but other agents are divided into the Commando, Engineer, Support, and Recon classes. By entering &amp;quot;Battle Focus Mode&amp;quot;, which slows time significantly, the player can order their agents to move to strategic positions and activate class-specific abilities. Agents have customizable outfits, weapons, equipment and abilities. As in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, soldiers will suffer from permanent death and if Carter is unable to revive agents who have taken too much damage, they will die (variable difficulty levels also determine whether or not it is possible for downed agents to become battle-ready when revived, or if replacement agents will appear during a mission).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Bureau: XCOM Declassified&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
