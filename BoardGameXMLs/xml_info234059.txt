			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again it&amp;rsquo;s time to let those adventurers get fat and lazy on the finer things. Good Baron Dave&amp;rsquo;s Catalog Of Sundries, Volume 3 is a free collection of items, services, building structures, and equipment. The good baron&amp;rsquo;s traveling merchants have been at it again and this time they&amp;rsquo;ve rounded up a massive collection of items for those wealthy characters to spend their dusty gold coins on. From the curious inventions of those gnome gear cutters to sturdy foundations that even the most seasoned stonemason would have to be proud of, there&amp;rsquo;s something in the catalog that would please even the most expensive of tastes. Stop spending all those nights sleeping on a strange bed, let go of that dragon&amp;rsquo;s hoard and buy your own inn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
