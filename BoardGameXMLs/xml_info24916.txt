			<description>This is an interesting game about the knight move in chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has the shape of a cross. The middle of the cross is the common zone, while the outer parts of the board are reserved as starting/ending section for specific players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 7 knights/horses and must try to bring them to the opposite side of the board. However, there are some instructions for that: all knights must cross the starting section before the can cross the common section and finally enter the ending section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movements are determined with the roll of a die, where the thrown number is the number of (chess-)knight moves that 1 single knight must perform in one turn. Starting and ending sections are save, but captures are allowed in the common zone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
