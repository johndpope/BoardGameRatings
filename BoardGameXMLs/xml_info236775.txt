			<description>The Black Plague Crossover Set is a Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buy that brings you over 50 cards to allow you to use a lot of the retail content from Zombicide: Black Plague in Massive Darkness. It will also allow you to use all of the Massive Darkness Heroes as Survivors in Zombicide: Black Plague!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, a Zombicide: Black Plague core box is necessary to use this content, and some of it requires a few of the expansion boxes. Please note this Crossover Set will not be available on retail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Plague Zombies as Massive Darkness Enemies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crossover Set includes 19 Guard cards to bring many Zombies as Mobs and Agents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Walkers from the Black Plague core box are a Mob, with a Fatty as the Boss.&lt;br/&gt;     Runners from the Black Plague core box are a Mob, with the Abomination as the Boss.&lt;br/&gt;     Necromancer from the Black Plague core box is an Agent.&lt;br/&gt;     Wolfz from the Wulfsburg expansion are a Mob, with the Wolfbomination as the Boss.&lt;br/&gt;     Deadeye Walkers are a Mob, using one sculpt as the Minions, and another as the Boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also 6 Roaming Monster cards to use the Abominations from the Zombie Bosses Abomination Pack:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Abominatroll&lt;br/&gt;     Ablobination&lt;br/&gt;     Abominotaur&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again, we are not including the Kickstarter Exclusive Abominations in the set, only those available on retail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Plague Survivors as Massive Darkness Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crossover Set comes with 15 Hero Cards to bring the main Black Plague Survivors as Heroes in Massive Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     6 Heroes from the Black Plague core box&lt;br/&gt;     4 Heroes from the Wulfsburg expansion&lt;br/&gt;     5 Heroes from the Hero Box-1 expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Converting all 50 Survivors from the 13 Special Guest Boxes, and 23 Kickstarter Exclusive Survivors would not be possible, so we focused on these Survivors that are easily available at retail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Massive Darkness Heroes as Black Plague Survivors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the Crossover Set will allow you to bring ALL the Massive Darkness Heroes to Black Plague as Survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     6 Survivors from the Massive Darkness core box&lt;br/&gt;     5 Survivors from unlocked Stretch Goals&lt;br/&gt;     ANY other characters we reveal during this campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
