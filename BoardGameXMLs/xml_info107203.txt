							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atari Karts</name>
									
			<description>Atari Karts is a Mario Kart-style racing game for the Atari Jaguar published by Atari Corporation and developed by Miracle Designs Ltd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graphics of the game, featuring colorful backgrounds and tracks and a hill effect giving depth to the track, are technically superior to those of Mario Kart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was criticized for its lack of interesting power-ups. Instead of being able to fire projectiles like in Mario Kart, the only offensive power-up reversed the other player's direction buttons. Another criticism is the fact that a collision with a wall will make the kart fully stop sometimes, which can be very annoying in the harder tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game music was composed in 1994 by Fabrice Gillet in Protracker on an Amiga. Both he and the people who created the in-game artwork are not listed in the game's credits at the end of the game. The manual refers to them as the &amp;quot;Miracle Designs Team&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is well known by Jaguar fans as the one of the rarest games for the system, with some copies going from $75 to more than $100 on eBay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Atari Karts&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
