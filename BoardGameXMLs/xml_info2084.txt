							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sherlock Holmes: The Game of the Great Detective</name>
									
			<description>One player acts as Sherlock Holmes for the round.  He selects a choice in each of five clue categories (age &amp;amp; sex, height &amp;amp; weight, color of hair, access, and weapon) and hides his choices from the other players.  The other players move around the board trying to decipher which clues the Holmes player chose.  When a player determines all five clues and gets to 221B Baker St., the round ends.  The next player then becomes Holmes and another round is played and so on until all players have been Holmes once.  Players score points by correctly determining clues, with a bonus given for being the first person to reach 221B Baker St. with all five correct.  Scores for all of the rounds are added up to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
