							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yvio: Tarascon</name>
									
			<description>Fantasy-themed role-playing boardgame for the ill-fated electronic boardgame system YVIO. The players are dragons who try to rescue a pre-defined number of younglings from their collapsing dungeon (the more, the harder). Lots of side-quests and exciting dramatic main game, the console rolls the die, keeps track of the dragon's levels and quests, parts of the fights are a small dexterity game. The playing time can vary between one and four hours (depending on the number of players and the chosen difficulty level).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magical land Tarascon: Imagine you are the last reminiscent of an ancient dragon race. Your task is now to protect the descendants of the tribe's mother Tarasque. Fight using magic, in direct combat and with strategic sophistication to prevent extinction.&lt;br/&gt;Tarascon is a rpg-style board game designed for the Yvio console. You take the role of one of four dragons, each with different values in attack, defense and speed. Seated in the cave of Tarasque you'll have to pick up a dragon egg and take it to a nest. After a short while Yvio will inform you that there's a hatchling hiding in one of the rune chambers. Search for it and take it out of the cave to win the game (difficulty could be set to 2, 3 or 4 eggs, too).&lt;br/&gt;During game play you will have to level-up your character, fight creatures and you can take on quests that the console is offering. You have to consider each decision wisely because the cave will start to crumble at some time during the game. If all the chambers are destroyed before one player fulfilled his task all players lose and Yvio wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
