			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As you enter the city of Warlorn you encounter a feeling of peace. The stories, for a moment, seem true.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Warlorn is watched over by the Ilmatari, followers of Ilmater, The God of Suffering. The tenants of Ilmater are to help those that have suffered and to take on the suffering of others such that they can be healed. To them, suffering is truly holy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its because of this that the town has become a place of peace, were people can ensure themselves safety, were the unjustly prosecuted can find respite. Something has put a blemish on this town however, as a worried looking woman places papers calling for someone to help find her missing child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join in this adventure of intrigue, roleplay, problem solving, and epic fights for levels 3rd to 4th as your party tries to save a young girl from The Greatest Suffering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
