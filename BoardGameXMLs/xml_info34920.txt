			<description>You control a small fleet of spaceships, as does your opponent. Your task is simple: you must maneuver your fleet across the galaxy to your opponent's star system. Along the way, all of your ships must stop at a difficult-to-reach system called Backwater. It's a friendly race, so you can't actually attack the other player, but there are ways you can try to slow them down. Who will get there first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Icehouse Pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design Competitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ice Game Design Competition - Entry in 3rd Competition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
