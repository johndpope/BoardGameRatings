			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Living jungle adventure for all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A weapon has been uncovered that can be used to aid in the war against Tiger. Heroes are asked to go and find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spirits of Malatra alert the Lacerial leader to a coming calamity. A meteor falls to Toril, wiping out a section of Malatra. There is a great explosion, and a huge fire. Before too much or the jungle is destroyed, the Spirits of Malatra, stop the fires.  The Meteor crashes into the earth, creating a large crater, and burning all the trees in a 1000 ft diameter. One tree did survive, but not in its original form. The meteor skimmed one tree, transmuting it into a new species of ironwood. The tree&amp;rsquo;s upper branches, and leaves, however did not survive the fire, leaving the trunk standing 20ft tall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes congregate toward the Lacerial village of Lilac, for some unknown reason. Once there, they are met by other heroes, Starr the Shaman, and Trueblood the Witch-Doctor of the Lacerials. The heroes are told of the vision that Starr, the Lacerial Shaman has had. He speaks of a great fireball that will lead the heroes to a weapon to fight Tiger with. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
