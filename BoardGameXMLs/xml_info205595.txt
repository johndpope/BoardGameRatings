							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crazy Chicken Invasion</name>
									
			<description>The day of the invasion has come. Flying saucers are darkening the skies and the fall of civilisation as we know it is halfway through the door already. The world is about to be conquered by the alien Crazy Chicken invaders. Nothing and nobody is safe from these birds from outer space. It's a good thing there are still plenty of hunters about to stop the invaders with their old shotguns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Crazy Chicken Invasion, arguably the most famous bird in the world is back in just the kind of genuine shooter that fans have come to appreciate in the past years: high-quality graphics, tons of hidden puzzles and extras, a Crazy Chicken at every corner and plenty of lead to be hurled through the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
