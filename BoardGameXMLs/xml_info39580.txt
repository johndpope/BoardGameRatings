You are one of the famed swordsmiths of 16th century Toledo, and challenged to meet the prince's impeccable taste.&lt;br/&gt;He demands the rarest metals, the most precious gems, and the finest leathers. There is little time, but you must purchase all the necessary raw materials, forge new and unique metals, and finally construct the most prestigious sword the world has ever seen. Do you have what it takes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swordsmiths of Spain is an innovative auction game that will have you asking for &amp;quot;just one more turn.&amp;quot; Countless combinations of Metal, Gem, and Leather Cards keep the game fresh each time you play.
