			<description>Bobina is a game for two players, played on a hexhex board. The goal is to form a loop with your stones, or prevent your opponent from doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays black stones, the other plays white stones, and both players may play grey stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: place one grey stone on each of the 6 corners of the board, and place an additional 4 grey stones on non-adjacent but otherwise random spaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         The players take turns. On your turn you must either place 1 grey stone or 1 stone of your color onto any empty space.&lt;br/&gt;         The first player to form a loop of her own color, possibly including grey stones, wins.&lt;br/&gt;         If the board fills without a loop of either color forming, the player who was the first to play a stone of her own color loses.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
