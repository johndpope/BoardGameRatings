			<description>An unusual structure has emerged on the mountainside that one would think to be desolate: a long-lost temple fort of Artheastam, the Kingdom of Light &amp;mdash; or is it rather a slaughterhouse? Several adventurers have been brave enough to attempt to discover the secret of the temple, yet none returned to tell the tale. What could this secret be? Why do so many go about risking their lives? Are they aware of what lies ahead of them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom of Artheastam has come to the decision to send its three most excellent warriors to face the peril. This will surely not be watched from the sideline by either the offsprings of darkness or the Mountaindeep or by the dispersed spacebenders. The future of their world is at stake, and they want to get hold of their legacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Magitics, a team of heroes controlled by a player must confront the other players' heroes in a diverse arena. Their aim is to be the winner of this fight and get a piece of a crystal that involves magical powers, hidden by Sethemet, the space-time magician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this conflict, all players control separate hero troops. During these battles, they may get spells, magic items and valuable loot, which strengthen them. They may receive different benefits, too. Players choose heroes that they want to activate; these heroes can perform various actions up to their available action points. The players' goal  is to ensure that with the right tactical decisions their resourceful heroes prove to be stronger than others or completely overcome their opponents by the end of the round. If all players activated their heroes, a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
