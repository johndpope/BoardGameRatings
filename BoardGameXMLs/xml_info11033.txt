			<description>From the box bottom:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entertaining information game combines risk-taking and strategy.  A roll of the giant 12-sided die determines the category you'll answer, or which special instruction you'll follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll a category, you must decide how much you know in that field.  Is Sports your best category?  Then bet you'll win the maximum $100.  Not sure about Entertainment?  Then select $50.  Totally adrift in Science?  Then try the easiest $25.  Keep in mind you're trying to be the first player to win $750 in game chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side of each card has three clues, all leading to the same answer.  The clues range from difficult to easy, but all will be informative and fun.  There are 1,200 different answers and 3,600 clues in all, so the game can be played many times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special instructions on the die, such as Double or Their Choice, give the game real variety.  As an added twist, you can challenge your opponent if you think he or she has bet more than he or she knows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
