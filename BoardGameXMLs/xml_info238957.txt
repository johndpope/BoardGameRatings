			<description>All players start with a private brewery (minor company) plus the pMGs from the starting package (coal mines and steel mills). The new features is the beer market for which the brewery produce and deliver. The basic demand of the beer market will be increased during the course of the game due to the development of the MONTAN companies. Each time they buy a capex card and acquire development markers the demand of the beer market will increase. This reflects the additional workforce (and consequently an increas of Dortmund's inhabitants) the MONTAN companies will need in order to handel additional equipment. The equipment for the breweries is on the backside of the capex cards. In order to acquire the latest most competive equipment a private brewery may be forced to be converted into a brewery corporation in order to generate additional treasury. During the brown phase the railway companies will transport beer to the off-board destinations which will increase the breweries' income proportionally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
