							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Kill or Not To Kill</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the PCs arrive in Far-Rough, they discover that the town is suffering from a rash of deaths caused by a murderous grave-talon. The locals are terrified and believe the rune animal Solange has abandoned the region. Compounding the issue is a group of nobles who are secretly hunting the gravetalons of the Floating Forest. The townsfolk, no longer trusting their local catchpole (sheriff), are now pressuring him to seek outside assistance. So begins To Kill or Not To Kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Grave-talon is the name the people of Far-Rough have given the Dinosaur: Deinonychus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To Kill or Not To Kill&amp;quot; is an Arcana Evolved adventure designed for four 2nd-level characters. Characters will advance to 3rd level by the end of the adventure. This is the second installment in the Rituals of Choice Adventure Path, a complete campaign saga consisting of 25 adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire campaign path will take characters from a simple escort mission at 1st level to an apocalyptic battle for the universe at 25th level. The campaign is episodic with individual adventures able to stand alone despite a plot arc that runs through the entire series. This full arc will become clearer with each episode, together with &amp;quot;The Player's Guide to The Rituals of Choice Adventure Path,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Path Chosen&amp;quot; web enhancements that you can find at our website, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.ritepublishing.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.ritepublishing.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rituals of Choice Adventure Path takes place in the Lands of the Diamond Throne setting but is flexible enough to work equally well in other Arcana Evolved or d20 hybrid settings. You could easily move &amp;quot;To Kill or Not To Kill&amp;quot; to another town where grave-talons could possibly hunt nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the Rituals of Choice Adventure Path, you will need a copy of Monte Cook's Arcana Evolved: A Variant Player's Handbook, Core Rule Books II and III. A number of monsters and NPCs will be drawn from Legacy of the Dragons so this will also be very helpful. However if you do not have this book, full stat blocks are already provided. Owning and/or playing the first part, &amp;quot;A Witch's Choice,&amp;quot; is helpful but not necessary, as the player handout &amp;quot;What Has Gone Before,&amp;quot; included with this adventure, has all the information the GM and players might need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
