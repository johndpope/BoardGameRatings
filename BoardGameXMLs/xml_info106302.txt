							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King Arthur: The Druids</name>
									
			<description>Wales is the beautiful and fiercely independent realm of tribal lords, wizards &amp;ndash; and dragons that slumber beneath the roots of Snowdonia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its new leader, King Ryons used to be the most dangerous warlord of the land. He wants to restore the power of the Old Faith in Britannia and he always reaches his goals. Bow down before the gods of the ancients. Fear the creatures coming back from the twilight and respect the ways of the druids. And follow the warrior-king, who will conquer Britannia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is the twin of King Arthur: The Saxons, offering a wide array of new content (i.e. beasts and other monsters) as well as a brand new campaign. The economic system of the base game redesigned for a totally new campaign structure, where the player will be able to play in sandbox mode being the champion of the Old Faith. The expansion have a complex diplomatic system, campaign winning conditions that can be set by the player and an absolutely free, non-story-based gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
