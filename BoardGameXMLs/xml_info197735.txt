			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trancers Role Playing Game (TRPG) is based on the Trancers movies, a five-part series by Full Moon Entertainment starring Tim Thomerson as Jack Deth. The first Trancers (aka Future Cop) was released in 1985 and is markedly better than the direct-to-video sequels. If you haven't watched the movie, this game might not be as fun so we recommend watching it or re-watching it before playing. But if you want a quick recap, here you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack Deth is a tough-as-nails-cop in 2247. He's matched against Martin Whistler, a physic criminal mastermind who can convert people into zombie followers with the mere power of his mind. To escape Deth, Whistler travels back in time to the 1980's to assassinate the ancestors of the Council Members who oppose him. Jack must travel back, into the body of an ancestor, to save the Council of Angel City. He must keep his girlfriend (played by a punk rock Helen Hunt) and learn to live in 80's California while tracking down Whistler and ending his menace once and for all.published until 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
