							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Solar Invasion 2100</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The year is 2100. Human beings have been intensively colonizing the solar system for the last 70 years in relative peace.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Kathar are still a young race: aggressive, and impetuous. They have conquered numerous other less militant races. They are currently fighting wars on several fronts. Initial reconnaissance of Earth mistook us for a peaceful race. There was no reports of Nuclear Weapon stockpiles. A small task force was sent to enslave us. The Kathar ships use antimatter energy weapons.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Earth wins if all of the Mother Ships are destroyed. The [Alien] fighters are not jump capable, and will self destruct. The Aliens win if Earth is destroyed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using two identical hex maps. Each turn the players first move their units and place attack markers on their own maps. Then the players look at each others' maps and attacks are resolved. Variant rules are provided for using a single hex map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
