			<description>Pilot a Rabbid! Thrust your Rabbid into space! Control its trajectory by using your jetpack&amp;rsquo;s boost and planets&amp;rsquo; gravity. Play tactically: your jetpack&amp;rsquo;s fuel drains as you boost to the stars. One-touch gameplay is easy to play and fun to master. Don&amp;rsquo;t crash into the planets, unless you&amp;rsquo;re asked to&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;150 Wacky Missions. Bounce into space cows or crash into mines while visiting over 10 different worlds, each of them offering 15 crazy missions! Use our ranking system to progress with your Rabbid and unlock achievements. The game includes 150 missions, but many more are to come!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade &amp;amp; customize your Rabbid. Collect coins to buy power-ups and special items to master the universe of fun. Upgrade your jetpack or your bat to increase their power and appearances. As Rabbids love to disguise themselves, find them new outfits for funny looks and personal customization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rabbids Humor. Space duckies, cheese planets, a sunburn when you fly near the Sun&amp;hellip;your Rabbid will have more than one occasion to scream Bwaaah&amp;hellip;and so will you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
