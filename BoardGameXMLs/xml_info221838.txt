			<description>The situation on the Korean peninsula is becoming more dangerous month by month. The bellicose statements from the &amp;lsquo;Supreme Leader&amp;rsquo; notwithstanding, its North Korea&amp;rsquo;s foray into the Nuclear weapons arena that has made the situation critical.&lt;br/&gt;The Supreme leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, in somewhat typical fashion has been making extremely provocative boasts in the lead up to Generalissimo Day, a day which honors his father Kim Jong Il, the 14th of February. The main thrust of these rants is characteristically anti-western but there was a hint of something big that intelligence communities are taking seriously. True to form, both a successful missile launch and a Nuclear test on the same day startled the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
