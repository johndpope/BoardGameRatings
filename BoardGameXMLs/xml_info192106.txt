							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Comic Book Adventures: Mission Book 6</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the sixth in a series of missions usable with Comic Book Adventures. These low-level missions and adventures are geared toward sixth- to eighth-level heroes to continue your fun solo games. The mission book is packed full of new quests and escapades, and builds on the story and plot line begun in the Mini-Mission and the first Mission Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: that this is not a full product and you will need a copy of Comic Book Adventures and Heroes Wear Masks, both by Avalon Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comic Book Adventures uses Avalon&amp;rsquo;s popular Heroes Wear Masks RPG as the base for the system, which in turn is based on Pathfinder, so if you are familiar with that great RPG game engine, then you are already to go.  If you have yet to play Pathfinder or Heroes Wear Masks, then here is your opportunity to jump in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get ready, sew your costume, grab your cape, and power up your energy beams: the city is in need of a hero and you must answer the call!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
