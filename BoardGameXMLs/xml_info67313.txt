			<description>TowerRun is a standard issue Open License Print and Play Dungeon Crawl Adventure Game for 1 (solo) to 4 players. It attempts to make use of several distinguishing mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, no DM player is required. All monsters obey simple AI/automatic rules, which can be performed by anybody willing to do it. Second, dungeon crawl games often take a very long time to play due to a lot of dice rolling. TowerRun attempts to minimize this by eliminating dice rolling wherever possible, including during combat. The (hopeful) end result is not only a faster game, but a more strategic method of play. Third, there is a built in &amp;ldquo;score&amp;rdquo; system that single or multiple players can attempt to beat whenever they play. The game is not designed to be &amp;ldquo;beaten&amp;rdquo; on the first attempt, so multiple attempts are necessary, and each time you can try and beat your previous high score. Finally, a core mechanic of the game revolves around random pairings of objects and enchantments. Quite often objects have unknown enchantments that can be revealed in a calculated or risky method. Players do not know what the enchantments are until they use the item, but if they use the item without first identifying it they run the risk of it being cursed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These mechanics make for heightened tension, faster game play, and a depth of balance and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
