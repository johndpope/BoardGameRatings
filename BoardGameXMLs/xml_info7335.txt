							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">G.I. Joe Commando Attack</name>
									
			<description>Note that this game is significantly different from the 1985 G.I. Joe Commando Attack game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple combat game in which players attempt to capture all six of their opponent's commandos. Players roll a die to determine how many spaces they may move any combination of commandos.  If a commando ends their move adjacent to an opposing figure, combat takes place:  each player rolls a die, and the higher roll captures the opposing piece.  Once per game, captured commandos may be freed by moving onto a compound gate space.  There are also resource tiles on the map that can be picked up and later used to temporarily boost your team's abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real attraction of the game comes into play when a player rolls the &amp;quot;missile launcher&amp;quot; symbol on the die. The player then uses a battery-operated gun to fire one or two foam discs at the board. If a piece is knocked over, it is captured, even it happened to be your own commando.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
