			<description>This Heyne travel game is played on a 2-piece board of 5x5 spaces. Each player has 5 tokens. Two opposing sides of the board are used as staring positions, but the 5 spaces always contain 2 tokens of one color and 3 tokens of the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to form a straight line of 4 tokens. To equalize the advantage of occupying the middle space of the board, this space must be left after 3 succeeding turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with this game are the rules for a second game, called &amp;quot;Lanxy&amp;quot;. It is played with 3 tokens per player are uses only the inner 3x3 spaces of the board. Object of the game is to form a straight line of 3 tokens. But the player reaching this has not won the game yet: he scores a certain amount of points, depending on where he could form that row. The whole Lanxy consists of 5 games and the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
