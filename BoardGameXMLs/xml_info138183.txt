			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Shadows over Sylvania you take on the role of a Vampire thrall of one of the bloodthirsty rulers of the accursed county of Sylvania. Your adventure takes place in the years following Count Vlad von Carstein&amp;rsquo;s failed attempt to become the first vampire Emperor. There are no Colleges of Magic, Konrad von Carstein is yet to seize control of the realm, and the legendary battles of Grim Moor and Hel Fenn are still in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the adventure to come, you will be forced to battle numerous enemies who would stand against you, both mortal and Undead. When this occurs, you must fight them using the rules that appear on the following pages. You will also come across weapons and other useful items that may help you progress in your adventure. And then there are the difficult decisions that you will be forced to make which could well have a direct impact on how events play out later in the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have completed the adventure, you can play it again and again, making different decisions, branching the story in new directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick up your copy, and begin your battle against the fell fiends of the domain of the dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
