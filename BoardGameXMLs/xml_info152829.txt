			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, hero. Your help is needed in this dire time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness surrounds us, and we summoned it. Although our goddess provided for all of our needs, empowering us to drive evil from the realm, we desired more. We saw Yahalla as a distant queen of unlimited power rather than the kind mother who watched over us. We saw a chance to grasp the gauntlet of immortality, and bartered our entire world to claim it. The Reckoning that followed her death unmade the borders of all lands, casting us into a realm in chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ruins of our forebears surround us. Great cities lie in ash; the mighty palaces of the old kings now harbor great evils. An epoch of learning and progress has come to nothing, its lofty works claimed by vile creatures and savage beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It falls to us to rise up and recover what has been lost. The Splintered Realm cries out for heroes. Will you answer the call?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythweaver celebrates its 10th anniversary this year; in 2002, I created a 32-page pdf rule set called Mythweaver. With this edition, I come full circle with that project, taking the &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; from every version of fantasy gaming I&amp;rsquo;ve developed over the last decade, infusing all of it into a central rulebook with a dynamic engine driving it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core rulebook includes four character classes that provide a general framework for character development without limiting your choices, ten distinct race options, a granular point-based character progression system, and dozens of character abilities, spells and talents. Included herein are rules for running the game, developing treasures, building monsters (along with dozens of monster stat blocks), several sample adventure locations, and an overview of the game world. Everything you need for ongoing play is included in one tight core rulebook. You use a D12 for most resolution, using a D6 in some situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
