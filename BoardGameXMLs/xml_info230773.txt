			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;This version of the ruleset was the first version of Forgotten Futures available in printed format.  It was included in a late 1997 edition of Arcane Magazine.  An unabridged version of the rules would be printed later in 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Futures is a role playing game based on Victorian and &lt;br/&gt;Edwardian scientific romances, the predecessors of science&lt;br/&gt;fiction. Adventures are usually set in that era, or in the future as imagined by the writers of the past. For example, the first Forgotten Futures collection was set in 2000 AD and 2065 AD, as imagined by Rudyard Kipling before the First World War. The game is usually published on disk as text and graphics files containing period fiction, game background, adventures, and a longer version of these rules. Some optional rules, examples and background data have been cut for this special printed version. The rules are easily adapted to most settings, provided that characters aren't extraordinarily powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
