							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Future Armor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking into the future is an art, but we did our best to make sure that the armor systems that are present in this book represent conceivable possibilities although this sort of breaks down somewhere near the end of progress level 8 and the beginning of 9. This product was designed in response to the unbalancing nature of powerful weapons that we all love to use. Not that those weapons are bad, but if you have ever been a game master you know how much they can unbalance a game all by themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Armor was designed with play balance in mind. The available armor types escalate by slight variations in many cases so that armors of past and future progress levels match up appropriately. This is not a book full of &amp;quot;no one else dared make them this good&amp;quot; suits of armor, but some of them are really quite good, and appropriately expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all products from Offworld Endeavors, every item has a purchase DC as well as a real price tag. See our other products for details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 30 Types of Armor from Progress Level 5 through 9.&lt;br/&gt;     10 Types of Powered Armor.&lt;br/&gt;     15 Armor Gadgets&lt;br/&gt;     Other defense related gear that wasn't really armor or a gadget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
