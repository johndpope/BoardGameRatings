							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NSKK und HJ-Verkehrsspiel</name>
									
			<description>This pre-WWII title turned a typical traffic-rules game into a propaganda vehicle for Hitler Jugend and the NSKK (Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps or National Socialist Motor Corps). The box cover features young men in HJ uniforms, while Wikipedia describes the latter as a small paramilitary organization within the Nazi party that both provided roadside assistance like the American Automobile Association and trained members in the operation and maintenance of motorcycles and automobiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game content includes a large 33&amp;quot; x 24&amp;quot; game board, seven grey wooden non-player vehicles, six colored player vehicles and eight people figures, some pedestrian and some matched with vehicles (e.g. the red motorcycle and rider).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination allows for a total of nine players, five pedestrians and four vehicles. Each player gets a set of five cards: a starting location, a final destination, and three intermediate stops. The first player to complete his route while respecting all of the traffic rules wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
