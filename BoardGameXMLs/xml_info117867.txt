							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Camelot</name>
									
			<description>This game is to Camelot what 4-player chess is to chess. Of course, the set-up, board and gameplay are markedly different than Camelot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in partnerships with partners sitting next to each other. The goal is for one set of partners to get any two pieces to te opponents' goal spaces-- either each partner getting one piece into one of the two the goal spaces opposite him or one partner getting two pieces into those spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two types of pieces which mostly move similarly. Draughts-like jumps occur in all directions, or one can jump one's own pieces without capturing. Each player focuses on trying to get his pieces past the player opposite him BUT defense also has to protect the opponent from pieces moving laterally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that Grand Camelot is distinctly different from the other 4-player games in the Camelot family, Four-handed Chivalry and Grand Cam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
