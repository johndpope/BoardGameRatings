			<description>Glyph is a dice-building combat strategy game for 2-6 players. Players are tasked with forming a team of three champions and defeat their opponent. These Champions are broken up into three distinct classes--Strikers, Guardians, and Adherents--with each Champion having his or her own strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities which you will use by harnessing the power of mystical glyphs. As the game progresses, your Champions will have the opportunity to acquire new items which will enhance their capabilities as well as perhaps give them even more skills to use to defeat your enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glyph: The Tinker further expands the options available to players for customizing their group of Champions with a the Tinker, a hero with the ability to create his own unique items for battle, and even pawn them off when the tribe needs some extra gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
