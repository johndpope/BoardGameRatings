			<description>Strip away every layer of the game, not mindlessly, but by logical thinking. &lt;br/&gt;In the end, the first person to solve every level, will win something possibly amazing...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furiosity was built [a] game jam, centered around the theme of making a game in a genre you hate.  If you follow the mobile apps world, you will certainly have heard about 'Curiosity', the pseudo-game by Peter Molyneux where everyone is tapping blocks away from a giant cube with the purpose of clicking away the very last block, and to find out what 'life-changing amazing' thing is inside.&lt;br/&gt;Some people think 'Curiosity' is a genius social experiment, others think it promotes mindless idiocy. Anyway, it made me create 'Furiosity' on a whim, or what Curiosity would have been if it was actually a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
