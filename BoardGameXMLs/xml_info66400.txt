							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Easter Bunny Game</name>
									
			<description>The Easter Bunny Game is a pickup and delivery game in which players of all ages move their bunnies around the board, collecting Easter eggs, and delivering them to homes in time for Easter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with chocolate mini-eggs; approximately 24 in four colours are required each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I get the balance right, older kids and adults will enjoy the challenge of planning efficient routes and beating the opponents to the more lucrative destinations, while younger kids will still enjoy scoffing the eggs :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br/&gt;12 cards&lt;br/&gt;Board&lt;br/&gt;4 counters&lt;br/&gt;24 miniature chocolate eggs... you'll need a new supply for each game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
