			<description>The tag line for the game is &amp;quot;Play an entire season in just a couple of hours&amp;quot;.  Pennant produces a major league baseball season - and a Pennant-winner - in just a couple of hours of true-to-life thrills and excitement.  Each participant is the owner, general manager, and field manager of his on team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First participants draft baseball players for their teams from the available players.  The players are color coded with gold being the best, blue the next best, and then red.  These are considered All Star players in the league.  Any position that is not filled is considered to be a regular player.  After teams are drafted then games are played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game is only 1/2 an inning.  It is considered to be the critical 1/2 inning of the game where the game is won or lost.  First a lead is determined for the pitching team of 0-4 runs.  Dice are rolled for each batter and charts are referred to for results until three outs are recorded(the pitching team wins) or the batting team takes the lead(the batting team wins).  The first team to win 20 games wins the pennant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
