							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Towning Around</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Towning around! Towns are the names given to larger settlements in SCRAWL. They are places of business, places of commerce, places where great minds come together to exchange ideas and also places where you can find naked drunks lying in a pool of sick in the streets. Towns are nothing if not diverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The populous and vibrant nature of towns means that there are plenty of things to buy and plenty of events going on. There also may be a sinister organisation keeping the populace under the boot heel of oppression. Will some her step up to remove them? Or if not a hero, someone who is greedy and stupid enough to try?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
