			<description>A travel version of Scattergories.&lt;br/&gt;Scattergories To Go is a portable party game where the players think of and write a list of words that start with the same letter to match a list of categories.  The letter is determined by the roll of a die for each round.&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored by having answers that no other player has.  Each game is played over three rounds.  Each round has different list of categories and different starting letter.&lt;br/&gt;All of the components are smaller than in the parent game and are made to fit in an included plastic travel case.  The game includes 4 folders with clips, a pad of answer sheets, 4 pencils, 4 sets of 6 category cards with 144 categories, a timer, a 20 sided letter die, and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
