			<description>A two player collectible card combat game, where players take turns playing cards to punch, kick, block, or use special abilities to defeat their opponent. Each player has their own deck, and there are currently 4 different fighters, each with their own deck. Collect booster packs for heroic rare cards to increase your combat prowess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play: Each player starts with 10 health. Players shuffle their decks and draw 5 cards. The first player plays any card in his or her hand and effects are resolved, and then the other player plays a card. This continues until one player chooses to end the turn instead of playing a card, or cannot play any more cards.  At which point players discard any unwanted cards, draw back up to 5, and the other player gets to go first on the next turn.  If a turn ends with a player at 0 or less life, and their opponent has 2 or more life than them, then that player loses.  Download the print and play versions here or at the official website, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.ucagame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.ucagame.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current fighters include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ansell V'han - a classically trained arena warrior, using heavy attacks to beat her foes into submission.&lt;br/&gt;     Tatakai - an ultra fast ninja that uses speed to keep his opponent off guard and control the battle.&lt;br/&gt;     Rama Lux - a monk that uses the powers of light and darkness to keep his own health up and his opponent's down. &lt;br/&gt;     Senka Hekt - a mysterious necromancer who uses powerful magic attacks to turn the tide of battle.       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
