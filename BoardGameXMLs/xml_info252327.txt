							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dagon&#039;s Bones</name>
									
			<description>A fast and fun Lovecraft-inspired dice game played in the pubs and bars of Innsmouth. Roll the Bones, pray to Dagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the seaside pubs of Innsmouth they play a game of chance and fortune called Dagon's Bones. It's a dice game that requires both luck and daring and maybe a small blessing from the Elder Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to steal enough coins from each other or Cthulhu himself, in order to please Dagon. But, beware, Cthulhu demands a tithe and if he gets too much, he wakes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
