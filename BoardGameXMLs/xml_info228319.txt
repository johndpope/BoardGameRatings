			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cooperative sci-fi survival game. Groups of 2-4 players will attempt to defend the lab's shared pool of health from increasingly difficult waves of Enemies.  Allowing too many Enemies or any one of three bosses to break through your defenses will end the game.  Defeat three bosses, however, and you will be able to call in your drop ship and escape with your lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advance Phase&lt;br/&gt;Every turn begins with enemy movement. Be cautious, as not all of the creatures move at the same pace! In this phase, any enemies advancing past the first row will cause damage to the players before being discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spawn Phase&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase, enemies that were beyond the battlefield now become visible! Similar to their varied movements, not all enemies will spawn into the fight at the same distance from the heroes. Additionally, these monstrosities can crowd spaces, stacking their damage and moving as a group, changing player priorities in a single phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to deal some damage. Emulating the limited access to and repurposing of supplies that would occur during the ambush, player action begins by drawing a small number of cards from the supply deck. Supplies range from energy sources and offensive weapons to traps and support items. A lucky draw in Dreadbound may not directly benefit you, but it could be just what your teammates need. Following the resupply, players may then make one of two combinations of actions: Attack (deal direct damage to the enemy) and Support (repurpose or gift supplies to teammates), or two Support actions. Plan carefully with the rest of the crew to make the most effective play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boss Phase&lt;br/&gt;Take caution with your kills in Dreadbound, as destroying specific enemies eventually leads to the appearance of one of the game&amp;rsquo;s six boss creatures. Each of these sports one or more abilities unique to their card, with a variety of effects that can damage players, as well as disrupt their plans and reset their priorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
