							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Church and Catacombs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;rdquo;When they entered the church they had no idea of the vast catacombs that were hidden below. All they knew was that the villagers claimed that the priests were hiding something. Something black and rotten, something from the world below&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve called this map the church and catacombs and this is a two maps package. One of the church and one of the catacombs below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is hand drawn and then coloured in Artrage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf is in letter format and consists of three different versions of the maps, two coloured and one black and white. One of the coloured maps and the black and white version has a grid attached to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
