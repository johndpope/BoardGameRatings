							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Run</name>
									
			<description>Dragon Run is a game of desperate combat and flying maneuver. One player takes the part of the Dragon summoned by Lord Ethamon, the dragon priest. He must reach Dragon's Tower and devour the fair maiden. The other player commands the troops loyal to King Corvallis, daring soldiers who ride upon the backs of swift, flying steeds. This player must slay the Dragon before Princess Tanis is consumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is maneuver. Each turn the Dragon secretly selects a maneuver, then watches as the wind riders choose theirs. The player who wins is often the one who can most often out-guess his or her opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
