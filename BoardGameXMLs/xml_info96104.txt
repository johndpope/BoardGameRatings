			<description>Chaos Field (カオスフィールド Kaosufiirudo?), released as Chaos Field New Order for the PlayStation 2, is a 2005 shoot 'em up arcade game released by Milestone Inc.. It was ported to Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube, the latter being the only one that had an American release, while the others remained Japan-exclusives. Additionally, it is included as part of Milestone Shooting Collection: Karous Wii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the &amp;quot;boss fest&amp;quot; style - the levels consist of little more than battles against a single, very powerful enemy. The player's ship can move back and forth between two parallel dimensions - the &amp;quot;order field&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;chaos field&amp;quot;. In the Order Field, enemies have less firepower, whereas in the Chaos Field there are more opportunities for amassing points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose one among three ships, each with specific traits of firepower and speed. All of them have a &amp;quot;sword&amp;quot; special power, possibly inspired by Radiant Silvergun, but here it is used just to cancel enemy shots rather than attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two special attacks that the player can use, A &amp;quot;Wing Layer&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;Lock-on Shot&amp;quot;. The Wing Layer can be used to damage the enemy as well as canceling bullets to obtain combos. The Lock-On shot targets parts of the boss or bullets. These attacks function differently for each ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combos can be obtained as well. The player can generate combos by targeting bullets or sections of the enemies with the Lock-on Shot or by canceling bullets with the Wing Layer. However, it is only possible to target bullets with the Lock-On shot while in the Chaos Field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chaos Field&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
