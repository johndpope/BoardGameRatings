							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomb of Horrors Map Set</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here for your enjoyment is a mapset based on the original maps from the 1st Edition AD&amp;amp;D classic adventure Tomb of Horrors.  You will need a copy of this adventure module to make full use of these dungeon tiles.  The maps are rendered in 1&amp;quot;=5' scale, with doors and archways that fold up to create a 3D effect.  The maps were designed with your printer in mind, with lots of white space to save on ink but plenty of detail.  Each room is depicted separately so you can lay each room down as the players encounter it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product does NOT contain any information as presented in the 1st edition adventure module Tomb of Horrors from Wizards of the Coast.  Though this map set may be compliant with newer editions of the module, Red Pub Games cannot guarantee that it does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
