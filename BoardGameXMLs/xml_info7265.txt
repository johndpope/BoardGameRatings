			<description>This is a strange game. Nowhere on the box, gameboard or playing pieces is there any reference to who designed or who published this game or when it was designed or published.  It must be fairly new because there is reference to  an internet site listed as : &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.racetobepresident.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.racetobepresident.com&lt;/a&gt; on the box. Attempting to go to that site results in notification that the site no longer exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to become president of the United States by collecting either a majority of the Electoral College Votes or more than any other player. Players earn Electoral College Votes by correctly answering the questions on the question and answer cards. The subjects covered on the cards  include current affairs, politics, American History, World History, Geography, Economics etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outside of the box states that the game is for 2 to 8 players and the inside says that the game is for 2 to 4 players with the 4 running as Presidential and Vice Presidential running mates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
