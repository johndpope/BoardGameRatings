							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Banana Republic</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Can you achieve high inflation, huge unemployment, gigantic debt, and lead the country to the brink of disaster? Great! You're Top Banana!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;In Banana Republic, players attempt to outdo each other in controlling banana republics. The object is twofold: 1. to create the worst governed nation, and 2. become the richest player (in bananas!).&lt;br/&gt;The entire game is themed around everything related to bananas. Players moving around the banana-shaped board may take &amp;quot;banana chance&amp;quot; cards (gaining or losing bananas), answer banana-related trivia questions, choose 'Economy Cards' and bet bananas on their chance of having the worst economic performance in a chosen area (such as inflation, unemployment, etc), bet bananas on having the worst banana republican leader (eg worst Treasurer, worst General) by allotted scores (in order to collect a set of government cards), land on a 5-banana &amp;quot;Bananza&amp;quot;, lose bananas in the banana bank, and withdraw other players' bananas from the bank.&lt;br/&gt;The winner (Top Banana) is the player who banana bankrupts all other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NB: Although the playing time is stated as 10 minutes, it can often last several hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
