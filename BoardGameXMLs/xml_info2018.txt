			<description>The party reaches its climax: the band strikes up the tango. The dance floor immediately fills up with enthusiastic dancers moving spiritedly to the rhythmic sounds. More and more dancers press onto the parquet. The room becomes tighter and tighter, everyone is jostling and shoving. Only the craftiest tactician manages to keep the beat and safely and skillfully lead his dance pair across the dance floor...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who first gets his dance pair to the opposite corner of the dance floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
