			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;First, there was Tetris, then Welltris, now comes the third in the mind-teaser series from the Soviet Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FACES follows the same concept you have come to love in its predecessors. In this case, the falling blocks have pieces of famous and not-so-famous faces that must be stacked in the proper order form complete faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swap the pieces, flip them, and drop them into place. &amp;quot;To rotate Shakespeare's nose or not to rotate Shakespeare's nose, that is the question.&amp;quot; Rack up the score by making perfect or mixed faces, but remember there are no points for &amp;quot;double chins&amp;quot; in this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For an unparalleled fun time, play FACES in the head-to-head mode. When you create a perfect face, your opponent gets a stack of face pieces dumped onto his screen. The tournament mode allows up to 10 players to try their skills for any pre-selected time and the victor is the one with the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's funny, it's obsessive, and you'll keep coming back for more of the soon-to-be-unforgettable FACES from the Soviet Union.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
