							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kung-Fu Chess</name>
									
			<description>Kung-Fu Chess is a chess variant without turns, therefore being related as a real-time strategy game. It is a computer online game played by two or four players simultaneously using the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created by the independent Shizmoo Games in the beginning of the 2000s, and was arguably the most popular game on the company's past website. It gained fans from all over the world, assembling a community of proficient players, a community which partly kept existing after the website was shut down late in 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kung-Fu Chess&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
