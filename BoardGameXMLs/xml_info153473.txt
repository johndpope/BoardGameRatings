			<description>Thoth is a solitaire print-and-play card game of 72 cards in which a player marshals Egyptian-themed forces to combat the gods. There are two decks - one player, one an automatic foe engine - and the goal is to acquire a minimum of 12 points by the end of 15 turns. Developing buildings are worth 2 points, Units and Resources are worth 1 point. If 12 points are collected and held by the end of any round prior to 15, the player wins. Turns are played in six phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
