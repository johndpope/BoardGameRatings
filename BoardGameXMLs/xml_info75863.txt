							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Call of Duty 2: Big Red One</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call of Duty 2: Big Red One is a World War II video game for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox and acts as a spin-off/expansion of Call of Duty 2. It was released on November 1, 2005, in Canada and the United States. While developed by Treyarch, personnel from Gray Matter Interactive, who created the Call of Duty: United Offensive expansion pack for the PC, also worked with them on the game. Pi Studios contributed as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Red One differs from other games in the Call of Duty franchise in that it focuses on a single Allied formation in the War: the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, which goes by the nickname Big Red One due to their unit patch which features a large red numeral one. The game covers the division's part in the invasion and liberation of North Africa, the invasion into Sicily, the landing on Omaha Beach in Europe and moving east, eventually crossing the Siegfried Line into Germany. At the end of each chapter and the beginning of the first, period footage with voiceover (courtesy of Mark Hamill, who was also in the Sam Fuller film, The Big Red One) is seen from the Military Channel, imitating a WWII documentary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features several actors from the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers, including Michael Cudlitz, James Madio, Frank John Hughes, Richard Speight, Jr., Ross McCall, Rick Gomez and Rene Morono.&lt;br/&gt;The box cover features actor Stephen Saux. The story and characters were written by Aaron Ginsburg and Wade McIntyre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
