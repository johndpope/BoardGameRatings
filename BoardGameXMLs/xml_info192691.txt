			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The North American Aviation P-51 Mustang was an American long-range, single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber used during World War II. The P-51s were used by the USAAF's Eighth Air Force to escort bombers in raids over Germany. The RAF's 2 TAF and the USAAF's Ninth Air Force used them as fighter-bombers, roles in which the Mustang helped to achieve air superiority in 1944. This aircraft was used in North Africa, Mediterranean Sea and Italy. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft included John Landers, Williams Saks and Spurgeon Ellington. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. Larger maneuver cards (63 x 88 mm) are included with this model, to handle the fast movement of this airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
