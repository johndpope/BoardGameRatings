			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is Mecarobot Golfer Eagle?&lt;br/&gt;His golf is perfect because he hits the ball with matchless power and at angles calculated using data stored in his highly advanced artificial brain. The engineers who created Eagle have an ambition: to participate in a pro golf tournament.&lt;br/&gt;But meeting the resistance of other pro-golfer, they reluctantly drop their plan. Eagles misses the chance to display his ability. Their sponsor buys Eagle a golf course and names it the Hyper Golf Club. Eagle is still waiting for challengers. So let's go to Hyper Golf Club. In this club, you can try three kinds of real plays. (Competition, Lesson, Driving Range) Eagle is looking forward to a match with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
