			<description>ClaudeSoucie is a variant on Lines of Action, where the object is to be the first player to get all their pieces into one group.  ClaudeSoucie differs from Lines of Action several different ways:&lt;br/&gt;1. The game is played is playable on a 10x10 board, or larger or smaller size.&lt;br/&gt;2. One player sets up all the pieces around the outside of the board, and the other player then picks what color they will play.&lt;br/&gt;3. Pieces that would normally be removed from play are put at the bottom of the piece that would be captured.&lt;br/&gt;4. The player who is the first player to have all their pieces in one group at the start of their turn wins, as opposed to immediately, as is the case with Lines of Action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ClaudeSoucie was invented by Donald Silberger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
