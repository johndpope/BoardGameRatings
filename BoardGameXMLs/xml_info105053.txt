							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yakari: Das kooperative Brettspiel</name>
									
			<description>Yakari and his friends are playing in the woods, but they have lost track of time! Now, the sun is setting, and they need to get back to the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a track of different locations. Yakari and his friends start at the location furthest away from the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the a player may perform a single action. Which action he may perform is determined by throwing/shoving/dropping a wooden disk on a grid of available actions. Before taking his action, the player rolls a die; the outcome of the roll determines how the disk should be moved on the grid. After the disk has been placed, the player performs the action, which most of the time is moving on of the friends forward on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have when the friends safely reach the village. However, they need to be quick. On the track, starting several space behind the friends, there is a sandtimer. Each time the timer runs out, it advances one space. If the time enters the same space as one of the friends, the players lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
