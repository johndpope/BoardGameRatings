			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready for your mystery date?&lt;br/&gt;The game with the electronic talking phone&lt;br/&gt;The game changes every time you play!&lt;br/&gt;So use the clues you hear and see if you can solve each mystery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery Date: The Game With The Electronic Talking Phone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the 1999 version of Mystery Date but is vastly different than the others. This is more like Electronic Dream Phone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic mystery game for girls is updated for the new millennium. With 3 kinds of fun mysteries to solve - Dating Line - Mystery Line - Party Planning Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dating Line: Be the first player to find out which boy wants to ask you out on a date. (There is only one secret Mystery Boy chosen per game - the same for all players. It changes for each new game you begin)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery Line: Be the first player to find out who the Mystery Boy is depending on one of threee randomly selected themes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    What boy was voted class president and how many votes did he get? or&lt;br/&gt;    What boy won the science contest and how much money did he win?  or&lt;br/&gt;    What boy is the captain of the soccer team and how many goals did he score?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party Line: Be the first player to get six boys to come to your party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is generally calling one of the boys (from the cards in your hand) and listening to the clue he gives, look at the pictures in the frames, and then record the information on your clue sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
