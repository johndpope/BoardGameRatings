			<description>With Tour du Jour you can organize one-day classics or your own multi-stage tour! Use a single racer or a team consisting of a maximum of four members. Whether you enjoy hills or mountains, cobblestones or coastal roads, Tour du Jour has it all. Find out how your team holds up under the onslaught of the gruesome secteurs pav&amp;eacute;s of Mons-en-P&amp;eacute;v&amp;egrave;le or Trouee d'Arenberg and brutal c&amp;ocirc;tes such as the Kapelmuur and Oude-Kwaremont. Prefer long or short or false flat stages? It's all up to you. Mountain top finishes? Check out the tiles for 3 infamous climbs: L'Alpe d'Huez (France), Alto de l'Angliru (Spain), and Plan di Montecampione (Italy). Rain? Snow? Got it covered. Labyrinthine, narrow city streets, complete with 90 degree turns, nasty road furniture that pops up unexpectedly? Tour du Jour has that as well. There's no end to the possible configurations: this versatile game contains enough tiles to lay out any type of race and blast off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gamebox itself&amp;mdash;containing 6 teams of 4 racers, game token holders, a set of 40 cards, 45 terrain tiles, and a 20-sided die&amp;mdash;has been reduced in size and weight in order to save on shipping charges.  Less box, more game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course is laid out from the terrain tiles each of which has a number indicating its degree of difficulty.  On a player's turn, they roll a die and if the die roll is higher than the difficulty, the player may advance.  If there are still unused pips to cover the degree of difficulty of the next time, the player may advance another tile until all the pips are used up (or insufficient pips remain to advance a tile.)  Unused pips are tracked and carried over to the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are event cards which are drawn at the end of a turn.  Most are blank (no effect), the rest contain an event (usually bad, but not always) that impacts the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a single race, the winner is the first to cross the finish line while for multi-stage races, the lowest aggregate score (aka time) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
