			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game taking place in the modern day world. In contrast to that setting it tells the tale of those beings charged with bringing about the end of days. These beings, called doomcryers, are born into the world in a nearly human guise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are given the power needed to bring about the end of all creation. Not all of them are in line with the end of days. Nothing in creation or Celestia can force them to do their part in Armageddon. Many of these doomcryers rebel and end up embracing the world, into which they were born. These dark heroes have become connected to humanity and now embrace creation. It is these doomcryers that are the focus of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The item includes Shadows &amp;amp; Fog, an introductory scenario, as well as several pre-generated characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
