							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pong Tactics</name>
									
			<description>Pong Tactics is a strategy card game that adds new gameplay mechanics to the classic drinking game beer pong. 10 cups are set up on either side of an 8 foot table. One Formation card is selected to determine the formation of the 10 cups on both sides of the table and then the cards are set aside. Cups may be filled with water or beer (if players are of legal drinking age). The remainder of the game is Action Cards. These cards impact the normal beer pong rules in various ways, such as changing the shot, number of shots, cards in hand, blocking shots, determining the end of the game and much more. The game is played by teams of two players on each side of the table. Each player on a team takes one shot at the cups on the other side of the table; if they make the ball into a cup, it is removed and the player takes a drink either from their own drink or the cup. The goal is to remove all of your opponent's cups by making all the shots. The Action Cards can aid your team or hinder your opponent in achieving the end game goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
