			<description>This is a game of combat in the realm of miniaturized warfare, which re-creates the struggle between hunter-killer groups of tiny fighting vehicles called MGVs. In MGV, the heavy fighting is over or far away. On this battlefield, there are only a few units and they must hunt each other down and clear the field; targets must be secured, gauntlets run or a final swipe at launching a surgical strike. No matter what the original mission was, things have surely changed and now the remaining units must finish things. Despite their microscopic size, it is the MGVs that always end up doing the heavy lifting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dedicated line of miniatures are produced for the game by the War Times Journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
