			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no character creation process--all characters are pre-generated and players select them.  Each character is presented on a Player Card.  The players then equip their characters by spending money from a pool to purchase relatively mundane items from table lists, and spellcasters either draw or select spell cards.  Game Cards then are drawn randomly from the deck as needed for the rules.  Game Cards in turn drive the action, encounters, and so forth--effectively creating the adventure and campaign as it plays out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is driven by cards, of which there are four types.  Player Cards show characters, Monster Cards have several types of opponent, Game Cards drive the travel of the party, and Weapon Cards consist of equipment characters can use.  Specific room contents are generated randomly when the room is entered, using a die roll to determine general room contents and then either consulting a table or drawing an appropriate card for specific contents.  Table entries are selected by 1d100 and are generally basic or minor.  Card entries are generally significant and major.  Dungeon rooms contain traps, tricks, treasures, monsters, and/or equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved by each participant rolling 1d10 to establish initiative.  Hits are scored by 1d20, and wounds are determined by rolling 1d20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
