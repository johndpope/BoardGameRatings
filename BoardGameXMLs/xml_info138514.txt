			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What does the future hold for your characters? Are they spellcasters that seek to harness the powers of death, Or toy with darker forces, utilizing the powers of demons? Are they bloodthirsty warriors, or harbingers of the end of the world? Perhaps they seek to pass through others' dreams, or leave the Material Plane behind forever. That is but a taste of what awaits you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains all three of the Classes and all twenty-six Prestige Classes by Khan's Press between November 2002 to November 2003. They are from Tremon: Kingdom of Sorcery, Fringe Races: Rogues, Fringe Campaigns: Soul Harvest, the adventure Blood Tomb, and the free download Khan's Press Presents #1. None of the books mentioned are necessary to use this product. Additionally, all of the classes have been updated for the 3.5 edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also contains three feats, six spells, one domain, one creature template, one goddess, and information on a plane of existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
