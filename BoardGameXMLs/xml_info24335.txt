							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goola</name>
									
			<description>Goola is a advanced adaptation of &amp;quot;Connect Four&amp;quot; with some twists.  Players alternately drop one of their twenty &amp;quot;Goola&amp;quot; beads into one of the five slots in the Goola Tower trying to form a line of 4 or 5 beads of their color in order to accumulate points (1 point for a line of 4 and 2 points for a line of 5).  The twist here is that scoring only happens after all the beads are placed.  After the initial placement, each player then alternately operate one of the five mechanic valves at the bottom of the tower under each slot to make the beads drop one by one out the bottom of the tower.  After each bead drops out, each player count all the points they get for forming lines of 4 or 5 beads of the same color. The player with the higher points scores the difference in points on the scoreboard.  The first player to reach 8 points on the scoreboard wins.  A further twist can be found in the blind-play option built in the Goola Tower.  This advance play is similar to the basic game except that the bead placement is shielded from the players' sight, and the players must reply on memory to calculate where to place their beads.  After all the beads are played, the lock mechanism is released allowing the beads to drop into sight and the game continues as normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;40 Goola beads in two colors&lt;br/&gt;1 Goola tower&lt;br/&gt;1 Tower base with scoreboard&lt;br/&gt;2 Goola stickers&lt;br/&gt;1 Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
