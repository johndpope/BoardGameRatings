			<description>Statistical game, allowing you to replay Ice Hockey matches. As usual with this publisher, teams are rated for skills such as Shooting, Defense, Assists, Saves, and so on. Once an option has been chosen, dice are rolled to see if the chosen action succeeds or, if it fails, to see if the opposition gain control of the puck. Most goals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My copy suggests that Gamecraft, another statistical sport game publisher, made this game first but I have never seen it. Usually with Valgames, Bob Valvano designs the game but in this case, I guess he didn't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
