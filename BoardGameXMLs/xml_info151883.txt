			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the gods of fantasy worlds are often unseen and unapproachable, they do sometimes manifest their will through mortal vessels called Avatars. Each of these remarkable individuals is chosen as a living personification of faith in action, a direct representation of the god&amp;rsquo;s interest in the affairs of its worshippers. An Avatar&amp;rsquo;s works can be kind or terrible, loving or wrathful... Always, however, they&amp;rsquo;re at the command of a higher power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the campaign, an Avatar could be...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A reincarnated master, tasked by the ancestors to bring balance to the elements&lt;br/&gt;     A devout young girl, elevated by her fierce beliefs to lead the people against a great enemy&lt;br/&gt;     The offspring of the gods, ordered by blessed parents to spread a message among the faithful&lt;br/&gt;     The voice of a dark force, spreading ill words and sowing fear and awe in all who question its influence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This master class expansion also includes 2 new Spellcasting feat chains for pushing your divine magic to new heights, counting your Blessings (and gaining new ones), plus inspiring your friends and allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This file is layered so you can turn the cover and page frames off when printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
