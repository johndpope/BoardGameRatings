							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Russian Subway Dogs</name>
									
			<description>Every morning dozens of stray dogs make the commute by train from the Moscow suburbs to the downtown core in search of food and fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may have read about the clever strays of the Moscow subway system in the news, now you can experience a day in the life of one of these dogs! Russian Subway Dogs is a score attack arcade game where you play as a stray dog scavenging for food on the subway platforms of the Moscow metro. Sneak up behind unsuspecting commuters and scare up food or highly volatile vodka with a quick bark. Compete for sustenance against other subway wildlife including rival dogs, pigeons, and the rare and dangerous Subway Bear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
