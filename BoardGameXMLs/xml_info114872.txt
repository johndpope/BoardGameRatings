			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jason was not sure what to expect. His world had changed so much that he was thoroughly confused. He used to watch horror movies about vampires, demons, and various other monster types. Now he was seeing them. How could this happen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately there were others like him. Normal humans that had never seen or knew of anything like what was after him now. Jason also wondered who could help him out of this situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The demon tracked his pray with smell and hearing. This human was a little crafty and had managed to hurt him. Now he had to die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Monster Fuzion. This is a role-playing game using the Instant Fuzion System. The time frame can be any that you like, but the recommendation is to be played in current times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Monsters?&lt;br/&gt;Why not monsters? Just imagine what a real vampire would have to go through in today&amp;rsquo;s society. What would Eddie Munster do today? Or even Pugsly and Wednesday Addams?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
