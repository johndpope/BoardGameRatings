							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tortured Souls! (Issue 11 - Oct 1986)</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thinks: &amp;quot;Wonder what's in my Tortured Souls! Issue 11?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Pussyfootin': AD&amp;amp;D or Expert adventure for a single thief of 5th-6th level or a single fighter of 7th-9th level. Surely even those loonies at Beast HQ wouldn't have come up with an adventure based on rescuing an old dear's pussy cat from an attic? Looks like they have!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sand-Blind: A module for 5-7 5th-6th level characters from the Zhalindor Campaign (a challenging series of independently playable pull-out modules for experienced AD&amp;amp;D players). Nawem Cain has buried his eight sons well, only the wisest of men can penetrate the tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tears of the Moon: A module for 7th-8th level characters from the Zhalindor Campaign. The legendary 'Tears of the Moon' can only be collected from the shrine of Khian in Shadulan's Mire, but another race has its own purpose for the shrine and doesn't want any interference...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Necropolis: Where worlds collide; who is waiting on the other side? If you thought the single character modules in issues 7-10 were tough, think again! The four bravest adventurers of Chuza now cross to the plane of Theophagus the God-Eater to face their greatest test yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
