							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Karate Chop Game</name>
									
			<description>The entire game consists of a foam brick separated into two halves that fit together like two large puzzle pieces. &lt;br/&gt;SETUP: One person is designated as the &amp;quot;Holder&amp;quot; and the other player is the &amp;quot;Chopper&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Holder&amp;quot; holds the ends of the brick firmly, using two hands, so that its center is exposed. Face the &amp;quot;Chopper&amp;quot; and place the brick about chest high, holding it away from your body. This is the &amp;quot;Ready&amp;quot; position. As the &amp;quot;Chopper&amp;quot;, face the &amp;quot;Holder&amp;quot; and place your chopping hand lightly over the exposed brick to aim. Then lift your hand to touch your ear. IMPORTANT - If you are RIGHT handed, use your LEFT hand - and if you are LEFT handed, use your RIGHT hand for the chopping hand.&lt;br/&gt;TO PLAY: 1) The &amp;quot;Holder&amp;quot; must announce &amp;quot;Ready&amp;quot; to begin the contest. After announcing &amp;quot;Ready&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;Holder&amp;quot; may fake, pull the brick aside, or do anything to try to fool his opponent, the &amp;quot;Chopper&amp;quot;, into committing himself. He must always return the brick to the &amp;quot;Ready&amp;quot; position to give the &amp;quot;Chopper&amp;quot; a chance to strike again. After each point is made the &amp;quot;Holder&amp;quot; must announce &amp;quot;Ready&amp;quot; before a new strike can be made. 2) The &amp;quot;Chopper&amp;quot; MUST KEEP HIS HAND AGAINST HIS EAR UNTIL he is READY TO CHOP. He can fake - but must always keep his hand touching the ear during the fake. Once he has started a chop, taking his hand from his ear, he must CONTINUE the chop and try to hit the brick.&lt;br/&gt;TO SCORE: The &amp;quot;CHOPPER&amp;quot; scores one point if he strikes the brick. The &amp;quot;HOLDER&amp;quot; scores one point if the &amp;quot;Chopper&amp;quot; misses the brick.&lt;br/&gt;After every 5 tries the players change places. The first one to score 11 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
