			<description>Formerly known as Aethera, Shattered God - Quest for the Divine Relic is an action/adventure game with heavy RPG elements. It focuses on a unique, player skill-based and challenging battle system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features all the basics of traditional RPGs: items, spells, attributes, etc., but it more closely resembles adventure games such as Legend of Zelda in regards to how it handles equipment and character development, which matter much less than player skill, as a good player will be capable of defeating even the strongest foes with the lowest level characters, a difficult but not impossible task. It also has a few interesting mechanics other than it's battle system, such as how enemy encounters take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
