							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chain of Command: Operation Marlet</name>
									
			<description>Operation Martlet is the fourth of Pint-Sized campaigns for Chain of Command, designed to be played using the campaign handbook At the Sharp End.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty eight pages long, Operation Martlet follows the established Pint-Sized Campaign format, with an overview of the forces involved on both sides, their deployment shown on period maps and the course of the campaign described in detail before going on to present a mini-campaign covering this combined arms operation launched by the British 49th Division immediately prior to Operation Epsom to seize the Rauray Spur from the defenders from 12 SS Hitlerjugend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign is a total of six game tables with the duration running between six and eleven games.  Briefings are provided for both sides, along with measurable objectives, period maps, force and support option listings and everything you need to play this campaign through to its conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all of previous Pint-Sized campaigns, it is available for the price of a pint in the local pub of the publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
