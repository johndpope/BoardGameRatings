			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monstrous Heroes Fight for Redemption...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witches have ruled the land since the last battles of conquest, but their Grand Coven has been sundered, leaving behind remnants of a once-mighty army. The survivors of the horde include captured citizens of the conquered nations that fought as the Witches&amp;rsquo; shock troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the Accursed&amp;mdash;the Witchmarks burned into their flesh and souls transformed these men and women into monsters. Now, unable to return to their former lives, the Accursed wander the land, giving aid to those in need in an attempt to atone for past sins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light has failed, darkness is ascendant. Only those bearing the forms of monsters can stand against the tide of the Witches&amp;rsquo; evil. The Accursed are this world&amp;rsquo;s only hope&amp;mdash;they must learn to embrace their curse or to fight against it, and find some way to free themselves forever of their Witchmark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accursed is a dark fantasy setting that requires the Savage Worlds Core Rules and Savage Worlds Horror Companion for use. It includes background information on the nations of Morden. Game mechanics include horrific new Witchbreeds for use as playable characters, along with Setting Rules, Hindrances, Edges, and Powers suited to telling stories set in Morden. The full setting guide also includes detailed information on eight of the Witches and their banes, as well as a range of adventure hooks and a plot point campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
