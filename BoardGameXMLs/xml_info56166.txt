							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hedge Wizard</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To some, the hedge wizard might seem to be a poor substitute for the wizard or sorcerer. Not as flashy as the latter, nor as recognised as the former. This is, however, a dangerous misconception. The hedge wizard is a rural, backwoods magician who relies as much on the superstition of his neighbours as on actual magic to make a living. He specialises in the use of cantrips; the minor incantations and simple spells that are largely ignored by most wizards and sorcerers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the 7th book of the Power Classes series from Mongoose Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20 system game, each of these mini-supplements introduces an entirely new core character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
