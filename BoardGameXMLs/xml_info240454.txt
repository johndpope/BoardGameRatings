							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Urban Encounters: Shops &amp; Houses</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind every door is a story just waiting to be told...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains 97 pages of original encounters and mini-dungeons set within shops and houses of all sorts. The settings within these pages will take you from the terrifying Vampire's Manse to the fully automated Home of the Future, all the way back around to the vicious Gambling Den and a maddening, saddening Possessed Orphanage. Each entry in the book outlines a building with between 4 and 24 rooms, with each room furthering a self-contained story that will play out as adventurers explore and interact with the denizens within. Every house and shop also includes a map and a set of rumors to help lead the party to the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a perfect way to fill out a D&amp;amp;D session, adding a bit of extra adventure when needed. If your table loves to open every door, barter with every shopkeep and take shelter in every rural barn, these encounters will add a little bit of excitement to their exploration. The adventures within can also easily be used as a jumping off point for adventure, with open-ended story hooks that can easily extend to full-length campaigns as you follow up on the threads generated within each encounter. With 32 original full length encounters, there's something for every table and every level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
