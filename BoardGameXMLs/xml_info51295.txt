			<description>&amp;quot;High Stakes at High Noon!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When Caleb Harling and Mary Jo Evans rode into Bailey's End, they were expecting trouble, but they weren't expecting to find the sheriff dead at his desk. Things got worse when they discovered the bounty they were after was on a man dead for years &amp;ndash; but just as mean as ever. Now all they have to do is figure out how to kill a man that an entire town can't stop. And this job was supposed to be easy...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
