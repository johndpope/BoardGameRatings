			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is only one adage that can be applied to science fiction roleplaying, it is this: The future is a place of limitless possibilities. While the d20 System core rulebooks give the GM and players everything they need to get started, there is always room for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its spiritual predecessor (Modern Player's Companion), the Future Player's Companion focuses on the material used in character creation and game play designed for use by players but also valuable for Gamemasters. After all, the same material that applies to a player character can just as easily apply to an NPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomorrows' Foundation, the first FPC volume, provides more character fundamentals for your sci-fi d20 System game. From basics such as talent trees to innovative new options like Environment Packages for characters from alien worlds, we give you the tools necessary to define your hero of tomorrow. Inside, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Character Story Arcs, helping you work with your GM to develop character-driven story arcs and guide your character toward the hero you envision.&lt;br/&gt;     New alien races, such as the secretive Liandrens and the technologically advanced Okulans.&lt;br/&gt;     New feats, such as the Cyberjunkie and Nanoimmunity.&lt;br/&gt;     Environment Packages, including the Desert Crawler, Eclipse Chaser, and Greenhouse Dweller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
