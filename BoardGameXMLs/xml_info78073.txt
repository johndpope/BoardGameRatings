			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil sorcerer Tuberculoz has risen from his deep caverns beneath the town of Hammerfest to enact his sinister plan...  To enslave all fruit to his whim!  He captures many fruits, and hypnotizes them to do his bidding, but when he steals Igor the Snowman's carrot, that's the last straw!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hammerfest, you play as Igor the Snowman (and Sandy with a second player) who is intent on defeating the evil sorcerer Tuberculoz and freeing the fruit from his control.  You begin the game with just a simple bomb which you can use to freeze your enemies and knock them off the edge of each stage, but various items and bomb converters can change your abilities, defeat enemies, and many other things to help (or hinder!) your assault on Tuber's deep, dark fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Borrowing concepts and styles from several classic platforming games including Snow Bros., Bubble Bobble and others, Hammerfest is over 250 levels of challenging platforming with a unique collection aspect that allows you to find several items of various rarities that you can show off to the other players in the community, as well as using them to complete quests that will unlock even more game play.  It includes a free, non-accumulative game every day, including ways to win free games, and the ability to pay for an additional block of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
