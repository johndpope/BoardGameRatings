			<description>From the game page on The Game Crafter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For too long the Meeples have lived under the boot of the mighty Regime. You have been pushed around and mistreated while the Regime grows rich off your toil. No longer! The day has come to rise up and take control of your fate. The day has come for Uprising!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uprising is a semi-cooperative game for 2-4 players who take the role of rebel groups rising up against the vicious Regime. Will you be able to work together to overthrow your oppressors, or will you turn on the others to try to become number one?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary of Game Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a grid, where each cell (&amp;quot;sector&amp;quot;) can be controlled by a player, by the regime, or by nobody. Each turn, players draw tiles indicating where they can take actions, such as attacking or reinforcing. After all the players have taken their turns, the regime takes 3 automated actions in random sectors. Each battle can be fought with military power, or with popularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when any player (or the regime) reaches a target score, based on popularity and sectors controlled. At that point, the force with the highest score wins, and if the regime is highest, all the players lose. In the standard rules, players can directly attack each other or temporarily align with the regime. There is a fully-cooperative variant, where players face a stronger regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
