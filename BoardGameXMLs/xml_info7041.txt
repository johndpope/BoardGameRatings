			<description>A game of man-to-man urban combat in World War II featuring German, Russian, and American forces. Each turn is fifteen seconds and each square is 10 feet across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook: &amp;quot;The game is designed to recreate, as close as possible, the 'feel' and 'flavor' of infantry combat and the problems and decisions faced by the small unit leader . . . The combat units involved represent the average organizations of the U.S., Germany, and the U.S.S.R. The playing area represents typical European buildings and streets. All names on the maps are in German, but represent typical small town architecture and street plans left over from the Middle Ages . . . Proceed with caution: the town is unfriendly, the enemy is experienced and your men aren't expendable. You have your mission and your organization. As soon as you read the rules and set-up, it will be H-HOUR.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From designer's William A. Comito's comments in the rulebook: &amp;quot;A game is one man's view of a particular subject, and is only as good as the author's research and experience. I designed this game from the viewpoint of a professional soldier who has spent 6+ years in the infantry, including two combat tours, and who has been an instructor in small unit tactics and map reading. My training has been in all aspects of infantry combat, and my research has included not only books but interviews with combat infantry veterans of WWII . . . The game is, honestly, an attempt to combine a miniatures game and a boardgame together. Most of the rules are written from a boardgame viewpoint, but can be readily applied to miniatures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
