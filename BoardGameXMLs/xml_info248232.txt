							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stones Break Bones: The Perfect Mix of Strategy &amp; Luck</name>
									
			<description>Stones Break Bones is a card game with just one simple goal - to gain exactly 25 points, no more no less. The gameplay is just as simple, pick up cards from the main pile and add up the points on them, but be sure to avoid stones! Those pesky cards force you to discard your whole hand to the discard pile. Boosters, on the other hand, make for a great surprise to your opponent. Play them at the beginning of your turn to throw off your opponents and get an advantage over the gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of the cards is slick, with hand-drawn icons on each card. Unlike many other popular card games, Stones Break Bones is pocket size (1.75in x 2.5in) - perfect for parties and road trips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
