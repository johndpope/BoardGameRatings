							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust: An Elysian Tail</name>
									
			<description>Dust takes place in the world of Falana, inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. Gameplay is presented on a 2D side-scrolling plane. The player controls the titular main character, Dust, as he tries to remember his past. Dust wields a sentient sword, the Blade of Ahrah, as his main weapon. Fidget, the sword's guardian, acts as a companion for Dust and can shoot projectiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player travels the world, they can acquire power-ups that permanently alter gameplay, such as the ability to double jump or climb to previously unreachable areas. Incorporating elements of role-playing games, Dust can gain experience points by defeating enemies, and in turn may level up. These can be used to raise various attributes, such as health, strength or magic. Non-playable characters can be interacted with throughout the game's world to sell items or receive quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dust: An Elysian Tail&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
