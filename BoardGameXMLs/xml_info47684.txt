			<description>Tauch Enten (Diving Ducks) is a game for children that uses a magnetic board and has a &amp;quot;diving hole&amp;quot; where the pieces can be lost. Each player has a set of ducks and the goal is to get them all onto the pond. The pond is made from the wooden box of the game with the colorful magnetic top slid into it. Players roll a dice that determines onto which island the duck can be placed, or if the player loses a turn. Only one duck can be on an island, and if player rolls a symbol where all matching islands are covered, he must take a duck into his stock. One die roll is a whirlpool, and with this a player can send any duck into the center hole, removing it from the game permanently and also getting a head start to putting the game away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
