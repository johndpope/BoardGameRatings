							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bolt</name>
									
			<description>It is based on the Disney film Bolt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By using Bolt's super powers the player can fight enemies. New powers, such as Superbark and Laser Eyes, can be unlocked during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The levels are shared between Bolt and Penny. Bolt has super powers whereas Penny has maneuverability by using her Wheelbar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the game focuses on Bolt's fake TV life, not the actual movie storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penny's father has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Calico, and Penny and Bolt must travel through five different countries to rescue him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this is actually on TV, and Rhino the hamster is watching a DVD pack of all the 25 Bolt episodes; Possibly at the rural home at the end of the film with Bolt's family (Penny, Mittens, Bolt himself, and Penny's Mother). However, the player does not see Rhino, only hearing him. But on the Nintendo DS you can play a mini game called Rhino's Mission, where you go through mazes and avoid obstacles, like cannons. and also he had an introduction sequence in the game where he was starting the DVD. saying it had 940 episodes of Bolt, even though the game actually has 25. The player does not see the other 915 episodes due to Rhino falling asleep at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bolt (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
