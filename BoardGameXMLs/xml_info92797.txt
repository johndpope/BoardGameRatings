							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech Field Manual: Lyran Alliance</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;House Steiner has always been the unchallenged economic power of the Inner Sphere. Transformed from merchant-princes to a military juggernaut by years of war, the alliance with House Davion gave them the most powerful 'Mechs money can buy and a streamlined chain of command. Now, the Steiner-Davion alliance has fractured from within, threatening to engulf both nations in civil war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BattleTech Field Manual: Lyran Alliance reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the new Alliance forces. This manual describes each Lyran regiment and its loyalties, profiles and special rules, plus cutting-edge equipment and the latest 'Mechs from the famed Steiner factories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sequel to the earlier House Steiner (The Lyran Commonwealth) is the penultimate volume in the FIeld Manuals series for BattleTech to be published by FASA. It follows much the same format as the other Field Manuals in that it focuses largely on the military structure of the Capellan Confederation before introducing a scattering of new equipment and units. Suiting the original Steiner theme in the fluff, all of the new discoveries are biased towards the heavy end of the spectrum, and consist of such things as Heavy Gauss Rifles, a new Assault 'Mech, and the largest Warship ever constructed in the Inner Sphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook is out of print, and hasn't been released in an electronic format by the new license holder, That makes this one of the harder to find Field Manuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
