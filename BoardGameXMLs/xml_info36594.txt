							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Indian Wars</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2 Players. Theme: American Indian Wars in the Post Civil War Years. One player is the Whites. The other player is the Indians.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom card deck containing seven types of cards: Initiative, White Combatant, Indian Combatant, Firepower, Aftermath, Special, and Historical. Most of the cards are ranked with a number. Some cards can only be played by one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with twenty Blood Chips. Blood Chips are won from the opposing player by playing cards having a higher total Combatant score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: Reduce your opponent to zero Blood Chips. Note: If both players are reduced to zero at the end of a Turn, the player with the least negative total wins. A White win indicates an early end of the Indian Wars in The White Mans favor. An Indian win indicates additional Resistance and a &lt;br/&gt;Continuation of the Indian Wars. (By 1870 there were more Whites in Kansas than Indians in the entire US)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
