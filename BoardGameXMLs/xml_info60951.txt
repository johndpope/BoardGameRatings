							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Shadows</name>
									
			<description>From the book Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For gamemasters of The Whispering Vault who have subjected their players to the shadows found within the pages of the previously-released books, this collection of fifteen new shadows will help in the creation of new and different Hunts. All manner of sizes and temperments of shadows exist inside this short PDF release, each one just waiting for a chance to get its claws (or mandibles, or teeth, or tentacles) into the Stalkers of your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;This marks Ronin Arts first newly-written material for The Whispering Vault and we owe a special thanks to the authors of the work for their time and creativity. The shadows in&lt;br/&gt;these pages should, eventually, find their way into the second edition rulebook of The Whispering Vault. Feedback is encouraged and appreciated so that once the second edition is released these shadows can be as terrifying and enjoyable as those found in the pages of The Whispering Vault and Dangerous Prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
