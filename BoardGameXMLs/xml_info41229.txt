			<description>A light multi-player wargame of sci-fi fantasy combat.  Strategic, tactical, and dice intensive.  Players have a set army on their home planets that they recruit with their starting units, forming groups.  These groups move around on the board, and when they meet another group, they combat.  Combat is done via dice rolls, (Lots of them!), but each character has his own number of dice and special power to consider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
