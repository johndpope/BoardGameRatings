			<description>&amp;quot;My head...what happened? Who are these people? Who...am I? I am ...Alex... yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s right, Alex is my name. Can they hear me? No, get a grip, Alex! I&amp;rsquo;m not talking, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking. but how did I get here? what is this place? The test! yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s it! I was in a room taking part to a ...Rorschach test... what was the reason? Am I crazy? Was I performing the test or... taking it? And what are those people doing here? Maybe... the place looks like a hospital. Maybe I was injured. There is no pain though, no bruises maybe. either way, I am not taking my clothes off in front of these strangers to check on my body. Maybe I have a relation with them. Supposedly I have something to do to them... or they to me... I wonder what it is...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside a mental institution, a group of people wakes up in the commons, the dining place of this sanitarium. nobody remembers how they got there. Amnesia. The only thing they remember is their names and an obscure scene of a Rorschach test. after searching the facility each one slowly begins to remember their role in this place... but that&amp;rsquo;s the easy part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanitarium is a game in which, what you try to discover, is yourself! You try to remember, by gathering pieces of information and items in the facility, who you truly are and what's your purpose in the sanitarium. If you know who you are, then you have a purpose. If you fulfill your purpose, then you are the winner! This game is a tribute to all the b-movies that feature a main plot inside an abandoned hospital, asylum, sanitarium, medical building wing, or haunted medical lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deduction mechanism of the game is very simple. It's allows you to bluff, in being one of the roles that exist in the game, until another player proves you wrong. If no one can prove you wrong then you fulfill your role's objective. There are six different objectives in the game that depend on the player's adopted role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanitarium is best played with 3 to 6 players, but if you have a big group of friends it may be played with a maximum of 9 (if you don't bother with a little downtime, it repays in interactivity!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
