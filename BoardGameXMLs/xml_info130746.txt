							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Lynn Steiner</name>
									
			<description>Publisehr Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lynn Steiner is the second daughter of the Steiner house, one of the two main Black Sun families. Raised in privilege to be a leader, pride prevents her from leaving her business to agents and prefers to act directly accompanied by her servants. She is in almost superhuman physical condition, and has access to the largest collection of supernatural artifacts in existence on Gaia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artifacts: Lynn can take up to two Advantage cards, whose combined cost is 25 levels or less, without having to pay for these levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural Born Leader: During the Recovery Phase, you may remove an Action Point from a friendly unit in Lynn's Control Zone and give one Action Point to another friendly unit with whom Lynn has Line of Sight. This ability cannot be used on Undead units.&lt;br/&gt; House Steiner: Whenever Lynn receives damage, all friendly units in her Control Zone gain Haste Lv. 1. Limit: Once per turn. This ability cannot be used on Undead units.&lt;br/&gt; X-Calibur (Ki, Attack) - +4 Attack&lt;br/&gt; Arrow of Destiny (Ki, Charge) - +2 Attack. This Charge allows Lynn to move up to 16 inches, and ignores the target unit's armor.&lt;br/&gt; Mirror Image (Ki, Effect) Lynn uses her second Defence value. Whenever an attack targeting Lynn misses, she can reactively perform an Attack or Charge with no cost against the attacker, even if she had already moved this turn. While this ability is active, Lynn cannot Dodge.&lt;br/&gt; Exaltation (Magic, Effect) Remove a negative status marker from a friendly unit in Lynn's Control Zone to put a positive status marker of your choice on Lynn. Limit: Once per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
