			<description>Tenth Edition featured 383 cards (121 rare, 121 uncommon, 121 common, 20 basic lands). It was the first Magic Core Set, after the Limited Edition, to be printed with all black borders. [2] It was also the first time since 5th Edition that the core set contained substantially more than 350 cards. For the first time, Wizards of the Coast put legendary creatures in a core set [3]: each color received two legendary creatures, and a legendary artifact, Legacy Weapon, was also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten thirty-card sample decks, consisting of basic lands, commons and 2 uncommons from Tenth Edition and the Lorwyn&amp;ndash;Shadowmoor block. All cards are black-bordered. They were made available through the website, Here I Rule. &amp;quot;Here I Rule&amp;quot; was a marketing campaign to reach new MtG players. The player that registered on the Wizards Play Network received a sampler, a pin and a DCI registration. The decks were also given away at conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decks come with an insert that provides the basic rules of play, turn order, and a glossary on one side, and a color wheel detailing each color's basic tenets (white is &amp;quot;protection&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;order&amp;quot;, blue is &amp;quot;deceit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;intellect&amp;quot;, etc) as well as showcasing the five main planeswalkers on the other. Due to a lack of rare or valuable cards, the Magic 2011 decks are generally regarded has having low value to collectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
