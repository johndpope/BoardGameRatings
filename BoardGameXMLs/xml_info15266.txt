							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Flintstones</name>
									
			<description>Dino, the Flintstones' pet, has gotten loose and is wandering about the neighborhood. While roaming, Dino has caused 5 clams' worth of damage to property belonging to Mr. Slate, Fred's boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die to move through the streets of Bedrock. If you land on a Clam space, you take 1 Clam token for each clam shown. If you land on a Car space, you may move your pawn to any other Car space on the gameboard. If you land on a Red space next to a building, you draw a face down tile from the box. If the tile is an Animal helper, you place it on the building to show that Dino is not there. If the tile shows Dino, you place it in front of you. Another player may capture Dino from you by landing on your pawn by exact count. The first player to return to the Home space with Dino and 5 Clams wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
