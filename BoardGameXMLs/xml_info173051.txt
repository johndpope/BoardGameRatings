			<description>Synergo is a tile-laying abstract strategy game.  Each hex tile has 1-3 colors on it, and to play it onto the board it must simply agree in color on each edge with every other tile it touches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get points for playing tiles. Although three different &amp;quot;Game Types&amp;quot; are outlined in the rules, the basic concept is that the more tiles you are connected to by color, the more points you score for that play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all game types, the winner is the player with the most points after the last tile has been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
