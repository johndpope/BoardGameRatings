			<description>26 is a competitive, fun, team-based card game. Players will divide into two or more teams. After determining which team will go first, one team will draw a letter card and the other will draw a topic card. The team holding the topic card announces the topic and the team with the letter card has 26 seconds to name as many topics as possible that start with the letter on their card. Then, the team holding the topic card draws a letter card and does the same thing. The team with more topics wins that round. The first team to win six topic cards wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
