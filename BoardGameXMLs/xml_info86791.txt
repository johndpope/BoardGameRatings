			<description>Play as a fallen angel in this exploration platformer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banov made this for Indie Kombat ( &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.indiekombat.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.indiekombat.com&lt;/a&gt; ), in which he competed against a developer named Andrew Brophy during the month of October 2010.  They had to make a game using elements of their opponent's games, and at the end of the month both games were released and users vote on the best one. There was also some trash talking involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
