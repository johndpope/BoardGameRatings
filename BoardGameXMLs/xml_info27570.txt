							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Laramie</name>
									
			<description>The game Laramie was based on the television show of the same name that aired between 1959 and 1962. That show starred John Smith as Slim Sherman, Robert Fuller (eventually of Wagon Train fame) as Jess Harper , Hoagy Carmichael as Jonesy and Spring Byington as Miss Daisy. The show was about two brothers and a drifter trying to run a stage coach stop for the Greater Central Overland Mail Company. The game itself is a simple roll and move game with the object being to get the mail through while overcoming obstacles like Indians and Bandits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
