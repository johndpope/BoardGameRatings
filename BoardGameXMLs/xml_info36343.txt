							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Be Continued: Match the Edge Game</name>
									
			<description>Object of the game is to build rows of matching tiles using as many tiles as possible to &amp;quot;create a new and interesting piece of art in each round.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components consist of 21 Corner and 51 2-Color (1 edge is always black; the other ) tiles in 3 design styles (Full; Small; Multiple). Working from a hand of 6 tiles, players create paths/designs by matching the design along 1 card edge in play while alternating colors. The &amp;quot;black-color-black-color&amp;quot; sequence can only be broken by the Corner tiles, which must be mated to a Full tile in the *same* color as the corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round ends when the 8th Corner tile is played. Each Corner is worth 2 points; all other cards are 1 point; and the player who placed the round-ending corner deducts 3 points from his/her score. After 4 rounds are scored the player with the *lowest* score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
