			<description>No. 293 in Piatnik's line of card games, the cards contain scenes and passages from Jonathan Swift's novel, Gulliver's Travels.  The game consists of 36 game cards plus one card with the rules: 20 of the cards deal with Gulliver's journey to Lilliput, and the other 16 to Brobdingnag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are illustrated on one side, with the relevant passage from the novel on the back.  The cards are marked with numbers from 1-9 and letters from a-d: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, etc.  Every four cards with the same number are a set.  The story is told sequentially from card to card, obviously heavily abbreviated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot; variant, but oddly enough they recommend gambling when playing the game!  (&amp;quot;A pool of counters formed at the start pays an agreed bonus to the player with the most fours.  A stipulated fine may be paid to the player who is misinformed about a card.&amp;quot;)  The game does not include any &amp;quot;counters&amp;quot; ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are completely in English, despite being made in Austria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
