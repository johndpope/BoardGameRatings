							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Venture Hold: A Dungeon Adventure</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Awaits&amp;hellip; Beyond the Iron Gates&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venture Hold: A Dungeonteller Adventure for Heroes with 10&amp;ndash;14 Luck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 9 amazing hand-drawn iso dungeon and town maps by Doug Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gates to Venture Hold are locked to keep unlicensed adventurers out&amp;hellip; and undead horrors in. A license to loot from the local town council can cost you an arm and a leg, sometimes only figuratively. For novice adventurers in the town of Lastward, your career path begins as a hired hand for one of the big adventurers in town, who are mini-celebrities in their own right&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a big adventure module designed for use with the Dungeonteller Fantasy RPG. You need to buy the Dungeonteller Fantasy RPG and the Dungeonteller Monster Book in order to play, unless you want to adapt the monsters and NPCs to other rules systems. Using Dungeonteller, about 6 &amp;ndash;10 game sessions would be needed to explore the dungeon, meaning that heroes would gain 6&amp;ndash;10 Luck, 3&amp;ndash;5 action dice, and 1 new power in the course of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is woven with a number of story arcs and missions that heroes can chose to follow or ignore as they like. You can play it as a linear stop-the-bad-guys quest game or just go dungeon-crawling. At the bottom of the dungeon, there are possibilities for further play (if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to develop them), or the heroes can just return to the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A town to explore with over a dozen locations described&lt;br/&gt;    Eight dungeon levels, with over 100 keyed locations&lt;br/&gt;    New Dungeonteller monsters and adversaries&lt;br/&gt;    Dozens of statted NPCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
