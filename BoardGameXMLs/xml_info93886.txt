			<description>Back of case&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playoff fever grips you. And no wonder. You're the driving force that can take your football team to the top in this rough and tumble contest between the leagues. The outcome of the game is in your hands. As the quarterback, you select the plays. Line up the formations. Call the signals and carry the ball. Cut down your opponent with deadly blocking. Intercept a pass. Make a flying tackle. All you need is skill. Strategy. Cunning. And nerve. For non-stop action that charges across the screen. You decide to pass. It looks good. Touchdown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
