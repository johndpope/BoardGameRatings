			<description>Battlefield Evolution: World at War is a complete stand-alone rulebook in the Battlefield Evolution miniature game series, set in the late part of the European Theater of WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 160 page book includes scenarios and army lists for the major forces involved in this theater (American, British, German, Soviet).  The lists include infantry, paratroopers, and armored units, as well as aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow you to use whatever 20-28mm miniatures with 1/72 scale being the recommended choice by Matthew Sprange, the Battlefield Evolution system's designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are easy to learn and fast-paced.  The game has a built in &amp;quot;Reaction System&amp;quot; which allows you to react to your opponent's nearby &amp;quot;Move&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Shoot Actions.&amp;quot;  No more sitting around staring at the wall during your opponent's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy as the rules are, they allow for great tactical flexibility, and will require critical decision making at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World at War rules are fully compatible with the future of the Battlefield Evolution line, including the forthcoming Battlefield Evolution: Modern Combat, due later this year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details direct from Mongoose Publishing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Using the latest generation of the fast-playing Battlefield Evolution rules, this is the action-packed rulebook that brings World War II to your tabletop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlefield Evolution: World at War is a portal into World War II, providing everything you need to stage small firefights in far flung villages, or massive confrontations involving massed infantry, armour and air units, as the struggle for territory reaches a fever pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main rulebook covers Late War armies in the European theatre, with future expansions introducing new campaigns and different armies. In this mighty hardback, you will find army lists for;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;British Army Infantry&lt;br/&gt;British Army Paratroopers&lt;br/&gt;British Army Commandos&lt;br/&gt;German Wehrmacht Grenadiers and Panzergrenadiers&lt;br/&gt;German Waffen-SS&lt;br/&gt;German Fallschirmj&amp;auml;ger&lt;br/&gt;Soviet Infantry and Motor Rifles&lt;br/&gt;Soviet Tank Desant&lt;br/&gt;United States Infantry and Armoured Infantry&lt;br/&gt;United States Paratroopers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlefield Evolution: World at War is designed for 20-28mm miniatures, and 1/72 scale models. The rulebook includes complete army lists, advanced rules, scenarios and a unique Engagements system allowing you to create your own missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is fully compatible with the rest of the Battlefield Evolution line, and hobbyists and publishers alike will have a chance to produce their own material for the game, through the introduction of an Open Content licence.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
