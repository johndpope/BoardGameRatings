			<description>Third Reich: The Card Game is a historical game of World War II that uses cards and can be played by two to four players. Each player controls a side or a Front in this multifaceted game, seeking to defeat the opponent by winning the most Battlefield cards before the end of play. There are no dice, tokens, counters or anything but cards in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basic Game contains 110 cards. It consists of an Allied player deck of 60 cards and an Axis player deck of 50. The cards are of several types. Generally, cards either represent real forces in World War II or they moderate the play of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
