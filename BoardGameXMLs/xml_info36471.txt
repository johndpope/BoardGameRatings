			<description>&amp;quot;A solo card and dice game of trading in the Imperium.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this one player game you play the Captain and crew of the FREE TRADER BEOWULF. The Goal is to profit 73 Mega Credits (i.e., 73,000,000 Credits), which is just enough to buy a SUBSIDIZED LINER and become a Merchant Prince. But in the 1350th year of the GALACTIC EMPIRE, this great Utopian civilization of Humanity is far from civilized. Trading in the Spinward Marches Sector, even close to its ducal capital REGINA, can still be dangerous.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expansion rules allow the game to continue as a Master Trader with a Subsidized Liner attempting to earn another 73 Mega-Credits to build a Mercantile Principality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
