			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award-winning game should provide hours of amusement.  Originally written on the Apple, there are also versions here for VIC, 64, Atari, and PET/CBM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Authors' blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start you are somewhere in a five-story structure made entirely of ice.  Each floor has 25 rooms in a five-by-five array.  Carved into the walls of each room are one or more openings, doors to the north, south, east, west, up, or down.  However, you can see only the doors available to you from your present vantage point.  Only one door in the building opens to the outside - it may be in a wall, the roof, or the floor of the building.  Your goal is to get out as fast as possible.  You could freeze inside these caves of ice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caves of Ice was written by Marvin Bunker and Robert Tsuk and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 40, September 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was based on the earlier game Quinti-Maze&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
