			<description>It is the first season of &amp;quot;Pauntels Got Talent&amp;quot; and the competition is really ramping up! You are a badger, attempting to impress the 6 judges in order to get them to vote for you. It&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as it seems though because the judges are also competing against each other to see which of them gets the most influence over the competition. Make sure you get the right judges on your side or you don&amp;rsquo;t stand a chance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials: Basic Decktet and 10 markers in each of the six suits. You may use the Excuse to hold the influence tokens collected by the judges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pauntel's Got Talent is an indirect trick-taking game largely inspired by Triumvirate (this may be a bit of an understatement). During the each hand player's will play to tricks which will determine which of the judges, represented by the 6 suits, gains influence for that round. At the end of each hand player's can pledge one card face down. The player who pledges more cards to any given suit wins the favor of that judge and any influence, or points, they are worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
