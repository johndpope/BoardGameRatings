			<description>[Back cover]&lt;br/&gt;Will you help them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vemora was lost for decades in the fallen halls of Thornburg Keep.  When a plague annihilated the residents of the palace, only a few managed to escape.  Now, the Village Elder of Dunnerton is asking you to enter the abandoned castle.  But the dangers are far too real.  Who knows what monsters lair in the ancient chambers?  Who knows if the disease is still festering in the fallen halls?  As you ponder your decision, the villagers of Dunnerton anticipate your response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vemora is a module designed for the Forge: Out of Chaos(tm) role-playing system.  It comes with a ready-to-play script and plot that maintains a smooth flowing game.  Its consistent format and easy-to-follow guidelines makes it simple to play.  From the village of Dunnerton to the fallen halls of Thornburg Keep, the Players will face new monsters, traps, and a variety of danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
