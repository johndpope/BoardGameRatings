			<description>The exciting knowledge quiz show on Super RTL!&lt;br/&gt;You go with your friends on a breathtaking ride on the Q-boat at 10,000 feet down and recover the treasure. Along the way, you have to answer tricky questions and collect valuable points. Secure your points across on the cargo hatch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teams try to find a common solution for each correct answer and win oxygen, with which they dive deeper into the sea of knowledge. A wrong answer leads the team to the next secured surface place. There are a questions about professions, geography, medicine, nature or sports in this game with the help of two Jokers. After three dives each with 10 questions, the player/team who has emerged the greatest overall depth, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
