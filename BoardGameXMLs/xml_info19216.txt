							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adhesives Family Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a game that was developed to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Henkel group (which manufactures adhesives).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a combination of different mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to collect a complete set of picture cards. A complete set consists of 8 cards, each with a different colored border. There are also 3 &amp;quot;joker&amp;quot; cards in the game, which can be used instead of a colored picture card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The picture cards are placed face up on the board around the movement fields, 4 picture cards are placed face down on special &amp;quot;guessing&amp;quot; fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player also has a hand of 3 movement cards, which can be used to move the pawn around the track. When you have played a movement card, the pawn is moved according to the instructions on it (it can be a fixed number or you may have to throw a die).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can land on different kind of fields, some allow you to take the picture card that is placed next to it. Others allow you to take a guess at the color of one of the face-down picture cards. You can take it if the guess is correct. You can also be allowed to swap picture cards with opponents, you can be forced to give one of your picture cards to another players, you can steal a card from another player or you must play a game of poker to win extra picture cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players with complete sets score 8 points plus 1 extra point per joker. The others score points equal to the longest sequence of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play 3 games to determine the overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
