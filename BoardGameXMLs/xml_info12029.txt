							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The World of Micronauts Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Capture Baron Karza-Intruder Into the Micronauts' World&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a boardgame based on the classic Micronauts toys.  Gameplay is the usual roll-the-die-and-take-a-card fare.  Playing pieces are photographs of the toys mounted on cardboard with plastic bases.  The board is a fairly impressive 3-D cardboard creation that takes a few minutes to set up.  When assembled, the board is four levels high.  Bottom level is the main board and players start in the middle of each side on their home spaces.  There are two stairways with bridges to the second level--a ring of spaces that sits above the center of the board.  The third level is a smaller ring set above this one.  Fourth level is a single space that sits above this.  Baron Karza, the bad guy, starts on level four.  If the characters land on certain spaces, they check the &amp;quot;Intruder Control&amp;quot;--a cardboard dial with its face hidden by a movable window.  They turn the dial however they wish, then open the window to see if Karza stays where he is, or teleports to one of four numbered spaces on the board.  Players must land on Karza's space by exact count to capture him.  Players may also land on their opponents' spaces, forcing said opponents to return to their starting space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
