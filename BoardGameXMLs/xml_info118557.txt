			<description>A rare promotional card game made by Golden Wonder, a manufacturer of crisps in Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, which can be played by 2-6 players, consists of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) 12 assignment files, each file giving the names and visual characteristics of the four enemy Agents to be captured and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(b) pictures of all 48 enemy Agents which together with 4.&amp;quot;Licence to Kill&amp;quot; cards make up the pack of 52 playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objects of the Game: Each player is given an assignment file which outlines the 4 Agents he must capture (the details on this file are not divulged to the other players until the end of the game). Using the pack of 52 cards, the players try to capture each of the Agents listed in their assignment file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal 4 cards to each player and place the remaining cards face downwards on the table. (We will call this Pack A). The player on the left of the dealer then picks up a card from Pack A. If this is a card he wants he discards one of the cards in his hand. If it is of no use, the card is thrown down. Unwanted cards are placed face upwards in Pack B. In turn, each player can take the top card from either Pack A or B. One card must always be put back on to Pack B as at no time must you have more than 4 cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each game you will find 4 &amp;quot;Licence to Kill&amp;quot; cards. If you are lucky enough to obtain one of these cards, you may interrupt the game at any time and exchange it for a card thrown on to Pack B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the cards in Pack A have been used, the cards in Pack B are turned face down and the game continues as before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
