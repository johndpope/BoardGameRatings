			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;Orangino is a parlor game for social groups or a tool for personal training. &lt;br/&gt;It makes us crack up - to speak about ourselves and about each other with each other.&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to evaluate some more or less evident characteristics, that are &lt;br/&gt;hiding in the personalities at the table and to be reinforced or questioned &lt;br/&gt;in your self estimate. The closer friend- or relationships you have with your co-players, &lt;br/&gt;the more valid judgments you will receive on yourself. The winner will be the one with &lt;br/&gt;the best consistency between self judgment and group estimate.&lt;br/&gt;The selection of characteristics are done at random&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
