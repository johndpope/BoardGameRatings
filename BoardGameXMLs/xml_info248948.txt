			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expressionless, inhuman, cold, calculating, dull, impassive, lustreless, stolid, deadpanned frightening and Doll-like. Some of the many terms wary folk have used to describe these arcane imitations of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relics of the long forgotten past, Dolls are remnants of a long lost technology used in dark and stubborn attempts to create artificial life. Non-living bodies made of fake skin and hollow bones were imbued with the essence of what was thought to be life. Alas to their disappointment, the Dolls were born soulless and without feeling. To be without soul and without feelings one is not bound by a moral code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dolls were feared and locked away save they turn against their masters. Many years have passed and some Dolls have found their way into the light. For better or worse, the Dolls mingle into our society with their fake faces without us evening knowing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
