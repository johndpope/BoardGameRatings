			<description>The race is open to graduate. Go the way of the wise Apprentices and try to get the points that will allow you to enter the University Bright Young. To get points, you must answer the questions correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first player (or first team) to finish university and get the enviable title of Junior Docte Rat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four question categories: Petite Colle (Little Poser) the easy one where the questions are worth 5 points, Bon Mot (Good Word) the vocabulary category that can give you 5 or 10 points, &amp;Eacute;rudition contains harder questions worth 10 points and, finally, Mini-Test where questions are usually divided into three sub-questions totalling 15 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first to finish the two board stages. You have to collect 40 points to finish the first part. Starting again from scratch, you need 80 points to complete the second level and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn rolling die to move their pawn and see what question category they will get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
