			<description>Similar to a memory match game (turn over pairs of cards looking for a match) with a bit more theme and some special cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns attempting to match cards which are forming a roadway from a central point. Cards unmatched at the end of each players turn are placed face-down once again, relying on the player's memory to complete matches. Special cards, when turned over, may allow the player to perform special actions, or loose them points in the final scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all matches are made the game ends, and the person with the most points in their &amp;quot;parking lot&amp;quot; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
