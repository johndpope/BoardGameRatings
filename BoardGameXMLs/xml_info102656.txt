							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Of Light and Darkness: The Prophecy</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purification is near....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the worlds of Light and Darkness, humans have struggled for nearly seven thousand years to put an end to the suffering. Once every thousand years, a gate opens between the waking world and the realm of dream time, offering the opportunity to create a new future for the next millennium. Six times in recorded human history has this occurred and the The Prophets have said that life, as we know it, will end on May 5, 2000. You, the chosen one, must rescue humanity from damnation, redeem the prophetess Angel and stop Gar Hob, The Dark Lord of the Seventh Millennium from plunging the world into a thousand years of darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purification is near... the adventure begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
