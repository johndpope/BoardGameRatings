			<description>A game about moving your three pawns to the top of the top of the pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you play one of your cards to do the corresponding action (spawn new pawn, move one pawn one level up, move one pawn two levels up, move one pawn three levels up, move one pawn one level down, remove an opponent pawn, remove all pawns on one level, move one pawn one space sideways). If you move your pawn to the square of another pawn, the other pawn is removed. All removed pawns go back to the owner and can be spawned later. When all players have played their cards, new cards are dealt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
