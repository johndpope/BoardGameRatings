							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bitter Woods (third edition)</name>
									
			<description>Third Edition Bitter Woods was published and sold briefly in 2002 as a professional DTP effort by designer Randy Heller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only 200 copies were sold before a contract to publish a Deluxe L2 Design Group version stopped further sales, making this one of the more desirable acquisitions among game collectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a color booklet and full color 1/2&amp;quot; counter sheet, includes historical articles, random events, and game scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition only supplies updated rules and counters, no other components are included therefore a copy of a previous edition is required for use!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
