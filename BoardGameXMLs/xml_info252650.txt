							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BN1: Escape From The Lanes</name>
									
			<description>BN1: Escape From The Lanes is the first bagged mini-game from Bedsit Games. Designed to be quick to play, easy to set up and highly portable, it comes as a fold-over A3 sheet containing the board and the rules, contained inside a resealable polythene bag along with all the playing pieces, tokens and dice required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 players must race to get all 4 of their pawns out of the labyrinthine Lanes. Players can hide in shops and attempt to knock enemy pawns back to the start. A simple and tactical game for ages 8 and above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Players must compete to get their 4 pawns out of the maze-like Lanes. The first player to get 1 pawn out of each exit wins. Players roll dice to move a pawn each turn. If they land on a coffee shop they take another turn. If they land on an antique shop they can hide until its safe to come out. Players can also fast-travel the board through the use of sewers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players will accrue numbered coins which can protect them if another player lands on one of their pawns. If they hold a coin bearing the number rolled, they can send the opposing pawn back to the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
