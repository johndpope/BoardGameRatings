			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hobgoblins are a regimented, militant warrior race bent on victory at arms and conquest. Given their first blade at birth, hobgoblins are born into conflict. A hobgoblin&amp;rsquo;s life worth is measured by his deeds in battle, and at death his soul finds its way to the eternal battlefields of Acheron. This society breeds cold, cruel creatures who relish violence, though at times an individual hobgoblin might yearn for a life beyond the daily weapons training, forced marches, and invasions. Such a hobgoblin might be you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What does this book have to offer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Learn more about your birthright, which is battle!!&lt;br/&gt;     Explore your subraces!
