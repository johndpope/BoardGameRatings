							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">E-Z Cash Pawn Shop</name>
									
			<description>From the Editorial Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The E-Z Cash Pawn Shop is the first of a number of locales to be mapped as free V&amp;amp;V PDFs on the FGU web site. This is a series of items envisioned by Dave Woodrum, who is also at work on several V&amp;amp;V adventures and larger location books. The idea of creating a file of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; locations for V&amp;amp;V on the FGU web site originated with Dave and we are all indebted to him for the idea and for his generous donation of his time and creativity. We all hope that V&amp;amp;V players and gamemasters will regularly check in with the FGU web site to find new material offered for free for Villains &amp;amp; Vigilantes (and for other games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a series of free PDF downloads to support a new line of V&amp;amp;V products from Fantasy Games Unlimited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The E-Z Cash Pawn Shop contains a GM's Map and a Player's Map of a typical pawn shop, along with NPC and location information designed to be dropped into any V&amp;amp;V campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
