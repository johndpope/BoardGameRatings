			<description>Uses cards and dice to simulate a game of basketball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game that simulates the real game of basketball.  From the tip-off to the final shot.  Roll the dice to put up a shot.  Cards are played to affect the odds of hitting the shot.  You are the coach, and you control the cards and strategy for your team.  You are also the players.  Slam dunk, pull down offensive rebounds, steal the ball.  Block shots, grab loose balls, hit clutch threes.  How you play your cards and if you can hit your shots makes each game different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
