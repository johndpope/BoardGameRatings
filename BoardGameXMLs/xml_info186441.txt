			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dangerous Gnollteeth Pass is home to its fair share of troubles, but it is the safest way through the Old Mountains for at least 200 miles in either direction.  One reason is the presence of Sn&amp;ouml;wycrag, a human settled fort that serves as a military outpost and traveler refuge.  The fort's walls have been destroyed and rebuilt many times over.  Each time, a new group of armed soldiers or entrepeneurs have reestablished the important outpost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, traders, merchants, hunters, and explorers use Gnollteeth Pass and Sn&amp;ouml;wycrag to gain quick access to the Northlands or the Olde Forests to the south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sn&amp;ouml;wycrag is an adventure locale with area map, town map, and notable personalities.  It functions as a location for adventure and intrigue but does not have a single narrative plot adventure as would be typical of most modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
