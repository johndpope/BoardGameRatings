			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Game made after a local kids show Mojje. Show is for children and in the show the kids will have to sings like animals. This game made after the show comes with a soundtrack from the show and a DVD as well.&lt;br/&gt;Game itself is easy and short. Game has a lot of identical puzzle pieces with a piano string on them.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a bunch of cards, one picture on each of them.&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game parent start the soundtrack. It has about 30-40 short songs on it. Every time Mojja says on the CD &amp;quot;Let's sing along&amp;quot; players add a new piano piece to the board. Game ends when all piano pieces are in place.&lt;br/&gt;Players get each 8 cards at the beginning of the game. Now every time they hear a noise one of the cards in their hands make (dog, cat, pig) or named item (bananas, oranges) they have to mimic it and then play the card. First player to get rid of the cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
