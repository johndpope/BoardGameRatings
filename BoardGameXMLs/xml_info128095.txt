			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the world of Wicked Crush, where a centuries-spanning war between humans and beastmen dictates life. But in the isolated beastmen town of Rosachelia, where you (as either a dude or a chick) fall from the sky, it's the almighty dollar that reigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town's entire economy revolves around profiting from the lives of adventurers foolish enough to enter Dynidar, the seemingly endless, constantly changing dungeon that borders the town. The townspeople provide the sales of items, services in forging equipment and even renovate the dungeon to make it deadlier. Despite this seemingly grim lifestyle, the townsfolk are actually quite friendly. Sharing a common interest in getting that paper, you are quickly welcomed among the Rosachelian people. It is then that you decide to be the first to reach the bottom depths of Dynidar and discover the endless riches and dark secrets that await.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Crush is a PC game designed around the concept of an online game where you play alone, but everything you do has a direct effect on other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking inspiration from classic action games like Castlevania and Mega Man, along with modern games like Demon's Souls, Little Big Planet, Persona 4 and Ys, the game promises to meld the responsive controls and compact movesets of old with unique online functionality, player-generated content, and beautiful, high definition, frame-by-frame 2D animation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's ultimate goal is to reach the deepest levels of Dynidar, each floor is actually made by another player pulled from an online server. If you complete the floor without dying, you will find gold or valuables at the end, and the creator of the floor will receive a small amount of gold. However, if you die, the floor's creator earns a much larger sum. What this ultimately means is that players are rewarded for making crafty levels that rake in the deaths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This use of player-generated content creates the unique challenge to giving the game a fair learning curve, slowly increasing difficulty while adding mechanics, and ensuring that the aesthetics remain cohesive. This is being achieved by grouping floors together into &amp;ldquo;tiers&amp;rdquo;, each of which has a specific amount and types of enemies and traps that may be employed, combined with a constantly updating ratio of successful and failed runs to determine how easy or difficult a floor is, where in Dynidar it should be placed, and how big the payout for completing it should be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between dungeon runs, the player will return to the town of Rosachelia. In town, players can rest, talk to the townsfolk, purchase items (such as potions, temporary strength supplements, and signs to leave behind for other players), upgrade their equipment, and build floors for Dynidar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
