			<description>From the publishers homepage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABC &amp;ndash; In The jungle is the ultimate connection between playing and learning and is therefore a must for all children in their preparation for school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While playing &amp;quot;ABC &amp;ndash; In The jungle&amp;quot; children get familiar with the letters in a fun and inspiring way. &amp;quot;ABC &amp;ndash; In The jungle&amp;quot; can be played in 2 different ways, so children can play with family and friends over and over in various ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore you can adjust the length of each Game to whatever time frame you want: The number of cards you choose to use in each Game determines the playing time of each round of fun learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The order of which a card matches a square on the Game Board is determined by the starting letter of the words from the picture on the card or the other way around if the card is a letter. For example, the card with the letter Z matches the picture of a Zebra on a square on the board. The card with a picture of an Owl, matches the square on the board with the letter O.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-GAMES-IN-1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GET RID OF THE CARDS&lt;br/&gt;Each payer is dealt a number of cards (for instance 4 cards each). In order to get rid of a card, a player must land on the matching square. The first player to get rid of all his / hers cards have won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLECT THE MOST CARDS&lt;br/&gt;4 cards are laid face up and now they players have to collect as many as possible by going to the square they match. When a player collects a card, a new card is turned face up. Before the game starts, the Players agree on the number of cards in total (for instance 12 cards). When all cards are collected, the player with the most cards has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
