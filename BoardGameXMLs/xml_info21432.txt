							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Kismet</name>
									
			<description>Description quoted from the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of the game is to achieve the highest total score including bonuses.  This is accomplished by rolling dice combinations which match the categories on the score sheet and by the skillful choice of scoring options.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine playing Yahtzee with poker dice, and you've got the basic premise of Royal Kismet.  There are three suits available - red, black, and green - with values from 6 to Ace in each suit.  Players attempt to create a poker hand (or other scoring set) after rolling the dice three times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes Royal Kismet truly unique are the dice included.  Each die has a unique distribution of numbers and suits - making it much tougher to calculate the odds of rolling that last Ace you need.  (Blank sides and a Joker can also affect the roll.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
