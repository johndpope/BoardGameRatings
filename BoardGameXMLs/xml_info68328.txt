							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fires of Heaven</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space opera writ large. It is the 23rd century and humanity is the center of a loose and expanding alliance of worlds, including several alien races. Threatened from within by corruption, and from without by the militaristic Vorn. Fires of Heaven (by Patrick Sweeney) is the largest EABA supplement to date at over 420 pages, with an interstellar atlas, corporate profiles, starship design and combat and more. You need EABA, of course, but otherwise it is a complete SF setting in one massive volume that you can print out individual sections of as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Author's Note included in the text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most space opera games feature sprawling, ancient galactic empires or federations of hundreds of alien races, with all sorts of hyper-advanced technologies. And while there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with such universes, I had something different in mind for Fires of Heaven &amp;ndash; an interstellar civilization with enough size to provide plenty of adventure, yet not so vast the heroes will never see more than a tiny fraction of it. A young, expanding union of worlds with plenty of room for heroes to explore new worlds, make first contact with unknown alien races, and play key roles in the unfolding story if desired. I also wanted to keep technological and societal advances as plausible as possible, extrapolating from the modern-day save for nods to two science fiction mainstays &amp;ndash; faster than light travel and artificial gravity. Finally, I set myself the challenge of basing the systems off current astronomical data on nearby stars and extrasolar worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
