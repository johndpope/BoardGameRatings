			<description>Based on the short-lived syndicated 1991-93 dating/game show hosted by Mark DeCarlo of the same name, ideally played with three females and two males (all of whom have dated each other) and an emcee. The host asks the female players intimate questions about relationships away from the males, who must guess the responses later. The male who scores the most points after three rounds of play, kept track of by heart-shaped stickers, is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studs had the honor of being a (very brief) target during Johnny Carson's final monologue, which he did in 1993 during a Bob Hope birthday celebration while discussing the evolution of television. In 2006, when Game Show Network aired its series of the 50 Greatest Game Shows, the inclusion of Studs as #47 (despite not showing any footage) led to flabbergasted game show fans calling it Freaking Studs and wondering how it could have possibly ranked higher than Blockbusters and Treasure Hunt; while far from the only shocker of that series, it's the only one relevant to this entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
