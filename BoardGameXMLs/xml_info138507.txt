							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lesser Races of the Wilderlands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Judges Guild Wilderlands Campaign setting includes an incredible array of races and creatures. The Player's Guide to the Wilderlands details many of the more common races, but it would have taken a work the size of that book alone to have detailed all of the races conceived by Bob Bledsaw and the Judges Guild staff. Here are some of the races that did not find their way into the Player's Guide but are still important to the setting. Except for the swerting, which are an unfortunate plague on the lands, the other races detailed here are rare and few in number. Most are shunned by other humanoids and as a result these races often form small communities of their own, which rarely number more than 100&amp;mdash;200.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
