			<description>Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;African-American Discovery is a trivia board game that helps you learn and review facts about significant African-Americans, African-American history, and African-American culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score points by discovering the other players' famous names before your name is discovered, by answering history questions from the Fact-Finder cards, and by winning points on various squares on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when there is only one player left. However, in a game in which a time limit is set, the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
