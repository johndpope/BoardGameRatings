							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gun Priest: The Blessed of Velash</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE VESTED SONS OF VELASH, A UNIQUE SECT OF DWARVEN PRIESTS, created the very first gun, and with it, ordained Midgard's very first gun priest. Since that day, their ways have spread beyond the dwarven temples that originally birthed them. The men and women who take up this path are a special breed, an elite group that understands there is only one way to win Ragnar&amp;ouml;k &amp;ndash; through superior firepower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gun priests are a devoted, militant lot whose understanding of firearms is seconded only to their knowledge of the Old Gods. They are committed to both paths equally. seeking to master them before the inevitability that is Ragnar&amp;ouml;k. While most gun priests are dwarves, the occasional human or clockwork elf also takes up this calling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gun Priests combine their precision, their faith, and their cunning to change the very nature of the battlefield. A combination of gunslinger and cleric, these individuals focus their power on their vested gun - a weapon unique to each and every priest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF includes a new class, as well as eight new feats designed for both firearm wielding clerics or faithful gunslingers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
