			<description>This game captures the political and economical going-ons of the first German republic (the so called &amp;quot;Weimarer Republik&amp;quot;) from 1920-33. Players take the roles of one of the major political parties (from communists down to the Nazis), trying to win elections and have their politicians in the government. Laws are made in a roleplaying style,  which change the rules of the game and influence the economics and life in Germany, while there are still reparations to be paid, and inflation threatens the economic stability.&lt;br/&gt;Some parties have military and paramilitary troops which can be used to break other parties` rallies or to suppress public uprisings.&lt;br/&gt;If the German Republic survives a certain number of years, the player, whose political goals are fulfilled, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
