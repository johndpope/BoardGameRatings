			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this role playing game you play as an ancient spirit of primordial chaos possessing the body of a sorcerer. The cabal intended to call forth an emanation of the highest godhead that they might invoke it into themselves. For their presumption the Creator sent them a god of corruption instead. The god divided itself into eight demons and each demon took a sorcerer as its vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From one to eight players can take part in a harrowing metaphysical adventure. Will they rip the universe to bloody shreds and dance upon its burning corpse or will they succumb to the weakness of their new flesh and begin to feel the sickness that mortal man calls compassion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
