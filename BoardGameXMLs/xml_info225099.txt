							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Commissioner Victor: Case of Missing Alfred Worthapenny</name>
									
			<description>Another quiet day at the precinct &amp;mdash; but not for long. A woman, covered in tears, bursts through the door, crying that her husband went missing. It seems that Mr. Alfred Worthapenny did not show himself at home for two days. He didn't show at work either, and friends report no sightings. After sending the woman home, you place a quick phone call to Commissioner Victor. After a short investigation, it turns out that the case is much more complicated that it seems. Lots of mutually exclusive evidence and a lack of connection between them &amp;mdash; this looks strange. The Commissioner gathers his most trusted detectives. Time to solve the mystery of missing Alfred Worthapenny!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Commissioner Victor: Case of Missing Alfred Worthapenny, players try to find out what happened to Mr. Alfred. They do so by placing evidence tiles in four colors on a grid. Each player has a different pattern to form from tiles of the same colors. Also, each player gets a tip that crosses out one possible outcome, which means that players cannot win with one of four colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
