			<description>This kit was available to retailers for the &amp;quot;Weekend in the Realms special event&amp;quot; on October 24-26, 2008. This was a promotional event to support the launch of Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, and unlike many special events was part of the Living Forgotten realms living campaign.&lt;br/&gt;The included adventure was triple the normal RPGA adventure length with each of the three parts designed to run as a session and worth 4 RPGA reward points. The adventure was retired from RPGA-sanctioned play on October 26, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some items were only in the physical and not PDF version of the kit. They are noted in the list of contained items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The &amp;ldquo;Beneath Haunted Halls&amp;rdquo; adventure (and poster map if you have a physical kit), playable by LIVING FORGOTTEN REALMS characters levels 1-4. &lt;br/&gt;    A pack of DCI membership cards with signup forms (physical kits only). &lt;br/&gt;    A sample character for those that do not want to create their own character. Permission is granted to photocopy as necessary.&lt;br/&gt;    A FORGOTTEN REALMS trivia sheet. Photocopy this sheet and hand one to each of your participants.&lt;br/&gt;    A LIVING FORGOTTEN REALMS survey sheet. Photocopy this sheet and hand one to each of your participants. &lt;br/&gt;    The Weekend in the Realms Event Report form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Physical adventure is full color, PDF is greyscale only. &lt;br/&gt;    PDF version of the kit has adventure in one PDF and all the other documents in a second PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
