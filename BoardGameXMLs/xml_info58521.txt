							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Pilot&#039;s Guide to the Caledon Subsector</name>
									
			<description>This supplement by J. Andrew Keith was submitted to GameLords but never published. An abridged version (with inaccurate maps) was previously published in Traveller Chronicle. This product was first available in full on the FASA and Gamelords Licensed Traveller CD-ROM. It has been compiled to look as much like it would have been pubvlished by Gamelords as possible based on the model of A Pilot's Guide to the Drexilthar Subsector, including GameLord logo's on the covers, only the copyright has been credited to FFE 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the astrogational computers of the Imperium comes A Pilot's Guide to the Caledon Subsector, a detailed examination of a single subsector on the frontier of the Imperium. Caledon... dominated by the Principality of Caledon, lies at the very center of Reaver's Deep Sector. Each world in the subsector is explored in sufficient depth to be the setting for one or more specific adventures int he Traveller universe. Planetary data on each world is also of use in conjunction with the GameLords enviromental supplements: Undersea, Desert, and Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come explore the Traveller universe... with A Pilot's Guide to the Caledon Subsector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
