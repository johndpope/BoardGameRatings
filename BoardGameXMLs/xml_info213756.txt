							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pon Bola</name>
									
			<description>Pon Bola is a skill game for 2 to 4 players. You need nerves of steel, maximum concentration and a quiet hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play: The 16 small balls are placed in the tray of the base, dividing four balls for each player (8 if only two players). Each player either picks up his stick and tosses it into a small ball, then attempts to deposit it in the &amp;quot;nest&amp;quot; of the six large balls suspended in the air, ensuring that it does not open and drop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-player teams will be formed. Win the first team to get seven of their eight balls in the &amp;quot;nest&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
