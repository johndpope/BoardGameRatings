			<description>Taken from the Press Pass Inc. press release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Press Pass, Inc. [recently] announced a licensing agreement with the Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation for the 24&amp;trade; TCG (Trading Card Game). Based on the action-packed drama airing every Monday night at 9:00 p.m. (8:00 p.m. Central) on Fox, the 24&amp;trade; TCG is scheduled to launch in August 2007 and builds on the success established by Press Pass with its critically acclaimed Fullmetal Alchemist TCG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently in its sixth season, 24&amp;trade; follows the life of CTU agent Jack Bauer (played by Kiefer Sutherland) and his allies, minute by minute, through a single 24-hour day full of heart-stopping action and intense drama as they work to quell a threat to the American people. The Emmy award-winning series boasts nearly 16 million viewers each week and has inspired a wide range of licensed properties, including PlayStation2 video games, novels, comic books, and an upcoming line of action figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a license we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to get,&amp;rdquo; said Edward Bolme, TCG Product Manager for Press Pass. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re designing this game to capture the essence of action and tension that the show portrays. We think the fans will find it a very exciting and attractive game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fans of 24&amp;trade; will love this game,&amp;rdquo; added Virginia King, Executive Director of Fox Licensing and Merchandising. &amp;ldquo;Serious collectors who don&amp;rsquo;t play games will want to collect these cards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by the award-winning Press Pass, Inc. design team responsible for the Fullmetal Alchemist TCG (voted #1 New TCG of 2005 by readers of Scrye and InQuest and Best Anime TCG of 2006 by Anime Insider), the 24&amp;trade; TCG will let you play either with or against CTU in a fast-paced struggle for victory.
