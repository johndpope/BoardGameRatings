			<description>From back of box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clone is a challenging new game that combines skill and luck on a unique battlefield.  The objective is to attack and eliminate your opponent's forces and prevent them from cloning lost pieces by destroying their cloning stations.  Whether advancing your forces across the board into enemy territories or beaming them directory into any territory via transport stations, you'll find 'Clone' to be a game that will bring hours of fun for family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owner's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A six sided board with locations for cloning stations on the outside and transportation portals on the inside with hex spaces between.  Each player plays one (or more) color and has 6 cloning stations and 6 playing pieces.  Playing pieces have different values (2 each of one, two and three) and can only capture those of like value or below (a la Stratego).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three different six-sided dice control your possible choices for action each turn.  The 'Movement' die is numbered 1-2-3-1-2-3 and controls how far you can move and how large a piece you may clone each turn.  The 'Clone' die with 5 blank sides and 'Clone' printed on the remaining side determines whether you can bring a captured piece back and also allows you to roll again.  The remaining 'Control' die determines what combination of actions you may take: Attack, Teleport, enter or exit a Cloning Station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
