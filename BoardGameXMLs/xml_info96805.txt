			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fussball Manager series is the most detailed simulation of the career of a football manager. The player choses a club which he wants to lead to success and manages the team year for year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If he does a bad job (or a very good) he may switch to another club and continue his job there. He also has to manage his private life, a feature that future games of the series doesn't have anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games may be watched in 3D and even a bit of interaction is possible. The manager may act as trainer and yell commands but if they have any effect is unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parts of the manager's tasks can be automated so that the AI takes over, reducing the game to those parts that are interesting to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is licensed by the DFB and features real clubs and names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
