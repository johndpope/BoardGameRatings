			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a coma so long it's amazing Robin Williams hasn't turned up to try some kind of miracle cure on it, Critical Miss is back. Like the parrot, it was indeed, not dead, but merely sleeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lot's changed since the first issue of Critical Miss back in the 20th century's 1998. Back then, the fastest a civilian airliner could do was Mach two and the largest number of astronauts that could be lifted into space by a single spacecraft was seven. In addition, we had experienced the end of history, the stock markets were booming, and we were looking ahead to an era of peace and prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In my own life, in the five and a half years since Issue 10, I've written a novel, moved to Brighton (and yes, I might have just a few too many books!), become a bus spotter, bollocked my mother for denying me my own chance to experience, even second-hand, genuine space exploration, ranted about being shafted by my web hosters, ranted about being shafted by my cable company, spotted a dream home that never was, won a prize for roleplaying, had a previous Critical Miss article go viral, got trapped in my own bathroom, tried my hand at Star Trek fan fiction, lost loved ones, reviewed suitcases, avenged 2005's failure by successfully climbing Arthur's Seat (some crap pictures, some better pictures), and found a crashed Victorian spaceship in Pall Mall that led to a giant, mechanical, walking elephant, with people on board. As you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, here's Issue 11. Hope it was worth the wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
