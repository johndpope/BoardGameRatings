							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heart of the Alien: Out of this World parts I and II</name>
									
			<description>User Summary of Heart of the Alien&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heart of the Alien is the sequel to Out of This World.  The game continues directly where the original leaves off.  Instead of controlling Lester, the player now controls his alien friend 'Buddy'.  The game is very similar to the original with similar graphics, controls, story, and music.  There are several flashback cut scenes in the game that allow players of the original Out of This World to see what'Buddy' was doing while Lester was fleeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was only released for the Sega CD and without the original designers permission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
