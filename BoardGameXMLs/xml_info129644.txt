			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that the mythical King Tuu Ku Ihu and the god Make Make possessed the &amp;ldquo;mana&amp;rdquo; or divine power to command the Moai to walk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question is, have you got the mana to move them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moai is a territorial game for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a standard 8x8 board with the four corners removed or blanked out.You will need a Black and a White pawn and a supply of counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moai can also be played on a hexagonal board with 91 hexagonal cells and the same rules apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Push or Pull your opponent's pawn (Moai) until the last player able to place a counter and move his own Moai wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by placing their Moai on an empty space anywhere on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White moves first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player on his turn makes 2 moves.&lt;br/&gt; 1) Place a counter on a space inline (orthogonally or diagonally) with you or your       opponent&amp;rsquo;s Moai on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once placed counters are fixed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) You push or pull you or your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Moai (orthogonally or diagonally) towards or away from the counter you just placed along an empty path or a player can also move a Moai orthogonally (orthogonally or diagonally on a hex board) towards or away from the counter just placed along an empty path ending with a single space diagonal turn left or right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Moai must move a minimum of 1 space toward or away from the counter just placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until the player that is still able to place a counter and move his own Moai wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
