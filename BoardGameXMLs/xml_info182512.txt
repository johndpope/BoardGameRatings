			<description>Test your friends and family in football knowledge. Based on the classic &amp;quot;YOU ARE THE REF&amp;quot; strip from The Observer, you take on the role as a football referee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you move along the board you will pick up scenario cards based on the laws of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each scenario has three possible outcomes but only one of them is correct. The question is which? You have to be quick though, as in football, you don&amp;rsquo;t have long to think about your decision; only 15 seconds or the game moves on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time you answer correctly, you will get a match card in the colour of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to visit all six different colours and answer correctly will win the game. But be careful; you can be challenged in your knowledge by your opponents and might have to hand over one of your match cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the scenarios and answers in the You are the Ref board game have been written by international football referee Keith Hackett and the scenario cards are accompanied by the art of Paul Trevillion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
