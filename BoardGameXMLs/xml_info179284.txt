							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Torp√©o Inanem</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torpeo Inanem is a story roleplaying game about existentialism and the surreal realities of the human mind. Players take on the roles of characters inside the subconscious of a comatose woman &amp;mdash; Tanya Bennett &amp;mdash; who has been asleep for over 10 years. These characters spend their existence trying to wake her from unending dreams and nightmares, while simultaneously warring with Hekate for her soul. In the end, can they stop Hekate? Or will the end come without Tanya ever knowing she was part of such a hellish game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
