			<description>Sub-title: A Savage Worlds Post-Apocalyptic Toolkit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Out of all RPG settings, I have always loved post-apocalyptic (PA) settings, but I could not find a set of RPG rules I was happy with. At the beginning of 2007, I finally found Savage Worlds (SW). Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s a privilege to combine Savage Worlds with a post-apocalypse setting in this toolkit. Now I have a great RPG setting and a great system to run it with. This document attempts to create a post-apocalyptic toolkit for Savage Worlds Explorers Edition (SWEX) and also extends/uses the Science Fiction World Builder Toolkit and Science Fiction Gear Toolkit. These documents are needed to utilize this toolkit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that when referring to SWEX and the SW Toolkits, my references may lack in some details. This is intentional. My goal is to promote and extend these works, not replace them or cause a loss of revenue. Therefore, this document will refer the reader to the original documents for any further details. If flipping between a few sources becomes frustrating, then I ask your forbearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I exercised the liberty of enhancing or changing some SWEX rules to suit my campaign and ideas. Since I consider this document a guideline, feel free to change or ignore anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t suit your playing style or campaign. At least the reader has a few more ideas with which to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Apocalypse covers PA topics such as hero creation, mutations, environmental hazards, robots, gear, artifact discovery and creatures. Since this a SWEX fan work, there are new hindrances, edges, skills and other goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
