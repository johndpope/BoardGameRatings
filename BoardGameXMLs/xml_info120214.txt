							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stick Stacks</name>
									
			<description>A dexterity game in the mould of later games like Jenga. In this game players must build sticks on to a structure. As the sticks get higher, it becomes increasingly more difficult. The sticks are rounded like a straw which increases the difficulty level even higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three dice decide which colours you need to take. Red sticks are the longest, blue sticks are medium length and green are the smallest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your turn is against the clock so you need to be pretty fast. If you knock down the stick tower, you lose that game. Play as many games as you want and the winner is the one with fewest losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
