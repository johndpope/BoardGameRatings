							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 â€“ Macchi M.5</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Macchi M.5 was an Italian single-seat fighter flying boat, designed and built by Nieuport-Macchi at Varese. It was extremely maneuverable and agile and matched the land-based aircraft it had to fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The M.5 was operated by five Italian maritime patrol squadrons as a fighter and convoy escort. By the end of World War I, these aircraft were flown by both United States Navy and United States Marine Corps airmen. The three versions of the airplane proposed include the model flown by the Italian pilot Domenico Arcidiacono, an American plane flown by Willis B. Haviland and a captured Austrian plane piloted by Friedrich Welker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
