							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hover Strike</name>
									
			<description>Hover Strike is a hovercraft combat game set in the far future. It began as an update to the classic arcade game Battlezone, but was renamed when it drifted from the source material. The game allows you to shoot your way through 30 different 3D levels which include terrain like ice, water, mountains. Your weaponry includes guided missiles, missiles, grenades and lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the enemies in the game are low flying aircraft that follow and shoot at the player's hovercraft. There are also turrets and enemy hovercrafts that are on the battlefield. Most of the missions order you to take out a certain number of enemy rockets, sensors, or re-spawning bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hover Strike&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE ULTIMATE WAR MACHINE IS HERE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You fear the worst for the missing colonists. Terrakian Pirates have taken over the distant planet, with their deadly machines patrolling every section of the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Federation has chosen you to launch a preemptive strike. Your vehicle is a state-of-the-art armored hovercraft, equipped with rapid fire cannon and powerful missiles. Anti-grav units enable it to float over any terrain. Battle through 30 fully texture-mapped 3D levels, including Night Vision missions. Knock out key targets and make way for the Federation armada. Save the colony before it's too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
