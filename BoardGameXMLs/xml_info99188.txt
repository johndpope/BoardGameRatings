							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Damien</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like a shadow that crawls through the darkness unseen and unheard, like a dark angel bringing absolute silence, the Inquisitor Damien is an enigma even to the Church. To contain his abilities he has restrained his body in rune covered bindings and sealed his senses. Nevertheless, although blind, his eyes perceive more than any mortal sight has seen, illuminated by the clearness of eternal darkness...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior/Prowler - Neutral Church - Level 45&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Initiative, Immunity (Blind).&lt;br/&gt;Lightning Slash: All of Damien's attacks ignore the target's Armor.&lt;br/&gt;Phase: When using Bodyless or Lifeless Damien is considered Intangible. He ignores all movement penalties due to difficult terrain, and may withdraw from Hand-to-hand combat without needing to Escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breathless (Ki, Attack) - +3 Attack. Damien gains a Damage bonus on this attack equal to the target's Armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bodyless (Magic, Movement) - Damien may move up to 16 inches in a straight line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lifeless (Ki, Charge) - +4 Damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
