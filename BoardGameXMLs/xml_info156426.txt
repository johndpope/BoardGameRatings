			<description>&amp;quot; Designed by Masayuki Kudou and brought to you by Playdek, Tanto Cuore features classic anime art and easy-to-play mechanics. Players hire maids to staff their mansion with the goal of becoming King of Maids by acquiring the most Victory Points. Private Maids remain in play and use their special powers each turn. Some give players a bonus or affect opponents in a negative way. Opponents can make maids sick or give them bad habits, decreasing Victory Points. The player who has the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the popular &amp;quot;deck building&amp;quot; mechanic, players improve their deck of cards through play, building strategies in a straightforward manner, and using their cards to score points.
