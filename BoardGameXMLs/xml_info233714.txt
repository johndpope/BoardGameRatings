							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Upper Lockgold Street</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They say that Upper Lockgold Street is paved with gold, but whilst that's clearly a metaphor, it's small wonder that people recognise the area as a wealthy one. Home to the city Law Courts, a powerful bank and a renowned library, people pay a fortune to live on the same street. But, like the cheap wood revealed behind peeling gold leaf, strip away the wealth of the street and find the cellars and sewers beneath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of printable battlemaps compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A set of three 20 x 20 maps depicting a wealthy city street. The ground level features a law court, bank, library, restaurant, fine-shop and several houses. Each of these buildings has an upper floor, with bedrooms and offices. Below the streets are sewers, basements and cellars, with laundry rooms, vaults, jails, archives, counterfeiter workshops and much more. Your party may need to venture below the street when planning their bank heist!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
