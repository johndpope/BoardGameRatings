			<description>In this two player card drafting game, both players compete to get the most points from their single row of animals. However, each animal has various effects that can cause you to rearrange your row for more points or to interfere with your opponent, among other things. When both players have 6 cards in a row in front of them, all game ending effects from animals are applied and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
