							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quiz Keno</name>
									
			<description>Quiz Keno is an early trivia/knowledge game mixed in with the luck of Keno (lotto). One person, who can can also choose to be a player, takes the part of &amp;quot;Questioner&amp;quot; and reads the questions and keep tracks of cards and answers. The &amp;quot;Questioner&amp;quot; changes at the end of each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players in the game each get an answer card which is set up like a Keno card. Each of these cards have 5 headings (same on all cards): Artists/Authors, Headliners, Military Men, Statesmen, and Famous Women. When a quiz card is drawn and the question asked, a player having the correct answer on his/her card marks the spot with a mini poker chip. The first player to get a straight row of chips (vertical, horizontal, or diagonally) wins the game. The &amp;quot;Questioner&amp;quot; reviews the answers to make sure all answers were correct. Cards can be exchanged between players before a new game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 75 Cards with 2 questions (A&amp;amp;B) on each card. The backside of the card contains one answer which is correct for both A&amp;amp;B questions. This yields a total of 150 different questions. The 12 Keno/Answer cards are different from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple, straight-forward game mechanics, but the game rules state that modifications to game can be made by player consensus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
