			<description>Do you want to vote a Pope? Now it&amp;rsquo;s possible. Conclave recreates the event in which a new Pope is being elected. You represent one of the factions within the Vatican and your goal is to become the most powerful. &lt;br/&gt;During a conclave you know each player has to vote for a cardinal, but how will they vote? And how can you convince them how to vote? Who is your friend, who is your foe? Make your own plan, see what the others are up to, but most importantly, vote tactically and become the most powerful faction within the Vatican.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conclave recreates the event in which a new pope is being elected. The factions of cardinals use their influence to make one of them the new Pope. You represent one of those factions and it is your task to gain the most influence, and to be the Pope-maker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
