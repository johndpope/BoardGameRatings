			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are those who say that Motocross asks more from the athlete than any other sport.  That may or may not be true.  But this much is true.  Motocross! is unlike any computer game you've ever come across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start/finish line you check your gauges, gun your engine and surge onto the course.  Through the corners, up the hills, into the ruts and down the straights you maneuver for position and try to beat the clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stay ahead if you can.  But whatever you do, stay on the course.  If you don't, one or two things will happen.  You'll slow down and lose valuable seconds.  Or worse, you'll wind up on the seat of your pants.  Who says computers don't like to get dirty?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Jim Rupp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
