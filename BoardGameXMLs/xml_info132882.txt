			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; DEAR READER &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a macabre scenario. It deals with themes of powerlessness, abuse and body horror. There is nothing fantastic in it. Its content is not pleasant and the outcome will, most likely, be unpleasant as well. Either that is your thing or it really isn't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comments and suggestions for the GM can be found throughout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WAR IS OVER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;United States Army hospital train HUC 89321, reduced by a blessed lack of necessity to three cars, is chugging its way through the Midwest with a handful of human wreckage and a medical team that would rather be anywhere else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The men who fought and nearly died for their country in what's come to be known as the Second World War are bound for William C. Borden General Hospital in Chickasha, Oklahoma, a grim warehouse for soldiers who don't fit the heroic narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether they will arrive there alive is an open question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
