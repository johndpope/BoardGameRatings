							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Concentra Spiel</name>
									
			<description>This game war released approx. in the mid 1960s by Verlag Hoppenstedt from Darmstadt/Germany as a merchandising game for the Dresder Bank AG. The name Concentra is the name of a big German investment fund and the game leads players to learn about investing and divesting with stocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 8 players move around the board three times. The player with the most money wins the game. Movement is determined by a die. In the first round, if a player gets on a green space, he gets the corresponding bond. At the roll of a 6 he gets a Concentra-Fund unit. In the second and third round, a player who gets on a green space has to pay the owner of the corresponding bond and a dividend for the Concentra-Fund. At the end of the game the dividend is divided among the fund owners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
