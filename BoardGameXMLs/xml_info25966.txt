							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mit 1000 Mark Ã¼ber Land und Meer</name>
									
			<description>This game is played on a political map of Europe. Starting point for all players is Brussels in Belgium. From there, 6 routes of equal length lead to 6 destinations: Edinburgh, Helsinki, Athens, Istanbul, Palermo and Gibraltar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to be the first player reaching one of the destination towns. Each player has a starting capital of 1000 Deutsche Mark. Towns on the way are stopovers, where the means of transportations to the next town must be fixed. Moreover, a chance card must be drawn, which indicates, if the travel goes on normally, of if additional luggage or passengers must be taken on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walking by foot is slow, but the cheapest means of transportation.   Faster movement is desired (bicycle, car, train and airplane), but costs rise drastically when using them. If a player runs out of money, he is eliminated from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
