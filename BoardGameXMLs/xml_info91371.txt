							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curse: The Eye of Isis</name>
									
			<description>Curse: The Eye of Isis is a survival horror video game that &lt;br/&gt;It shares the same sort of atmospheric setting, gameplay, fixed camera angles, and ammo preservation as the earlier Resident Evil games, as well as many other archetypal survival horror games in the genre, such as ObsCure and Silent Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange things are happening at Great Britain&amp;rsquo;s museum of natural history in 1890. A gang of ruthless thugs has broken into the establishment, the Eye of Isis Egyptian statue has been stolen, and a mysterious fog has overtaken a number of areas of the museum killing and transforming all it comes into contact with.&lt;br/&gt;Playing as museum curator/archeologist Victoria Sutton and her childhood friend Darien Dane, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to fight the various beings and entities created by this fog. You'll spend considerable time in the museum, take a steam train to the coast and travel the seas in a huge cargo ship before finally entering the pyramid tomb where you must find and destroy the source of this ancient evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Curse: The Eye of Isis&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
