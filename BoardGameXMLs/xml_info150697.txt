							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Emil: Stapla trägubbar</name>
									
			<description>Emil is one of the characters created by the famous Swedish child book author Astrid Lindgren. Emil has got himself into trouble once again and therefor finds himself in the tool shed, carving his wooden figures. However, over the course of his mischieveous childhood the wooden figures have become rather numerous and Emil has trouble fitting them all on his shelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Emil: Stapla tr&amp;auml;gubbar (Emil: Pile up the figures) is about piling the figures and trying to be the player who places the last figure on top of the pile without making it fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns drawing figures from a bag and try to place the figures on top of the pile in any way they want, as long as the figures don't touch the table.&lt;br/&gt;A player that causes any figures to fall has to collect the fallen figures except from one that goes back into the bag. The player must then use the figures from his/her own collection before drawing from the bag again. The player who places the last figure from the bag onto the pile without it falling is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very fast and suits ages 3 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though the box states 1-6 players, there is no real limit to the amount of players since everyone draws from the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also offers a solo play version where a player can try to break different records, such as widest structure or highest structure or most figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
