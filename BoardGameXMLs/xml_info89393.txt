			<description>From the cover (translated): &amp;quot;Thomas is looking for his friends. Can you help him find Percy, Gordon, James and the other trains? Besides a good memory you need to be able to work together in this game to succeed. For only together will you be able to beat Diesel.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thomas needs to find his friends, and goes looking for them in various different stations, trying to avoid running into the mean Diesel. His friends need to be found in a particular order. If he runs into Diesel once too often (5 times), then the players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative game in which the players work together to try to defeat Diesel. They can help each other with remembering where the particular friend is whom they're looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game involves memory, mainly, but it's as much a cooperative activity which makes for fun game-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
