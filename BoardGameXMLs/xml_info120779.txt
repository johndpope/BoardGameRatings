			<description>&amp;quot;The fast-paced aim, launch, and score game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This a dexterity game with a motorized revolving game board. Players use catapult-style flippers to launch balls into four different 5x5 grids on the board as it spins. Each grid target matches one of the four ball colors. The object of the game is to be the first player to get four balls of his or her color in a row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three levels of play. For young players scoring is based on the total number of balls that land in his or her matching zone. For adavanced players only balls in the matching zone count when creating the four-in-a-row sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the motorized board with four attached catapults, 40 balls, 4 grids, and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2, 3, or 4 players ages 4 and older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
