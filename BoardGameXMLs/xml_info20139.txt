			<description>Elementals are elemental beings developing from earth, fire, water or air and change perpetually. Players try to find elementals corresponding in two parts to an elemental in the middle. &lt;br/&gt;The cards are evenly distributed among the players. The first player turns up a card for the middle, this is the pattern. Then in turn players turn up their top card. If it does not correspond, it stays discarded with the player, if it corresponds, the player noting this claps his hand on the card in the middle. If the player is correct, he/she gets all open cards, if the player makes a mistake he/she loses the cards. Their are some special cards which have curious consequences.If a player has not enough cards for play of for paying for a mistake, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was released for Essen 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
