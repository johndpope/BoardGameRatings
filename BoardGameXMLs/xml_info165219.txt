							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arcadia Quest: Pigsy</name>
									
			<description>It's rather unusual for a pigman to have a profession NOT dealing with food, so Pigsy has been a rather unsuccessful bandit due in no small part to being very recognizable and often stopping to eat his spoils before getting away.  After trying to rob Wukong and failing, Pigsy has decided to turn his hand at being a hero instead, and is surprisingly good at it - albeit with an unfortunate tendency to attract monsters due to his rather delicious nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exclusive figure available only through the Kickstarter campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
