			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traveller is a hard-SF (Science-Fiction) roleplaying game. That is to say, the Traveller universe obeys consistent and realistic laws. A few physics-tweaks are necessary to allow characters to travel between worlds, but what they find on those alien worlds will be physically plausible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traveller also obeys the laws of social science. The people encountered in the game will behave in a believable manner. Even aliens will follow their own consistent rules of behavior, even if they are so alien as to be incomprehensible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far from limiting the imagination, this grounding in hard science promotes creativity by creating a sound foundation to work from and a core of &amp;ldquo;normality&amp;rdquo; to counterpoint the wonders of the universe. Nothing is weird for the sake of making it weird, but there is certainly plenty of strangeness to explore and encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Traveller universe is a strange and mysterious place, but it is not frivolously so. A mysterious artifact or an alien society will have a reason for being as it is. Finding that reason may be a challenge, but who said exploring the universe was going to be easy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
