							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mutiny!!</name>
									
			<description>Mutiny!! is an adult-oriented game and features mature content&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutiny!! follows the story of Grace Barnet, a prostitute who finds out she&amp;rsquo;s been made captain of (The Bleak Heart) The Mutiny!! a pirate inter-planar skyship after the Navy come looking for it&amp;rsquo;s original captain (pictured above). Forced to leave in a hurry lest she be captured in the previous captain&amp;rsquo;s place, she then discovers the enormous debt she&amp;rsquo;s been shackled to after being made captain. Mutiny!! is a fun, sexy, and light-hearted adventure story, where Grace must learn to be captain, and her crew of misfits must learn to be treasure hunters if she&amp;rsquo;s to pay down her new sizable debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutiny!! is an unconventional visual novel that forgoes the common route into character route trappings, the central focus of Mutiny!! is on it&amp;rsquo;s main adventure story, with character specific stories to come later as bonus route DLC. These DLCs are small character focused escapades but are not meant to be the meat &amp;amp; potatoes of what is Mutiny!!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
