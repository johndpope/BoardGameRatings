							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wiry Dan&#039;s Electric Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Harett-Gilmar produced Wiry Dan's Electric Baseball in 1950. This game, and a similar Jim Prentice-branded offering in 1948, added electricity to the outguess-your-opponent mechanism. In this case, the pitching player secretly pushes a metal arrow down onto one of four metal pitch option circles. The batter touches the lead on a wire to one of four hit circles. If a light goes on, he uses a spinner to determine the kind of hit.  If nothing lights up, the batter touches the ball and strike circles to determine the result of the pitch. Two more circles by the &amp;quot;Smiling Umpire&amp;quot; determine the results of attempted steals and bunts, foul pops, tagging up or double-play attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
