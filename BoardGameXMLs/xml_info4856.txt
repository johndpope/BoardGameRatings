			<description>Each player plays one round as the Programmer. The Programmer places number tiles face down, and indicates their total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the other players attempts to place their number tiles face up to guess the hidden sequence. If none are correct, the Programmer gives feedback by indicating how many of each players tiles are correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one or more players guess the Programmer's code, or until 4 rounds pass, in which case the Programmer wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have been Programmer once, points are tallied and a winner declared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
