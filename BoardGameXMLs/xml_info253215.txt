Players need to fly their way through a lab using a stolen jetpack over a series of three rounds. During each round:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Players receive four new lab cards.&lt;br/&gt;2) All players, in real-time and at the same time, grab tiles from the common pool and lay them to trace their way through their lab.&lt;br/&gt;3) Points are scored through mission cards or by collecting coins!&lt;br/&gt;4) The first player to reach the end of their lab triggers the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;5) Scores are totaled and written down for the round. &lt;br/&gt;6) Players, starting from the one with the lowest score, pick a permanent gadget out of a river of four.&lt;br/&gt;7) A new round begins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most points at the end of the third round wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
