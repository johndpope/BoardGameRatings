			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many U.S. Marines &amp;quot;Semper fidelis&amp;quot; isn't just a motto, it's a creed. When a team of Marine Raiders is caught in a terrible explosion and it seems their own government has sold them out, the scars run deep in both flesh and soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now loyal only to their true brothers - each other - the POWER CORPS is a team of elite, super powered mercenaries... they don't need to be thieves to support themselves when there's always a high paying market for their kind of skill and power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It doesn't matter if they are in paramilitary uniforms or brightly colored outfits... mixing it up with the POWER CORPS is a big mistake!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
