Pollution has devastated large portions of the world, lowering even further the available space to inhabit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We tried for many years to find a way to colonize space. Every attempt failed drastically, ending every time with the death of all volunteers. Things were looking bleak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then some of our scientists discovered Eden. This wasn't a new planet, but a dimension the runs perpendicular to our own. In the place where the two meet is a natural weak spot.
