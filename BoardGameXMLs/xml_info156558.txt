			<description>from What is Hawkmoor?:&lt;br/&gt;Hawkmoor is my own &amp;ldquo;home-brewed&amp;rdquo; fantasy roleplaying setting. Hawkmoor started off as a setting for the first edition of the World’s Most Popular Role Playing Game, but has been attached to many different game systems since those early days. This document is the latest official version of Hawkmoor, presented here as a companion volume for S. John Ross&amp;rsquo; most excellent Risus: The Anything RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herein I have tried to take Hawkmoor back to its roots and preserve that &amp;ldquo;old school&amp;rdquo; feel without abandoning the &amp;ldquo;new school&amp;rdquo; design aesthetic that makes Risus tick. Whether I have accomplished this or not is something that I leave up to you, the reader, to determine. Regardless of whether or not I have achieved this goal, I hope that you enjoy Hawkmoor and find that it provides you with many hours of fantasy adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
