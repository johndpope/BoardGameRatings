			<description>This is the game that introduces a unique concept of custodial trapping pieces and delaying their capture until a later turn. It is playable using a regular chess board and some of the pieces from a regular chess pieces, which start on the board in a set configuration.  Since its launch, several other games by the same author have appeared which borrowed from the concept.  These games include Crossing Stonehenge and King's Crossing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players will end up trapping one or more pieces in a line between two of their own pieces.  These pieces are then frozen and are not able to move.  After this, a piece bookending the pieces will end up moving and occupying the space of one of the pieces it traps and removing it from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win the game by either capturing the enemy Commander piece or getting their own Commander across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
