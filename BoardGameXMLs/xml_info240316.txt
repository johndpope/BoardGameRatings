			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A One-Shot Adventure&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with OSRIC, 1E and 2E game systems&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for 4-6 player characters of levels 6 to 8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maiden of Iasgairen has gone missing, kidnapped by dark forces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The constable suspects &amp;lsquo;tis the work of a band of scurrilous pirates!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ve placed a bounty on the head of the young warrior maiden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you rescue her and become &amp;ldquo;The Heroes of Iasgairen&amp;rdquo;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure the party is called on to solve the mystery of the disappearance of the Shield Maiden of Iasgairen. The young woman, whose given name is Eimhear Iskara, is the leader of her fishing community which lies along the sea on the southern coast of The Red Eagle Barony. Living as far as they do from the capitol of their nation, these hearty sea folk are vulnerable to attack: the Shield Maiden is a symbol of bravery and self reliance to her people. She has valiantly led her folk, thwarting pirate invasions along this coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of her opposition to their plans, the pirate captains who prowl these waters placed a bounty on her head, offering a huge amount for anyone who brought her to them alive; their plan being to torture her and gain information on the Barony&amp;rsquo;s forces before killing her, and displaying her broken body to intimidate the villagers. The merciless pirate known as Pegleg Peggy, feared by sailors and fishermen throughout this Realm, decided to claim that bounty and has kidnapped the Maiden. A local fisherman spied one of Peggy&amp;rsquo;s goons heading back to their hideout: an old smugglers den hidden beneath a natural cave system in the wooded area near to Iasgairen. Peggy is expecting to make the exchange shortly: one day after the players arrive in town. So if there is any hope of saving the Shield Maiden, the players will have to strike quickly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains a completely original ONE SHOT adventure, fully detailed and ready for immediate use with very little preparation by the GM or the players! A quick night of role-playing fun right at your fingertips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find great Old-school art and completely detailed maps in the Old School blue &amp;amp; white style, with detailed encounters for each area! This module also includes a fully detailed map of The Red Eagle Barony done in the Old School style, and complete with information on geography, local settlements, defenses, and areas for further exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure includes a carefully crafted set of SIX PREGENERATED CHARACTERS, ready for immediate use in the game by players or the GM. Each of the six players is presented fully ready to play with all of the necessary stats and gear. As a BONUS, these PCs are specially laid out so the GM can simply print out the page, cut out the sheets, hand them out and the players will be ready to go with their own handy mini character sheet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module provides wonderful background information and additional areas for adventure for those GM&amp;rsquo;s setting their campaigns in the author&amp;rsquo;s ever expanding campaign world, which now comprises four different kingdoms: Jarlburgh, Alderburgh, The Red Eagle Barony, and D&amp;uacute;n Loachas.
