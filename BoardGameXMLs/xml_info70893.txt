							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cavian</name>
									
			<description>Creatures of myth, whispered in legend, lost in the mists of history - and now returned, for reasons unknown to any but themselves. Such are the Cavians, a race of humanoid rodents noted for their incredible psionic abilities. The Cavians were exiled from Exodus for nearly three hundred years, and their unexplained return has made more than a few other races extremely nervous. Fear of Cavians comes naturally to those without psionic gifts, for these ratfolk can &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; thoughts and emotions the way most humanoids can see color. Worse, most Cavians are scions of a racial hive mind, a collective intelligence of phenomenal power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All the information to play the Cavian as PC Race including  Personality and Relations.&lt;br/&gt;     Plus an all new Cavian Paragon Class&lt;br/&gt;     All New Cavian Feats including Hive Mind and Severed.&lt;br/&gt;     and a blank Cavian Character Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
