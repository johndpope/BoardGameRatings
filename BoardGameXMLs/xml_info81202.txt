							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Powers that be: City Council</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Running a game in an urban setting? Slipping towards politics &amp;amp; intrigue? Want to know who runs the show above the local guildmasters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first book in the &amp;quot;Powers that Be&amp;quot; series, City Council details each member of the city council, their background, motivations and role-playing notes, as well as the requisite d20 stat block. Each major character also has a colour illustrated card designed to be shown to the players, with the character's notes on the back for the GM to refer to. Also included are maps of the palace and a selection of adventure and campaign notes for use with the city council in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this is more than 'just' the city council and the politics and adventures surrounding them. This book also includes a fully detailed palace within which these intrigues occur and the council meets. Each room is detailed, and all NPCs are statted out. The book is polished off with rules for voting and influencing the voting procedures, as well as some social feats and prestige classes used for the Council members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The institutions developed and described in the &amp;quot;Powers that Be&amp;quot; line are designed to be easily placed in any major fantasy or magical medieval city. While &amp;quot;Everyone Else&amp;quot; detailed everyone else needed to populate a city, &amp;quot;Powers that Be&amp;quot; details specific institutions and characters within them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
