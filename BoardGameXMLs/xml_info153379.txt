							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wars: The Clone Wars â€“ Blockade von Ryloth</name>
									
			<description>Planet Ryloth is suffering from blockades and players are tasked with destroying the enemy ships in order to free the planet&amp;rsquo;s population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player sets his Jedi Sternj&amp;auml;ger on Square One of the Score Track on the box edge. The blockade tiles are shuffled face down and ships are put into their holders, set up and placed at a minimum of one box length distance from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you first turn over one blockade tile; the number on the tile determines the number of ships participating in the current blockade. One of your fellow players places this number of ships on spots of the board, in any orientation and position he likes; one of the ships must always be the Droid Control Ship. Then you as the active player take the five star chips and try to topple all ships by throwing chips at them, with a maximum of five throws. If you manage to topple all with less than five throws your turn ends with the last toppled ship. If you toppled the Droid Control Ship you score two points and you score one point for each other ship you toppled; one extra point is scored for each star chip you have left over. You move your Jedi Sternj&amp;auml;ger forward accordingly along the box edge. If your Sternj&amp;auml;ger reaches a score of 20 you win at the end of this round if you have most points. In a variant you must topple the Droid Ship with a certain kind of chip and score penalty points for ships you did not topple; in another version there are no given spots for the ships, you can put them anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
