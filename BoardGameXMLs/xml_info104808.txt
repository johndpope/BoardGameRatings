							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dead Man&#039;s Hand</name>
									
			<description>Dead Man's Hand is a first-person shooter set in the American Old West. It is somewhat unusual in that between levels, the player plays poker for extra health and ammunition. Your character is armed with 4 default weapons; a knife, a pistol, a rifle and a shotgun. Other weapons you can find are TNT and Whisky bombs. You shoot objects such as whisky bottles, cans and even enemies to score legend points, this fills up a &amp;quot;trick shot&amp;quot; meter that lets the character use the secondary mode of firing which can vary depending on the current weapon. The combat in the game also makes use of the games physics engine, with the player being able to trigger physics based traps such as shooting a rock and causing it to fall onto an enemy below, kills obtained this way are rewarded with extra points and a greater increase in the &amp;quot;trick shot&amp;quot; meter. It is a noteworthy as a video game that does not feature a caucasian male as the protagonist- rather, the hero of the story (and the character of play) is of Hispanic (or Mesitzo) descent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dead Man's Hand (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
