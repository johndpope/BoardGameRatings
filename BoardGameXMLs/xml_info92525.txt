							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bridge Across Time</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the depths of the jungle, something moves for the first time in centuries. Long forgotten, the bridge has remained buried at the bottom of the water for countless years. But it has been discovered again and, where once it bore the invading armies of Alexander across the raging river, now it will move again in the service of the imperial Japanese army. Unless, that is, your band of heroes can put a stop to the enemy's plans. The armies may have changed but the importance of the crossing has not diminished over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere in the heat and the humidity of the Burma jungle, a division of Japanese soldiers waits. Your small team must locate the force and discover if they have discovered a way across the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bridge Across Time is a Weird Wars adventure written by Andrew Hind and illustrated by Jim Branch, and set in the jungles of Burma. In addition to the mission, this book includes additional horrors to be found beneath the humid canopies and rules to cover the unique difficulties of fighting and living in such inhospitable terrain. This pdf has been designed to be compatible with both the d20 Weird Wars rules and Great White Games? Savage Worlds rules system and is the first in a range of dual-statted books from Legion publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
