							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anno Domini: Fussball</name>
									
			<description>At heart, Anno Domini: Fussball is like every other Anno Domini game: Each edition of the game includes 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which that event happened on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player receives nine cards and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place theirs in chronological order with what's already on display. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the current order of cards is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed. If the order was correct, the doubting player receives two cards and ends his turn without playing anything; if the order was incorrect, then the previous player &amp;ndash; who had accepted the order as correct &amp;ndash; receives three cards. The first player to rid himself of cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in Anno Domini as most events are rather obscure or are hard to date precisely. As you might expect, Anno Domini: Fussball contains historical events related to football (i.e., soccer for those in the U.S.), and the relationship of events to dates is not necessarily obvious. Like all Anno Domini games, the Fussball edition can be played on its own or mixed with any number of other Anno Domini editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
