			<description>Cassette Inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our super heroine Dezzy has heard on her communication console about the dastardly plot of the infinitely evil Scarthax, to pull the legendary GREAT PLUG and cause the demise of the known Universe. Dezzy has decided that her great friend and ally Ziggy will need her help to thwart the plans of the Evil Lord. We therefore, find her speeding along the space lanes in the direction of Doomsday Castle - the last known whereabouts of Scarthax. But she did not reckon with the evil genius of the Dark Lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As her intergalactic spaceship negotiates the gas clouds surrounding the star cluster Leiades, her ships computer warns her of an approaching magnetic storm. Her small ship is thrown around space as if it were in a tornado on earth. The storm is over as rapidly as it had started but the ships computer immediately indicates damage to the ships fuel tanks and life support system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dezzy examines her star maps for any sign of civilisation in the area, The only place she can reach in time before her fuel supply runs out, is an old derelict Drive In which had been built near a now disused asteroid mining belt. She turns her ship towards the DRIVE IN where she hopes she can repair her spaceship and then continue on her quest to help Ziggy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As she approaches the DRIVE IN she is surprised to see that the advertising neon lights are still flashing a welcome all over the complex. A sign indicates the entrance and she carefully docks her spaceship inside. Immediately a heavy steel door starts closing behind her. She senses danger. Dezzy is in the grip of a powerful tractor beam. The reduced power from her propulsion system cannot shake off the grip of the energy beam. Her spaceship is being drawn further inside. She realises she has been caught in a trap, and she can guess who had set it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
