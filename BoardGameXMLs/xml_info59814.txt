			<description>This boardgame is hidden into a woollen bag. In this boardgame you can be one of the heroes of folktales.&lt;br/&gt;There are four characters in the game, the strong, the clever, the lucky and the good hearted. Each player chooses one character at the beginning of the game. One player can choose the same character as another player's ; in this case you replace the character with one of the extra tokens.&lt;br/&gt;- Strong: he replaces the trials with his strength&lt;br/&gt;- Clever: he uses his brain&lt;br/&gt;- Lucky: for him every trial is equally difficult; he trusts his luck&lt;br/&gt;- Good hearted: uses his good heart&lt;br/&gt;There are several characters who accompany you. They are represented with cards and if you defeat them you can take their cards. If you have these characters first they will try to complete the trials for you. If they do not succeed then it is your turn. At the same time you can have two helpers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
