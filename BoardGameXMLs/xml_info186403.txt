			<description>The World of Khoras - Fantasy Campaign Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Khoras is, simply put, the most fully imagined, richly detailed fantasy campaign setting  on the internet. It is ready-to-use with any game system and gives the Game Master a totally new and lively setting for his or her players to enjoy. The World of Khoras is compatible with any traditional dice and paper role playing game, requires no membership and is absolutely free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Khoras is a system agnostic fantasy setting that is adaptable to any fantasy role playing system.  The world is developed and complete.  The material is presented as a series of HTML pages, including these major entries:  Site Map, Main Menu, Introduction, Civilization, Cultured Races, Physical World, Fauna &amp;amp; Flora, Magic, Religion, History, and Glossary.  Numerous maps are available, including national borders, full color geographic maps, parchment maps, and so forth.  Most maps are available in several resolutions and a few different file formats.  The maps are supplemented with a distance chart in miles between all Capital cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During 2002 the web site planned to publish a CD-ROM of the setting and attempted to become a subscription-based web site.  Neither of these efforts came to fruition.  As of 2015 the site is still freely accessible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Older versions of the site also included sections on Trivia, Tales (fiction), and Role Playing in Khoras&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
