			<description>Word Twist is a game for two teams.  Teams take turns drawing a card from the deck which will display one of five categories, some of which incorporate elements from other well-known word games.  The categories are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Nonsense - players have to answer a question on acronyms, dates, words, people or movies;&lt;br/&gt;     Word Bluff - players have to identify the correct definition of a word from three possible choices;&lt;br/&gt;     Express Yourself - players give clues to get their teammates to identify a word, but cannot say certain banned words;&lt;br/&gt;     Word Twist - both teams compete to make as many smaller words as possible from the letters of a given word;&lt;br/&gt;     Memory Time - a short passage is read from the card and questions are then asked to the opposing team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams accrue points in each round and the winner is the team with the most points after a predetermined number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box front: Word Twist: Every Word Game You've Ever Played - In One!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
