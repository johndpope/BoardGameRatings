			<description>This is designated as a &amp;quot;fun game&amp;quot; by the designer, in contrast to his simulation-type, statistics-based sports games. Players run one horse race or, recommended, a series of races on a simple track. Various race events can be run on the same course. Players secretly bet on the horses and are allowed to do so until the horses are close to the line, but odds decrease with a horse's progress. Horse movement is rolled for, with two horses moved per turn, but players have bonus movement cards to influence the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
