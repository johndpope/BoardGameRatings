							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Busy Train Memory Game</name>
									
			<description>From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;From fun with a frog to a pirate at the party - there's a new surprise to find behind every window of the busy train...but will you remember where you saw it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play:  First fit the two engine pieces together, then add the carriages/cars.  Now fit the window pieces face down, at random, into the spaces.  Shuffle the cards and place the pack face down between the players.  Players take turns to turn up a card from the top of the pack and then &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; a window.  If the window matches the card, the player leaves the window open and keeps the card.  If not, the player must close the window and return the card to the bottom of the pile.  When all the windows have been opened, the player who has collected the most cards is the winner.  For a shorter and simpler game, play with fewer carriages/cars and take away the corresponding number of window and memory cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 thick train pieces&lt;br/&gt;15 window pieces&lt;br/&gt;15 memory cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Value:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wealth of detail encourages observation&lt;br/&gt;Develops concentration and memory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Value:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amusing illustrations stimulate imagination and add to the fun&lt;br/&gt;Increase the challenge by adding carriages /cars&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another well done memory game for kids 3+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
