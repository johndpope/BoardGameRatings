							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grouping The Flags</name>
									
			<description>This is an old Parker Brothers card game of set collection. The deck consists of six groups of Flags of eight colors each (Black, White, Green, Red, Yellow, and Blue) and four Key cards. The object of the game is to collect a complete set of eight Flag cards AND a Key card. The entire deck is dealt out to the players. On your turn you may ask any player for a specific card, &amp;quot;Please give me Number Four Black.&amp;quot; If the player has the card asked for, he must give it to you and you may continue your turn by asking for another card. Your turn ends when you demand a card from a player who does not hold it. A Key card may be asked for at any time. The first player to obtain a complete group of nine cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
