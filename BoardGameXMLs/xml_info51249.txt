			<description>Bestia (The Beast) appeared in one of the issues of Joker - short magazine for gamers published in late 80's in Poland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of Bestia resemble popular Battleships in it's basic, being a paper and pencil guessing game played on sets of the same diagrams but that's where the similarities end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bestia one of the player assumes the role of the Beast - the master of a group of mosters lurking in the depths of a dark dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other player (or players) lead a small band of adventurers who seek to destroy the monsters and escape the dungeons with their treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the actual game all players secretly deploy they units (the mosters and treasure hoards/adventurers). Players in turns try to find and destroy monsters/adventurers, throwing spells and using weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
