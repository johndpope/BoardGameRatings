			<description>Three childrens games can be played with this set of letter stamps, &amp;quot;ghost&amp;quot; tins and &amp;quot;ghost&amp;quot; word cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Little Ghostly Alphabet the objective is to stamp two words.  The stamps are put in the tins.  Then each player gets a ghost card with a word on it.  The words are in multiple languages, including English. Each turn a player selects a tin, then stamps any letters which are in their word.  The letters must be stamped in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Word Searchers is a variation on Hangman, using the stamps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In G as Ghost, the stamps are again put in the tins.  Each player chooses a tin, then uses a stamp inside to either start a new word or extend a word that is already started.  Players must announce the word they are thinking of.  Other players can either stamp the letters in that word or switch to another word as long as the letters already stamped match the new word.  Only three words can be started at a time.  The game ends after five words are completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
