							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Irrelevant Clues to Bamboozle Players</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When searching a room or building players will often be looking for clues that something may be out of the ordinary or have been hidden. Signs of wrongdoing or secret compartments. Hidden or removed evidence. Seeing as they are looking for such, it seems a shame not to give them something to find, so here are 100 different such signs that they can find. None of the are relevant to what they are looking for (unless, of course, the GameMaster decides they are). All of them look as if they could be important but could have perfectly simple explanations. Explanations that may well be overlooked by the paranoid - namely players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the clues are suitable for any setting, but some will require a level of technology to be relevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paper - A completely blank sheet of paper has been crumpled up and thrown into a bin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover and one page the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
