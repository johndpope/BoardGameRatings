							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Build-A-Meal</name>
									
			<description>The children will be able to identify the major food groups and some of the foods that belong within them. The players will also recognize the idea that each meal should include food from a variety of food groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this game is to build a hand that contains all the necessary food groups in a healthy proportion: 3 cards from the Fruit &amp;amp; Vegetable Group, 2 from the Grains Group, 1 from the Dairy Group, and 1 from the Meats Group. Each card (see Card Design) contains one food item but does not identify the food group.&lt;br/&gt;Play occurs as in traditional rummy card games. All players are dealt seven cards. The remainder cards become the draw pile and are placed on the table between the players. The top card is turned over and placed beside the draw pile to create the discard pile. The first player can choose the top card from the discard pile or a new card from the draw pile. The player then discards one card onto the discard pile. Each player proceeds in this manner until one player has built a healthy meal as noted above. The Water wildcards can be used to substitute for any needed card. The Candy and Soda Cards are of no value in building a winning hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;49 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
