			<description>Galaxy was first published as &amp;quot;game in the magazine&amp;quot; in the AHA-Zeitung #87/2, the zine of several joint Swiss Playing Clubs. In winter 1987, Editoy published it as a real game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The huge board shows a universe with 6 planets, 36 space stations and about 50 meteorites. The planets are connected with thick planet routes, the space stations with thinner space station routes, and the meteorites with dotted meteorite routes. Movement is done with movement tickets, which are won by throwing a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each planet is the home planet of a player's space ship, thus up to 6 people can play a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to visit all 6 space station of the own colour and return to the home planet first. This can be rather difficult, because 18 &amp;quot;magnetic fields&amp;quot; block the same number of routes. Besides moving his space ship during his turn, a player takes any magnetic field and places it on a new route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
