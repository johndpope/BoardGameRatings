			<description>Spin Doctor: The Card game of Dirty Politics is a card game for 2 to 6 (or more) players wherein the players take on the role of candidates running for President of the United States. During the course of the game, players will accumulate votes by collecting state cards while at the same time thwarting their opponent&amp;rsquo;s ability to do the same by putting them in scandal, winning debates, being underhanded and generally behaving like a mud slinging politician!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
