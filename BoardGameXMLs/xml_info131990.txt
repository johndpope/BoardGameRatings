			<description>The Game &amp;quot;Het Groot Pretparkenspel&amp;quot; is about amusement parks in The Netherlands. The aim of the game is that each player buys, builds and manages one or more parks. Everyone gets a working capital to do this. One player controls the Central Bank. Each player buys a site belonging to an amusement park and tries to fill it up with attractions. As in reality this will not all go smoothly. Financial difficulties will arise because attraction prices will fluctuate and because players are forced to conclude transactions with the Central Bank and the other players. The visitors (players which end up at attractions during play) will pay entrance fees to the owner of the park, which will have to manage on it. Moreover, the &amp;quot;Plus-Pech&amp;quot;-cards (Luck-Bad Luck) will provide ups and downs. The game ends when all players except one are bankrupt. Alternative game ends are at a pre-determined time or property limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
