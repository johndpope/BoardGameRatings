							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pivot</name>
									
			<description>The object of Pivot is to make the highest score by isolating numbered squares on a 8X6 game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins the game with five pivot pieces and 10 claim discs.  On a turn a player rolls the dice and covers the number rolled with a pivot piece.  Because the playing pieces are of double width, two numbers are actually covered for each number rolled.  The player chooses which way the piece will &amp;quot;pivot&amp;quot;... i.e. which other number will be covered as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all five of a player's pivot pieces are on the board, a player must remove one of his previously played pieces and pivot to a new location (he cannot use a number that was just uncovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a square is isolated by having all sides covered with pivot pieces or the side of the board, it may be claimed by placing a disc within the square.  If the square already has a disc, it may be doubled up (if it's your color), or replaced (if it's your opponent's colour).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until one player has used up his 10 claim discs.  Points are scored equal to the numeric value of the square claimed (numbers covered by two discs score double).  The player who went out also scores a bonus 25 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played over a number of rounds.  High score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
