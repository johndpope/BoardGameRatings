			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Two lifetimes ago, there were no cars, trains, motor cycles or even bicycles. Horses carried people on their backs, pulled coaches, carriages and wagons. Horses were everywhere and did everything. Mail coaches carried letters and parcels; stagecoaches, post chaises, wagons and carts carried passengers between towns and cities. Horses were changed at Inns and passengers were collected, rested and fed. If you walk around the old parts of our towns and cities you will see the old Inns with their arched entrances and courtyards. Their names often remind us of their coaching past.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple roll-and-move game where your &amp;quot;coach&amp;quot; has to go round the board and collect a passenger from each four Inns. There are a few squares that make you miss your turn or go back, and &amp;quot;horse bolts down the lane&amp;quot; squares that make you go to the other side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
