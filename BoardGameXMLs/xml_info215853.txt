							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King Arthur Pendragon (Edition 5.2)</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capture the Spirit of Arthurian Legend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relive the grandeur and romance of the greatest of all legends&amp;mdash;the story of King Arthur. Assume the role of a knight starting his career in the time of Uther Pendragon, undertaking quests and perilous adventures for your lord, for your lady-love, for the Church, or for your own glory. Win great renown with your laudable deeds and feats of arms, perhaps even winning the right to carve your name into the Round Table itself as the story of Arthur and Camelot unfolds around you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its innovative rules, including the distinctive traits and passions system designed to help you in determining your character's behavior under any circumstances, Pendragon provides a unique roleplaying experience laid out against perhaps the richest tapestry in Western literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Edition 5.2 updates the redesigned and reorganized 5th Edition, and includes new material and rules changes from Greg Stafford, the creator of the original game and author of the 5th edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised 2016 edition with new layout and cover/interior art licensed from Nosolorol Ediciones (Spanish-language publisher of Pendragon).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
