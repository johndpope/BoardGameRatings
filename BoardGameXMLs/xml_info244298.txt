			<description>You are a space pirate trying to retrieve a treasure that was lost during a bitter battle many years ago. You need to return the loot to your own planet to win the game. Do you wait for them to find it and then wipe out their fleet? Or do you go for it and hope to make it back to your planet unscathed?&lt;br/&gt;movement uses dice rolls to determine how far you can go.&lt;br/&gt;movement is done with either one ship moving each dice in a single direction. or the same direction. or two seperate ships moving a direction based on one of the dice counts each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
