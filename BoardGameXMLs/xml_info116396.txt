							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Christmas Eve</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war on terror has opened on a new front &amp;mdash; Toyland is at war. The characters are all members of the Toyland Intelligence Committee Terrorism Obstruction Cell (TICTOC), sworn to defend Toyland against aggressors. The adventure centers on a plot to ruin Christmas for one little girl, something TIC-TOC can&amp;rsquo;t allow to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-shot adventure is designed to be played in one or two sessions. You can use the characters provided in the back or encourage your players to come up with their own childhood favorites and start from scratch (give them 6 advancements each, and it&amp;rsquo;s recommended at least someone in the group has Driving, Knowledge (explosives), Swimming and Climbing). We suggest you&lt;br/&gt;use a floor plan that closely mimics your own house, just make sure you include a living room with a Christmas tree, a kitchen, a bathroom, a bedroom and a set of stairs. The scale in Toyland is 1 game inch = 1 real inch. As a fun alternative to maps you can find a few suitable toys and use your actual house as a playing area. Room sizes vary greatly from house to house however so you may want to double all paces and ranges if your rooms are large to keep things Fast! Furious! And Fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
