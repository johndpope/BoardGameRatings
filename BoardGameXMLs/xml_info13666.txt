			<description>This 'Booklet' provides (8) additional pages expanding upon the initial (5)-'Races' with &amp;quot;Biological Units&amp;quot;('peoples'), '5'-MORE &amp;quot;Super Galactic Dreadnaughts&amp;quot;, '6'-&amp;quot;Star Fighters&amp;quot;-descriptions, an additional 'Chart' for use when including the previously mentioned 'forces', PLUS the *BONUS* to 'add' a 5%-chance to ALL of the DIE rolls for this 'Manual's' OWNER-it's printed right there in black &amp;amp; white! Yes, that IS a part of the 'beauty' for having paid what they were asking for this in the first place, I suppose. It should somewhat make-up for overpaying for this little 'addendum', as far as I'm concerned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some decent drawings of the 'Peoples' included(well, at least a single 'one' for EACH of the 'Races', of an individual 'Trooper'!), and it even details their individual equipment(the drawing of such), while this has &amp;quot;Starfighters&amp;quot; getting some more attention. The &amp;quot;Super Galactic Dreadnaughts&amp;quot; also have their own detailed pictures and accompanying 'specs' for all of those. Each of them has their own 'description' and some more background information is provided for all of the 'participants'. The 'Entomalians' resemble a 'humanized Alien'(from the movie &amp;quot;Alien&amp;quot;), the 'Avarians' are a 'Birdman' species, the 'Aquarian' looks 'Reptilian'(Amphibian?), the 'Terran' like an 'Earthman', and the 'Carnivoran' looks to be some sort of bigger, badder, meaner looking &amp;quot;Ewok&amp;quot; sort of 'guy'! They were even given names, as such, but you can call them whatever you prefer, if you really, really, want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Starfleet Wars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
