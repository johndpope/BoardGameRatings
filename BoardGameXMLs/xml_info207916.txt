			<description>A box with 2 games:&lt;br/&gt;1) Il nuovo gioco dell'oca&lt;br/&gt;A mix between The game of goose and Ludo. Each player tries to move his 3 geese to the end of path (2 adult and 1 child): during his turn he rolls the die and moves one goose. According to the square he lands, he can move forward, backward, roll again or move back an opponent goose to closer lake. If 2 or 3 geese of the same player are on the same square, they are safe. An adult can &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; an opponent child, a child can't &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; an opponent adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) La lepre e la tartaruga&lt;br/&gt;A racing game for 2 players, based on the Aesop's tail &amp;quot;The hare and the tortoise&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls the die and moves his figure, then he can put a tile on the path and/or move again if he lands to a tile or a square with a number. Each tile has a number between 1 and 3, with + or -: so a player will move forward or backward 1-3 squares.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after one player completes 2 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
