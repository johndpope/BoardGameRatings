			<description>La Grande Parade is a memory-based circus-themed children's (and parents') game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player will try to gather the highest number of cards within every category. Categories include Clowns, Magicians, Bears, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;difficulty&amp;quot; of the game is in deciding when to stop picking cards from a category and begin a new one. In fact, if you cannot stop a category, go for another one and then come back to the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an example: the first card is a bear, then a clown is revealed. By taking the clown, it will not be possible to take bear-cards anymore (the category is closed). So that's why a player is free to leave a card instead of taking it, which makes his turn end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When there are no cards left on the table, or none that anyone can take, the game ends and the biggest collection wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
