			<description>Wild West Exodus is a table top miniatures game set in a sci-fi filled 1800's America. Technology and greed rule the old west. Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business introduces 4 new factions to the game; The Confederate Rebellion, Dark Nation, Golden Army, and The Watchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About The Golden Army:&lt;br/&gt;The once famous explorer Ponce de Leon and his conquistadors were subjected to a mix of Watcher blood and tropical jungle water.  What they call the fountain of youth has now kept them alive for hundreds of years endlessly searching for the source.  Their influence over the Mexican people and robust army has pushed them to the door step of the country&amp;rsquo;s boarder.  The men of the Golden Army know of only one thing.  Fight until dead or until the enemy is destroyed.  This horde faction sends endless supply of men to battle.  They are led and protected by the destructive weapons of the conquistadors directing  them from the rear.  They will soon push across the border ready to destroy any army that stands in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Wild West Exodus:&lt;br/&gt;Wild West Exodus is a miniatures game played by 2 to 4 players in control of the faction of their choice.  In the world of WWX, every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  The game mechanics and rule set feature exciting game play from the first dice roll.  Each player will be allowed to field a posse of 6 to 60 models or more.  The WWX rules have been designed to allow for scaling of the game to high or low model counts without causing rules issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool.  The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice.  Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn.  The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Halo that each model possesses creates an area of assault around the miniature allowing for fast and deadly close combat.  This helps move the game along quickly and gives each fight a more cinematic feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild West Exodus also benefits from an alternating 1-3 model activation system.  This system lets both players choose the most strategic way of advancing their characters across the battle field.  This means that you never have to wait more than a minute or two before taking control of your own posse for your next activation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each posse consists of a structured army list.  All factions will have 1 Boss model, 0 to 4 Underboss models, 0 to 8 Sidekick models, and an endless amount of Hired Hands.  Heavy and Light Support vehicles also make up an army list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This really gives the gamer the option to field a force led by one mighty general commanding a horde of troops or the complete opposite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some gamers may choose to load up on skilled Sidekicks and Underbosses or go heavy on Hired Hands for a true horde army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter what option you take, the world of Wild West Exodus will engulf you in fun and excitement from your very first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
