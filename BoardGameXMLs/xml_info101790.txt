			<description>In this game teams compete to collect one card from each of three categories (Object, Action, and Creature).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each member of a team brings 5 items (together the items must all fit in the palms of the hands of the person who brought the items) and those items are then used as props for that team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a member of a team rolls the die, draws a card, and then using the props for the team (those items which each member of the team brought) attempts to get the other players of the team to guess the word on the card that corresponds to the roll of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a team fails to guess the word, the other team(s) have an opportunity to guess the word and steal the card from the team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first team to collect an Object card, an Action card, and a Creature card wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
