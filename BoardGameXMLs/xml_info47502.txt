			<description>From the publisher's website;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the Hero High Yearbook GMs will find a total of ten new students for their Hero High game. Each student is built at PL8/120 pp, making them ready-to-play characters for players in Hero High, teen hero archetypes, or potential fellow NPC students under the GM's control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following students are present in this supplement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Angst: A girl without a past, Eve wrestles daily with truly frightening powers.&lt;br/&gt;    * Bank Shot: Idalyz Melendez may be blind, but she's got all the angles.&lt;br/&gt;    * Crater: Samot is the winner of Farside City's scholarship to Claremont and its first home-grown superhero.&lt;br/&gt;    * Druid: Aeron Gwynn must try to reconcile ancient traditions with a modern world.&lt;br/&gt;    * Gravity Master: It's easy to make fun of Lawrence Smalls. Easy, but not necessarily smart.&lt;br/&gt;    * HD: Quentin Rodriguez has a great imagination and the mutant powers to share it with everyone.&lt;br/&gt;    * L33T: Shinnosuke Koyama, world-class hacker and neo-ninja.&lt;br/&gt;    * Mindforce: Tia'kim Moc Thranen, the most powerful Lor mentat in at least a generation.&lt;br/&gt;    * Ripper: Don't let Crystal Gaithers' innocent appearance fool you.&lt;br/&gt;    * Ultiteen: With a name like that, Quo-Dis has to be good, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
