							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fungal Kingdom: The Fungifolk</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fungifolk -An 8-Bit Adventures Pathfinder compatible race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re not just &amp;ldquo;fun guys&amp;rdquo;, they&amp;rsquo;re FUNGI!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to 8-Bit Adventures! Do you yearn for a simple time, when video games scrolled right and you only had to deal with 2 buttons at a time? An era when blocky, colorful, vaguely recognizable shapes made up heroes that battled odd and often confusing villains with little to no context? Then Fat Goblin Games has you covered!&lt;br/&gt; This book covers the fungifolk, the race of the commoners that make up the bulk of the populace of the once peaceful Fungal Kingdom, now ruled over by the ruthless Turtle Legion. While the Welcome to the Fungal Kingdom adventure assumes outsiders come to save Princess Persyk, it's entirely possible for some of the locals to rise up and aid any adventurers in helping to overthrow the tyranny of the Turtle King!&lt;br/&gt; Included in this book is a full racial write-up in the style of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Race Guide for the fungifolk race. Included are write ups about the race, racial traits, alternate racial traits, and specific racial options for the fungifolk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
