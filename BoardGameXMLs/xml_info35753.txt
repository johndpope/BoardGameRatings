			<description>In this childrens game the idea is for the cats to be the first to reach the cream. The game is a straight snakes-and-ladders clone with slides replacing the snakes. This means roll and move, ladders bring you forward, slides bring you backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 board game&lt;br/&gt;6 playing pieces (cats from the comic)&lt;br/&gt;1 wheel of movement&lt;br/&gt;rules (printed in lid)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was issued in a time when the &amp;quot;Pelle Svansl&amp;ouml;s&amp;quot; comic was very popular in Sweden, the only national comic of the time that could challenge Disney. Most images in the game are signed Carl-B&amp;ouml;rje (real name B&amp;ouml;rje Nilsson, cartoonist and comic magazine editor), the cartoonist who drew the comic, and the whole game could probably be credited to him (given that there is no original gameplay).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six playing pieces are pictures of main characters from the comic, Pelle Svansl&amp;ouml;s (the hero without tail), Maja Gr&amp;auml;ddnos (his girlfriend), Feta Trisse (fat and smart cat), Elaka M&amp;aring;ns (mean main enemy of Pelle), Frida (the scatter-brained one) and one of the twins Bill and Bull (the funny and dumb duo, sort of like Dupont and Dupond). A few more characters show on the gameboard and on the cover: Tusse Batong (policeman), Gullan fr&amp;aring;n Arkadien (another good-looking girl-cat) and Murre fr&amp;aring;n Skogstibble (farm cat). There are also some anonymous extra cats on the game board. All pictures follow the comic style perfectly, certainly a main feature of the game at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
