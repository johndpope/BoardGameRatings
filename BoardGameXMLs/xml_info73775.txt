			<description>From the game instructions sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a simple game designed to help the players understand and appreciate the cultures and customs of the different communities in Singapore. Through the game, the players can also learn to appreciate the importance of racial harmony in our multi-racial society.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a large paper board with a picture of Singapore island overlaid with a triangular grid. Each player takes a set of four coloured chips with stickers depicting children of different races and places them on the starting positions at four corners of the island. The object of the game is to move these pieces one step at a time to link them up in a diamond shape or in a straight line. Along the way, there are spaces marked with a star that act as barriers. If a player's piece lands on one of these starred spaces, an opponent takes a card from a stack of cards bearing questions about ethnic customs, festivals or practices in Singapore and asks the player the question. If the player answers correctly, the piece is allowed to remain on the starred space, otherwise it must return to the space it had just moved from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first printed in 1992. The text copyright belongs to the National Community Organisations Council and the illustrations copyright belows to Promotion &amp;amp; Sales Centre Pte Ltd. The game was planned and produced by the National Community Organisations Council.The game was made and printed in Singapore by Promtion &amp;amp; Sales Centre Pte Ltd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
