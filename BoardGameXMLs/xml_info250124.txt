			<description>Čtver&amp;aacute;ček is a satirical improvisation card party game for four or more players. It is played on individual rounds, so-called &amp;quot;term of office&amp;quot;. In each term of office, one player is the president (of Czech Republic), player on his or her left is the president's spokesperson and all others are journalist. The President chooses the subject of speech and, after playing the cards (statements) he/she must use them in a speech. Journalists then ask unnecessary and provocative additional questions to which the spokesperson must react promptly, even if they are far from being worthy. If his responses gets journalists offended, they give him points of shame. When a journalist buzzes, the spokesperson is satisfied. Goal of the game is gain as many points of shame as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
