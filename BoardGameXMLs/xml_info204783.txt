			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In play, the Adventuring Party will set forth from their home base, travel the countryside, fight monsters and bandits in the countryside, find ruins and explore the lost places below. With skill and luck they will return home. Their adventures will be chronicled and their heroic deeds told throughout the land&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its core, this is a campaign simulation. Few individual actions will matter much including the death of a character, the important thing is the grand story we make from these tiny actions. The goal of the game is to traverse 10 adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leader for the round decides which order the party is in and what direction they will take and what they will explore. The other players have input, but the final decision is that of the party leader. The player sitting opposite the Party Leader will take the part of Chronicler. In a three player game the Chronicler will be the person to the right of the Party leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
