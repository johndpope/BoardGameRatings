							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sandman Cometh</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sandman Cometh is an imaginative and mind-boggling text adventure game consisting of two parts. Proceeding into the second part requires the successful completion of certain tasks in the first part. Furthermore, you are supposed to be dreaming all the events taking place as they occur in shifting regions of the subconscious. Your objective? Well, you must navigate through the Palace of Dreams in search of the lost Hourglass of Infinity. Plenty of humor and fantasy, along with the expert advice of Sigmund Freud, Herman Hesse and Lewis Carroll will be your invaluable companions in this perplexing and intriguing quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
