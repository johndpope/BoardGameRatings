							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Dimensi√≥n de NITRAM</name>
									
			<description>Martin and his friends gathered to try out a strange board game someone left on their doorstep on the occasion of their birthday. Nobody knew the origin of that game but, Martin, a fan of any table game even if it seems boring, convinced everyone to play it. When they opened the board, all fo them were absorbed by an obscure portal that transported them to the Nitram's Dimension. This strange place seems to be related to Martin, however nothing is what it seems. The only thing they have in mind is that to return they must find a portal similar to the one that brought them. Here there are no friends, only rivals trying to escape this dangerous dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the players roll the dices, advance in the map, find items &amp;amp; events, fight against monsters &amp;amp; Nitrams, and travel through other portals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
