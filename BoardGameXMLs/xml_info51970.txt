							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delta Prime</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're a delta - a person with superhuman powers - you're required by United States law to register them with the government. And once you do, you become their employee for life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, some folks aren't happy working for Uncle Sam - those terrorists calling themselves the Defiance, for instance - but they don't understand that it's the greater good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Primer, you're one of the few and the proud, a stalwart hero who has decided to put aside his personal life and dedicate himself to making this country - and by extension, the world - a safe place to live in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Uncle Sam calls upon you to perform your patriotic duty, he knows you can do your part. Your're a memeber o Delta Prime, America's top delta team, and you know that you might have to do to anything for your country - anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you do it without question, because you know that it's right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's for the greater good, after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing else matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Delta Prime sourcebook for Brave New World comes packed with details about the Primers, their goals, as well guidelines for playing heroes who work for them. Included are six brand-new power packages tailor-made for Primer heroes, plus new details on Primer gadgeteers and their dreaded Armorgeddon power armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You respect the law. You registered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it's time to get to work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
