			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is not intended to be a full conversion or write up of Book 06: Deathtrap Dungeon &amp;ndash; not merely due to copyright issues, but because there is no reason not to have a copy of the original book and chances are if you are reading this you already do. So, for the preface to the adventure, and the explanation of why Baron Sukumvit is offering 10,000 gold pieces to any that can beat his Trial of Champions, please reference the source material. This conversion simply explains how each event in the original book can be run using the updated rules and Out of the Pit creatures. The relevant page references to the gamebook are included with each entry, which is structured to provide only prompts for the location, set up and adjudication of each event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copies of Advanced Fighting Fantasy RPG, Book 06: Deathtrap Dungeon, and Out of the Pit are required to use this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
