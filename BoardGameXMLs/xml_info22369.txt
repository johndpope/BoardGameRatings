							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spots</name>
									
			<description>Simple memory-based game variant.  Cardboard discs ('spots'), each with a certain word printed on one side, are placed face down on the gameboard.  Each spot has a matching card which forms a pair; these cards are shuffled and form the draw pile for gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of drawing a card and finding the matching spot on the gameboard.  Unmatched cards are placed face up in front of the drawer until the appropriate match is made.  Cards may be taken either from the draw pile, from in front of an opponent or from in front of the drawing player.  The player with the most matching pairs when all spots have been removed from the board is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a garage theme tacked on rather loosely - the 'spots' are representative of spots found on a garage floor and many of the words on the discs relate to this theme - dirty spot, wet spot, danger spot, grease spot etc.  The gameboard is the garage floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
