							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sweetest Secret</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prestigious contest of epic proportions has just been announced! A trio of baker ponies has their eyes set on the prize, yet events of the past contrive against them. Secret ingredients must be gathered, but as the three bakers get closer to their deadline, none have the time to seek them out! Perhaps a party of adventuring ponies will lend them a hand in crafting a winning recipe for the contest! Can they collect everything in time to claim a Bittersweet victory and put the rising tension to rest? Join the sweetest ponies in town as they learn the true value of friendship and hopefully pull together to win the prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sweetest Secret is an adventure compatible with the PonyFinder campaign setting and designed for four 1st level characters; PCs should reach 2nd level by its conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
