							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saloon Fights</name>
									
			<description>Saloon Fights is an Old West themed game that attempts to recreate the saloon fights as they occurred in Hollywood movies. This game isn't meant to be a realistic portrayal of fights, rather it portrays the over-the-top fights of B-grade cinema. Each player in the group controls a group of six, one is a group of hardworking cowhands and the other is a group of ne&amp;rsquo;erdowells looking for trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game map is a hex grid of the saloon and the wooden sidewalk outside. Objects inside the saloon such as tables and the bar also represented which serve as movement obstacles to the players. There are a total of three maps included with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 50 points which are allocated to the six men either as strength points or dexterity points before the fight begins. Fighting is carried out in order of descending dexterity (highest dexterity goes first). The men can be hurt, knocked unconscious, stunned, or killed and the game provides counters to indicate their status during the fight. The fight is initiated between two randomly chosen men who must throw the first punch at each other before any other characters can join in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes counters for townsfolk such as piano players, saloon girls, and the bartender, each of whom has strength and dexterity characteristics and may get involved in the fight. The game turns are timed based on the camera cuts of old Western movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
