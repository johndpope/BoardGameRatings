			<description>The sister game to Junishi, 12 Moons,Neteru, and Zodiakos,&lt;br/&gt;Haab is an abstract strategy game inspired by the Mayan Zodiac. (Each player controls 6 of the 19 signs.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Haab is to move one of your 6 pieces into your opponent's Gate, which is located at the opposite end of the board, in between your opponent's Spawn Areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin at either end of a board comprised of 23 circles. &lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game there are not any pieces on the board. Any pieces that a player wishes to use must be &amp;quot;spawned&amp;quot; in one of the Spawn Circles on that player's side of the board. &lt;br/&gt;Players may move the pieces that they already have on the board either by moving them into adjacent circles or by jumping over friendly pieces.&lt;br/&gt;Players also may use their pieces to capture their opponent's piecess by jumping over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haab is a simple and fast paced abstract strategy game that is easy to learn and usually plays in under 20 minutes. It comes in a little cloth bag that also serves as the game board&lt;br/&gt;and it can be carried in any pocket that is big enough to hold a pack of gum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haab is a complete game that can be expanded by combining it with its sister games Junishi, 12 Moons, Zodiakos and Neteru.&lt;br/&gt;(source : the publisher)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
