			<description>Now is your chance. The kingdom is falling to ruin. The land has stopped producing food, the populace is starving, and the king is powerless to help. No longer relegated to the shadows you and other Necromancers like you may emerge; offering understanding and defeat over death itself to the fearful people in exchange, merely, for their unquestioning and total obedience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to destroy all your opponents' villages and be the last necromancer left alive. Utilize the deaths of your enemies&amp;rsquo; servants or even sacrifice your own to fuel your dark magic. Use your cards to build up your villages and summon afflictions and monstrosities to set upon, attack, and destroy your opponents&amp;rsquo;.  You win when every other player is undead. Become the last in power and leave destruction in your wake. Nevertheless, beware your fallen foes--for, as a Necromancer, death is but a tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ritual, you always have a chance to come back and steal the win. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun and unpredictable cutthroat card game for 3-5 players which is easy to learn and quick to play, yet offers significant strategic depth. How can you best use the cards you've drawn? Who shall you attack first? When will you make your final move and crush all who oppose you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
