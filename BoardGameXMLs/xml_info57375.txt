			<description>Game introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Mighty Thews is a role playing game for creating pulp fantasy short stories. It requires virtually no prep, and can be played to a satisfying conclusion (including character creation) inside an hour. On Mighty Thews is an amalgam of three other great games: Clinton R. Nixon's Donjon provided the inspiration for a player-empowered fantasy game (and more than a few mechanics), Jason Morningstar's Dungeon Squad! provided the core mechanics, and PEG's Savage Worlds was a huge influence for many additional rules. The remaining slim fraction of the game I made up myself, with some help from my friends, and with influence from a host of other games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In On Mighty Thews, the players work together to create a short story (or series of short stories) about powerful characters in a fantasy setting. One player will be the &amp;quot;Game Master&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;GM&amp;quot;, and will be responsible for organizing the scenes and pacing of the story, and playing the role of the characters' opposition. The other players will play the roles of the heroes of the story. They're responsible for playing their characters in an entertaining and exciting way, and for adding content to the story that lets them show off their characters' abilities and that furthers the plot of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
