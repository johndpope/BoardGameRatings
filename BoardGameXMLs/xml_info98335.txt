			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRON was originally designed as an arcade cabinet based on events from the film. It consisted of 4 mini-games: I/O Tower (the player must use his discs to destroy bugs to clear a path to the tower entrance), MCP Cone (the player must destroy a multi-colored wall to pass through), Battle Tanks (the player must guide a tank through a maze while destroying other tanks and recognizers), and Light Cycles (the player guides his light cycle around the level trying to avoid light trails while also trying to box in the opponents.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were several styles of arcade cabinets released in 1982: standard upright,mini upright, cocktail table, and seated &amp;amp; enclosed. The cabinets featured an 8-way joystick with a firing trigger and a rotary dial to adjust the direction of the fire. This game was re-released in 2008 for XBLA with added features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
