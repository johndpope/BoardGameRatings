			<description>Basra is a fishing standard deck playing card game similar to Casino. The game plays with 2, 3 or 4 players. 4-player game are usually played in partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt four cards and four cards are played to the table making the &amp;quot;floor&amp;quot;. Jacks and 7's of diamond from the floor are shuffled back into the deck and replaced. Players take turns playing one card to the floor and capturing cards if possible. When each player has played all four cards, the dealer deals out four more to each player, unless the deck is empty in which case the round is scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captures can be made by playing a card of the same rank or a card that sums to two or more cards. Multiple captures are possible, for example a 10 would capture a 3, 7 and 10 from the floor. Queens and Kings do not have numerical value so the only way to capture them is by playing the same rank or a special card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn a Basra, worth 10 points, by capturing all the cards remaining on the floor . Players keep track of this by keeping the capturing card face up in their point pile. Jacks capture all cards on the floor, but do not count as a Basra. Jacks played on an empty floor capture nothing and remain on the floor. The seven of diamonds plays just like a jack except it earns a Basra if the captured cards add up to 10 or less. After the last card is played, remaining cards on the floor go to the player who made the last capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;The player (or team in partnerships) with the most cards receives 30 points. Ties are pushed to the next round (so 60 points could be earned).&lt;br/&gt;Jacks and aces are worth 1 point. &lt;br/&gt;The two of clubs is worth 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;The ten of diamonds is worth 3 points.&lt;br/&gt;Basra's are worth 10 points each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new hand is dealt unless someone has a total score of 101 in which case the player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie a new hand is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
