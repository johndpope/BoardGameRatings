			<description>A party and trivia game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: Board, 330 cards, 6 player tokens, card box, sand timer, 36 action chips, 34 joker chips, die, noisemaker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six categories of questions/activities, and several per category are printed on each card:&lt;br/&gt;- Pantomime - mime a word from the card, the other players guess what it is.&lt;br/&gt;- Drawing - draw a word from the card, the other players guess.&lt;br/&gt;- Taboo words - explain the word without using the forbidden words.&lt;br/&gt;- Proverbs - the active player's neighbour reads the first part of the phrase from the card, the active player has to complete it.&lt;br/&gt;- Psycho quiz - the active player chooses a partner. The partner chooses a situation from the card and reads it. The card also lists four possible answers, of which both partners choose one. The aim is to guess what the other one will choose.&lt;br/&gt;- Logic: The active player is given a logic problem to solve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is to collect one action chip per colour (colours correspond to the different categories of tasks). Action chips are collected by landing on an action space on the board and completing a task from that category. Joker chips can be earned by guessing the words other players are miming/drawing or if the player's token lands on a joker space. Three joker chips can be exchanged for an action chip of the player's choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect one action chip from each of the six different categories wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
