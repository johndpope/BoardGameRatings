			<description>Zed or Alive: The Zombie Miniatures Game is a miniature wargame rulebook and setting for use with Savage Worlds: Showdown! The goal of this game is to put a high quality, inexpensive rule set in the hands of players which allows them to play campaigns as various denizens of a post-zombie-apocalyptic world, a genre that we feel is missing an iconic miniatures game that provides a fun, compelling, yet streamlined experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zed or Alive, players choose to either start one of several human group types or they can opt to develop their own unique Virus Strain. Human groups range from standard Survivors, Military units, to even outlandish and savage Tribals. These groups will clash with each other in various Confrontation types (scenarios), all the while fending off independent Shambler zombies (classic &amp;quot;walkers&amp;quot; which are neutral, although Virus Strain players can influence their actions). Additionally, players may choose to go on solo or co-op confrontations if they do not enjoy head to head competitive play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players go from game to game, they will gain experience and level up characters, add new group members, scavenge loot to barter, sell, or even combine into custom-made gear with the new jury-rigging rules! Powerful groups can get their hands on a vehicle and attempt to get it running, giving themselves a huge advantage both in battle and between games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virus Strain players, unlike human ones, do not control a specific group of individuals, but instead control their own unique branch of the zombie pathogen. This manifests itself through mutant &amp;quot;Aberrant&amp;quot; zombies which can be controlled during gameplay, able to become part of any scenario and throw a wrench in the works. Some are pure killing machines, others are more insidious and are geared toward influencing the actions of otherwise mindless Shamblers. Instead of gaining experience, Virus Strains gain Evolution Points for inflicting carnage and chaos with which to mutate their Shamblers, different Aberrant types, or their Virus Strain as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
