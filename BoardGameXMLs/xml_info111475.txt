							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hue Turn</name>
									
			<description>Can you see your pattern on the board? If not, add a peg or make a Hue Turn to get the pattern you need to score your card! Patterns show two, three or four peg positions with complex patterns worth more points than simple ones. See how good your pattern recognition is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards each show a pattern of 2, 3, or 4 colored dots, and are divided into a 2-dot deck, a 3-dot deck, and a 4-dot deck.&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 3 cards (one from each deck), a set of double-sided Pegs (Red/Silver Pegs, Silver/Black Pegs, and Black/Red Pegs), and Green &amp;quot;Hue Turn&amp;quot; Pegs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player may either place one of their Pegs onto the board (with either color facing up), or discard a Green &amp;quot;Hue Turn&amp;quot; Peg to flip an existing Two-Colored Peg on the board.  The current player then reveals any Pattern Cards that were created by the action they took this turn, keeping them in front of them for scoring at the end of the game.  Then they refill their hand from any of the draw piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after any two decks are exhausted and all remaining players take one more turn.  Score one point for each colored dot on the cards you collected, plus 2 points for each unused Hue Turn Peg.  The highest total wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Pattern Recognition, Spatial Visualization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
