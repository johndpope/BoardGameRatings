			<description>Subtitle: A Noir-Pulp RPG inspired by the novel of the same name&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Empire State RPG. In this game, you will find rules for creating characters and situations that would be right at home in Adam Christopher&amp;rsquo;s novel Empire State or any of a number of other movies and novels set in the film noir genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using these rules, created for us by David &amp;lsquo;Doc Blue&amp;rsquo; Wendt, you and your friends will create stories that reflect that genre. You will drive narratives through the weaknesses and failures of your characters, as well as their strengths. Just as the protagonists in the source materials find themselves beaten up and betrayed before the clues start to come together, you will portray characters who suffer loss and betrayal as part of their quest for the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
