							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disney&#039;s Aladdin (Master System/Game Gear)</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia supplemented by User Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master System/Game Gear version&lt;br/&gt;This version was developed by SIMS and published by Sega, and released in 1994. The game is basically the same on both systems, except for the screen size. Gameplay in much of the game resembles Flashback: The Quest for Identity or Prince of Persia. It's a side-scrolling platform affair where the player must negotiate their way through a series of moive-themed levels such as the streets of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, the Sultan's palace and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay comes in a variety of flavours: some chase levels, where the play is running automatically, but must jump over chasms or oncoming obstacles, dodge falling objects and try not to get caught by the guards. Other levels are traditional platform-type encounters. There are also several magic carpet ride levels, these scroll automatically and Aladdin must dodge the oncoming obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
