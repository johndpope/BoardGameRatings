			<description>A memory card game by Altenburger und Stralsunder Spielkartenfabrik.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get the most points, by remembering where the four identical cards are located. &lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, he/she turns around four cards. If any of those are identical, he takes those cards. All other cards are turned around again. The turn passes to the next player, and the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When there are no more possible sets, each player score their cards: &lt;br/&gt;2 identical cards give 1 point. &lt;br/&gt;3 identical cards give 3 points. &lt;br/&gt;4 identical cards give 4 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
