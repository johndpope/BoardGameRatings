							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Animal Bird Fish Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Animal Bird Fish is an educational card game for children of all ages that helps to prepare children for reading and identifying different animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main way to play is called &amp;quot;Lucky Sevens&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;All the cards are dealt out to all the players. The dealer starts by playing a number 7 of any group; Animal, Bird, or Fish, the next player must follow suit/group and play a number higher or lower. Or he may play a 7 of any group. If you cannot play you must pass. When a player runs out of cards he is the winner. He receives a score equal to the number of cards left in the other players hands. It has a bit of a trick-taking mechanic. Players play to an amount agreed upon before the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the cards are numbered it can also be used to play Rummy, Snip and Snap - which is similar to war, and Rally-up - a game where players try to get 12 consecutive cards of one group by passing 2 cards face down to the player on their left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
