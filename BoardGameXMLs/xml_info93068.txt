			<description>&amp;lsquo;61-&amp;lsquo;65 is a fast play, Company-level American Civil War game based on the popular Song of Blades mechanics. Playable with 40-100 miniatures per side in less than two hours, &amp;lsquo;61-&amp;lsquo;65 puts you in command of a Union or Confederate Company, with a Captain and several Lieutenants, Sergeants and Corporals. Send your skirmishers ahead, keep a tight formation and &amp;ndash; wait to see the white of your enemy&amp;rsquo;s eyes before firing your volley!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three scenarios included, one for each main period of the War (1861-62, 1863, 1864-65);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple rules that require decision making and encourage keeping a chain of command;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playable in any scale, with single based models;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Profiles for Officers, NCOs, skirmishers and enlisted men for each major period;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy measuring system, no bookkeeping, minimal amount of markers;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for multiplayer battles and for playing the game as a Song of Drums and Shakos variant with as few as 6 to 15 figures (SDS required);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules for Cavalry and Artillery;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick rules for setting up a table in pickup games;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sgt. O&amp;rsquo;Reilly hints on play, formations, combat, and much more&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;61-&amp;lsquo;65 is our American Civil War ruleset, written by Sergio Laliscia. It plays at company level, meaning that a player controls a company (98 men in the game) and one figure is one man. The models move and fight as units of 4-8 men each. Smaller games can be played (with about 50 figures per player) and of course with enough players, large tables, and plenty of time, you can play much larger actions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Figures as independently based but we suggest using magnetic trays for rank and file to speed up movement. Skirmishers are independent figures. Command figures are on a separate stand containing a leader figure, a drummer and a flag-bearer. &lt;br/&gt;Other leaders are single-based. Skirmishers are represented by two single figures in front of a rank and file unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confusion/disorder in units is represented by turning the disordered figures with their back to the enemy. As corporals rally them back in line, they can recover and be turned back to face the enemy. Casualties are represented by removing figures. Units with less than 4 figures run back to the player&amp;rsquo;s baseline and can be rallied later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
