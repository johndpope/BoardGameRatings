			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping the Swamp of Doom from going over to the dark side has never been easy. The crocodile folk and the demons aren't helping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is set in Scott Malthouse&amp;rsquo;s Peakvale campaign setting. While it can be incorporated into any other T&amp;amp;T world, such as Trollworld or Elder, we recommend that you check out Trollish Delver Games for details first. The player characters should either have Combat Adds of 50 or more or be able to cast at least a couple of 3rd level spells. It is assumed that the players have survived the Temple of the Hag but the scenario can just as easily be played as a standalone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be noted that while this scenario is designed for T&amp;amp;T 7 and 7.5, it can easily be adjusted to any edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
