							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drag Show: The Contentious Drinking Game</name>
									
			<description>In this fast-paced card game each player takes on the role of a drag queen trying to out-perform her peers at the club.  On your turn you can play one card from your hand and the first player to earn 10 points of GLAM wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Show Move&amp;quot; cards, such as &amp;quot;Shimmy the Girls&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hit the High Note&amp;quot;, benefit your own performance and give you points.  &amp;quot;Bitch Move&amp;quot; cards, such as &amp;quot;Smack Talk&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Kick Her Canckles&amp;quot;, hinder the other players' performances and make them lose points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could also play nasty-sounding drink cards, such as the &amp;quot;Turd Spackle&amp;quot;, on a player which slowly gets them drunk and makes them lose points every turn until  they can pass it on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fabulous card art from Stan Yan and witty catch phrases from Layman Kingsford help to inspire players to get catty with each other in true drag queen style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
