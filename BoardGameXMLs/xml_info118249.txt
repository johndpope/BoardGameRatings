							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SFX Skills: Diabolism</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How far will some men go for power? What depths will they plunge for the sake of knowledge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diabolism. We are drawn to its classical occult horror traditions: dark-robed cultists, blood-soaked ritual sacrifice, and the ornate trappings of dark magic. Like the fodder for any good fright film, it repulses and entrances us in equal measure. The Diabolist, the master of this infernal science, consorts with demonic beings and traffics in the worst of human depredations and suffering ... He is the most base of men, and yet the most modern: One driven by ambition and amoral self-interest to betray all that is human for influence and wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFX Skills: Diabolism is the first installment in the SFX Skills series, which details a new highly adaptable system of FX for modern (and fantasy) d20 role playing. Based within the feat and skill structures common to most d20 systems, SFX Skills are easily added to almost any game with a minimum of adjustments. SFX Skills also offer the ability to run both &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo; magic games, even games consisting of elements of each, using the same system. SFX Skills: Diabolism is a self-contained toolkit for adding the dark magical tradition of Diabolism to your game, including rules for using SFX Skills, feats for controlling their access, and a new Background for scholars of occult lore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFX Skills: Diabolism was designed to be flexible and scalable for characters of 1st to 20th level, while maintaining a strong thematic focus that keeps Diabolism from becoming &amp;ldquo;just another magic system&amp;rdquo;. While particularly apropos for villainous NPCs, SFX Skills: Diabolism is relevant for heroic PCs and includes advice for &amp;ldquo;fighting fire with fire&amp;rdquo; and turning the Diabolist&amp;rsquo;s own dark skills to good ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
