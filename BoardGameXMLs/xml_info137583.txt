			<description>A license game about the childrens crime book series TKKG (Tim Karl Kloesschen Gabi, the 4 detectives including the dog...).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone spraypainted the neighbours wall. But who was it? The players (detectives) have to choose between 8 suspects that wear different coloured clothing. The culprit is determined by three upside down chips that depict the guilty ones cap, shoes etc. A player gets to see these chips by rolling three dice one to three times. When two dice show the same colour a card is drawn and the player has to do the action written on the card or give a correct answer to the question on the card. After one player has seen all three chips the game ends. The players guess which of the 8 suspects has done it. The player guessing correctly wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
