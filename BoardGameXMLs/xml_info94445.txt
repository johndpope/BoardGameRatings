							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tackle!</name>
									
			<description>Tackle! is a football (soccer) game possibly dating from the 1960s.  The object of the game is to score the most goals.  Players each have a team of 11 footballers represented by small plastic tokens.  One team is red and the other is blue.  The playing pieces fit into holes in the board which is a football pitch marked out into hex spaces.  There is a token for the football which can slot into the board or into the top of the footballer playing pieces to denote possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they may choose one of three actions: 1. Move a player with the ball up to five spaces in the direction they are facing then (optional) turn and pass the ball, 2. Move a player off the ball, 3. Attempt to tackle an opposing player.  There are additional rules governing the movement of goalkeepers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: &amp;quot;Tactical football for 2 players - move, turn and kick away!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
