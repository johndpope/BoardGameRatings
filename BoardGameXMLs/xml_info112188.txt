							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flaws</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes of fantasy gaming are perfect in every way. Except when they aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;eacute;&amp;eacute;Player's Options: Flaws&amp;eacute;&amp;eacute; introduces the concept of intentional imperfection for your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game character. From quirks like constantly stretching the truth when telling a story, to minor disabilities such as poor hearing, these optional flaws and the difficulties they cause add depth to your character&amp;rsquo;s personality and the roleplaying experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as those of us who have flaws of our own (which would be all of us!) are naturally stronger in other areas to compensate for our weaknesses, a character who takes a flaw gets an extra feat or three extra skill points. But the flaw itself bestows penalties &amp;ndash; some minor, some quite significant. Is it a worthwhile price to pay for the bonuses? Only you can decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 49 flaws presented here is fully described with the penalties your character takes for having the flaw, as well as information on how they can eventually overcome their flaw. That is, if you want to get rid of the flaw at all. The challenge of roleplaying a rogue who needs spectacles to pick locks might just be too fun to resist!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
