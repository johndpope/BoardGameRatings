			<description>Cosmo Gang the Video is a fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1991 for the arcade and 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES). There also was a release on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on August 4, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses characters from a popular redemption game released in the previous year. While the game is mostly in English, the characters in the game speak in Japanese. Unlimited number of credits can be used as long as the system is not turned off. The choice of font for the game is considered to be the same font used in both Galaga and Space Invaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts out very much like Galaga: enemies (Cosmo Gangers) enter the screen, join an attack formation and swoop down on your ships as you try to kill them for points and, in this game, powerups. 2 players can also play simultaneously. There is also an element of Gaplus where there is a Cosmo Ganger at the top of the screen with a powerup who is capable of taking 2 hits before he is killed and he drops the powerup onto whichever player's ship killed him. But as you get further in the game, it becomes less and less like Galaga (Cosmo Gangers shooting big lasers, Cosmo Gangers breathing fire, etc.) There is even an end-of-game boss (Don Cosmo) with 4 life bars to get through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cosmo Gang the Video&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
