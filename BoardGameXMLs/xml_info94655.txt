			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPECTRUM is the most advanced massive multi player game system in existence, the coronet immersion systems lets you fully experience and control your character in a verity of game worlds, and thanks to Reaction Response Recording the creatures and non playing character react like real people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes too real, the Simulated Integrated Memory Personas are generated by collections of reactions to testing and events and continue to develop in complexity as they are used and reused in the games. Some of them eventually become aware they are being used by unknown forces as pawns in some vast game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as they were created to, they react.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some seek to worship these unknown creators, and some rebel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players in Going Rogue take on the roll of SIMPs who have recently gained the ability to remember their past &amp;quot;lives&amp;quot;, orcs slain by adventures, bank staff killed by wild west robbers, Aliens killed by armored soldiers, each time used as cannon fodder for &amp;quot;heroes&amp;quot; playing games with the SIMPs being slaughtered for their entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And they have had enough of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
