							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lap of the Gods</name>
									
			<description>At the dawn of time the 8 Gods of Zzarn ruled the universe... You are trapped in a comet's time vortex and only the Gods can return you to the future IF you deliver to them the buried Crystals of Zzarn - this is your task; your future is in your own hands...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crystals of Zzarn are buried in 16 vast chambers, each of which contains 3 effigies. Each of the effigies must be delivered to the Gods who will then grant special tools and abilities to reach the crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only by holding an effigy can you transport to a new chamber - but beware - Devil Incarnations constantly sap your energy levels and will steal an effigy from you after touching you 3 times. You dare not risk the Gods' displeasure by sacriligiously losing an effigy - if you do so they will remove your magic powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From the inlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
