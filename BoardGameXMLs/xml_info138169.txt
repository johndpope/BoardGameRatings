			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; Tony Bath&amp;rsquo;s early inspiration was the force that launched ancient wargaming. With his friend Donald Featherstone, he pioneered the first table top ancient battles and the most well-known of all wargaming campaigns, the Legend of Hyboria.In 1965, he founded the Society of Ancients and it's journal Slingshot. This compilation of his work includes: The Peltast and Pila Ancient Wargaming Rules The complete book, Setting up a Wargames Campaign The Legend of Hyboria (including notes on the conclusion of that climactic campaign). Setting up a Wargames Campaign is a complete guide to setting up an ancient and medieval campaign and has chapters on: Map movement,Contact, battles and after effects, Playing with umpires and without, Supplies and replacements, Guidelines on running campaigns in other periods. As Donald Featherstone said, 'a perfect little book' &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
