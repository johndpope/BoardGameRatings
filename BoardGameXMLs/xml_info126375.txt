			<description>Essex County On Board is a version of Monopoly. All the spaces, deeds, and cards are based on locations in Essex County, Ontario on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to determine how far they move. Landing on a space gives the player the option of buying the property. When a player collects all the properties in one color group, the properties can be improved by building. When players land on a space owned by another player they must pay rent. Rent is determined by the location of the property and the number of improvements on the space. Some spaces instruct a player to draw a card which can be beneficial or harmful to the player. Players must avoid going bankrupt to stay in the game. The winner is the last player left in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
