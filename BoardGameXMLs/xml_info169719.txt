			<description>You or your team is trying to guess which of the four choices doesn't belong to the same category with others. You must also try to give the reason why it doesn't belong to that category. Categories can be nearly anything: members of pop groups, types of cheeses, different materials etc. You or your team gets two points for right guess and additional point for the right reason, which you can find from the card. The team that first gets to 15 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is deck of 60 cards in a nice tin box. Two cards has the rules and every other card has six different categories with four choices on each. Right answers are bolded, so the player reading the card, can't participate on that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
