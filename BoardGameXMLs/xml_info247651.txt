							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: WW II â€“ Curtiss P40 Warhawk</name>
									
			<description>The Curtiss P-40 Warhawk was an American fighter and ground attack aircraft used by the air forces of 28 nations during WW2, serving as an air superiority fighter, bomber escort and fighter bomber. The P-40 performed surprisingly well as an air superiority fighter, at times suffering severe losses, but also taking a very heavy toll on enemy aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Special Pack is a ready-to-play large size model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards, as well as specific rules and components necessary to use the airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
