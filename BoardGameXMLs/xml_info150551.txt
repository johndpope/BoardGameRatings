							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Appalachian Trail</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the 1920's and the Appalachian Mountains! You have been commissioned to create a section of the Appalachian Trail, something that will eventually extend 2,200 miles through 14 states! It is your job to forge the best trail possible, with varying terrains to cross, scenic views, and majestic native wildlife. Unfortunately, others have also been commissioned to create sections of the trail and might try to stop you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Appalachian Trail each player is given a section of the trail to complete. This is accomplished by matching up similar terrain cards to each other. However, your opponents might put an obstacle in your path, forcing you to change the direction of your trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also trail improvements that increase the value of your section of the Appalachian Trail so that it attracts more hikers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completing your trail first is important but winning is based on victory points which are accumulated through: trail completion, longest trail, set collection, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
