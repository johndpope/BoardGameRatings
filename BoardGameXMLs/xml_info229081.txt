			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it goes down.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 10 white cards in their hand. Whomever masturbated most recently is named the first ROC or Reader of Cards. After a thorough hand washing, this person draws and reads a red card out loud. Each player (not the reader) then passes their &amp;ldquo;funniest&amp;rdquo; white card face down to the ROC. Once all white cards are received the ROC reads each white card out loud in context of the red card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ROC chooses which card they believe to be &amp;ldquo;funniest&amp;rdquo; and gives the red card to the player that played that card. Play moves around in a circle until: abs are wrecked from laughing, someone passes out, or the majority pusses out. Person with the most red cards at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
