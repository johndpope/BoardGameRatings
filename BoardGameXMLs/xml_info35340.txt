							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pokémon Poké Ball Flip</name>
									
			<description>It's a Pok&amp;eacute;mon-filled game of fun and action as you try to be the player with the most cards when the timer signals the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn over a card from your stack to see if its number is higher than the &amp;quot;number to beat.&amp;quot;  If it is, you get all the cards that have been played so far and are closer to winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Ash shows up, a totally different kind of action begins.  You get three tries to flip a card on the special Pok&amp;eacute; Ball paddle.  Complete the challenge and your stack of cards will grow even more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
