			<description>The Higgs Boson, be the first to find it.&lt;br/&gt;Higgs Boson, a board game where you control photons, electrons even neutrons and blast your way to victory.&lt;br/&gt;Only one scientist can win, make sure it is you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may move 1 unit each go, except when moving Electrons. A player may move 1 electron 2 zones or 2 electrons 1 zone during their turn. Neutrons move across the flat sides of zones, and may move as many zones a a player likes until it runs into another unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with 3 photons, 1 for each colour. Photons may only land on zones of the same colour. Photons travel in straight lines and move across the points of zones. Photons travel like a wave so while they travel in a straight line from point to point, they only come into contact with the board on the appropriate coloured zones. Like Neutrons, Photons may not pass through a zone occupied by another unit. Your Scientist may only move 1 zone per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the units can move in any direction in keeping with their movement properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on your another players unit you 'take' them, you move into the space and the 'taken' unit is removed from the board. If your Scientist is killed you are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Higgs Boson is hidden in the middle of the board. The first player to find it by landing their scientist on it is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
