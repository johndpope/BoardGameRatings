			<description>LOOKING FOR A NEW EXPERIENCE?&lt;br/&gt;Physics puzzles are definitely one of the most popular game genres on the app store. While most of these puzzles take place in simple 2d worlds (angry birds, cut the rope, etc&amp;hellip;), Nitako&amp;rsquo;s Save Toshi pulls ahead of the competition by providing a brilliant 3d take on that genre, one that can easily be compared to the Wii&amp;rsquo;s hit game Boom Blox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ME LOVE TO DANCING!&lt;br/&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s story revolves around a cute fictional anime character called Toshi San, who loves to dance and needs your help to get to a proper dance-floor. The player&amp;rsquo;s goal is to help Toshi get to the dance-floor area by shooting and smashing down the different types of blocks she is standing on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUPER SIMPLE:)&lt;br/&gt;The intuitive controls that are incredibly simple to pick up. To shoot, tap your finger on the target. To rotate your view, just drag your finger around, THATS IT! Save Toshi has an easy and straightforward learning process with detailed in-game tutorials and there is also a hint system to help you with even with the most challenging levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUPER CHALLENGING!&lt;br/&gt;The level design uses a wide variety of game-play elements (different materials, explosives, hinges, and more) to create 100 mind-boggling physics puzzles. To rule the leader-boards, the player needs to solve all levels with as few shots as possible and while the game starts out with extremely easy tutorial puzzles, later levels can be insanely difficult to score perfectly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
