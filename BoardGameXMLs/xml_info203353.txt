			<description>QuickWits 2 is a great way to get the party going! It's easy to learn, fun to play and things get dirtier faster than you think when the clock is ticking! A category may seem simple to you at first glance, but under pressure &amp;quot;the struggle&amp;quot; is real and you and your friends will spit out some really funny answers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some ADULT themes so be careful who you buy for. We recommend 17 and over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Acquire as many cards as you can possibly can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it works:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One by one, players draw a card and place it face up on the table.&lt;br/&gt;Each card contains a category and a symbol on it.&lt;br/&gt;When two symbols on the table match, the players race to give examples of the category on their opponent's card. The first to do so gets to keep that card.&lt;br/&gt;Pay attention because matches happen often and quickly.&lt;br/&gt;Once an answer has been said it is no longer valid for the duration of that game. This makes things much more interesting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
