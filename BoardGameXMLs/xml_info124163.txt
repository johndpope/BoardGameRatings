			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemy planes are not the only things hunting in the sky&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early winter, 1918. You are members of the Royal Flying Corps stationed near the Front and rumour has it, the next big push is about to begin. The squadron&amp;rsquo;s being worked to death, and its champion ace is on the verge of cracking up. Meanwhile the new Hun Circus is racking up kill after kill &amp;ndash; but is it the enemy or something else that&amp;rsquo;s to blame?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sortie into Hunland to tackle an observation balloon ends in a fierce scrap with Jasta 32. Great winged beasts, agents of Death itself, are glimpsed flying in and out of the clouds. On the ground, flying ace MacMurdo knows more than he&amp;rsquo;s letting on but he is on the edge. Reporting it to Command won&amp;rsquo;t do any good, but talking to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, military journalist, might. Combat takes its toll, and the date of the Push draws near. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to make the skies safe and not just from the German planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
