			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With less access to VK-driven technologies, SSU engineers have had to invent other means to combat the powerful walkers deployed by their Axis and Allied foes. Their response? The Dust Tactics: IS-5 Heavy Tank comes equipped with serious SSU firepower in both of two Damage Resilient configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built to deal with serious threat of enemy aircraft, the Mao Zedong controls a battlefield at range with its Quad 85 mm AA Gun. These powerful guns are deadly to enemy aircraft and can be used effectively against ground targets as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the SSU has long considered artillery the most important weapon on the modern battlefield. Since the beginning of the war, fielding these huge guns has proven a successful tactic for the Soviets, one which they see no reason to stop now. The second configuration of the IS-5, the Vladimir Lenin, is a powerful artillery platform, capable of reducing enemy targets to rubble with its massive 252 mm field mortar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
