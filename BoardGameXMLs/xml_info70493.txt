			<description>This is a game of lists. Each round a question is read out. Questions don't have a single answer, but rather a list of possible answers. Then each player places a bet on whether they think they know more answers than the other players. The round continues as each player gives one answer around and around the circle until there is only one player still able to continue answering. This player is the Last Man Standing, and earns points based on the size of their bet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
