			<description>(From the game's Consimworld folder)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Royale is the first in a series of games dealing with campaigns of famous 18th century military leaders (Frederick the Great and Marlborough among others).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Royale is a simple wargame about the First Silesian War, 1741-42. The campaign marks the debut of Frederick the Great's military career, however inauspicious this was for him personally. The war began with Prussia taking advantage of a perceived weakness of the new and first Queen of Austria, Maria Theresa, when she assumed the throne. Bavaria, France, and Saxony contested Maria's claim to the Austrian crown, as well as having long disputes over their borders or policies of the Austrian empire. Prussia sought to claim the rich province of Silesia from Austria and in a whirlwind (for the time) campaign in 1740 seized virtually the entire province. Prussia's Allies took longer to mobilize their forces and work out the disputes they had with one another to form a coalition to defeat Austria and overthrow its new queen. A long era of war in central Europe was about to begin. Can you do as well, or better, than your historical counterparts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the &amp;quot;chit-pull&amp;quot; system with a deck of cards similar to Paul Rohrbaugh's Pocket Battle Games series from Against the Odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
