			<description>From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;I just want to say thanks to anyone who even has taken a peek at this to see if it is worth a damn! When making this game, I honestly made it for me and then decided to share it with others. There are several great zombie games out there and this is not a project saying that I can do it better, merely I love Savage Worlds, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a zombie game for it that &lt;br/&gt;had everything that I was looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may find yourself looking through this and saying, &amp;quot;Hey! This is EXACTLY like something from this zombie movie!&amp;quot; or game or whatever. And guess what, you are probably right. I borrowed from many zombie and survival horror movies, books, games, comics, or whatever. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken things I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed about the genre and plopped them all into this campaign setting. At the end of this booklet I give a full list of all the things that have influenced my setting. On that note, a hearty thank you to all those who have worked so hard to create some amazing pieces of art in the zombie and survival horror genre! We would not have our love for the hordes of undead or the tingling sensation down our back without your love and care!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soooo.. What do you need to play Wrath of Zombie&amp;copy;? Just this little thing here and Savage Worlds Explorer&amp;rsquo;s Edition (SWEX)!&lt;br/&gt;Note: Having the Savage Worlds Adventure deck can add some fun to your Wrath of Zombie&amp;copy; game, but isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoy it and have some fun with it! If not, oh well. I tried!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
