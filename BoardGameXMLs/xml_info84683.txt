							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pub Crawl: Take the Edge Off</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Recently, you and your friends participated in a semi-annual event in your city: the pub crawl. There were good times, there were bad times and, as is often the case, now you&amp;rsquo;re all sitting around swapping stories from that day. Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t laugh remembering the blush on Penelope&amp;rsquo;s face when she realized that the bartender offering her a virgin mimosa wasn&amp;rsquo;t commenting on her sex life? And all the guys wince every time Tex points out that he got hit in the junk with a baseball bat while defending Bambi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since alcohol was involved, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need some help from your friends to remember the details of what happened that day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entry in 2010 Game Chef Design Competition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
