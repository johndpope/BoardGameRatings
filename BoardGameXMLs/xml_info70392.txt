							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from the Witch!</name>
									
			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Both players roll the die.  The player with the highest number goes first, and chooses whether to be Hansel and Gretel OR the Wicked Witch.  Both players place their markers on their own Start squares.&lt;br/&gt;- On your turn, roll the die and move your marker that number of squares.&lt;br/&gt;- You can move in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;- If you land on a sweet, play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IF YOU ARE HANSEL AND GRETEL:&lt;br/&gt;- You must go through the cookie house then back home before the Wicked Witch catches you.&lt;br/&gt;- You can follow the trail of white pebbles or the trail of breadcrumbs to escape from the witch.&lt;br/&gt;- You need the exact number to get home.  If the number you roll is too high, move backwards the remaining number of squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IF YOU ARE THE WICKED WITCH:&lt;br/&gt;- You must catch Hansel or Gretel by landing on the same square with the exact number.&lt;br/&gt;- You cannot follow the trail of white pebbles or the trail of breadcrumbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over either when Hansel and Gretel get back home, OR when the Wicked Witch catches them!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
