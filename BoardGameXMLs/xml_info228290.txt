			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players. A game of social advancement in 17th century France in which players, by means of the purchase of ennobling offices, advance their bourgeoisie families into the aristocracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player builds up 1 family at a time.  Once a family has been ennobled and has an income of 30+ silver per turn from investments, it is retired and the player must start a new family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck comprising card types:  Families, Trade, Bonds, Land, Offices, and Events. The Land, Bond, and Office types are collectively called Investments. Most cards have a value and may also have special characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity track has a place for the deck and 10 cards to be laid out: &lt;br/&gt;Discard | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | Deck&lt;br/&gt;A card&amp;rsquo;s position on the track is the cost in opportunity tokens to take it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 different types of Common Markers: silver coins, gold coins upgrade markers and opportunity tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 1 random family card in play and with 1D10 Silver. &lt;br/&gt;10 cards are laid randomly to each of the 10 spaces on the opportunity Track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn divided into 9 phases: &lt;br/&gt;1.  Family Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If you have no family card in play you may put one in play from your hand at no cost. You may have a max of 1 non-retired family card in play at a time.  Cards in play are placed face up in front of you. &lt;br/&gt;-   You may put a trade card in play for gold equal to its value. You may not put a trade card into play if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a family card in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Revenue Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Gain Silver equal to the combined value of every card you have in play for your most current family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Fate Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Gain 1D6 Opportunity Tokens (OT).  OT can be saved from turn to turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Opportunity Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may buy cards on the Opportunity Track using your OT. Place these cards into your hand. A card&amp;rsquo;s position on the track is the cost in OT to take it. Some Event cards are resolved as soon as you buy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.  Capital Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard one or more cards from your hand. Gain silver equal to the value of the discarded cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.  Conversion Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Convert silver to gold. Every 10 silver converts into 1 gold. Keep the change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7.  Investment Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If you have a trade card in play with your current family, you may buy Land and/or Bond cards from your hand. These cost gold equal to their value. A family may have multiple Land and Bond cards in play. &lt;br/&gt;-   If your current family has at least one Land in play, you may buy an Office card for gold equal to its value. A family may not have more office cards in play than land cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8.  Noblement Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If your current family has at least 1 office and is making 30+ Silver per turn, it may retire. &lt;br/&gt;-   If it is making 50+ Silver per turn, you must retire it, even if it has no office. &lt;br/&gt;-   Set the retired Family aside in its own stack.&lt;br/&gt;-   When retiring, you must discard all your gold.  &lt;br/&gt;-   Next turn you may start a new family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9.  End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &lt;br/&gt;-   If there is a card in the 1 spot on the Opportunity track discard it. Then slide all the remaining cards down from 10 to 1 filling in all empty spaces on the Track.  Flip over cards from the deck to fill in empty spots (starting with the 10)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a turn ends and there are no cards left in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score Prestige Points (PP) for each of your families. A family gets PP equal to the value of its Lands and Offices. If a retired family has no Offices it gets -5 PP. Get an extra +5 PP for each retired family you have after the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most Prestige Points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
