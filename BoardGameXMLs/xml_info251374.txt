			<description>Ever wanted to know what it was like to work for the Easter Bunny the week before Easter? Well, hop to it and pray that you don&amp;rsquo;t have a bad hare day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scrambled Eggs: A Dexterity Game requires a minimum of two players, but is better with more&amp;hellip;just bear in mind that it requires real eggs to play, so you might want to get eggs cheep &amp;ndash; preferably in multiples of twelve as they are usually cheeper by the dozen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will prepare the eggs ahead of time (removing the yolk and whites leaving the shell), color as they please and they are ready to begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will scramble to get as many of the eggs from the central playing area into their own bowl. Using chopsticks, players transfer the eggs to their bowl. If an egg cracks, points will be deducted from their total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when all eggs are removed from the central bowl.  Players should play the best of three rounds with as many intact eggs that remain. The player who has obtained the most eggs over the three rounds, minus the eggs the player broke, scores the most points and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission for the April 2018 24-Hour Game Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
