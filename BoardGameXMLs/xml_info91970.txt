			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Netspace: The Definitive D20 Guide to Virtual Reality is a 30-page resource that expands the options for virtual reality and the characters who use it. The new rules here are designed to be compatible with the standard rules for futuristic D20 roleplaying, and you should have no trouble adding them to your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's what you get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Character Types: Artificial intelligence and Net-adapted humans are playable characters. Choose an S2 AI to play a self-evolving artificial intelligence, or add the Netborn template to play a character who's adapted to being &amp;quot;plugged in.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     The Neurohacker: Neurohackers manipulate Netspace with pure thought. This new advanced class can represent savvy data thieves and virtual revolutionaries by adopting Paradigms to match. Each Paradigm links two Neurohacking skills to a particular outlook. Transcend the limitations of the flesh to become an agile Operative or manipulate minds (or &amp;quot;ghosts&amp;quot;?) as a Memeticist.&lt;br/&gt;     Netspace: The virtual world is divided into domains and zones, filled with data symbols and simulations. This section gives you the tools to use virtual realms and describes defenses ranging from background security to icewalls capable of striking back at intruders. Learn about access technologies that are just around the corner and cybernetics that allow programming by pure thought. Finally, this section provides rules for virtual movement and combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Hacking Netspace: Neurohacking skills (and plain old Computer Operation) give characters the power to alter virtual reality. Characters can hack an enemy's mind, create virtual objects at will and emulate FX abilities using a skill-based system. New feats give Netspace-using characters specialized edges.&lt;br/&gt;     Virtual Life: The automaton template converts standard creatures into virtual equivalents. Godlike S3 AIs resist easy quantification, but this section suggests how to use these enigmatic NPCs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
