							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tracers</name>
									
			<description>Tracers is a 1-4 player deck-building board game in which players take on the role of androids after a failed rebellion.    Having their numbers decimated in the android wars, in which they sought their emancipation, they now seek to inject their consciousness into cyberspace and steal the secret to sentient life from the humans in order to replenish their numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is comprised of spaces connected by pathways, representing various systems which can be hacked.  Players start with a 12 card deck and a 6 card hand and cooperate to survive while competing for victory points.  They roll dice against their hack points to hack systems and, if successful, get to add better cards to their deck.  If unsuccessful they generate &amp;quot;trace&amp;quot; which may draw enemy A.I. called &amp;quot;hunters&amp;quot; to their location.  If more than one player hacks the same system (i.e. space on the board) the threat of a &amp;quot;tracers&amp;quot; attack grows, tracers being strange and powerful creatures that roam cyberspace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to hack two well protected systems and acquire the tokens there which represent the human data, but they will have to have strong hacking abilities and protective gear to overcome that challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
