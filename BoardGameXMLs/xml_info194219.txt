							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Graveyard at Lus Expansion 01</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first of the 13 FREE Expansion products for The Graveyard at Lus, a supplemental product for The White Star RPG. In this Expansion, we provide a STARSHIP RECOGNITION GUIDE, allowing you to compare starships against each other. Also included is a complete listing of all starships from The Graveyard at Lus in one document. A new alien race, the Kaliban, is included, including a full Player Class options to play the Kaliban Proselytizer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship hex silhouettes and tokens in this product are currently incomplete and will be completed shortly (and are marked as &amp;quot;in progress&amp;quot; within the document). Individual hex tokens are being created for each of the starships listed in this expansion in single image formats to allow them to be used in virtual tabletops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
