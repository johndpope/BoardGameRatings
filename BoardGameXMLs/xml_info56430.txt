			<description>This children's matching game, published by Djeco, has 3 sets of large player mat type cards with busy, whimsical illustrations which are divided by a grid, and a set of smaller, matching, image tiles for each illustration.  One player draws a tile and describes the image on it while the others search for the matching grid space on their player mats.  The first to correctly identify the matching space wins the tile, and the player with the most matching tiles at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great game for children who are developing oral language skills or vocabulary, and would be fun with any age to practice a foreign language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules come in 8 languages and the game itself is language independent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game suggests an age of 6 and up, but I think that this game could easily be used with much younger children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
