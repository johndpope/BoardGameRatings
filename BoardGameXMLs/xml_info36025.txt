							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">F-14 Tomcats</name>
									
			<description>Descriptions from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Solo Dice Game. Simulation of an American solo F-14 Bombing Mission in the Middle East circa 1987. Pretty much like Microprose F-15 II. No realism, I think no Tomcat would do a solo bombing mission.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mission: The mission consists 25 waypoints, first and last of which is home base. Draw the waypoints as circles connected with lines on a piece of paper. There are two targets in a mission, primary and secondary targets. First target is 2d6 waypoints from the 1st waypoint, the second 2d6 waypoints from the first target. Roll on the target table to determine what the targets are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Scoring: Keep a running tally of points and kills while you play. You get awarded medals and promotions accordingly. You start with no medals and at a rank of 2nd Lt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for a two-player cooperative variant are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
