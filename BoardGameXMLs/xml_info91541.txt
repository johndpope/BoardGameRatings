			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;To Brie or Not to Brie! A cheesy expansion for I Drank What?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fancy a bit of cheese with that wine? It is the party of the year. And what fancy dinner party, even one where the guests are dropping like flies due to some poisonous misadventures, is complete without a little cheese?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Brie or Not to Brie! is an eighteen-car expansion for I Drank What? The Game of Wine, Poison and Comedy, that introduces Cheese cards to the mix.  So grab a plate and take a slice, because a little bite of cheese might just save your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of Cheese cards (Stinky Cheese, Runny Cheese and Sharp Cheese). Cheese cards are played to the table in front of players as protective items. Once in play, a cheese card can be discarded by a player in lieu of revealing her Wine Card during a Toast or Drink Challenge, potentially saving her life. Each cheese card also offers a special ability:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Runny Cheese - While this card is in play, your wine card may not be moved or stolen.&lt;br/&gt;     Sharp Cheese - While this card is in play, you draw 2 cards (instead of just 1) when you survive a Drink Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;     Stinky Cheese - While this card is in play, you may not refuse a Drink Challenge nor may a Drink Challenge issued by you be refused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can only have one Cheese card in front of her at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion also adds three cheese-related Action cards: The Cat's Eaten It! (discard a Cheese card in play), The Cheese Stands Alone (discard all other players' Cheese cards), and Rats! (steal a Cheese card from another player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion contains 18 cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3 Runny Cheese cards&lt;br/&gt;     3 Sharp Cheese cards&lt;br/&gt;     3 Stinky Cheese cards&lt;br/&gt;     3 The Cat's Eaten It! action cards&lt;br/&gt;     3 The Cheese Stands Alone action cards&lt;br/&gt;     3 Rats! action cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
