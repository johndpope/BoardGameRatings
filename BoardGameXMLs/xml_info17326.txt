			<description>A Japanese card game. The game consists of 110 regular playing card sized cards and a one-page rules sheet in Japanese. The game is similar in play to Uno. Each player plays one card in turn, matching against the last card played in color or value, or drawing a card if not able to do so. The first player to go out scores 0 points for the round, with the remaining players scoring points for the cards remaining in their hands. The game is played in a series of rounds until one player has scored 500 or more points. When that happens, the player with the lowest number of points wins. If a player happens to score exactly 500 points, his score is halved to 250.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
