			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord of the Rings: Journey to Rivendell first appeared in a 1983 Parker Brothers catalog as a 'coming soon' game for the Atari 2600. Unfortunately it was never released due to copyright issues leading many to think that the game was never built. Twenty years later, a former Parker Brothers employee gave a prototype of the game to the operator of the AtariAge website. Surprisingly, the game was quite complex and seemed to be complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game essentially recreates the action from Book 1 in The Lord of the Rings novel. You play the roll of Frodo Baggins trying to safely journey from Hobbiton to Rivendell while being relentlessly pursued by Dark Riders. You may use the ring to hide from spying birds but this also speeds up your pursuers. You may also meet several characters from the book including Sam Gamgee, Strider and Gandalf, along with the usually neglected characters of Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel who all give you special powers to aid you in your flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
