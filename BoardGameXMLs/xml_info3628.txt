			<description>&amp;quot;Bold Frogs&amp;quot; is a memory game where each player tries to be the first to fill their board with 10 frogs.  On their turn, they choose two frogs from 60 tiles placed face down.  If the two tiles are consecutive, they choose a third. If this too matches, they can place the three frogs on their board or keep trying to get more matches. If they miss, all frogs are returned to the table (a bit like Can't Stop).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a also a variant for older children and adults that allows players to find matches solely to remove frog tiles form the game and make it impossible for others to complete their board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a good game and one that adults will like to play with children in the same way as Zapp Zerapp or Zicke Zacke H&amp;uuml;hnerkacke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
