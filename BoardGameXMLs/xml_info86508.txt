			<description>From &amp;quot;How to Use This Book:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces you to the world of Krynas and the DarkLore campaign setting. It provides you with all the basics to begin adventuring. Within you will find details of the player character races, basic classes and a beginning selection of career classes. There are new systems for skills, combat and to represent your character&amp;rsquo;s growing political influence. The world of DarkLore is introduced, and you are provided with brief introduction to the lands, peoples and powers of the world. Combined, this information should give you the bare minimum to begin adventuring in our world. Further supplements will cover the different areas of the continent of Krayn in greater detail, providing new classes and other game material alongside details of the major players and important locations of region. We will also unveil the story arc of the campaign, as the Cloak of Acheron descends upon the world. You will have the chance to play out the roles of the chosen heroes of your own fantasy novel, customising and shifting the story arc and moulding it to meet the needs of your own game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
