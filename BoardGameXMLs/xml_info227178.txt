			<description>Schwarzer Peter or Black Peter is the anti-Santa Claus, a character who comes along and punishes the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; kids while Santa doles out presents to the ones who've been good. This 19th Century gambling game uses Black Peter as a theme for a roll-and-move race with particularly nasty penalty spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has a 70-space track, with 28 square spaces around the edge of the board, and then two concentric rings of spaces (large and illustrated 33-44, small colored spaces 45-68) with 69 and 70 along with Black Peter in the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by any number and uses two dice. Anyone who rolls double 1 or 2 gets to roll again. There is an initial ante, and various spaces call for fines to be paid or bonuses received, either to/from the pot or other players. Spaces 12, 21, 25 and 28 make players go back to 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone who lands on 35 must take the Black Peter token and is out of the game, while other spaces give players a black token - and three black tokens also eliminate the player. Any player that runs out of money along the way is eliminated too. First player to 70 collects the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
