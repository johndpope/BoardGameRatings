			<description>In Bibi &amp;amp; Tina: Tohuwabohu Total, the players play together with Bibi and Tina to successfully hide Adea from their relatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have hidden cards in front of them, and during the course of the game, the players try to figure out which cards they have, then exchange bad cards for better ones. But they do not have unlimited time as the pursuers are on their heels. In order to win the game together, at the end of the game the value of the good cards of all players must be higher than the value of their bad cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
