			<description>The Creditor's Deal is a card game created by the Frandzel &amp;amp; Share law firm as a gift for their clients.  The theme is building a portfolio of loans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt seven cards, and the rest of the cards go into a draw pile.  On their turns, players check their hands for completed loans (a loan card and matching collateral card, or these two plus a guaranty card for higher-value loans) and then lay the cards down face-down in their portfolio.  They then either draw a card from the draw pile or take the top card from the face-up discard pile.  If they have more than seven cards, they must now discard down to seven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other cards can help complete loans, take away money, steal card from other players, steal or protect completed loans or cause another player's loan to be auctioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the draw pile is gone.  Players add the value of all their completed loans and subtract regulatory or legal fee cards and any unplayed completed loans they hold.  The player with the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
