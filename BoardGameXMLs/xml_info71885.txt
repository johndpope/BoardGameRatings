			<description>(BGG description:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chandler Tedholm's Tactical Surface Combat rules replace the original War in the Pacific Surface-Surface Combat Display with what amounts to a complete tactical naval game system, explained in a mere six small-format pages of rules, and taking not much more time than the original combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of the abstract &amp;quot;move by numbers&amp;quot; system of WITP, the players move the actual task forces on a hexagonal hexmap corresponding to one hex on the WITP map (with simple rules on how represent terrain appearing on the WITP map), 30 hexes across.  The rules use the WITP counters and combat results use the original WITP tables.  Gunfire combat is simultaneous and accounts for target size and speed, gun range (by ship type), and facing. Command control and fog of war are covered as well, so the rules can deal with both day and night combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules come with no less than eight separate scenarios covering major engagements of the Pacific War so they can be played even outside a WITP game: Java Sea, Savo Island, Cape Esperance, Guadalcanal I &amp;amp; II, Tassafaronga, and the Komandorski Islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Chain_of_Command issue 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the introduction:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of surface combat in the original War in the Pacific have nothing whatever to do with the actual operation of modern warships. [...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This alternative set of rules has been designed to impart some of the tactical flavor of WWII naval combat.  At the same time, an effort was made to keep the complexity ot a reasonable minimum.  [...] With practice, it is hoped that it will not take any more time than the routine it replaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules will rectify a few of the inconsistencies in War in the Pacific. They will introduce the players to the awesome Japanese Long Lance torpedo. [...]  In addition certain ship types will be restored to usefulness, such as Japanese CL's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope this effort adds to your appreciation and enjoyment of SPI's classic monstergame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
