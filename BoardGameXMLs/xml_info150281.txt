			<description>Grid-Hammer is a tabletop game for 2 to 4 players that's played on a 9x9 square board called the &amp;quot;Grid&amp;quot;. The object of the game is to move any one of your ten pieces across the Grid and past your opponents' defenses, then exit with this piece off the opposite side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces move, climb, rotate, capture, transform, and combine into new hybrid pieces as they surge across the board and off the Grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grid-Hammer is themed on the Grid itself. What would an ecosystem populated by grid creatures look like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
