							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower 6</name>
									
			<description>Tower 6 is played on a board showing 51 hexes. 24 of them are colored with 4 different colors and they constitute the four regions, where new playing pieces enter the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;1 normal 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;1 colored die (4 sides with 4 different colors, 2 sides wild)&lt;br/&gt;10-12 stackable playing pieces (depending on the number of players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to be the first player, who can build a tower of 6 own pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with an empty board. During a turn, a player can enter a playing piece on the board, move a piece that's already there or attack an opposing piece (or tower).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entering the board is very critical in this game. The location, where a playing piece can enter, is determined by the throw of both dice, but that space should be empty - or you either loose one of your own pieces/towers or your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore moving away from such entering spaces is important, but entering lots of new pieces or attacking opposing pieces is what leads to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is determined by a die roll, but the die is only needed to fix the direction, where a piece can move. &lt;br/&gt;And attacks are even handled without using any die: they are simply decided by the height of the 2 involved towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tower 6&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Color Guard&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Stronghold&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Where To?&amp;quot; are 4 games from Ronald Corn from the 80ies that never found a publisher. They all had interesting mechanics and/or inventive victory conditions - but they had no theme! Since they were not pure abstract games (they used dice, cards or tiles as random elements), this lack of a good theme could be well have been the main reason, why they were never published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
