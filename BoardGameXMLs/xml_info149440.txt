							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enigmata: Stellar War</name>
									
			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this final installment of Enigmata, you control a space base. You purchase and strategically position an array of ships so as to defend your base from an ever increasing number of incoming enemy vessels. Your ships increase in rank as they kill enemies and can also be upgraded using coins you gather from the battlefield. There is a much stronger boss ship to defeat at the end of every stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features some shared content in which you get to fight against space bases created by other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
