			<description>The Van Gogh &amp;amp; Friends Art Game contains thirty six oversized cards. Each card shows a color illustration or detail from paintings by VanGogh, Gaugin, Cezanne, Seurat, and Toulouse-Lautrec. The cards come with rules for &amp;quot;Go Fish for Art&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Masterpiece Memory.&amp;quot; In &amp;quot;Go Fish for Art,&amp;quot; each player tries to collect sets of six cards by the same artist. In &amp;quot;Masterpiece Memory&amp;quot; the cards are spread out face down. Each player flips three cards. If the three cards are by the same artist, then the player collects the cards. The cards are also color coded by artist to aid in set collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with an art book that describes the period, a time line, biographies, and some information about each painting in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Renaissance Art Game and Impressionist Art Game have the same mechanics as this game, but with different art work on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
