			<description>Fisticuffs! is a free-for-brawl fighting card game created by The Nerdologues, a bunch of people you don&amp;rsquo;t know but could totally be friends with. Four to six players engage in head-to-head (-to-head-to-head) constant combat until the frenzy peaks and one player emerges victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in an alternate 1920s, an eclectic collection of some of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest fighters are pitted against each other by the magnanimous Baron Reginald Fistcuffington Smythe aboard his monolithic floating airship. Baron Smythe, inventor of the new super-element Hydrolium, offers the winner of his &amp;quot;Fisticuffs Bouts&amp;quot; the granting of a single wish, whatever their heart desires most. The surviving fighter will get their wish fulfilled - and become champion of Fisticuffs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is simple. Each player picks a fighter from our cast of characters, each with their own backstory and special move. The stable of fighters include a sky pirate, a flapper, a saxo-magician, the son of a slain Chicago mayor, and a robot built by Baron Smythe himself. Every player gives their fiercest battle cry, and whoever&amp;rsquo;s is best begins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with five cards from the Punch Card deck. These Punches will be a fighter&amp;rsquo;s offense and defense. On a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, they throw a Punch against any opponent - but that player can Block if they are holding a Punch of the same name. This leaves the attacking player open for a Counter, allowing the defending player to attack with a Punch that is the same color as their Block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat continues until a Punch goes un-Blocked or a Block goes un-Countered. When an attack successfully lands, the defending player loses health. Everybody starts at 12, and when they reach 0, they&amp;rsquo;re knocked out for the rest of the match. Every remaining player gets a turn each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a full round (one turn for everybody) has been completed, the fighters return to their corner. This is when you draw new Punch Cards - and when you get a Round Card, a special action that will help provide a tactical advantage by giving you more attacks, depleting an opponent&amp;rsquo;s defenses, or giving you the edge you need in the middle of combat. The new round begins to the left of the person who started the last round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rounds keep going until there are two boxers left, at which point they enter Close Combat - no more rounds, no more Round Cards, just two boxers fighting over one dream. The fighter that is left standing is the winner of the bout and the champion of Fisticuffs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
