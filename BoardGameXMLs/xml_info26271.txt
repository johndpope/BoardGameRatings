			<description>A children's game. The players collect cards with things a cat likes. The cards are shuffled and placed on the board. The players then roll a die and move their cats onto cards and turn them over. If there is an item a cat likes on the other side, the player gets to keep the card. If it is a card a cat doesn't like the turn ends for him. If the card shows a dog the cat flees onto a tree in the middle of the board and this player loses a turn.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as all cards are uncovered and the player with the most cards win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
