							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Overton</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overton is a medium sized town sitting next to the river Tonbrook, surrounded by rolling hills and calm forests. It makes a convenient stopping point for coach travellers on the River Road and for barge traffic sailing up- and down-river, so it sees a decent amount of coming and going. Money changes hands, people live their lives, and apart from the occasional goblin sighting, it&amp;rsquo;s the safest and quietest town you could hope to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except of course that&amp;rsquo;s not true. There are ancient tombs under those hills, and the reason the woods seem calm is because the monsters within have terrified the locals into immobility. Rumours whisper of cultists behind every door, lycanthropes working the barges, and the mayor is a hollow shell occupied by a sorcerous tapeworm. Overton&amp;rsquo;s placid exterior hides a boiling core of adventure waiting to break loose a band of player characters are just the folk to unleash the chaos and &amp;ndash; if the people of Overton are lucky &amp;ndash; hang around long enough to shove any genies they&amp;rsquo;ve released back into their respective bottles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overton is a steading suitable for a party of player characters to use as a base camp for exploring the surrounding area. Presented here are details of the town, several locations of interest to adventurers, and a handful of important NPCs. It&amp;rsquo;s written with an eye to use with Dungeon World but could be easily ported to other fantasy systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
