							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heldric - The legend of the shoemaker</name>
									
			<description>Do you enjoy hack-n-slash but longed for a bit more? Maybe you like tower defense games but find them a bit boring? Heldric is a unique mix of the same old styles of game with a few new twists. A hack-n-slash without endless level grinding. A tower defense game with more action. A game where you don&amp;rsquo;t play as an epic hero, but as a humble shoemaker who must work together with his fellow villagers to defend their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build and upgrade the village quickly before the attack waves start. Each building you place adds unique abilities to not only the player&amp;rsquo;s character, but your fellow villagers as well. You must choose your structures wisely, as there are only a limited amount of plots to build. Each villager contributes to your coin income and provides essential help in defending the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must help defend against waves of monsters intent on killing everyone. Do you have what it takes to survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
