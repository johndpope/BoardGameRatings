			<description>The game consists of two decks of cards.  One deck has descriptive words like slippery, hairy, leathery,or enormous and the other deck has some of the strangest REAL words you've NEVER heard before. Some favorites are &amp;quot;dipthong&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;niblick&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;aholehole&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;peniaphobia&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt; Players choose a &amp;quot;reader&amp;quot; for the round. The reader picks the top card off each deck. The reader then places the two cards face up for all to see. Each player schemes up a sentence containing the two words. Note:No altering of words. The two words can be placed in any position or location in the sentence.&lt;br/&gt;ie. Fiery + Knobber&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I was overcome with a fiery sensation the moment I saw that knobber&amp;quot;  Players then discreetly hand it over to the reader. While trying to retain composure, the reader then reads all sentences out loud. Each player gets to vote on what they think is the funniest sentence. The player with the most votes that round wins the vote. You can be as dirty or dignified as you want. But be sure to be funny.Don't let the fact that you're clueless as to what the word actually means intimidate you. Many players get a kick out of improvising. It adds to the hilarity. The object of the game is to laugh. Best played by 4 or more people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LET'S VOTE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the reader reads all sentences, taking turns, each player, without knowing who wrote what, votes on which sentence is the funniest.The sentence with the most votes wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
