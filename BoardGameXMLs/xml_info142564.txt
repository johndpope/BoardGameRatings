							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World of Arkara: Fractured Realms</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to what was the Kingdom of Damask; what is a fractured realm. Once the greatest empire the world had seen in a thousand years, a home to commerce and diplomacy, favored by the King of the Gods, Atos and home to the Eternal City of Atosia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the length of time it took an assassin's blade to puncture his heart, a great man died and his kingdom, his dream, would soon follow him into hell. Quick to destroy, the realms will be far harder to reassemble. Can heroes turn the tide?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Avenge the elven genocide at the hands of orcs, humans and red dragons in the Slaughterwood&lt;br/&gt;     Find a lost prince and restore him to his usurped throne&lt;br/&gt;     Rebuild a shining kingdom plunged into chaos and despair&lt;br/&gt;     Discover the secrets of the Mithril Dragon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to campaign materials, a map of the region, important NPCs and plot hooks the Fractured Realms contains several organizations PCs can join or fight against, along with rules for benefits and responsibilities of membership in a sword and sorcery organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organizations include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Aerie, the largest thieves guild in the known world&lt;br/&gt;     The Crucible, a foreign legion of humans, dwarves and halflings serving the elves in a genocidal war against an invading orc army&lt;br/&gt;     The Firebrand, a chaotic evil gang of orcs and humans under the control of a brood of red dragons that have already eradicated the elves of an entire forest&lt;br/&gt;     Freelancers, a group of knights who are either bandits or freedom fighters... or both&lt;br/&gt;     The Owlguard, a mysterious order of Paladins devoted to the god of truth and knowledge&lt;br/&gt;     The Red Dragon Mercenaries, the meanest, toughest mercs in the world have made a home in the Fractured Realms because chaos means lots and lots of mercenary contracts&lt;br/&gt;     The Basin Tribes, once a shining beacon of a truly civilized and peace-loving orc civilization, their king is old and weak and his son seems determined to return the tribes to the old ways and spark a genocidal war to the death between orcs and elves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
