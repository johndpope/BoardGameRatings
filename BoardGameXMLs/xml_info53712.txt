							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Mind's Eye Theatre supplement brings the world of the Garou to live-action storytelling.  The Apocalypse features new and intriguing information about Garou society, including each Garou's role in it.  Additionally, this book features Garou political issues that can enrich any game of Werewolf, whether it's played on the tabletop or in live-action.  This book contains everything you need to enter the world of the Garou.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Apocalypse features:&lt;br/&gt;- Garou Society - including the Garou's rigid social structure, methods of competing for Renown and the many rites and challenges that accompany each new rank.&lt;br/&gt;- The Thirteen Tribes - including unique abilities available only to Mind's Eye Theatre characters.  Many of these abilities can be readily adapted to the tabletop Werewolf game.&lt;br/&gt;- The Spirit World - detailing information on spirits and their powers, including journeys through the Umbra and methods of working with and against spirits.  Rules are also included on playing spirits in a live setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Apocalypse not only expands on the already vibrant world of the Garou, it also expands the Mind's Eye Theatre system to encompass a host of new information, improving playability and inspiring creativity. This game is a must for Werewolf players and Mind's Eye Theatre enthusiasts alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
