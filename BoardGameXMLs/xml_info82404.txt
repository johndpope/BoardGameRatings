			<description>After Burner II is an arcade-style flight game released by Sega in 1987. It is the second game in the After Burner series. In the game, you fly a F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, gunning down enemies while avoiding incoming fire. Like Out Run, another Sega arcade game, After Burner II came in several versions, the most famous being a large, servo actuated, sit-down cabinet which resembled a cockpit and moved according to the motion of the plane onscreen. The cockpit would bank in the same direction the on-screen aircraft was banking. There was also a much less thrilling upright version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The differences between After Burner and After Burner II are very small, and it is easy to confuse the two. The differences included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The waiting-for-start sequence (the screen/music after a player inserts credits but before starting the game) is different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     After Burner II added a throttle to the controls, allowing players to vary their speed while flying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     After Burner has 18 stages; After Burner II has those same stages but adds three additional stages that make 21 stages total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     After Burner II added a few minor enemy changes to introduce new speed-based challenges (missiles/aircraft behind the player aircraft) to account for the use of the new throttle control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The player's missiles in After Burner II could be fired considerably more frequently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Musical compositions were the same for both games, though After Burner's instrumentation is different in spots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;After Burner II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
