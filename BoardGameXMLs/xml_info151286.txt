			<description>Two or four player soccer game using metal miniatures; players each have 1 field player and 1 goalie, using a ball that position determines the possession/active player. On a board with checkerboard patterns different areas (dark &amp;amp; light) determine who's next to kick (dark or light team).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player puts the field kicker next to the ball and releases its leg to kick the ball. The other player should try to block the kick with his/her goal keeper. After the kick the possession is once more decided and the same procedure starts all over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goalies can be managed by two other players, game lasts 2 x 10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remarks: Game was produced during 1930's; 'Wunderteam' was a specific name for the Austrian national soccer team during the years 1931 up to 1933.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
