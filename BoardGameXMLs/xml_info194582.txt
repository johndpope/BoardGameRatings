The He.111 was used in a variety of roles: it was used as a strategic bomber during the Battle of Britain, a torpedo bomber during the Battle of the Atlantic, and a medium bomber and a transport aircraft on the Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and North African Fronts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory&amp;trade; Special Pack is a ready-to-play large size model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards, as well as specific rules and components necessary to use the airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
