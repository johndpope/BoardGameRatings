			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There comes a few times in many a well-seasoned role-player's life when they get tired of all the serious RPG's out there trying to be the ultimate definitive guide to complete role-playing satisfaction.  And thus, they move on to satirical or humorous RPG's that take a tongue-in-cheek approach to it all.  But, even then, the well-seasoned role-player will still find themselves frayed at how an otherwise light-hearted game can still get bogged down by rules and garbage dictating how stupid, annoying, outlandish or otherwise tongue-in-cheek you can be within their stupid, annoying, outlandish or otherwise tongue-in-cheek game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HARPE Jaded attempts to provide a fresh, entertaining, and rules-light game for experienced role-players (for gamers who are &amp;quot;jaded&amp;quot;).  The players play a &amp;quot;Player&amp;quot; who in turn plays a &amp;quot;Character&amp;quot;.  The meta-game can be run with whatever rules seem appropriate, but in addition to playing the (presumably super-cool) meta-Character at one-remove, the player also has to play their &amp;quot;Player&amp;quot; who is assumed to be &amp;quot;the whiny, bitchy&amp;quot; type who likes to play games instead of have a real social life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
