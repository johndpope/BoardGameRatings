			<description>In Gloria Regi players struggle to be the king's successor and get all the fame, power and richness their kingdom has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King plans to retire in five years, but, sadly, he doesn't have any inheritors. &lt;br/&gt;Players are loyal noblemen that have five turns to convince the King that one of them is the best choice to suit his crown. &lt;br/&gt;Each player has seven employees to help them doing all the duties that this task demands. &lt;br/&gt;They must propose new strategic buildings to the kingdom (in one of the four areas: religion, military, commercial or political), search for original relics to fulfill the royal treasure, develop the production of resources and even ask for the Senate and the Queen's support. Every year, the King evaluates the competition and makes one new wish, if one of the players' employees can realize it, good for them, the King gets pleased and let them work fine. If one employee do not make a task he was demanded for, someone might go to jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game the King will designate a successor to the throne, according to his own values (in the beginning of the game, players decide what kind of king they want to play with, choosing among five possibilities: there is one neutral, one that gives more value to religion, one to military, one to commerce and one to politics).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end, the player with more victory points is proclaimed the new Glorious King. The other players also get a job close to the king, being the Jester, the Horse Keeper and the Eunuch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
