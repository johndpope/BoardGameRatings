			<description>Alternate GURPS III&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Tools for Tinkerers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can do anything with GURPS . . . but sometimes, you want to push the envelope even more. This month's Pyramid -- the PDF magazine for roleplayers -- offers new GURPS character-creation options, rules you can use, and ways to work together like never before. This game-tweaking issue includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Bucket of Points,&amp;quot; GURPS Line Editor Sean Punch's innovative new way to look at character creation that lets the GM have balance and versatility.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Team Up!&amp;quot;, new rules that will have your heroes working together and combining abilities like never before.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Alternate Guns Specialties and Techniques,&amp;quot; a way to overhaul the existing categorizations of the Guns skill that makes shootists simpler and more realistic.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Social Points,&amp;quot; this month's Eidetic Memory installment from GURPS Basic Set co-author David L. Pulver that shows what happened when David offered more options for social characters . . . including a fully statted character from that campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Natural Weapons,&amp;quot; presenting a new advantage that can model unusual inborn abilities -- plus 11 samples from the unnatural world!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Everyman Tasks,&amp;quot; a look at activities that everyone should be able to do without much difficulty, from the mind of GURPS Social Engineering author William H. Stoddard.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;By Default,&amp;quot; an alternate method for solving the problem of heroes with sky-high attributes and not much else, presented by GURPS Martial Arts: Technical Grappling author Douglas Cole.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;A Full Complement,&amp;quot; another Sean Punch-penned article that provides new ways to help out others through complementary skill use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month's Pyramid also features a Random Thought Table where you know what you're getting, plus an Odds and Ends that includes an option for GURPS Powers: Divine Favor, as revealed by that tome's scribe, Jason &amp;quot;PK&amp;quot; Levine. Whether you're making characters, making friends, or making a trip to the shooting range, you're sure to find something here that will make life more interesting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
