			<description>Yonin Shogi or Four-handed Shogi is a four-player variant of shogi invented in 1993 but published in its current form in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using two subsets of standard shogi pieces and a standard 9x9 shogi board. Each of the four players gets one king, one rook, two gold generals, two silver generals, and three pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players sit around the board, one at each of the four sides. At start, each player's pieces are arranged in three rows forming a triangular pattern centered along the respective edge of board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to capture your opponents' kings. Individual play as well as team play is possible. Movement and capture are identical to standard shogi, except for check and checkmate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
