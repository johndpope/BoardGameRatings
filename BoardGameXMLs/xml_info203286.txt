			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by her policeman father, Deb Russo had wanted to make a difference in her neighborhood all of her life. First wanting to become a cop and later a lawyer in order to ensure the bad guys received justice. Even though the system often seemed flawed, she was dedicated to her job. After her father was killed and his murderer acquitted, however, Deb decided that working within the system wasn't enough. She honed her body to be as sharp as her mind and took on the identity of a masked vigilante patterned after Lady Justice, herself. With sword in hand, LIBRA hunts criminals to turn over to the authorities along with the needed evidence to see that justice is done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
