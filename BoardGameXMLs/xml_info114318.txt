			<description>The objective of the game is to score  points by correctly guessing the Password from your team mate's clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players split into two teams and a word is given to one team member who must give clues to enable their team mates to correctly identify the word, This is all done against an electronic varying timer so you must think and talk quickly to find the word before the timer runs out. Some words are easy but some are very difficult to describe in a short space of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pre-establish a time before play starts and the team with the most points when that time is reached, wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
