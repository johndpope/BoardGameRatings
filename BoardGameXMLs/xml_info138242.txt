			<description>Lapsus Calumni #04 &amp;ndash; The Inn of the Last Rose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Editorial description:&lt;br/&gt;An inn for all needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have a reputation among my older friends for using inns and taverns probably a tad too much, they are quite cliche I will admit, but I feel that is part of the fun. I have heard of many a game where the players went from adventure to adventure without so much of a moment of down time. In my past games I have found this down time is perfect for players to expand their character's ...for lack of a better term... character. Introduce allies and enemies, those damn town guards and the mayor&amp;iexcl; s beautiful daughter, or better yet his too pretty wife with a wandering eye, were sure to come up and cause nothing but trouble for our brave heroe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you are able to throw this little inn somewhere in a campaign of yours and let your players experience the magic that a non-dungeon romp can bring. Sometimes just having character sit around and shoot the breeze can be very rewarding. Until next time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
