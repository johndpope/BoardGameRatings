			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you Escape from the Island of Fog?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flying Dutchman is supposed to be a portent of a ship's doom. Not long after witnessing the legendary ship sailing through the air, a terrible storm runs you aground on an island surrounded by fog. As you explore it, along with abundant amounts of exotic fruit and fish that any rich man would pay to dine upon, you begin encountering the locals: monstrous sea creatures; half-man, half-aquatic abominations; dead sailors. You must escape this once-thought paradise, especially since the island is sinking into the sea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a 10 Die Survival Game, the players run through as a group, trying to survive the cards that remove their pile of Dice. If you are out of Dice, you are dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion strives to add a little more choice to a player's turn; 16 cards force you to either face an encounter immediately or introduce an effect that will make one or more encounters afterward become much worse; a variety of items also allow for one-time helpful effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for 1 or more players. You need 10 six-sided dice per player to play, or if 10 dice per player is too much, you will need some way to track the dice that they have remaining &amp;ndash; a pad of paper, some counters, etc. &amp;ndash; and 10 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also requires a deck of 10 Die Survival cards. This deck should normally be comprised of 3 Salvation cards, and at least half of the total deck should have Encounters (see below). A standard size for a deck is 30 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player should begin the game with 10 six-sided dice; this represents their life/sanity/etc &amp;ndash; when you have 0 dice remaining, you are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all 3 Salvation cards are found, then the game ends. All players that still have dice remaining can pat themselves on the back, while all dead players shouldn't feel too bad for dying to the difficult circumstances that they were thrust into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
