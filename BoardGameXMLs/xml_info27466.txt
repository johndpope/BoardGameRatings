			<description>The rhythm's gonna getcha in this beat-the-beat game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knew you could learn rhythm while laughing? New Flail and Wail offers musical laughs and more. Best of all, players who might think they can&amp;rsquo;t keep a beat, let alone keep up, will have a riot clapping along, shouting with the song, waving, pointing and, well, Flailing. Each player passes the beat around by shouting a Wail sound and making a Flail move &amp;ndash; first theirs and then another player&amp;rsquo;s. As the music speeds up, someone is going to mess up and that&amp;rsquo;s when Miss Dee Beat, the cranky music teacher, steps in. You&amp;rsquo;ll be in trouble when she gives you a dreaded treble (clef). Be the one with the fewest trebles and win. Game includes a fab CD featuring 50 original tunes to shout with and shake at. The game&amp;rsquo;s patented Magic Maraca rocks the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 and up. 3 to 8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copy of Home Page on Internet Archive: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20060323170503/http&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060323170503/http&lt;/a&gt;://gottalaffgames.com/FlailNwail.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
