			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythender is high-action adventure game where you play amazing, Mythic heroes&amp;mdash; called Mythenders&amp;mdash;who travel the Mythic World to destroy its gods and monsters. Because, hey, why not? It&amp;rsquo;s all about leaping off of mountains with your massive, flaming sword drawn and splitting open a giant&amp;rsquo;s face. (At least, it was a face before you showed up.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of will you take on the role of a Mythender, a single man, woman, or child turned into a force of destruction. One of you will play the Mythmaster, taking on the role of the Mythic World and everyone in it: gods and monsters, powerless mortals, and even the land itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll tell the stories of slaughtering gods in a way that goes beyond just killing them&amp;mdash; you unmake them, turning them from beings that rule mortals into legends people vaguely remember. This is an Ending, and only you Mythenders have the power to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll tell the stories of interacting with mortals that barely understand you, seeing you just as they see gods and monsters: terrible beings that have far more power than they can imagine. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to break Thor&amp;rsquo;s jaw, but getting a little girl to smile instead of being frightened by your glorious visage? That will be your greatest challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll tell the stories of struggling against becoming gods yourselves. You live in the vicious cycle of apotheosis and decide, as you must take on the corrupting powers of the Mythic World in order to End its gods. Each time you take more of that much-needed power, you take a step away from your mortal soul and a step closer to becoming a Myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or you&amp;rsquo;ll tell the stories of how you ignore all that humanity business and go pedal to the fucking metal, diving headfirst into the heart of Myth, leaving corpses &amp;amp; cultists in your wake. And eventually forcing your comrades to murder your Mythic ass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
