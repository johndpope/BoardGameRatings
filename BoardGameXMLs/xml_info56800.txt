							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Children of the Gods: Obun &amp; Ukar</name>
									
			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandoned by Heaven&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the earliest sentient alien races humanity discovered was the Ur-Obun - peaceful and wise philosophers. Soon after, humanity met their cousins, the Ur-Ukar - vicious and cruel warriors with a starfaring empire of their own. Humanity has played the two against each other ever since. These two races were gifted by the gods - the ancient Anunnak jumpgate builders - with unique technology. Xenologists now scour their homes and myths for clues to the riddles of the ancients. But some wonder: How long will the gods permit such transgressions against their children?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Children of the Gods: Obun &amp;amp; Ukar&amp;quot; details the histories, cultures and unique powers theurgic and psychic) of these two races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
