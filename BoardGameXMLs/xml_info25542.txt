							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Centre Chess</name>
									
			<description>This chess variation uses the traditional pieces but is played on a board with a different topology: it's as if the board were pinched together in the middle, or as if the board were centered over the north pole of a globe, so all moves from the 4th to 5th rank pass through the center point.  There is an extra file that prevents the two player's rooks from being adjacent; you cannot move through the outer two ranks of the file, you can move through but not stop in their inner two ranks. Diagonal moves for the bishops and queens are defined so that they make S-curves after passing through the center point, allowing for attacks that are hard to spot until you get used to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set comes with a 2-sided board, a standard 8x8 board being on the other side; and it includes a checker set, so you can play Centre Checkers as well.  Rules are included for all 4 games, chess and checkers, traditional and Centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
