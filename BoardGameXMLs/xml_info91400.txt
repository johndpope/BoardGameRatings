			<description>Contains 110 cards with over 1500 fancy, unfamiliar words and their meaning. Players take turn to pick one of these words as a task for the others. The person who picked the word writes its meaning on a piece of paper while the others try to come up with a plausible definition. Then all definitions are read and everyone tries to find out which one is correct. Guessing the correct definition is worth one point; made-up definitions are worth two points per player who believed in it. To win the game you have to reach the end of the game board first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
