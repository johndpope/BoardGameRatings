			<description>This game is part of the Shibumi family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with a given position, each player takes turns as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The player rearranges the free marbles corresponding to his colour in a new position on the board. In such way that every marble of his colour is connected and at least one of his balls maintains its previous position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. If a 2x2 square is formed with three marbles of the player's colour and&lt;br/&gt;- one red ball, then the red ball is replaced by one of the player's colour.&lt;br/&gt;- one of the other player's balls, then this ball is retired from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. A new red marble appears randomly on the board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the next player's turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the pyramid is completed. The player with most marbles of his colour on the board is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
