							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DOV: Days of Valour</name>
									
			<description>DOV is the base set of rules for WW2 and Modern Tactical wargaming at the Squad and Platoon level.  It is the base product for the &amp;quot;Valour&amp;quot; series of games, and handles all the rules for the small-scale tactical combat play for that system.  Unit's and counters represent squads, individual tanks, support weapons, crews, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played either stand alone with miniatures for 15mm, GHQ, or HO miniatures. The company also has several hex map and counter add on modules that can be used for more traditional non-miniatures based play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOV is a fast paced set of game rules that strikes a good balance between realism in war game simulation play and playability. Unit cards contain detailed weapons, vehicle and nationality based attributes that give players a crisp experience of the small scaled fighting realities of that historical era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When combined with the add on modules for Flags of Valour, this system also integrates with a new kind of Fog of War set of mechanics never before used in war gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base rules are an 80 page booklet, 12 page data book, Command and STRAT cards, along with a sheet of control and marking counters for Unit Status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with data cards on the vast majority of German, American, Russian, British, and Commonwealth troops used during World War 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
