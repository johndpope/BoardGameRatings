							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dozen&#039;s Donuts</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dozen's Donuts a fast paced tile shifting game from the creative minds of Monocle Society. Play as one of six characters at Debbie Dozen's robot powered food truck, matching up your favorite donuts along the way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the classic match game, but redone in a 4x4 grid. As you make matches, you shift the cards in the grid one direction, and fill in the holes with new donuts. Along the way you'll see different donut types, some that are stale and cannot be matched, golden donuts that match with everything, and power-up donuts that when match give you a power to use on yourself or your opponents. The first to 9 matches wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't forget to download the companion app on iOS and Android for interactive score cards, print and play options, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
