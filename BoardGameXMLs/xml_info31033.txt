			<description>From the introduction to the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Policeman Paul has a lot of work to do today as quite a number of crooks are hanging around town. Studying the &amp;quot;personal description&amp;quot; given by the dice in the tumbler, you can help Paul track down the crooks in a thrilling chase. Who will be the best assistant policeman and the quickest at catching the right crook?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game in Haba's range of tumble-dice games, which include dice inside a sealed tumbler with a clear plastic dome. This game has 3 six-sided dice, two of which are essentially D3s, with 3 different faces repeated once. There is a die with dots (1, 2 or 3 dots), a colour die (yellow for the beach, green for the park and blue for the town) and a crook die (Policeman Paul, a chubby crook, a woman crook [on 2 faces] or a crook with a loot bag[on 2 faces]). Besides the dice and the rules, there's a large wooden piece representing Policeman Paul and a deck of 27 cards, showing all possible combinations with crooks of the three dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 27 cards are placed face up on the table around the Policeman Paul piece. A player shakes the tumbler. Depending on what the dice in the tumbler show, players try to claim the corresponding cards on the table. If the crook die shows the Policeman Paul face, the other dice are ignored and players try to grab the Policeman Paul piece - the successful player gets to choose any card on the table and place it in front of himself. If the crook die shows a crook, the players try to cover with their hand the card showing the corresponding number (on the die with dots) of that kind of crook in the venue specified (by the colour die). Players can only use one hand and the player who successfully covers the correct card with his hand gets to place the card in front of him. Players who wrongly grab Policeman Paul or cover the wrong card can make no further attempt to claim the right card that turn. Cards in front of players can be captured by other players if the same combination of dice get rolled again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to claim five crook cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
