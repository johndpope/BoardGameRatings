							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Countdown to Disaster</name>
									
			<description>You&amp;rsquo;re a military demolitions expert working in hostile territory that&amp;rsquo;s been called in to defuse a massive car bomb found outside a luxury resort hotel.  You&amp;rsquo;ve evacuated the parking lot and setup your equipment; you begin to examine the bomb when suddenly the bomb timer starts to countdown from 16 minutes and your heart rate just went into overdrive.  Upon further inspection you notice the bomb is controlled by an encrypted code sequencer and you need to figure out how to connect your Code Analyzer to the bomb&amp;rsquo;s timer.  Your new high-tech Code Analyzer is used to bypass the bomb&amp;rsquo;s timer and prevent the bomb from exploding. To do this you must figure out the wiring sequence from the mass of wires in front of you and rewiring the device to include your code analyzer, which will override the timer and allow you to defuse the bomb safely!  You have less than 16 minutes to figure out the wiring sequence and connect your Code Analyzer.  If you can figure out this circuit and connect each of the four individual wires from the bomb timer to your code analyzer, you will safely stop the timer and eventually defuse the bomb; saving the resort from certain disaster!  Countdown to disaster begins&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Countdown to Disaster is a combination tile placement, card management game and race against the clock style game. Your Code Analyzer has [4] color coded wires &amp;ldquo;Red, Green, Blue and Yellow&amp;rdquo; which must be connected to the timer of the bomb so as to be able to bypass the timer and prevent the bomb from exploding! These connections will be made through the [16] wire routing tiles on the game board. The bomb itself is amass of wires, which is represented by the 4x4 grid of wire tiles on the game board that are routed in different directions to try and prevent you from defusing the robot. Your goal is to figure out the four individual wire routes to connect your code analyzer to the robot's timer. You must figure out a complete connection route for each wire from the code analyzer to the bomb's timer before the timer runs out and the bomb explodes!&lt;br/&gt;You have special wiring tools that allow you to manipulate the wires and create or change the route of each existing wire or wires. With your tools in hand you can swap wires vertically and horizontally 1, 2, or 3 spaces. You can also rotate the direction of a specific wire or wire group up to 360 degrees. The last tool allows you to actually cut out &amp;ldquo;replace&amp;rdquo; a wire or wire group with a new wire or wire group from the bottom four tiles! When you replace a wire or wire group you can rotate the tile to the position of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
