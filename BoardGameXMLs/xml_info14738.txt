							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Space Drag Race</name>
									
			<description>The Great Space Drag Race is a 2-4 player game designed for quick play, with games lasting 20-30 minutes. Included are 4 dragster Control Consoles, 88 play cards, 80+ counters, the track, dice, and four custom miniatures representing the dragsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game plays a bit like &amp;quot;Robo Rally lite,&amp;quot; with players selecting cards in secret and arranging them in the order they are to be revealed to determine their dragsters' movement for the turn. The number of cards, from 1 to 3, each player selects, and when they are revealed, depends on the speed of his/her dragster, which generally increases from the start line. As dragsters collide with each other, they are knocked off course, and may rebound from the &amp;quot;walls&amp;quot; of the track. Each dragster has a supply of mines and missiles, as well as a certain amount of power for shields to deflect hits. Before the race starts, each player customizes his/her dragster with one secret piece of equipment which confers a special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is either the player to cross the finish line first, or the only player to survive the battling for position along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This demo game was produced in a set of 150 and distributed at conventions to test the waters for a full-size Great Space Race game in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Great Space Race&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
