			<description>A One-Round Living City Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tymora, Lady Luck, gives her blessings in many forms, and both good luck as well as bad could result from one of her blessings. Lately, however, the only noticeable luck for the Temple of Tymora has all been bad, the temple is looking for a few lucky souls to look into the problem. Knowing how important luck is to the adventuring population of Ravens Bluff, many have come to the Temple of Tymora to offer their assistance. The priest in charge of the investigation has selected the six of you from the many applicants to look into their problem. You six (substitute correct number if needed) are selected and led from the central chamber into a smaller sitting room to wait for the mission to begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
