			<description>Statistical hockey game replaying the 1936 Olympic ice hockey competition. Fond memories for me as it is the replay of the most unexpected result in Olympic Ice Hockey. Britain, yes - Britain, won the gold medal. Unbridled joy in the whole country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a dice based statistical simulation. All the teams that took part are rated in areas of ability based on their performances that year. You could replay the whole competition in one evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-published by the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
