			<description>Quotations are read aloud and everyone tries to identify the same famous people.  Players do not have to recognize the quotes to guess the identities.  The quotes themselves are clues.  Each quotation card contains the names of three famous people that are related in some way.  On their turn, players choose any of the three hidden identities and slide the door that reveals the next quote.  The players may then guess the identity of any of the three personalities on the cards, thereby scoring points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
