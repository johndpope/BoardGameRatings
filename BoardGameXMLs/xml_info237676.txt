			<description>In Mars Rover, players are members of the science teams of famous real missions to Mars. While you compete for funding and influence, you all collaborate to program the only piece that moves around the board: the rover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns playing a command from their hand into the Command Queue and gathering support from their rivals, or picking up cards from the R&amp;amp;D Lab to improve their deck. When the queue is filled, the rover performs each command and a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan carefully to emerge as the most influential scientist in the agency!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
