							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cerebral Assassin (PFRPG)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cerebral assassins are abominations that were created long ago by an insane cult lead by an enigmatic mentalist. No one can say what their intended purpose was, only that the cerebral assassins soon took control of the cult members and lead them on a maniacal killing spree. After the creatures had satiated their thirst for blood they disposed of their puppets and went their separate ways. Somehow the aberrations have figured out a way to create copies of themselves and procreate. Since it is widely believed that the first cerebral assassins were humanoids, it follows that the creatures are simply recreating the process that spawned them. These creatures are usually found in the service of people in positions of power. Most cerebral assassins work for profit but also enjoy using their &amp;ldquo;legitimate&amp;rdquo; employment as an outlet for their sadistic tendencies. Power is an unbearable temptation for a cerebral assassin and they never miss an opportunity to usurp power from their masters. Cerebral assassins are both intelligent and extremely manipulative and their psionic abilities allow them to gain influence over those around them. These creatures are cunning and patient and they are more than willing to serve others in the short term if doing so allows them to gain a long term advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Cerebral Assassin (CR 8)&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Cerebral Assassin Paragon (CR 11)&lt;br/&gt;     Cerebral Assassin Miniature Counters&lt;br/&gt;     Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
