							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Protectorate Twilight Bow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every weapon is created with the individual in mind. In the modern world of Exodus many weapons are built with the intent of mass production to fuel the march of war. Thus it was with the Protectorate Twilight Bow. A weapon built with massive battles with Dominion forces in mind, its overwhelming cost and difficulty in manufacture made it a laughable example of bad military spending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasures of NeoExodus: Protectorate Twilight Bow is created for use with your NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting home gaming for the Pathfinder RPG. The Treasures of NeoExodus series focus on creating unique and interesting magical and mundane items that you can use in your NeoExodus home games that give you more a personal connection to the item. This PDF comes with a background and history of the Protectorate Twilight Bow, its special mundane and/or magical qualities plus magic item containing detailed information and blank versions of the cards. Everything you need to incorporate Protectorate Twilight Bow into your character&amp;rsquo;s background and your gaming sessions is here making them even more appealing, special and personal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
