			<description>Website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delving Deeper RPG closely emulates the rules of the earliest version of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular roleplaying game. Go back to a time when every weapon did d6 damage, clerics could cast no spell at first level, only fighters could use magic swords, and if you wanted a locked door opened you had to bash the thing in! It is difficult to imagine in a world where multiple, weighty tomes comprise the rules; but the these three small books contain all you need to build a campaign that can span decades of real time! If you&amp;rsquo;re tired of trying to find the rule for determining whether your fighter is left-handed and is able to swim and just want to kill some goblins, have we got a game for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait, there&amp;rsquo;s more! While Delving Deeper is a solid, rule set that closely emulates the rules of the earliest version of Original Edition, it also has a toolbox aspect to it as well. Running throughout the game are two separate tracks of options &amp;ndash; little tweaks to the rules that help DD also emulate the rules of the First Basic Edition (&amp;ldquo;Basic Track&amp;rdquo;) and the rules of the Third Print Edition of a modern rpg inspired by Original Edition (&amp;ldquo;Modern Track&amp;rdquo;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delving Deeper RPG will be released directly from Brave Halfling Publishing as a digest boxed set of booklets, dice, character sheets, etc. the first week of April and in your local game store in May. We will be supporting Delving Deeper RPG with modules, supplements and campaigns. A free trademark license will also be available for third party publishers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Boxed Set Contains everything you need to play:&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull; Forging a Hero (Player's Guide)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Codex of the Divine and the Arcane (Spells)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Index of the Fiendish and Malign (Monsters)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Vault of Treasures (Treasure &amp;amp; Magic Items)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Delving Deeper and Blazing New Trails (Referee's Guide)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Robert Conley&amp;rsquo;s, Blackmarsh Campaign Setting&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A pad of 25 digest character sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
