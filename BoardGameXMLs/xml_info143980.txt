							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gunship: Tactical Bomber / Fortress</name>
									
			<description>The Tactical Bomber is a new set of boards, cards and tokens to further expand the Gunship galaxy.  Intended for 4-Player battles, the Bomber will offer massive firepower options at the expanse of being slower and less repairable than a Gunship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactical Bomber Boards are landscape in nature and feature 10 Hit Locations, including Wings and a customizable Rear Turret.  With 3 Bomb Bays, a multitude of payloads will be available, including high-explosive Nova Bombs and Plasma Bombs, which include a new Fire Mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set will also provide a new Attacker/Defender system to the game.  One team will be defending a Planet with their Carrier, Gunship and Fighters.  The Planet will be the site of a powerful Fortress, which must be assaulted by the Attackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Attackers will have a Carrier, Gunship, Tactical Bomber and their own Fighter Squadrons.  The mission objective is the destruction of the Fortress below and team tactics and strategy will be paramount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bombing Objectives will be a major part of the upcoming Storyline Mode.  An abandoned Fortress can be seen in the Gunship: Afterburners expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Crewmates relative to the Bomber and Fortress will be announced during the July Kickstarter and available for purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
