			<description>&amp;quot;Waku Waku 7 has an irregular feature set for a fighting game of its time, and includes features common to SNK fighting games (four basic attacks, screens zooming, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The game has a roster of nine characters (Two of which were available only in the Versus mode of the console ports). Each has a significantly different playstyle and parodies a well-known character from another game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Each character has a powerful special move (Referred to as the Harahara movement, or Harahara motion). They had several factors that made them unique, including:&lt;br/&gt;          o They were easy to execute;&lt;br/&gt;          o They needed to be charged. (during which the character concentrates, says something, strikes a pose or blows a fanfare)&lt;br/&gt;          o They were unblockable and difficult to dodge, but could be interrupted while charging.&lt;br/&gt;          o While charging, the game flashes a warning and sounds an alarm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Characters could be launched through the screen to hit the other corner, and attacked while on the ground; but could also dodge or attack while getting up.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Waku_Waku_7,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
