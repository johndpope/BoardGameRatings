							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wardens of Mars</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mars, the red planet, 4th from the sun, should be a peaceful world. The intelligent race that inhabits the planet is a simple group of people. Tall and thin, hairless with dark red skin, the Martians are a very community-driven people; each gifted with a strong but incomplete magical power, they work together to form beautiful hive-structures, create food and drink of many varied styles, and mold the basic rocks and sand of their planet into works of art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadly, Mars also hosts an odd phenomenon. Periodically, breaches in reality open, and inhabitants and landscape from other dimensions begin to encroach upon the face of Mars. It has been a long time since anyone has attempted peaceful communication with these outsiders, since the different alien&amp;rsquo;s intentions have been universally hostile. A new class of citizen grew, the wardens, tasked with using their powers to create weapons and destructive magical spells to fight off the invading forces that visit the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
