			<description>In Kultapeli (&amp;quot;The Gold Game&amp;quot;), 2-6 players represent prospectors in the Finnish Lapland in 1949. The idea of the game is to first make one to three claims, register them at the Bank/Registry Office, then pan for some nuggets of gold and sell them - and any claims that have not run dry yet - to the bank, to reach a sum agreed before the start of the game (eg. 20,000 marks). Each time a player visits the Registry they must also visit the saloon and play a Blackjack-like dice game for at least half of their money. The first player to reach the agreed sum wins. When moving on the map, the players may encounter some events which are usually negative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gold nuggets are called according to the old gold prospectors slang: Lifeless, Nit, Louse, Bedbug, Nugget, from smallest to biggest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
