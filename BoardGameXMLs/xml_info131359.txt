							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gumnut Game</name>
									
			<description>Using the enchanting May Gibbs characters from the classic story of Snugglepot &amp;amp; Cuddlepie that has delighted generations: be the first to grow the grandest gumtree in the land. Protect your tree and survive the fires and dangers of the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gumnut Game pits up to 8 gumnuts babies, as they attempt to survive the harsh conditions of Australia. This is determined by spinning both a Weather Forecast and Fire Danger Indicator as determined by the spaces that players land on as they progress through the game. Along the way players have the opportunity to pick up Reward, Danger, Surprise and Safety cards which either provide advantages or disadvantages to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of The Gumnut Game is the first player whose gumnut baby is able to traverse all 99 spaces and survives the dangers allowing it to grow into a River Red Gum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
