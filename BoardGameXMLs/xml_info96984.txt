							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">California Challenge: Test Drive II Scenery Disk</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A border-to-border race through the Golden State!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most diverse and picturesque landscape in the world is the setting for this grueling and demanding race. Here are the legs of the competition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The California/Oregon Border to the Trees of Mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sign says &amp;quot;Welcome To California&amp;quot;--but don't plan on a long stay. The race begins at the border and immediately catapults you down a twisting redwood highway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trees of Mystery to Eureka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hold tight. The road are as gnarled as the trees. Handling is at a premium. The lush forest and ocean-scape may be beautiful but one errant glance could pile you head-on into a logging truck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eureka to Rockport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare to climb. This stretch starts off like an elevator ride--then the bottom drops out. Definitely not for the faint of heart. Best to keep one eye on the road and one eye on the elevation markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rockport to San Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No stopping for souvenirs in the small coastal towns. Time to make your move. Blast down 101, through the tunnel near Mill Valley, then feast your eyes on the famous Golden Gate Bridge and city skyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;San Francisco to Carmel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab your sourdough to-go and step on it. Infamous Devil's Slide takes no prisoners and the heavy traffic makes even the locals sweat. Shoot past Santa Cruz and wind your way down the Monterey Peninsula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carmel to Santa Barbara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The view from the vistas is postcard perfect. Trek through the towering redwoods of Big Sur, then zip by a lighthouse off the Santa Barbara coast. No time for California Dreamin'. The snakelike curves, narrow bridges and undulating roadway demand your full attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Santa Barbara to Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the Beach Boys sing? Take a gander out your window. Sunny Santa Monica, Del Mar and La Jolla beach. Wave adios to the palm trees, weave down that L.A. freeway and make a run for the border.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
