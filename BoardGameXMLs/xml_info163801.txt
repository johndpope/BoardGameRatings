			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villains...who needs them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's be honest: you do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've got the strength of an ox, the speed of a cheetah, and the grace of a cat. You can fly faster than a jet and punch through brick walls. But where would a superhero be without a few super villains to knock around? Yeah, you could use your superpowers to help little old ladies cross the street, but with your awesome might sometimes that might be a little overkill (think of the scene at the start of The Incredibles where Mr. Incredible uproots a tree to save the cat that was trapped in it). There are burglars and fleeing felons, but such miscreants hardly break a sweat for a hero who can lift 10 tons and create a force field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is what this book is for-to give the game master running a superhero campaign with the MADS Role Playing Game a worthy challenge! This book contains 40 adversaries and antagonists for you to use in your superhero themed adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
