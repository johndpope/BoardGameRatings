							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Close Combat: Cross of Iron</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Atomic Games award winning Close Combat series of games. Close Combat: Cross of Iron, brings back the award-winning classic in new epic battles of the Eastern Front of World War II. In Close Combat: Cross of Iron you start off as a junior officer leading your men into battle in real time. Earn promotions as you deal with an unforgiving enemy. Fight and survive though the frozen winter, hot dusty summer and muddy autumn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Maps and Campaign. Close Combat: Cross of Iron comes with all the original Close Combat III Battles, Operations, and Campaigns. However, also included is an entire new Campaign called Fuger's Ostliche Wut, or Fuger's Eastern Fury, for you to fight as either German or Russian, based on actions between 1943 and 1944. Each Battle and Operation has been carefully made with in depth briefings related to actual events, and will give you hints about the battle and what you may expect. We have tried hard to make the balance of play suitable for a newcomer to the game, making it neither too hard or too easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 26 new maps never released before and 6 modified maps from the original game, gathered together in 12 Operations spanning 12 months of the Russian Front Campaign, from dry summer landscapes through mud and snow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised Data.The Teams, Units, Weapons, and Data have been revised with new Graphics and more accurate performance. The AI has been modified to reduce many of the problems experienced with the original release of Close Combat III, and it is of course now Windows XP and DirectX friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
