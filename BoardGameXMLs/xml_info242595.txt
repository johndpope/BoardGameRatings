			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take to the stars, medieval kingdoms, or the urban and futuristic cityscapes! Many planets, cultures, and creatures await discovery within the universe and you are lucky enough to live to discover them. Morta IV is a vast galaxy whose inhabitants were separated from the Milky Way long ago to ensure the Milky Way's stability and to ensure arcane magic would not lead to the destruction of life which was in its infancy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the confines of the book is 26 species (including all of the fantasy standards but also; Vampires, Satori, Nue, Einherjar, Deep Ones, and Half Dragons), 9 classes (including Soldier, Mage, Rogue, Steam Knight, Chaplain, Crusader, Battlemage, Technomancer, and Marksman), Advanced Classes which can be taken past a certain level to further specialize your character, weapon and armor customization, five different casting types (arcane, divine, psyhcic, rune, and summoning), rules for engaging in a Duel of Wits, Sanity, and 21 different deities, and information on the world of Morta IV (including factions/organizations with their own special equipment, feats, and Advanced Classes)! In addition to all of this, there is a mini-Bestiary in the book containing an assortment of monsters to use in your campaigns (some of which are playable!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what are you waiting for? Morta IV awaits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
