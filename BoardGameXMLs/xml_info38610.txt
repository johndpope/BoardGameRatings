			<description>&amp;ldquo;The Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage began in 218 BC. In the winter of that year Hannibal crossed the Alps and invaded Italy with a large army.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The first major engagement came near the Trebbia River where a Roman army confronted the invaders. The battle was a disaster for the Romans. Hannibal encircled them with the help of a surprise attack on the Roman rear led by his brother Mago. The Roman army broke and routed across the river with heavy casualties.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base, except for elephants and commanders which are mounted singly. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Units portrayed in the game include Commanders, Cavalry, Infantry, Skirmishers, and Elephants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
