			<description>A space program game but with a veeery low budget. You are entrusted with a task to explore space and expand a world of beerlings!You'll hire a team of &amp;quot;extremly talanted&amp;quot; beerlings build a spaceship from scra... from different parts and go in space and even found a colony and maybe if you are really luck... skillful discover alien life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of space exploration and colony management for 2-4 players. At the beginning of the game players deside turn order by rolling dice, then build a space ship from different junk by buying ship tiles of different tiers from stack (cards) with their starting budget which is veeery limited, after this players generate their &amp;quot;heroic&amp;quot; crew by blind drawing trait tokens. After this every player decide the destination by choosing a planet, gas giant or asteroid on a map and try to fly their ship to the chosen destination to found a colony or space station and then manage it. During flight a lot of different events will happen (card drawing) and players will try to deal with them by moving astranaut tokens to the ship tile-event location and roll dice. The time of the program is limited by the total number of turns. And the goal of the game is to survive and make their space program successful by getting the highest amount of points at the end of the game (for every astronaut alive, every module standing and every token of resources) while every turn everything goes wron....to hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
