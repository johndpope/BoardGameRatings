							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peter Pepper&#039;s Ice Cream Factory</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peter Pepper&amp;rsquo;s Ice Cream Factory is a sequel to Data East&amp;rsquo;s BurgerTime. The game places players in the role of Peter Pepper as he tries to complete oversized ice cream cones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level is comprised of a number of ladders and platforms with ice cream cone components scattered about. The player must walk over the cone component to force it to drop to the platform below. Once all the cones have been completed the level is complete. To make the task more difficult, Peter is harried by a number of enemies that will follow him through the level. If the player makes contact with an enemy, a life is lost and the player is reset at the starting point. All cone progress is maintained between lives, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
