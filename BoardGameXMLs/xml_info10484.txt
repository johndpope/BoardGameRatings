			<description>This game is an old version of &amp;quot;Deutschlandreise&amp;quot;, but you travel around the Rhine area instead of whole Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 9 destination cards. The first card (any color)sets the starting place, the 8 other cards come in two of each color (red, orange, blue, green). The players have to move along the board by throwing a die. The first player who has visited all of his/her destination cards and arrives back in the starting place wins the game. To travel between the cities along the Rhine (blue cards), the players have to use the &amp;quot;Rheingold-Express&amp;quot; (train), where the dice throws count double.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
