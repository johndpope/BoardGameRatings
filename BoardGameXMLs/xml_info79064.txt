			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer Circus Maximus is the game that puts you in the fast chariots that raced in the Roman coliseums. Design your own chariot, balancing speed, endurance, driver skill and chariot strength, and match them in competition against human and computer opponents. Up to 12 people can play, each taking one chariot, but the game is just as exciting and dangerous when played by one. Select a fast team and hope the others won't attack to slow you down, or choose a powerful heavy chariot that will ensure you finish the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a five-race campaign game that allows you to bet on the outcome of each race acquire a fortune with astute wagers, or be sold into slavery for going into debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, Computer Circus Maximus allows players to enter their moves and see the result in animated action! This is a fast-moving game that can be played at a party or at home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer Circus Maximus is ready to run on IBM PC, AT, XT, and jr. computers, plus the Cameleon Seequa and Compaq computers with 128k memory, one double-sized disk drive, and color graphics board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
