			<description>Hugo and Penelope get swept up in a murder whodunit in the quiet charm of the English countryside when they visit the cottage of Hugo's Great Uncle Horace (top left). Next to it we see Penelope thoughtfully staring at two iron gates with no sign of a lock or any way to open them. The good news is that she has worked out that they are electric gates and the way to open them lies inside the gardener's shed. The bad news is that the gardener appears to have designs on poor Penelope who must deal with him first. Harder and much more extensive than game one, it abounds with red-herrings and tricky puzzles as you work your way around (and under) the grounds of the cottage to the final startling revelation of the murderer's identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
