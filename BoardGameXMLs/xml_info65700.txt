							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Women&#039;s Lib?</name>
									
			<description>The game of women's rights.&lt;br/&gt;From a sticker included in the box: &lt;br/&gt;Male chauvinists, radical feminists, happy housewives, confused husbands - they're all right here in WOMEN's LIB. Each player is assigned one of these characters and tries on a whole new personality. WOMEN's LIB is a game of debates and elections, bribes and bargains. Fight for your cause, argue your point of view and everybody learns something about our changing world and it's women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate 35 Persuasive Points is the winner of the game. The points are awarded to players who successfully debate and campaign to achieve the goals favored by the character they are representing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
