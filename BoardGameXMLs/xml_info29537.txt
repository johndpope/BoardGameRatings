							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I.Q.:  Dr. Hagen&#039;s New True or False Game </name>
									
			<description>This game was used as an advertising game. The game had     booklets which contained more than five hundred true/false questions rated according to difficulty, as well as ads for the sponsor's products (Aqua Velva After Shave).  The game also included a small spinner and a game board which traced your progress from &amp;quot;greenhorn&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;genius&amp;quot; (or, if you fared poorly, to &amp;quot;idiot&amp;quot;).  There were at least three different booklets of questions produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
