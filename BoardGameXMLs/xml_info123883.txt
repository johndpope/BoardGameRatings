			<description>Both the Offensive coach and the Defensive Coach have 8 cards in their hands. The cards show the offensive plays; Fullback thru line, Halfback Off Tackle, Halfback Around end, Long Pass, Jump pass, Flat Pass etc. The Offensive player selects his play call while the defensive player puts the cards in order depending on which play he thinks the Offensive player will call. The order that the cards are placed in determines how successful the offensive play is. If the defense matches the offense then the defense has guessed the right play and the gain will be minimal. If the offensive play was Halfback around end and the defensive player had that card 4th in order the gain might be 7 yards. If the defense had the card 3rd in order the gain might be reduced to 4 yards. So the closer to the actual play call the defense is, the lower the gain potential. There is also a clock that the players move. Run plays take 30 secs while pass plays take 15 secs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
