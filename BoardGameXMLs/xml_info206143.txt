							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dominions: Darkwood Enfold</name>
									
			<description>Dominions: Darkwood Enfold is a book in the Return of the Drow line for players and gamemasters alike. Each book focuses on different aspects of the drow, the World-Below, its setting, locations, races, magic items and general adventuring in exotic world of the World-Below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dominions not only includes new locations, but also introduces additional rules for variant subtypes of drow, feats, racial traits and classes. The locations in this book are designed to be stand-alone and world-neutral. You can integrate them into an ongoing campaign as individual points of interest, or use all the locations together as one well-developed region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drow have existed in this spider-worshipping, matriarchal, quasi-dominatrix niche for decades. There&amp;rsquo;s literally nothing new under the sun there, so if anything touches on the drow it needs to be inspired and fresh&amp;mdash;a reinvention. What is contained in these pages is my attempt at that intention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drow dominions are often small, usually no larger than a metropolis on the surface world. Dark elven cities come in many forms with some even carved into the sides of great crevasses. Others are in huge stalactite fields with bridges and ramps strung between the giant stone spikes. Black cities exist on the shores of dark rivers and on islands in midnight oceans. Settlements sprawl across the elevations of vast caverns and snake through tight warrenlike tunnels. They lie hidden in fungus forests and shimmer on the edges of manna lakes. In addition a dominion could simply be a powerful family living together in a hollowed out stalactite, or it may be a collection of drow dwellings all falling under the sway of the most powerful drow present. The dominion highlighted within this book is just an example of variety existing amongst the drow elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return of the Drow - Dominions: Darkwood Enfold introduces just such a new dominion for the drow. Darkwood Enfold describes a group of drow that have evolved and diverged from the prototypical dark elf. These drow are of neutral alignment and are immersed in a culture of fey magic, ghosts, and symbolism of their Moon Goddess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
