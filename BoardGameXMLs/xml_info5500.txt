			<description>'Fowlplay, the board game where it's duck season 365 days a year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game:  kill your limit of six ducks without going over the limit and return to the clubhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to 10 players move shotgun-shaped playing pieces around the board to land in one of four hunting locations:  a blind, a pit, a boat or a log.  Once there, Shell Cards are played to &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; and Duck Dice are rolled to see how many birds fly over.  Players draw from the Duck Deck to see what kinds of ducks they kill; some Miss Cards included.  As players move around the board they may land on certain spaces that require drawing a card from the Draw Deck of various consequences.  Fowlplay simulates a real duck hunt featuring real photographs of six species of ducks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is enhanced by the availability of custom playing pieces with your own picture on them!  Fun for ages 6 and up.  Made in USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
