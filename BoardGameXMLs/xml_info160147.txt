			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the north the mysterious Orc tribes threaten the coastial town of Icago. Already the Abbey of the Goddess Thiseir has fallen due to their raids and farmers and fishermen have reported seen the horrid pig-faced creatures moving inland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cloaked Mage promised the Lord Mayor a way to be rid of the threat &amp;hellip; no one has heard from the mayor or his family for a week. Every search attempt is a failure, the Lord Mayor's farms are protected by strange metal constructs known as Scarecrows. Strange lights streak the night sky, toward the Scarred Relic Moon &amp;hellip; from the Lord Mayor's home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A call goes out to anyone brave or stupid enough to aid the town; you have answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spectres of Usarm&amp;rdquo; is the Fourth Two-Page -Adventure from Genius Loci Games and the third to use the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry rule set. Created for a party of 4 to 6 players of the 4th to 6th level, the &amp;ldquo;Spectres if Usarm&amp;rdquo; mixes exploration, story and combat as quickly and efficiently as possible to provide at least 2 hours of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
