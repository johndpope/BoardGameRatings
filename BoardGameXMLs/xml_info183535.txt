			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends have longed to see action  firsthand in what they're calling the War of  Secession. But apart from your make-believe battles,  you've never even laid eyes on a real rebel soldier.  Until now. Now, as the world outside explodes  with cannon fire and the cries of the wounded, you  find yourself crouched in terror in an abandoned  farm. As the clamor dies down you muster your  courage to peek outside. &amp;quot;Please put your hands  up,&amp;quot; says a genteel Southern voice. Shaking  and suddenly cold you raise your hands and turn  around slowly. It is a confederate officer.  Reckoning you ought to know the local terrain, he offers  to take you to his commanding officer, the  legendary General Robert E. Lee. He says he won't shoot  you if you run, but you wonder. You're being  offered the chance to play a pivotal role in history.  But should you help the general whose army is  overrunning your town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
