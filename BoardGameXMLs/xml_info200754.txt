							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Game of the World</name>
									
			<description>This game is comprised of a deck of 100 cards, each of which bears the name of a country, colony, region or body of water along with 10 questions about its subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of three cards. The first player asks the player to his left one of the questions on one of his cards. If the second player answers the question correctly, he takes the card and puts it face down in front of him. If not, the next player in line gets a chance and so on. Whoever answers takes the card. If no one answers, it is placed into an Ignorance Pile on the table. The asking player then replenishes his hand to three, and the turn to ask moves to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every four cards collected by correct answers make up a &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; and victory goes to the first player to collect an agreed number of books. The rules recommend four books for 2-3 players, three books for 4-5 players and two or even one book for larger numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest two ways for adapting the game to classroom use, either by forming teams or by spelling-bee style elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
