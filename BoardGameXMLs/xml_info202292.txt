			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Stars is a game of memories, consciousness, and creeping existential dread. You will play the parts of the recorded minds of a number of characters. They have been sent on a mission, a mission they currently have no recollection of. Their mode of travel was a vessel where their minds were transferred into the computer systems of the vessel their bodies travel on. Their bodies have been kept alive, but without the activity of their minds. This process leads to memory degradation, in order to combat this their minds have been &amp;quot;awakened&amp;quot; and are inhabiting virtual representations of themselves having a discussion in a virtual room. They will each be provided a book of sketches that have been prepared for them to trigger memories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizes Before the Storm game mechanics, though the needed rules are presented in this document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
