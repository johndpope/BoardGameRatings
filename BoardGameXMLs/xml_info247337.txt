							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pundit</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are those who think they know it all, or at least, they think they know all there is worth knowing. Pundits study narrow fields of magic and knowledge to better assert their control over the world around them. Often seen as bookish, arrogant, and intellectually vain&amp;mdash;no matter what their intentions&amp;mdash;these scholarly authoritarians apply their talents to endeavors that would advance themselves and their allies to greater levels of influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of their reputations as pedantic bores, they are still valued by many lords and kings as advisers, tutors, and in times of trouble, warrior mages. Mounted on &amp;ldquo;high horses&amp;rdquo;, they carry a great deal of clout to see them through many obstacles and challenges. Blending formidable arcane magic and martial prowess with equestrian skill, pundits journey to stick their nose where it is often not wanted to make matters their own to deal with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: A pundit simply knows where and how they are needed. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask them to explain their methods; it&amp;rsquo;s best to not get them started.&lt;br/&gt;Parent Classes: Cavalier and Wizard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
