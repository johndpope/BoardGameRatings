			<description>[From Back of Box and User Summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riding in the car has never been so much fun. Players outwit opponents with custom decks in hopes of becoming the ultimate Vrooomster. Vrooom! The travel card game consists of more than 175 common, uncommon and rare cards. The trip may end but the fun never stops. The journey continues by adding cards to your collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to score the most points before either a certain distance is covered by the transportation you are in (eg 10 miles) or when you reach a destination (eg Grandma's House). Vroom is played by playing out 'object' and 'transmission' cards. Object cards are played when the player sees the object on the card (eg 'Stop sign'). Players score points for playing objects and for collecting sets of like objects (the latter achieved through the play of transmission cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
