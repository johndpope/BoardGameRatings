							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duck Soup</name>
									
			<description>The game is played in two courses. In the first course (Duck), both of you, after playing to a trick, draw the top card from the stock to restore your hand to thirteen cards. In the second course (Soup), which begins when the stock runs out, you play your hands out to a finish.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;You'll find it more profitable to win a middling number of tricks in both courses than many in one course and few in the other because you each calculate your final score for the whole deal by multiplying together your two scores for the individual courses. For example, if in the Duck course you took 6 tricks for 7 points, and in the Soup course you took 5 tricks for 8 points, your final score will be 7 x 8 = 56.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
