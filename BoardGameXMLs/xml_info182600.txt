							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jagt den Koffer-Mann</name>
									
			<description>This game was adapted from the british TV-series &amp;quot;Man in a Suitcase&amp;quot; (Der Mann mit dem Koffer) from 1967.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have to reach the safe in the center of the game board with their agent. Movement is determined by a die. If a Agent gets on an orange space, he advances according to the printed arrow. On a red or yellow space the player has to draw a card to hinder or benefit his agent. if he rolls a six he doesn't move, but has to drop the glass marble into the slot. Any agent that gets hit by the marble has to return to the starting space. The player who drops the marble has the option to remove his agent from the board and return it after the marble has run it's course. However if he chooses to remain on the board and his agent isn't hit, he advances a number of spaces, according to the compartment, where the marble comes to rest. The first player to reach the safe wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
