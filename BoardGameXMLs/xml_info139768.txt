			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Final Fantasy VII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Fantasy VII (simplified Chinese: 最终幻想7; traditional Chinese: 最終幻想7; pinyin: Zu&amp;igrave; Zhōng Hu&amp;agrave;n Xiǎng 7), also called Core Crisis (Chinese: 核心危机; pinyin: H&amp;eacute; Xīn Wēi Jī), is a Chinese unofficial, unlicensed &amp;quot;Shanzhai&amp;quot; remake of the 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII, originally developed by Square for the PlayStation. The two-dimensional &amp;quot;port&amp;quot; was developed and published by the Chinese company ShenZhen Nanjing Technology for the SUBOR entertainment system, a clone of Nintendo's Famicom console (known internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System). The cartridge itself is unique, as it is structurally different from licensed Famicom cartridges in terms of hardware and programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features many gameplay elements of the original Final Fantasy VII, including a three-member party structure and adaptations of the game's subsystems. The items, spells and equipment available to the player are based upon those in the original game, and although a large number have been omitted along with optional characters and some side quests, the original story was reproduced in very minute detail. The game was received with mixed reception, cited as an impressive achievement but at the same time criticized for its difficulty and choice of a target console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Final Fantasy VII (Famicom)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
