							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aux Sabords!: Kit Expert</name>
									
			<description>This expansion for Aux Sabords consists of additional ships, cards and treasure chests and offers additional rules to improve the base game.&lt;br/&gt;The players hold five cards in their hands, play at least one and fill up to five after their move. With the cards they can move their ship(s) and pick up treasure chests. When they meet other pirate's ships, they can start a battle by playing a combination of pirate cards. The defender has to play a higher combination of pirates to thwart the attack. In any case, the winner gets the spoils. When all treasure chests are in the players' ports, the player with most chests is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
