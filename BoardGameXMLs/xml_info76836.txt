			<description>Mega Bomberman is a video game from the Bomberman series. It was originally released in 1993 as Bomberman '94 for the PC-Engine (the Japanese version of the TurboGrafx-16) and was ported to the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994. The PC-Engine version was released only in Japan while the Mega Drive/Genesis version was released in the west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports single-player and multi-player modes. In single player, the player navigates several levels of mazes, destroying creatures with bombs. In multi-player mode, players defeat each other with bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mega Drive/Genesis port had some differences, such as fewer options in multi-player, inferior graphics, and some different music (for example, Jammin' Jungle's music in the original version was reused as the first level in Super Bomberman 4, but is entirely different in the other version).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TurboGrafx-16 version was eventually re-released in Japan on the Virtual Console. Outside of Japan, the previous game, Bomberman '93, was made available instead. The TurboGrafx-16 version of Bomberman '94 was eventually released on the North American Virtual Console as an import game on March 23, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TurboGrafx-16 version was released on the Japanese PlayStation Network on July 15, 2009 for play on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bomberman'94 is the final HuCard title to be made and released by Hudson Soft, the original designers of the PC Engine console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mega Bomberman,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
