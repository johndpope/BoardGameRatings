							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kolardo: A Space Age Classic</name>
									
			<description>From the rules: Kolardo will fascinate and entertain all who play, and at the same time will unfold the beautiful and subtle, yet simple language of COLOUR.  Produced for ASCIA by Neil John Productions Ltd., New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Information: The Kolardo Pack comes with 54 cards representing 9 colours (3 primary, 1 secondary, and 5 tertiary colours), a rule book, and a rule card for advanced play.  The basic concept of the game is capturing melds of secondary and tertiary colours by playing and discarding cards to the piles next to the draw stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
