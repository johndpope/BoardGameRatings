			<description>Crucible of Courage introduces Richard Berg&amp;rsquo;s long-awaited Civil War Tactical System, The Rifled-Musket Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucible of Courage emphasizes the limits of command, training, and discipline, all in the light of what soldiers will do despite what their leaders want. Yes, all the weapons are present, including artillery, but the fun is in getting your men to use them in the most effective way. See why most Civil War combat was close-range firefights &amp;hellip; or maybe you can find a way to change that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucible of Courage includes five scenarios, all historical battles with their own maps and counters for the actual units, each a different view on the tactical details of the American Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucible of Courage scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st Manassas (Virginia, July 21, 1861, the opening moments of the battle, Burnside&amp;rsquo;s 2nd RI vs The Louisiana Tigers) &lt;br/&gt;Athens (Missouri, August 5, 1861, local militia, street-fighting, and hollowed logs as cannon) &lt;br/&gt;James Island (SC, June 3, 1862, the Union&amp;rsquo;s initial attempt to attack Charleston by land) &lt;br/&gt;Chickamauga (Georgia, September 18, 1862; Wilder's Brigade, armed with repeateres, holds the bridge against two brigades from Lidell's Division. &lt;br/&gt;James Island, (SC, July 16 1863, the 54th Massachusetts Colored Regiment gets its baptism under fire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucible of Courage is designed for quick learning and easy play, a system that has almost unlimited possibilities. Game rules are short, but there are lots of charts and tables to cover every aspect of battle at this micro level. Playing time is 2-4 hours for any scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
