			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is December and Juliane is on the ferry's deck. She is on the way to Jutland to celebrate Christmas with her family. The sky is gray, the ocean is gray, and the sun is low and stinging. Snow dots her cheeks, and she snores through her nose to prevent it from running. Over the loudspeaker, the captain's voice is heard. They will soon be in port. In a moment she and her mother will have to climb down into the crowded bus. Then three hours more driving, sick all the way. It's not any kind of a good Christmas. Perhaps it's grandma Lise's last, because she has been diagnosed cancer. But that's not what Juliane has in mind. For Juliane has a secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
