			<description>A board and card abstract skirmish level combat game for 2 players depicting the battle between Asgardians and either Frost Giants, Dark Elves or Marauders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is conducted on an 8x8 board using chits, figures or miniatures to represent units. Dependant on scenario several spaces on the board will be marked as impassable, representing pits, walls, and other obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are described in a series of tables but have a hit point value of between 1 and 9, have specific capabilities and characteristics, and may have associated special cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck. Cards are of varying types: Move, Ranged Attack, Hand to Hand Attack, Defence, Combo and Special.  Move and Attack cards have an associated range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The units used are dependent on scenario (four are provided). Each player places one unit on each square of his back two rows. Units may not stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.   Fate Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Draw 3 cards.  Max hand size = 5 cards.  Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.   Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Play (discard) a Move card to move one of your units. The move card has a number. This is the number of spaces the unit moves. Moves can be diagonal or orthogonal. &amp;ldquo;Knight&amp;rdquo; type move cards allow a unit to move like a knight in chess. Instead of moving just one unit in any direction, you have the option of moving 2 or 3 units forward the indicated number of spaces using a single move card.  Units cannot move through other units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.   Fight Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Play (discard) an Attack card to have a unit attack. The attack card has a number. This is the range of the attack. Attacks can be diagonal or orthogonal. &amp;ldquo;Knight&amp;rdquo; type attack cards produce an attack with a range like a knight in chess. Units cannot attack through other units.&lt;br/&gt;-    Every attack does a base of 1 damage (target loses 1 hit). Use chits or coins to record damage.  A unit reduced to 0 hits is killed or incapacitated and removed from the board. &lt;br/&gt;-    Your opponent may play defence cards to negate your attack.&lt;br/&gt;-    A unit is knocked back in the direction of the attack. If a unit is blocked by another unit the other unit is also knocked back (like a row of dominoes).  If a unit is knocked into an impassable space or off the board it is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory conditions are scenario specific.  After 15 turns, if there is no victory, one side retreats and the battle is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
