			<description>A hot game for desert foxes... &lt;br/&gt;The glowing sun and the burning hot desert sand make the life of the desert inhabitants a constant adventure. If one water hole is dried out, then they go to the next. On the way there, everyone is lost who misses the connection to the caravan. In the end, quite a few desert foxes lose their orientation, since their senses are confused by mirages. Therefore, holding the caravan together is the greatest skill of every tribal leader in order to reach the best position at the oasis while still safeguarding the community (from the back of the box).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player try to lead their camels to the best spots of the oasis. Every player has the same set of cards. Movement is made by choosing one of three visible cards, which range from forward 1-4, backward 1-4 and a few special cards. While moving spaces already occupied by another camel aren't counted, so staying together with the caravan (at least for some time) is quite useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
