			<description>Turn a scripted steel-cage wrestling match into a real fight in this 250,000-word interactive novel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've always dreamed of becoming pro wrestling's biggest star...but a wrestler's world is fraught with hardship and betrayal, in and out of the ring. Become a powerhouse, a technician, a high-flier, or focus on your promo skills. There's more than one road to success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But none of those roads will be easy. This is a world where your biggest fans are your harshest critics; where the front office is more dangerous than the squared circle; where friends can become enemies with a single heel turn; where, sometimes, the only way to win is to lose, spectacularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is professional wrestling. And you're about to change it, forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SLAMMED! is an epic interactive professional-wrestling novel by Paolo Chikiamco, where your choices determine how the story proceeds. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--but driven by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's never been a professional wrestling game like this, a game where the outcome of your final match, your choice of opponent, and your relationships affect the ending. When's the last time you played a pro-wrestling RPG with a &amp;quot;kayfabe&amp;quot; stat?--or where your trash-talking &amp;quot;promo&amp;quot; ability is as important as your core strength and wrestling technique?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
