			<description>Line of Fire is a shoot 'em up video game, played from a first person perspective, and developed by Sega. The cabinet features two light guns, and a design which allows the player(s) to sit down while playing the game. It was first released in arcades in 1989 before being converted to home computers and published by US Gold in 1990. It was released on the Sega Master System in 1991, however the style of the game was changed to that of an overhead scrolling shooter. It follows a two man commando unit as they try to escape from a terrorist facility after seizing a prototype weapon. The game was criticised for lacking drama, and the home versions have &amp;quot;blocky&amp;quot; visuals, however reviewers found that there were some nice touches. The Sega Master System version was seen as disappointing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Line of Fire (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
