							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aces Gin Rummy</name>
									
			<description>Get ready for a card game that makes all other forms of entertainment look like deadwood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are dealt. You pass on the up-card and draw from the stock. Two melds already and you&amp;rsquo;ve only drawn once! Sort the high cards down and discard that king. Not much deadwood, but if you knock now, you might get undercut. It&amp;rsquo;s risky either way, but you hang in there, hoping for a spade or a seven.&lt;br/&gt;One more draw&amp;hellip;and&amp;hellip;GIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast of Characters&lt;br/&gt;Want to play Gin Rummy against an elegant Victorian skunk? We&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered. How about a dapper beaver in a collar and waistcoat? You can do that too. With 11 different animated characters to choose from, including a variety of well dressed ladies and gentlemen (and equally well dressed farm animals and robots), our cast of quirky characters will charm the aces out of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay For All Skill Levels&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to Gin Rummy, don&amp;rsquo;t worry. The EASY difficulty setting is a great way to ease into the game. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for more of a challenge, HARD will have you planning every move and really watching the discards. Whatever your skill level, our adjustable difficulty system has the right setting for you.&lt;br/&gt;Traditional Scoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games in Gin Rummy can be customized to be played to 100 (if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a quick game), 150, 250 or 300 (if you&amp;rsquo;d like a game that lasts a bit longer). Scoring follows classic rules with a 100 point bonus for winning, a 20 point bonus for each hand won, and double points for shutting out your opponent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
