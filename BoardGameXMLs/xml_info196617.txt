							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baa&#039;Beel</name>
									
			<description>The construction of the cosmopolitan city of Baa'Beel has begun with the placement of the Foundation Stone. You, as a wise consultant, must take care to manage the expansion and population of the city. Dozens of orcs, humans, elves and dwarves swarm the city asking for a chance to settle and develop their neighborhoods, but of course you are not just being a good neighbor: When they finish the city gates, the city will be over and a new mayor will be elected. If the residents that came for your help control the streets and neighborhoods, your place on the throne will be granted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn in Baa&amp;rsquo;Beel the main player must buy one of the available tiles (buildings, houses or natural), then place one of their tiles in the map of Baa'Beel. Then the second player moves two inhabitants from their pool to one house in the city. In this moment, the adjacent inhabitants that don't get along with the races of the new inhabitant leave their houses, e.g., elves make dwarves leave their houses, humans make elves leave their houses, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the players control the houses in which they have the majority of inhabitants and the buildings for which they have the most adjacent houses controlled by them. Players obtain points from controlling houses and buildings, as well as for certain tiles, and whoever has the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
