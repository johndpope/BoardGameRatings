							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Chains</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the coast of the Auroral Ocean, almost directly opposite from the Pirate Isles to the east, stands Dis, the City of Chains. One of the member states of the Confederacy of Nine Cities, it sits on the eastern shore of R&amp;ucirc;l, perfectly situated at the intersection of several major land and sea trade routes. While nominally a trading city, it is more famous &amp;mdash; or infamous, most would say &amp;mdash; as the preeminent marketplace for the slave trade on the continent. Despite strict prohibitions on slavery elsewhere in the Empire, the peddling of flesh continues unabated in Dis, flourishing even, just as it has for nearly a thousand years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The well-to-do citizens of Dis enjoy a great deal of freedom: the freedom to own other people as slaves, enjoying a decadent and heady lifestyle at their chattel&amp;rsquo;s expense. The poor and downtrodden of the city enjoy none of these luxuries, instead living in constant fear of its ruler, the cruel autarch, whose minions snatch up those crippled by debt or who break the law, no matter how small the infraction, clapping the hapless victim in shackles and chains from which they will never escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City of Chains reveals one of the most cruel and decadent cities in the Confederacy of Nine Cities. As with other installments in this series, the information contained herein is intended to inspire you to develop Dis beyond what is provided in these pages, to help you make this vile and sinister place your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
