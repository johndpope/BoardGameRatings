							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barkley: Shut Up and Jam! 2</name>
									
			<description>The game is played from a horizontal perspective as the player and its teammate (computer or human) try to outscore the competition using any means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose from ten &amp;quot;streetwise&amp;quot; players, not including Sir Charles himself, as they play in either an exhibition game or tournament. Since this is basketball on the street, players compete in eight different urban environments featuring graffiti, rubble, and even a moving train. Over 2,000 player animations have been included to show moves such as behind-the-back passes, double-clutches, alley-oops, and 25 different dunks. Battery backup allows players to save tournament progress, as well as individual records such as triple doubles, total wins, and total losses. In addition, digitized voice samples of Charles Barkley offer either words of encouragement or ridicule while they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Barkley Shut Up and Jam! 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
