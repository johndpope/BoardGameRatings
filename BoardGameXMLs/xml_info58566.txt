			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enchanted Worlds Starter Kit is a boxed set containing the Enchanted Worlds rules and an adventure. The front and back cover are printed sheets glued to the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 34-page spiral-bound rulebook&lt;br/&gt;- 20-page adventure &amp;quot;Autumn Harvest&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;- a reference cardstock sheet&lt;br/&gt;- a full-color map of the game world&lt;br/&gt;- 2 character sheets&lt;br/&gt;- a &amp;quot;Read this first&amp;quot; sheet&lt;br/&gt;- a hand-knitted woolen dice bag with 2d10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Unlond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a time of danger and intrigue in a land of power and magic. Let this be your guide to the secrets within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages ago, war engulfed the world of Unlond in an epic conflict. For long years an alliance of humans, elves and dwarves fought against the evil forces of the Dark Prince Tidur. Finally, the Dark Prince was struck down on the field of battle and his forces withdrew to their homelands. Now, centuries later, the embers of that war still burn in the hearts of many. Peace has never been more than just a stalemate between the forces of evil and the alliance that opposes them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ill omens abound now. A plague swept through the northern lands last winter, weakening the nations of the alliance. Strange creatures have been sighted and sages fear that war will return to Unlond. Now is the time for heros, for new legends and new stories of valor and diplomacy to be made. Now is the time for you to experience the power and magic of Enchanted Worlds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game of fantasy roleplaying you and your friends take on the roles of heros fighting against the forces of evil and treachery. Each player has a character, your hero that you roleplay. One person must take on the role of the gamemaster, who is responsible for creating the storyline, describing the setting of the adventure to the players and interpreting the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are easy to learn and quick to use. Each player spends points to raise the character's Attributes, eight scores that represent the character's innate abilities. Players then pick Skills for their characters. There are dozens of Skills to choose from. Any combination is possible, from a sneaky fighter to a sword-wielding wizard to an expert hunter or anything else you can imagine. Each character is as unique as each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this box you'll find the complete rules for playing Enchanted Worlds games, a sample character sheet that can be photocopied for player use, a reference card with all the most commonly used charts and tables and a full color 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; map of Unlond.The game also includes two eight sided dice (all the dice needed for playing the game) with a special dice bag and Autumn Harvest the first adventure for the Seasons of Change storyline. The adventure has four sample characters, so you can play now without needing to make new characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps most importantly, the Enchanted Worlds Starter Kit is part of the New Worlds Game System. After you learn the rules of Enchanted Worlds, you'll be able to pick up either Distant Worlds (our science fiction setting), Fantastic Worlds (science-fantasy) or any other setting when they become available and begin to play immediately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
