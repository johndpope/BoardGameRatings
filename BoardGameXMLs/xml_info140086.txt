							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rugrats</name>
									
			<description>Promotional game issued by Singapore Airlines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four games are described that can be played with the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1 is Rugrats Match-Up and is played like Pairs in Britain but like Memory in the rest of Europe.&lt;br/&gt;Game 2 is Look for the Rugrats! Each player rolls the die (that has to be assembled) to see which Rugrat they are for that round. All the cards are laid out face-down. The seemingly same card backs actually hide an image of one of the Rugrats, and you have to use the special viewer to see it. So it is a race to find your Rugrat as each player searches at the same time. First to find their Rugrat claims the card and then the die is used again to determine which character you are for round 2, and so on. The player who wins the most cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;Game 3 is Rugrats Hideout. Players draw one card each which they can look at but must keep secret. Players take turns to ask 3 questions to try to find clues as to which card your opponent holds. If you guess the most correct answers, you win.&lt;br/&gt;Game 4 is Rugrats Showdown. This is played like Slap Jack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
