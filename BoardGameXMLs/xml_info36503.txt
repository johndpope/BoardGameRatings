			<description>&amp;quot;Megazilla attacks Tokyo!!!!!!! One player is Megazilla, the other is the Japanese military trying to defend the city.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a map of Tokyo divided into &amp;quot;blocks.&amp;quot; The blocks come in three types: Water, City, and Rural. The Megazilla player has one counter representing Megazilla. The JDF player has 80 counters representing land, air, and sea units of the Defense Force. Other counters include Rubble and Artillery Attack. The components also include a custom deck of cards used by the Megazilla player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: The JDF (Japanese Defense Force) wins if Megazilla is ever at 75 or more points of damage. Megazilla wins if he makes it to the opposite end of the map and reduces at least half of the city blocks to rubble.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
