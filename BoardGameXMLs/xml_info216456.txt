							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Trolls</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game of Trolls is a card game centered around trolling and testing the limits of your friendships. Players take turns attempting to attack one another, forcing them to either defend or draw a mountain of cards. The game's unique event cards get the entire group involved. It's an awesome family game and an epic party game that'll ensure you'll have fun at the expense of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The longer the round, the more dynamic the game becomes as Gold cards stack on additional rules, keeping everyone constantly on their toes. The first player to discard all their cards becomes the King of Trolls, acquiring game-changing perks for the next round. The loser also gets powers too because let&amp;rsquo;s face it, it sucks to suck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
