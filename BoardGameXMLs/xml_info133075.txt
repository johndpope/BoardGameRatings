							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Climbing the Greasy Poles</name>
									
			<description>A game that appeared in the Jolly Gnomes Annual in 1951.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board features 4 poles, with 15 spaces from bottom to top. Each player uses a separate pole. Movement is by a die. Nearly every space on the pole has instructions, sometimes good, sometimes bad. You must obey the instructions, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player reaches the top (by exact throw of course, in games of this vintage), wins the round. Everyone starts at the bottom and play again proceeds as above. The first player to win ten rounds, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
