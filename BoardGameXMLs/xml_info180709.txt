			<description>Hospital Haste is an exciting and challenging Time-Management Casual Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our heroine is Sally, who wishes to help people and decides to take up work in a hospital. Thanks to her help, patients suffering from unique and rarely encountered diseases will be taken care of in a comfortable environment, where they will be accurately diagnosed and quickly nurtured back to health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in cartoon-style graphics and is full of humorous elements. Over the course of the game, the heroine gains the resources needed to build and furnish her own dream clinic, which the player can arrange according to her own taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare yourself to discover five different locations, in which you will have to take care of many patients. The challenge will be greater with every level. Can you help Sally fulfil her dreams?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
