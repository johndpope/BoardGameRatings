							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Welcome to Junkbeach</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, what do we have here...?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lot of time has passed since the heights of mankind. While humanity marked its time in bunkers and cryostasis, or slowly came to terms with the radioactive lands of tomorrow, the ocean had have enough time return most of the trash that civilization dumped into it &amp;ldquo;back to sender&amp;rdquo;, and right onto the coasts wherever the streams and currents allowed for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result is a Junkbeach, a place where down-on-their-luck scavengers and looters shift through what has been washed ashore, in hope of finding ANYTHING useful or trade-worthy. And sometimes, there even is some useful stuff: whole automated container ships sunk in the aftermath of that day, others ended up on sand banks and reefs as satellite navigation began to fail. The ocean is not careful with the things it gets, but it is not a hoarder: sooner or later, things that drift and float are spilled back onto the coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
