			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever woken up dead, but just never realized it? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what happens to the crew of the Scientific Research Vessel, Clausius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the player characters awake from cryostasis, their brains, addled by the cryogenic mind fog of hypersleep drugs, are in no fit state to realize there is anything out of the ordinary happening - other than the proximity alarms blaring, and the crew of an unknown vessel about to board their ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As they scramble to save their ship, the player characters realize there is more going on than meets the eye. Not only has the ship&amp;rsquo;s distress beacon has been activated, but when they discover the withered husks of the rest of the crew, they realize their last memories of leaving Earth don&amp;rsquo;t match with what they are seeing. Except for one crew member, that is. He has distinct memories of events long after they left Earth behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
