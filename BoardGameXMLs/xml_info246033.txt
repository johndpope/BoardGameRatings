			<description>A roleplaying game of Time, Wizards, and Time Wizards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Time Wizards!?: A running joke that started during D&amp;amp;D games in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s regarding a typo in a splatbook forgotten by history, and ended up in roughly what you see here. The original version of the rules were just a bunch of nigh-incoherent mechanics scribbled on old notebooks, specifically intended to be obtrusive and problematic. The version you see here is essentially the same thing, but slightly better formatted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Will You Do in Time Wizards!?: In Time Wizards! you will take upon the role of a Time Wizard, a long-bearded master of the arcane arts that has transcended mere material boundaries and has become one with time itself. Essentially, this means you will play as a specific moment of time, using causality to alter events and achieve your probably pointless, but nonetheless heroic, goals. Your cosmic powers will depend on what happened during you (that&amp;rsquo;s it, what transpired during the time period you became).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Should You Play Time Wizards!?: You should not play Time Wizards!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Likely Mistaken Rules of Time Wizards, sometimes called Time Wizards Classic, was published in November 2013.  It is &amp;quot;the original&amp;quot; version of the game, as envisioned by the creators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
