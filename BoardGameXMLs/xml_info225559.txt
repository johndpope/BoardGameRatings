							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fighters of Porphyra</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a War-weary World, you need Fighting Men that do not carry Steel, but are of Steel&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the Patchwork Planet of Porphyra, war is a way of life, with vastly divergent cultures clashing in campaigns lasting for centuries.  Fighters on Porphyra are better, different, with alternate rules to &amp;ldquo;unchain&amp;rdquo; the iconic class, and make it a force to be reckoned with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The myriad and hostile forms of life, and the clash of Deist and Elementalist, and the typical struggles for power have generated many specialists in the art of armed combat.  The cavalry-fighting Anticavalier, brave (maybe too brave) Giant-Killer, the legendary Elementalist Immortal, the Janissary, born to be a mercenary, and the Pawn- humble and weak until he meets a powerful boss villain!  These and four more fighter class archetypes are present in Aaron Hollingsworth&amp;rsquo;s Fighters of Porphyra, published by Purple Duck Games!  Also included is a new hybrid class, the Elisud, counterpart to the Immortal, a blend of Paladin and Fighter that gets the job done on the front lines, like a good soldier should!  Other extras like intriguing new equipment, hybrid weapons for new ways of combat, and a select few magic items and weapon qualities, because a warrior that fights a new way lives to fight another day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
