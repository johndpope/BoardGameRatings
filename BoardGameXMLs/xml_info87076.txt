			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Def Jam Rapstar is a rap karaoke game for the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360, and a spinoff title of the Def Jam series. The game brings together a setlist of 45 popular rap songs and places the player on the mic to rap along. The radio edit versions of the songs were used in order to maintain a rating of ESRB: T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapstar is played by following along with the song and rapping to the cues provided onscreen. Performing lyrics correctly gains points, while making mistakes will prevent combos, much like other karaoke and rhythm games. The setlist included with the game has a range of musical styles, and varies between countries. The North American edition includes &amp;ldquo;Gold Digger&amp;rdquo; by Kanye West, &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t Truss It&amp;rdquo; by Public Enemy, and &amp;ldquo;Brass Monkey&amp;rdquo; by the Beastie Boys. In addition to the included songs, extra songs can be downloads as DLC from the online store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can go solo, team up with a friend, or compete with an opponent on a song, and a strong online community exists for players to interact with others worldwide. The Xbox 360 and PS3 titles include video capabilities, and players can upload videos of them rapping to the in-game songs. Video battles can also be initiated by uploading a video of the same song and having the community vote on which rendition of the song is better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
