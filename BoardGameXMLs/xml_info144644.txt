							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">21 Organizations</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 Organizations provides 21 new and varied groups to use in a Traveller campaign.  Each has its own unique history, motives, and goals.  Read about groups as varied as Solar Purity, The Cascadia Colonization Authority, and the Loyal Order of the Mystic Platypus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, 21 Organizations also includes career tracks for The Hub Federation Navy, bounty hunters, and The Cascadia Colonization Authority.  NPCs for many of the organizations are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the book has been designed to be used in concert with the history and locations of other Gypsy Knights Products, these organizations can easily be modified for use with any Traveller setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all our products, the main intention of this book is to provide an extra spark to the Referee's imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
