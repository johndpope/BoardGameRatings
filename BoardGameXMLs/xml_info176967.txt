			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the 1981 horror film, The Entity is a completed video game that 20th Century Fox decided not to release. It is assumed that this is due to the film's intense plot which deals with a woman being repeatedly molested by a ghost. Ironically the game has nothing to do with movie's sexual subject matter and instead involves moving the entity into higher planes existence. Horizontal lines representing these planes scroll downward on the screen. Each line has a gap (i.e. portal) and the player must use walls to force the entity through the hole and into the next plane. Liquid Helium can be used to slow down the ghost. The game ends when the supply of helium runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
