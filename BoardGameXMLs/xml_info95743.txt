			<description>The Tactical Assault: Fantasy Cards&amp;trade; is an elegant card-driven rule set for bringing exciting clashes of sword &amp;amp; sorcery - including command &amp;amp; control and the fog of war - to the tabletop battlefield in a very playable fashion. The rules are even able to incorporate the some of the more obscure aspects of pre-gunpowder warfare such as war machines, artillery, obstacles, sappers and so forth into the same fast-play, narrative based system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite being deceptively simple in appearance, the Fantasy Cards provide a very challenging game full of hard choices and long range planning. The fact that every card can offer multiple options, that there is no way of knowing exactly when certain cards will appear in a player's hand, and that not every unit will be available at all times (e.g. due to combat effects, confusion, etc.) forces players to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of almost every tactical decision within the framework of their overall strategic plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, with the incorporation of expansion decks, even more challenge and detail can be easily added to the base game. This allows players to customize the rules to the level of complexity they most enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if folks prefer their battles more in the form of a traditional board game, the Fantasy Cards can be combined with the new Tactical Assault: Legendary Battles&amp;trade; print-n-play packs. These sets give Fantasy Card players everything they need to play exciting battles in a hex and counter style format - including unique scenarios, beautiful full color maps and more than enough counters to allow players to develop their own scenarios. The only thing the players need to provide is their own Fantasy Card decks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this is offered in an easy to download print-n-play format available at the Tactical Assault Games website - along with articles on tactics, tips &amp;amp; tricks, designer's notes and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
