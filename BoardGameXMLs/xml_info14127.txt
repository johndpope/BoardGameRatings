							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great North American Bird Watching Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>This game features over 2,000 questions falling to three levels of difficulty &amp;ndash; beginner, intermediate, and expert &amp;ndash; making the game suitable for birders of all skills levels. Players move from space to space and answer trivia questions about the habitat, mannerisms, field marks, diet, and nomenclature of birds. The first person to get back to the start wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that birds staying within Mexico and Hawaii have been left out of the game. Some birds, of course, fly across the border or even across the Pacific Ocean. Birds of this type have been included. For example, there may be questions about the illusive Black-Vented Shearwater, whose range includes the western Mexico, the Baja Pennisula and southern California. There will, however, be no questions about the Giant Cowbird whose range, of course, only extends up Mexico's eastern edge, even though very rarely one of these ornithological wonders is blown off course into Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
