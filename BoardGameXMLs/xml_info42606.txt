			<description>One player is the game conductor. He shuffles the cards and looks that the game is played right. All players gets 10 red and 10 blue cards, the game conductor get these cards too, he plays like all other players.  First a situation card is uncovered like &amp;quot;Your company to go bankrupt&amp;quot;. Now,the cards from the hand are played (red &amp;amp; blue ones) with psychological profiles on them about how a player handles the situation. The game conductor counts the cards in front of the players and gives red or blue stones in the amount of the cards from each one. After,  the player rolls a die and moves on a gameboard.  I don't find anything in rules about the end of the game or who wins !??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E-Serie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
