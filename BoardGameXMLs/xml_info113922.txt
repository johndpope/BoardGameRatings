			<description>Trip World (トリップワールド?) is a 1992 platform video game developed and published by Sunsoft for the Game Boy. It was released in Japan on November 27, 1992, and in Europe in 1993. The game's plot centers around the bunny-like being Yacopu (ヤコプ?) and his quest to retrieve the flower of peace so that peace will return to Yacopu's disarranged world. The protagonist's trademark ability is to shapeshift into different forms.&lt;br/&gt; A port for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console was created and released in Japan on November 30, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first glance, Trip World is like a scaled-down, miniature version of Gimmick!, another one of Sunsoft's games. In Trip World, the player controls Yacopu through five relatively large and slightly linear stages to explore and complete. They include areas such as a mountain, a jungle, the ocean and a castle.[5] The stages also feature some secret passages and divergent paths. The objective is to find the stolen flower of peace, since the inhabitants of Trip World turned mad because of its absence, acting as the enemies in the game.[6] At the end of each world, Yacopu faces a boss, in the fifth and last world the player has to defeat multiple bosses in a row in order to complete the game. There are also a few mini-bosses in certain parts of the stages.&lt;br/&gt; Yacopu is able to shapeshift between three different primary forms at any time, these forms are manually activated by the player when desired.[7] In his normal form, he is able to walk and to jump and can attack enemies by kicking them. When Yacopu's ears transform into wings, he is able to fly in a limited way. This form doesn't allow to fly completely freely through a stage due to gravity, and since the player isn't able to change direction during flight, and Yacopu always falls down when he touches a wall. In the third form, Yacopu resembles a fish. While he can't move on the ground, the fish-like Yacopu is able to swim well and attack enemies with foam in water. Beneath these three forms, Yacopu also occasionally shapeshifts into other special forms which can't be manually activated or deactivated by the player. By picking up special power-ups, Yacopu turns into forms such as Flower Yacopu (stunning enemies with seeds) or Tail Yacopu (tail attack with long range) for a limited time.&lt;br/&gt; The player's character has four health points and loses them by touching spikes or when being hit by enemy attacks. Other than in many other platform games, most of the enemies in Trip World don't hurt the player's character on touch. Many benign enemies will become violent if attacked by Yacopu however. Most of them just push Yacopu around when not angered, while other enemies are able to attack in certain manners and do so freely. All bosses are able to hurt Yacopu. The player loses a life when all health points are gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Trip World&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
