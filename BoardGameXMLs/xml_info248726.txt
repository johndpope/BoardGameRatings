							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soul Puzzler: Turbo Edition</name>
									
			<description>Soul Puzzler - Turbo Edition is the All-in-One Expansion for Soul Puzzler, a 2-player, head-to-head, tile placement puzzle game inspired by the puzzle-based video games of the 90's to now. Soul Puzzler - Turbo Edition is easily accessible to all players with added characters and abilities to add increased depth that will please the more experienced gamer and past Soul Puzzler players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each turn a player may take one of two actions, that of playing a Soul Token or switching an existing Soul Token's Position. Once the Soul Token is placed or a Soul Token is switched, the turn then goes to the next player. When you have 3, 4, or 5 of your Soul Tokens in a Row or Column, you remove them and score points equal to the number of tokens you remove. All Tokens above the removed Soul Tokens fall to the bottom most portion of the board. The first player to reach 15 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
