			<description>Description from box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Sandman. He knows your name. You don't. He knows where you are. You don't. He knows what you have done, and why you must die. You don't.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To survive, you must journey through a tempestuous world in search of answers to a question as tenuous as your own existence. You play the role of an amnesiac traveler, lost in a world beyond the natural. The rules are brief, preparation easy, and the story rich. The Sandman is watching... Why don't you face him?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters awaken on the Orient Express suffering from amnesia - and thus starts this &amp;quot;Instant Adventure&amp;quot;, the first and only offering in what was supposed to be a series of such games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandman is termed an Instant Adventure because it was intended to be played with little or no preparation on the part of the players. The game includes four scenarios (The Sandman Comes, The Prophet of Darkness, A Feast for the Eyes, and Map of Halaal), each of which was intended to be run in a single evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
