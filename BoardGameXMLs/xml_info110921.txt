			<description>The topic chips for human - natural - heavenly - terrestrial are sorted and laid out as stated in the rules, as are the randomly chosen and shuffled obstacle tiles. These obstacles can only be mastered by discarding of topic chips. The questions cards are sorted in order of the topics, but if so desired can be shuffled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you are the questioner, you draw the front card and name the topic, the facts, the questions and all answers. Then all players in turn choose and name one of the answers. Then the correct answer is read. If you answered correctly you can either move your pawn or take a corresponding topic chip from stock. If you reach a face-down topic chip first, you get it. If all answer wrong, the questioner gets a chip. If you answer correctly &amp;quot;all wrong&amp;quot;, you move one step and get a chip. A spot containing an obstacle tile may only be entered if you can discard 2 corresponding topic chips. The rules also provide for players who have dropped back very far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
