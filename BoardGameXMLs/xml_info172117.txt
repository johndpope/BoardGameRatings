			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many horrid monsters that lurk in the dark places of the world, but none is as cruel or terrifying as the vampire. These immortal fiends exist in an unnatural state between life and death, but they walk undetected among their living prey. They are intelligent, sadistic, patient, and thirsty for human blood. Only the bravest and most skilled monster hunters dare to challenge one of the lords of the night, and most of them die a fool's death. There are many legends concerning vampires, but only some of them are true. Knowing the true nature of the enemy is the only way to survive an encounter with a blood-drinking prince of undeath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This source book for the Monster Hunters RPG contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Background on European vampires: their habits, their motivations, and most importantly, how to track and kill them. &lt;br/&gt;      Stats for different types of vampires, vampire variants, and rules for creating your own unique monsters *  Known vampires of Europe: histories, background, and habits&lt;br/&gt;      A collection of vampire servants and related monsters&lt;br/&gt;      New feats and equipment &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
