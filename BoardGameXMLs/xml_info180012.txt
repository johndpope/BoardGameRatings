							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I-List Music Party Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's the fast-find song frenzy that pits your playlist against your friends' in a simultaneous music challenge for up to four players!  Connect up to four MP3 players (not included) and let your fingers do the flyin' as you show what you know about your music collection.  When you're done playing, use the console to play your favorite music!  Plus, the console stores everything, making it easy for you to take this tune-tappin' song-matching game anywhere you go!  Game console comes with cables, 60 cards, and instructions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique game is played by everyone connecting their MP3 players or smart phones to the game console via the included audio cables.  Players take turns drawing cards and reading aloud the categories.  All players must then search through their playlists in a race to be the first one to play an appropriate song.  If the song does indeed fit the category, that player earns a point; otherwise, they lose a point. Once all cards have been played, the game ends and the player with the most points is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
