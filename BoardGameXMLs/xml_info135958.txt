							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Casey &amp; Andy</name>
									
			<description>From Steve Jackson Games website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to a comic-strip world where the golden light of science holds the promise of a better future for all humanity.&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science can indeed do anything - which means scientists are the most powerful, important people in the world. (OK, this is clearly not our world.) And at the top of the heap are those undaunted by the constraints of inadequate theories, the challenges of defying conventional wisdom, and the dangers of nuclear radiation. In short, mad scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Casey &amp;amp; Andy is based on Andy Weir's hilarious webcomic Casey &amp;amp; Andy. The title characters are 21st-century mad scientists dabbling in time and dimension travel, instantaneous cloning, and increasingly complex apocalyptic doomsday devices. Apart from that, they live in suburbia with their girlfriends, Mary and Satan. Yes, that Satan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Casey &amp;amp; Andy is also a complete GURPS Fourth Edition sourcebook available only as a PDF right here on e23! Casey &amp;amp; Andy is written by David Morgan-Mar, who knows a thing or two about webcomics with his own Irregular Webcomic, and certainly knows a thing or two about writing for e23. It also features tons of Casey &amp;amp; Andy art by webcomic creator Andy Weir, including an original four-page story just for this PDF!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
