			<description>Contents: 16 cars in 4 colours, 1 number die, 1 letter die, 1 board, and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of 4 cars in their colour. They must use a car until it has parked and then they can use their second car, and so on. First to park all 4 of their cars, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the number die to move your car. You can go in any direction. A parking space must be reached exactly. When you park a car you must roll the number die again together with the letter die (this is called &amp;quot;paying the parking metre&amp;quot;). The throw will probably refer to a parking space somewhere on the board, the number die reveals the area and the letter die reveals the actual parking place in that area. Any car in that space must be moved back to the start. Should a blank be rolled on the letter die any cars in the parking places must 'feed the meter again' i.e. roll the number and letter dice again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is undated but an educated guess would be around 1960. Interestingly, even with fewer people around, it was still difficult to find a parking space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
