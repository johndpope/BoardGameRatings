			<description>&amp;quot;The glorious Maneuvers&amp;quot; is a thinly-themed game about soldiers marching but is basically a race game. Players are progressing their piece along a 83 space track. Pieces can be stacked up to 3 levels high. There are white, black and gray pieces scattered along the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece's move is the piece's position (behind all players' pieces and stacks of pieces), times the piece position in a stack (1, 2 or 3). If it is on a white or black piece there as additional multiplier of x2 or x3. So one can complete the race in two giant moves if you are clever and lucky. Pieces must move between 1 and the full value available. Pieces that bolt way out in front tend to hang out there a while. Pieces that hang back can often make the biggest moves. Also if someone is on top of a piece it isn't moved, but every exposed piece must be moved every turn, so things don't usually stay blocked long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 gray pieces that are worth 1, 2 and 3 VPs each and go to the first player to land on each. Otherwise there are 12 spots worth 12, 11, 10, etc VPS so you count the total of all the pieces VPs and add gray piece VPs to get a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
