			<description>Interesting tourist simulation set in Washington DC.  Seems to have been put together by a company that was interested in tour guides (Macomas, Ltd).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns choosing a type of venue to visit (historical, presidential, entertainment, bars, diners, sports, etc).  Then they roll a six-sided die to determine which of the six places is available for them to attend.  The result shows them how much time and money must be expended along with the resulting victory points gained (which is a straight formula based on time and money).  Some locations can only be visited at night (and no later than 9:00 to start); others are only daytime affairs.  If the tourist returns to their hotel too late, they are docked victory points. The game ends after two days (four segments of night/day).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of hotels, players also decide which area they wish to stay in (close in, convenient but expensive, or farther out), which affects their total allotment of money.  Players also choose transportation modes (walk, taxi, rental car, subway) where the time/money trade off rears its head again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few cards that players can use to augment their scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, it's a move-and-roll game, rather than vice versa, and it's very spreadsheet-like in that players log their comings, goings, time, and points on a grid/scoresheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
