							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Danainae &quot;Queen Mabby&quot; Mab</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The queen of the Fairies is here! You may address me however you please.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fairies don't have Queens, naturally. It would be like herding cats, except that cats are deliberately pulling pranks on you. You just like to pretend you're a Queen, and you do it in the only way possible: to the precise extent that others happen to feel like acknowledging it. For all that you're playing a role, though, you take the obligations that come with it quite seriously - as seriously as the fae take anything, anyway - and always try to do right by your &amp;quot;subjects.&amp;quot; You're neither haughty nor condescending; all in all, you're a real people-person. Or...a fairies-fairy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
