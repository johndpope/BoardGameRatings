							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arc of Fire</name>
									
			<description>A modern arms miniatures game that seems to have grown out of the advances made in the BGWWII rules. It includes scenarios for WWI, WWII, Angola, Vietnam, and the Boxer Rebellion. The scale is 1:1 skirmish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arc of Fire (AoF) is intended for games employing forces up to company level, with from one squad to three platoons on each side using 10mm-28mm miniatures, often with armor or artillery support. One of the prime design goals of AoF was to find a level of detail that was fun and easy, but still captured the flavor of skirmish gaming. If rifle magazine capacities, tanks&amp;rsquo; power-to-weight ratios, or the quantity of high explosive in particular shells are the type of factors you really want in a game, you should probably not be looking at this book. The basic assumption of AoF is that leadership, training, organization and motivation are more important than minor technological advantages in deciding who wins. By concentrating on these rather than on &amp;lsquo;kit&amp;rsquo;, AoF produces a fast and exciting game that is more realistic than many games that obsess about technical detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Face of Battle: The Hill Battles – Khe Sanh, Vietnam: 1967&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
