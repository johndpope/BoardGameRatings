							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rivet Wars: The Man in Charge</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Some men are born to follow and some are born to lead. The Colonel, as everyone refers to him, is definitely the man in charge. When he walks into a room one can feel his presence. And the gaze of his eye is always scrutinizing his men, looking for any flaw, any weakness. When charging into battle, this is the man you want in charge!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was a KS Exclusive figure for Rivet Wars. The Man in Charge has special leadership abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
