			<description>(from box back)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHOICES transports players into the world of decision-making. It is an adventure of thought that begins with a dilemma and ends with a choice. Tucked in between is competition, verbal action, and a lot of guesswork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your family, friends, or Bible study group will find CHOICES to be a fun and challenging activity. They will come face-to-face with life and sometimes nose-to-nose with opposing views of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of CHOICES are twenty principles. They find their root in the Bible and focus on twenty issues of life. Each principle is supported by several verses from the NIV Translation of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 to 10 players can play, but 4 to 8 are best. CHOICES can also be played in teams, and is designed for ages teen to adult. Each game includes 170 Dilemma Cards, 20 Answer Cards, 10 Principle Cards, a plastic storage tray, and a reference booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
