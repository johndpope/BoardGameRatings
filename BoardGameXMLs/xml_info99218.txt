			<description>A Monopoly type game (roll the dice, move round the board, but this game is set in the world of football.&lt;br/&gt;Contents - the box says 'This box contains one playing board and approximately 450 components'.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has the objective to take his team from the 3rd Division to the 1st Division and then to win the title. There are numerous cards such as, Press Report, Disciplinary Hearing, Result, that sort of thing.&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to buy players who are good in the Division you are currently in, and improve the team's performance. The track on board is octagonal and six sides relate to week-days and two sides relate to Saturday morning and afternoon. On that afternoon you collect gate receipts when you pass the square designated for that purpose. This improves as you rise up the divisions. Also in this section, you can choose to earn 1 point for your match (the game was a draw) or you can purchase a Result card and take your chances.&lt;br/&gt;The designers were two British footballers, quite well-known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
