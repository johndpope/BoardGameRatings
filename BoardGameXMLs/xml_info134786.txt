							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Laser Defense</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser Defense places you in control of the United States strategic defense satellites. These satellites sit spinning in orbit, ready to intercept nuclear missiles with high-energy laser beams. They also have the capability to destroy missile silos on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screen shows you the United States and its cities as though viewing them from orbit. You can look north over the pole. With the press of a button, you can see Europe and the Soviet Union. Missile launchers are visible, and even as you watch, a continuous stream of nuclear rockets rise and disappear over the pole to destroy your home cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is simple: destroy all the missile silos while intercepting rockets launched toward the U.S. Pulverize the enemy. Keep your cities alive. As you proceed to each new wave, more and faster missiles are launched. Particle beam weapons on underground MX tracks attempt to blast your satellites from orbit, and your fingers itch to activate the final defense . . . ERADICATION!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
