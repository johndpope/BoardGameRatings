			<description>from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CROSSCHECK&lt;br/&gt;A Strategy Crossword Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of sharpening pencils for crossword puzzles? Then sharpen your wits for this exciting new game that provides the ultimate challenge for crossword and word-game fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stop the spin of the on-screen die to determine the length of your word, answer the clue correctly, and place the first answer on your own Starting Bar in the center of the screen. Thereafter, place your answer anywhere on the board. It may stand by itself or cross any other word, even one of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s, provided it forms a valid word with any word it crosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy is crucial. Place words where they will do you the most good or where they will interfere with your opponent&amp;rsquo;s next move. You may also have the option to place a single letter or a solid square to block other players. The goal is to build an unbroken chain connecting your Starting Bar and Home Base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CROSSCHECK allows up to four players or teams to play to a set point-limit, a set time-limit, or until one player reaches his Home Base. Clues vary from easy to difficult, making CROSSCHECK a game the whole family can play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;-Easy-to-use commands&lt;br/&gt;-Shift from close-up to full overview&lt;br/&gt;-Additional clue libraries (including children&amp;rsquo;s version) available&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
