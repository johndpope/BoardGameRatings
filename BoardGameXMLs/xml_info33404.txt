							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NFL Strategy Jr.</name>
									
			<description>Produced in 1974 with new NFL rule changes, this is a version of the NFL Strategy game for younger children. This game is a generic simulation of American football. (No real teams or players) Each turn the offensive player chooses a run or pass play from a set of cards while the defensive player chooses from 4 run defenses and 4 pass defenses by placing pegs into a hidden matrix. The offensive play is then inserted into the defensive matrix and 5 possible results are revealed. A die is then rolled and the color of the die face indicates which play result to use. Regular football rules are used, such as 4 downs to gain 10 yards, and scoring is the same as in the real game. As in real football, the object of the game is to outscore the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
