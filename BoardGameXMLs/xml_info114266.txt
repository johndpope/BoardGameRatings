							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Iosara</name>
									
			<description>Mystery accompanies each step taken by Iosara, only the Empress or possibly her advisors know any of the true details relating to this enigmatic entity. Even Iosara&amp;rsquo;s gender is not conclusively known. The only thing that is for certain is that Iosara&amp;rsquo;s swords appear wherever it is necessary to fight for Elisabetta&amp;rsquo;s dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Empire Warrior - Lv. 50&lt;br/&gt; At 5 | Dm 5 | Df 9 | Ar 2 | LP 15 | Re 10 | Mo 12/16 | AP 3/4&lt;br/&gt; Innate Abilities: Immunity (Doom).&lt;br/&gt; ooo - Crystal Fire (Ki, Ranged Attack)&lt;br/&gt; Distance 16 inches. If this attack causes damage, the target suffers Slow Lv. 1. Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt; ooo - Death Bringer (Ki, Attack)&lt;br/&gt; +4 Damage.&lt;br/&gt; oooo - The Three Fates (Ki, Attack)&lt;br/&gt; Iosara makes three consecutive Attacks. If the first causes damage, the target suffers Seal Lv. 1, the second causes Blind Lv. 1, and the third attack causes Doom Lv. 1. Each of these states cause a separate resistance check vs. Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;IOSARA Unborn&lt;br/&gt; Specter: If Iosara is reduced to 0 or less LP, it becomes a specter instead of being destroyed. While a&lt;br/&gt; specter, Iosara becomes Intangible, cannot recover LP through any means, and is removed from play if it takes any damage.&lt;br/&gt; Wandering Shadow: Iosara is not deployed normally at the start of the game. At the beginning of each Recovery Phase roll a die, on a 9+ you put Iosara with all its Actions Points anywhere on the board that is not within 2 inches of an enemy Unit. When rolling for Wandering Shadow, apply the following modifiers:&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;+1 for each game turn that has passed.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;+1 for each Unit that has been eliminated from Iosara's party.&lt;br/&gt; Power Absorption: When Iosara destroys an enemy Unit, choose a Magic or Ki ability from the Unit. Iosara gains a copy of that ability. Iosara uses the ability as though it was on its card. All costs, benefits, and drawbacks of the copied ability remain the same. Iosara may only copy one ability at a time, so if later in the game it destroys another enemy Unit it may copy a new ability replacing the old one or retain the old one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
