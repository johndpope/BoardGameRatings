			<description>This game comes as five dice packaged in a tube with a short page of game rules. The ones on the dice are replaced with lobsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first game (just called &amp;quot;A Lobster Dice Game&amp;quot;) players must successfully molt their lobsters by rolling the dice. Unsuccessful players are out of the game, and the last lobster to molt is declared largest and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second game (&amp;quot;Lobster Fishing&amp;quot;) the players score one point for each lobster of legal size caught (i.e., a lobster rolled along with a 4, 5 or 6.) After 10 rounds of fishing, the winner is the one who caught the most lobsters legally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
