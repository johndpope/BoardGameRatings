							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Moose</name>
									
			<description>Our super friendly moose has shed his antlers. Help him regrow new ones by adding one branch at a time. Be careful! If he tips over, you'll have to begin again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns helping an adorable moose grow new antlers by stacking brightly colored wooden squiggles onto the rocking base. Just don't be the one to bring the whole thing crashing down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
