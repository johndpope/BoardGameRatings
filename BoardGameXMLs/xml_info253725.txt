							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kentucky, 1861: Loyalty, State, and Nation</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the northernmost slaveholding states, Kentucky plays a pivotal role in the crisis unleashed by Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s election in 1860. Student roles include political leaders, newspaper editors, and militia leaders. Opening with a special session of the legislature, Kentucky, 1861: A Nation in the Balance forces students to struggle with the complex and divided loyalties of their roles. They must determine how to reconcile varied motivations, interests, and ideologies with an unprecedented and intensely combustible situation. Informed by assorted speeches, debates, and political tracts, students debate the cultural, economic, and political concepts driving secession while reacting to a constantly shifting political and military situation. Through the use of rhetoric, the press, and paramilitary action, they struggle to alter the fate of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
