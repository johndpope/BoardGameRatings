							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Entropic Settings: Underhome</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An abandoned dwarven city, Underhome is completely submerged. A poorly placed mining shaft tapped an underwater lake that flooded the city, forcing the inhabitants to suddenly flee, leaving most of their wealth behind. The majority of their crafts remaining intact, since they were made out of metal or stone, Underhome now contains technology and knowledge lost to the remaining inhabitants of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underhome is a dark fantasy setting for the Entropic Gaming System. Designed as a region to be set within any setting or campaign, it&amp;rsquo;s usable at any character rank and can even provide a new home for the player characters. With a slight change of flavor, Underhome can also be placed in any epic fantasy setting and includes new OGL adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underhome includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New OGL adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;    A collection of NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;    A city with map and important places.&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip; and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
