							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;Blackout&quot;</name>
									
			<description>Educational game recommended for Sunday School teachers to help children with their numbers' recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, the child spins a number and then reads out the word on their board relating to that number. That word can then be crossed off, i.e. a Blackout counter is put on to it. Play proceeds until one child has crossed off all their words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lessons can be graded. Younger children can start with Blue cards, the Yellow can be attempted, then Green, and finally Red. It is suggested that Red is not used until the teacher is sure that the children are ready&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
