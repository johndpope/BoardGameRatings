			<description>DESIGNER'S NOTES:&lt;br/&gt;This is the third set in my card driven wargame rules, and although still loosely inspired by the Battle Cry &amp;amp; Memoir '44 games by Richard Borg, the game no longer has a battlefield divided in 3 sections. Battlefield sections are great for ACW and WWII, but spreading a (smaller) imperial force across the battlefield would not always be realistic or playable, since in most colonial battles a smaller well armed imperial army faces hordes of natives. The left-center-right wing Battle Cry/Memoir '44 principle has here been replaced by color-coding the units red, green and blue (activated by cards of the same color) thus enabling the imperialist player to concentrate his units anywhere on the battlefield if he wishes to. Also, compared to ACW or WWII, there was a much bigger difference in quality of weapons used by imperialists and natives. Therefore the symbols on the dice are no longer representing the targets but rather the type of ammo/weapon used, whereby the more modern weapons have a better chance of scoring hits than outdated ones (see rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since many colonial games are played in &amp;quot;Darkest Africa&amp;quot;, an (optional) set of &amp;quot;event cards&amp;quot; is added in order to spice up the &amp;quot;adventure&amp;quot; type games. When using the fast play variant, games with 20-30 native units (and about half of that number of imperial forces) can be concluded in 90-120 minutes (ideal for a club night). In order to have a balanced game, the number of victory points to be scored by imperialist armies should be around 1.5 times higher than for native forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
