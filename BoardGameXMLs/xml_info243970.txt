			<description>In 1918, newly independent Finland is in turmoil. The Senate and the Parliament are paralyzed, restless Russian troops are still stationed all over the country, and pro-government and revolutionary paramilitaries are clashing. The Senate flees the troubles from the capital to the north, while its army, the White Guard, starts to disarm Russian garrisons. At the same time in the capital, the People's Delegation declares a revolution and its Red Guard starts to seize power in southern Finland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, 1918 is a two-player strategy game of the Finnish civil war. Players are in control of the pro-government Whites and the revolutionary Reds and their respective allies. All factions are unique with different kind of units, creating asymmetrical but balanced gameplay. The game has three scenarios, with different set-ups, objectives, and durations that depict different stages of war. In addition, there is the Grand Campaign, covering the whole war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than simulating mere fighting and battles, 1918 combines combat, type and quality of units, supply, casualties and fog of war into more complex warfare. On a strategic level, players have to create and maintain an army, keep an eye on the enemy, and secure their supply routes. On a operational level, players must take into account different kind of terrain and infrastructure affecting battles, in addition to their fighting forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All factions differ from one another. Factions also differ in every scenario or campaign, both by units available and the phase they come into play. Different objects of scenarios also change the entire way of playing with different sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set-ups, units, and objectives of each scenario and the campaign are converted from real events and situations of the Finnish Civil War. Also each sides' support in the country, their means of support, and the infrastructure and the terrain are taken from respective real-life equivalents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
