			<description>The players will practice simple addition and subtraction to collect as many cards as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 face-up cards in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;The player turns over his top card and mentally adds or subtracts the amount with that on the start card. If the result does not match, the next player plays his top card, combining the amount with the previous running tally. The plays continue until a player matches the target or cards run out. In the first case, the player making the match is the winner. In the second case, no one is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;40 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
