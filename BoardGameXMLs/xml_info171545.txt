			<description>Shop till you're top! Shopping Queen is a game based on the successful television show on the German TV channel VOX that features a group of girls, &amp;euro;500, and four hours of time for the perfect outfit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the women go up and down the shopping mall from one store to the next in a pink shopping mobile. The time is running out, and only if the &amp;quot;candidates&amp;quot; answer the questions about the fashion world correctly and excel at various actions will the shop doors open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever thinks she has found the right style may enter the catwalk where each promising shopping queen has to face the judgment of the other players. Star designer Guido Maria Kretschmer also plays an important role in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
