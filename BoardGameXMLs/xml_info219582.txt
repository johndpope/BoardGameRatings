			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is not dead which can eternal lie and with strange aeons even death may die.&lt;br/&gt;The stars!... The stars are... wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No. The stars are right. The stars are right at last...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Midwich. Now. 1985.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Seven years have passed and somehow, against all the odds, we few prevail. The ruins of the old town now provides limited shelter against The Morbus and the entities that lurk and murder in the folds of mist, though I use the term shelter with no small cynicism, for truly nowhere on Earth is safe for our kind. Not anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is our base, but not our home. We must return, it seems, but only for short periods. Salvation we have found, by sublime irony, within the depths of the very dimensional magic that is no doubt responsible for the fate of our planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Let me explain...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STRANGE AEON, FREE PLAYER EDITION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 47 page Strange Aeon lite edition for players or the casually interested! We've removed 300 pages of the Game Keeper specific stuff and left only the crucial information players will need. Just 47 pages with minimal artwork. Printed back to back that's just 23ish pages. A neat self-printed reference for your game group and completely free. This is exactly the same PDF as included with the Game Keeper edition, so if you have that, you already have this, no need to download again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
