			<description>Nelaxtam is an abstract strategy game in which players are trying to land troops on an island, represented by a 12x12 board. Each space on the board is marked with a white or black marker and the goal is to destroy your opponents territory and remove those markers from the board. Troop movement and action is revealed simultaneously by both players. Troops can either move or destroy an adjacent enemy territory. The game is over once one player cannot position any of his five troops in a position to destroy further enemy territory. The player who has removed the most enemy territory is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
