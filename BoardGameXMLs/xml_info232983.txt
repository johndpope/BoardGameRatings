			<description>Do you know how high the Eiffel Tower is in metres? Or where Napoleon I and his wife were crowned in 1804? Find out in BrainBox Paris On-The-Go, which contains 35 beautifully-illustrated cards showing the very best Paris has to offer, and then some!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept, and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
