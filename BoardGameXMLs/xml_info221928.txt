			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Olivier Bellerose is an agent in a 19th-century European secret society known as The Engine. Olivier carries out various missions for this group including theft, seduction, sabotage, and assassination. Armed with the best intelligence and equipment, he forwards The Engine&amp;rsquo;s secretive agenda one mission at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Cache is a collection of characters designed to be used in tabletop RPG gaming, either as character concepts for players or as NPCs/villains by GMs. Artist Matt Morrow illustrates the character pieces, and Encoded Designs writes a system-neutral description, including how to incorporate this character into your campaign. These write-ups also include hooks for encounters and adventure inspiration, plus tags for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the system-neutral write-up are stat blocks for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fate Core&lt;br/&gt;    Savage Worlds&lt;br/&gt;    5e&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
