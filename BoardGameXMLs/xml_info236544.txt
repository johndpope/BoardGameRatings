			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For over eight hundred years, the Empire has dominated the lands of R&amp;ucirc;l. A vast realm of incredible wealth and military might, it grew by conquest, annexing nation after nation, until it stretched from the Desolation in the north to the edge of the frozen wastes in the south, and from the feet of the Shield Mountains in the west to the shores of the Auroral Ocean in the east.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rising from the ruins of the kingdoms it conquered, the Empire became the mightiest nation in all of R&amp;ucirc;l, a power whose fall was inconceivable. But fallen it has as the capital city of Caecras drowns in the blood of the orc uprising, and many of its provinces are breaking away. A shadow now creeps across the land, the drums of war are sounding, and chaos and uncertainty spread like wildfire across the continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entry in the Lands in Shadow series details Caecras (KAY-cress), the crumbling heart of the Empire. In the following pages, you will read about its history and geography, as well as the portraits of important personages. You will also find statistics for common characters, and several new options for player characters. With Caecras, you have everything you need to explore the ruined capital, and make it the centerpiece of your Shadow of the Demon Lord campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
