							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jelly Bean Farmers</name>
									
			<description>Jelly Bean Farmers is a light-hearted game in which you build your farm in a tableau in front of you. You gain food by growing it on your farm or by plundering your opponents as a warlord. Struggle through drought, pestilence, and aggressive neighbors to become the greatest farmer of all time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with 2 to 4 players, but is best with 4.  The game content is appropriate for any age, but the complexity would be a reasonable challenge for a bright seven year old.  Game play is about 45 minutes to an hour, and you will have eaten (usually) 16 of the edible counters when you are done.  (... so don't use large cookies or shots of tequila, but animal crackers or small, disposable cups of beer work fine).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts for 8 'years,' where each year is split into two seasons.  Each year the players draw cards and choose (in advance) one to play each in the spring and summer seasons.  The players choose whether or not to plant their fields for the spring season, then the spring weather is revealed and players resolve their actions.  There is some flexibility in how a player chooses to resolve the action, especially if he did not plant, but he must use the card that he previously selected for the season.  Crops are calculated and each player must eat one 'food.'  Hopefully he is not eating the last of his seed crop!  Then the planting, weather, action resolution, and crop resolution are repeated for the summer season.  Finally, any warlord tribute is paid before the next year starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is about 60% luck and 40% skill -- the best players tend to win more often but not every game.  It is silly and fun, with unexpected turnarounds due to odd weather or unexpected cards.  There is also a mechanic where a player who has been wiped out can cash in 'food stamps' and keep playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
