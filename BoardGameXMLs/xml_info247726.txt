			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are six rituals for the Delta Green Handler&amp;rsquo;s Guide, which we cut due to lack of space. The psychic abilities, for example, would have required a section on the presence of psychic powers in the setting, as well as notes for the Handler on the risks of giving such potent abilities to players (we&amp;rsquo;ve provided some notes). It seemed wiser to save them for the PISCES book, which deals with psychic Talents directly (and they will be addressed in more detail there). The &amp;ldquo;Dreaming Door&amp;rdquo; ritual raised all kinds of questions about the Dreamlands that we just did not have room to cover in the Handler&amp;rsquo;s Guide. And &amp;ldquo;Bottled Soul,&amp;rdquo; drawn from Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Strange High House in the Mist,&amp;rdquo; was just too specific and weird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released to subscribers on Delta Green's Patreon and Drip feeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
