			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen of Lies is a d20-compatible fantasy adventure for 11th-level player characters (PCs), and requires the use of the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition Player's Handbook, published by Wizard's of the Coast. Included with this adventure are several pages of maps; magic items; and a new monster, the arachnemass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back of the Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep below the surface, in the sunless lands of the Netherdeep, creatures of darkness build weapons and armies and dream about invasion. An attack on a temple sends the heroes on a quest to retrieve stolen artifacts and kidnapped friends. All signs point to the actions of the dark elves of Ul-Drakkan. But, even within that ancient fortress, there exists a deeper darkness....&lt;br/&gt;Underground enemies lurk beyond every twisting passage, and strange creatures abound. The foul culture of the dark elves is both decadent and cruel, and the heroes may discover that they've stumbled into a web of deceit and treachery that threatens the lives of all who oppose the dark elf Queen. Can the heroes complete their mission without being discovered, or have their very actions been orchestrated by the Queen of Lies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An epic fantasy adventure for 11th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen of Lies is an action-packed adventure written by DMG author Monte Cook. A challenging scenario designed for 11th-level characters, Queen of Lies is filled with well-developed dark elf personalities and showcases their alien culture, full of merciless betrayal and dark lust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring new monsters and magic items that dwell within the unique environment, Queen of Lies will test the mettle of the hardiest of heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen of Lies was published before the setting Ptolus was published. After D&amp;amp;D 3.5 was released Queen of Lies (OGL 3.5) was revised for that version of D&amp;amp;D as well as adding it into the Ptolus setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
