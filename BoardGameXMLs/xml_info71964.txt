							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">British AFV Cards</name>
									
			<description>This expansion for Advanced Squad Leader provides the British forces of West of Alamein: ASL Module 5 a set of 24 &amp;quot;AFV cards&amp;quot;.  Each card represents an AFV (armored fighting vehicle) type and has counter marker tracks for up to a platoon of such vehicles.  Markers for armor leaders, malfunctions and special equipment could thus be off board, allowing for less clutter on the mapboard units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common in miniature game systems, vehicle tracking cards in ASL first appeared for German and Soviet forces in Streets of Fire: ASL Deluxe Module 1 and then for American  forces in Hedgerow Hell: ASL Deluxe Module 2, both encouraging the use of 1/285th scale armor miniatures as mapboard units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use of the cards does not impact the AFV rule set, it is simply a record keeping enhancement.  In particular, these cards are not meant to provide a means of hidden information, as the rules specifically require the AFV status to be displayed at all times to the opponent.  Thus, for example, hidden armor leaders are still be noted somewhere off of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Page F18 of Chapter F provided in West of Alamein: ASL Module 5 stated: &amp;quot;British AFV Cards will become available for purchase as of January 1989.  Their cost will be $5.00 US, plus 10% for shipping within the USA (or for APO/FPO); or 20% for Canada or Mexico; or 30% for shipment overseas.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
