			<description>Vermeer Spel is a promotional Monopoly-like game developed by Identity Games in commission of the Vermeer Groep (projects in construction and infrastructure). Players try to earn money by realizing building projects. A project can be realized if both development card and realization card for that particular project are in use. Cooperation is important as these cards can be in use by different players when realizing a project. Additional money can be earned by players if an opponent lands on their building project already  realized. If all construction sites are built up, the game ends. The player who owns most money at that moment wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
