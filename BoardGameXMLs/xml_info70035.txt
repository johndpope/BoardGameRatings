			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;It's springtime in Pixie Hollow, and Tinker Bell and the rest of the Disney fairies want to make their gardens sparkle! Help them gather flowers, berries, and creatures to take care of. Players try to match their cards to the three pictures on the fairy pawns. If you only have two of the items in your hand, you can ask your friend for the third! Once you have a match, you get to take the fairy pawn and put it in front of you. The player that collects the most pawns wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Includes 7 Pixie Hollow Fairy Pawns &amp;amp; Stands, 28 Cards and Instructions&lt;br/&gt;-For ages 5+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
