			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge stolen from the ruins of an ancient city now steers the fate of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ebla Restored, the third Asylum Pack from the upcoming &amp;quot;Revelations&amp;quot; cycle for Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game, adds to the cycle's focus on the power and dangers of eldritch knowledge. Its new cards promote exciting new synergies between dark Tomes and the daring Relic Hunters who seek them. Meanwhile, players gain unprecedented control over their decks and discard piles, finding new ways to work with lost knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the forgotten secrets of ancient Ebla provide you the answers you need to stymie your foes? Will humanity tremble before the terrifying might of the Ancient Ones restored to their former glory, or will heroic investigators and scientists thwart them and their zealous cultists to maintain sanity, at least for another day?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ebla Restored introduces sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty cards) that provide players with new incentives to hunt down ancient Tomes, visit remote Libraries, and prevent rival Relic Hunters from fetching powerful artifacts for their respective factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
