			<description>Ascension: Storm of Souls is the first in-app expansion for the popular deck building iOS game Ascension: Chronicle of the Godlsayer. Conceived and designed by three Magic: The Gathering tournament champions, Ascension: Storm of Souls introduces new game mechanics, and can be played as either a stand-alone game or played as an expansion for Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ascension: Storm of Souls is quick to learn and easy to play. Game play revolves around a Center Deck containing Heroes, Constructs and Monsters; and players take turns recruiting Heroes or Constructs for their decks or defeating Monsters to earn honor and ultimate victory. New cards are revealed every turn, forcing players to react and ensuring that each game is dynamic and unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuing the epic struggle which began in Chronicle of the Godslayer Samael is defeated, but the world of Vigil has been left in turmoil in his wake. In Storm of Souls, players will see different factions rise to prominence with the new Event cards, and have powerful new Trophy Monsters to hunt! In addition to the brand-new mechanics, players will also see powerful new takes on popular mechanics from past Ascension releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIGHLIGHTS:&lt;br/&gt;- New Event Mechanic&lt;br/&gt;- New Faction cards&lt;br/&gt;- New Trophy Monsters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;- A complete 1-4 player game&lt;br/&gt;- Can be combined with Ascension: Return of the Fallen&lt;br/&gt;- 101 New Center Deck Cards&lt;br/&gt;- New Fanatic card!&lt;br/&gt;- New art&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
