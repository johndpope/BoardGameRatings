							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Melford Murder</name>
									
			<description>An AD&amp;amp;Dâ„¢ Mini-Adventure for 4-8 1st-level characters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Module back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Strikes in the Night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of the small village of Melford are stunned when one of the most prominent citizens is found dead one morning. Clues are scarce, suspects are everywhere, and the constabulary is stumped. A rich reward has been offered to anyone who can help drag the killer out of the web of shadow and intrigue they have woven around themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Melford Murder provides two levels of challenge: as a standalone adventure, the PCs will have to catch the killer and bring them to justice. If played as the second module in the trilogy (The Spider Farm, The Melford Murder, Shrine of the Oracle), the risks and challenges are greater, but so are the rewards. Are your players willing to match their wits against a killer Particularly one who may be willing to kill again to keep their secret...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
