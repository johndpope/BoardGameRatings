							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crossbreeding: Flesh and Blood</name>
									
			<description>From the intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;An owlbear paces round and round the dry moat encircling the wizard&amp;rsquo;s castle, seeking any creature foolish enough to have entered the moat willingly or unfortunate enough to have been thrown there by the wizard&amp;rsquo;s minions. Up in the wizard&amp;rsquo;s stables a pair of night-black pegasi nicker nervously, as they always do when they hear the owlbear&amp;rsquo;s hungry cries. Their oversized ravens&amp;rsquo; wings are as dark as their equine coats, the feathers shining in the scant moonlight filtering in from the open stable door. From the tallest tower of the wizard&amp;rsquo;s castle spills light of a different sort, magical flames burning eternally in their iron sconces, illuminating the wizard&amp;rsquo;s workroom and those within it. The wizard runs his hand through the fur at the top of his cat&amp;rsquo;s head and it purrs its contentment, rubbing up against him for more, folding its dragon-like wings out of the way and carefully keeping the tip of its envenomed scorpion-tail from scratching its master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of magical crossbreeding is not always an easy one and there are many mistakes that can be made along the way &amp;ndash; mistakes that can, quite literally, come back to bite you! However, with enough practice, a new form of life can eventually be brought into existence and it is then, flush with the excitement of success, that the magical crossbreeder feels the true power of arcane spellcraft.An owlbear paces round and round the dry moat encircling the wizard&amp;rsquo;s castle, seeking any creature foolish enough to have entered the moat willingly or unfortunate enough to have been thrown there by the wizard&amp;rsquo;s minions.
