							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starcade</name>
									
			<description>Starcade is a micro card/dice game that hints to favorite video games like Galaga and FTL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the captain of a starfighter. Unfortunately, there is no shortage of antagonists in space. Your ship has different systems represented by dice. Can you keep your ship on course for the battles with the alien vessels crowding the galaxy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starcade has 3 distinct modes of play:&lt;br/&gt;-Solo&lt;br/&gt;-Player vs Player&lt;br/&gt;-Co-op&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each mode was designed separately using the components in this pocket sized game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1-3 people can play Starcade with a single pack, up to 6 with 2 packs (Player vs Player only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players first set up their system resources. Then players roll attack dice to battle the alien drones, fellow pilots, or the dreaded Mega-Mothership. In Solo mode players fight through waves of drones in an attempt to defeat them and a mothership with the most Victory Points possible. Players will have to carefully manage their ships resources and decide which ship upgrades to purchase. The upgrades are powerful, but they cost the Player Victory Points to purchase them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the multiplayer mode Players roll their attack dice to see who will be the last ship standing. Players will have a limited bonus resource to work with and must be careful when to use it. This is the fastest mode of play and easy to take and play anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the Co-op mode offers the chance for players to work together to defeat the Mega-Mothership before her powerful arsenal conquers them and maybe even the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
