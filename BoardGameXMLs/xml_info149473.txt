			<description>Sound the alarm! A huge Tornado! is wreaking havoc on the outskirts of Tornadoville, USA! Rescuers from the elite Tornado! Rescue Unit have been sent to help. You are one of these Rescuers. Get ready to clear debris and free family members from the rubble, but beware the Tornado! Its particular brand of cyclonic evil can block you from finding people in need. Who will be the best Rescuer? Only time will tell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tornado!, two players take turns as the Rescuer and as the Tornado! As the Rescuer, players will flip over cards and remove debris while hunting for and saving trapped family members to earn points. But the Tornado! player will attempt to block the Rescuer&amp;rsquo;s every move by throwing cubes onto the playing field. Not only can the Tornado! keep the Rescuer from scoring points, it can force the Rescuer to score points for the Tornado!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
