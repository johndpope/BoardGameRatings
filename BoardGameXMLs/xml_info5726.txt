			<description>Tycoon is a stock market trading game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board, buy/sell stocks and bond and check rising and falling prices of stocks held.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally self-published in 1962, Parker Brothers bought the rights and republished it in 1966.  Later self-published again as Arbitrage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A description of Arbitrage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arbitrage (HC Jacoby Inc) Is a stock market and corporate manipulation board game. The board is a Monopoly type with the movement track that goes around the edge and with the middle taken up mostly with price tracks for the 6 corporations in the game. Each corporation has 3 spaces in a row on the outside track that counts as it's home. Then there are a few other spaces that give allow either specific actions like buying/selling mutual funds, or make you draw a random event or a stock manipulation card. Stocks are bought buy mainly landing on one of the 3 spaces of a corporation's home, or buy landing on a mutual fund space. If you own 3 stoacks of a corporation you become its president and can pay out dividends to stockholders, or can merge corporations thus increasing stock prices. Other things that can happen are takeovers - forcing a resident to sell you his shares, options - a chance to buy shares from the bank or another player for 1/2 price. Trading of shares between players at any time is also encouraged. The game ends either after a set ammount of time, or when a player goes bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement around the board is accomplished with 3 dice ( regular D6, and 1 special die which has symbols on it to move stock prices either up or down. A player's turn consists of rolling the three dice, moving his marker to the new space, manipulating a stock price up or down by the die roll, then performing the action on the space where you landed (if any).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
