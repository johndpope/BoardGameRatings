			<description>From the Game's Text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About my RPG HYBRID: It assumes that reality tries to reveal itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Author: I'm trying to find an easy way to make sense out of gibberish that is found in many advanced math books, by Rule # 369. And, use that to understand science-fiction that of MU &amp;amp; Dr Who.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HYBRID is an incomplete homebrew RPG that attempts to model a large number of emergent phenomena through a small number of mathematical formulae. The function X^Log10(X) is one of the core parts of the system. The game is mostly diceless, although d6 are used where randomisation is employed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of many rules (551 in the last version) each of which either states a way to model something using the game's formulae, or is just a commentary by the author (and not actually a rule). Some of this commentary is not directly related to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game text makes many references to other RPGs. The most frequent references are to the 1986 version of Marvel Super Heroes, Champions / HERO, Aberrant, and GURPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
