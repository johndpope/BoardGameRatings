			<description>In  Fist Full of Coins players arrange playing pieces according to instructions on a card and receive coins based on the complexity of the task and how well it was carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the game comes a game board that serves as the holding area for the games pieces, the four levels of game cards, and is where the player assembles the pieces.  The pieces in the game are various unique boxes and colored items which are arranged to match the instructions on a particular game card. There are four levels of card complexity in which the amount of instructions, and memory work increases.  Players decided on how many turns to take, and at the end of those turn the person with the most coins is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be used daily to aid in communication and reading comprehension, dyslexia, and memory.
