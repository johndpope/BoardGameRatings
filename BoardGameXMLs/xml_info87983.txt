			<description>From the publisher website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Red Hand of Doom Web Enhancement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War is gathering in the dry brown hills known as the Wyrmsmoke Mountains. As midsummer settles over the land, smothering everything in heat and dust, the fierce warriors of the Kulkor Zhul -- &amp;quot;People of the Dragon&amp;quot; in the hobgoblin tongue -- gather beneath the dreaded Red Hand banner, ready to sweep down out of the Wyrmsmokes and conquer the human lands below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a special tool for DMs running The Red Hand of Doom, we're pleased to present this Enemies and Allies compilation for use during the adventure. This document contains complete stat blocks for every encounter, in the order of their appearance in the book, which eliminates the need to frequently flip to the appendix of the book. Please note that a few stat blocks have been truncated to get them to fit on a single page (some descriptions of special qualities have been replaced by page references). Also, creatures from the Monster Manual that appear in this adventure are not represented by stat blocks in this compilation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoy The Red Hand of Doom. Just remember to watch out for a certain five-headed dragon...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This last event begins as soon as the PCs strike a mortal blow against Azarr Kul. As his body crumples to the floor, he cries out in rage at his failure . . . and his cries are heard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
