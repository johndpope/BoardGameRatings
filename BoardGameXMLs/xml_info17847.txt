							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flip Flop Go</name>
									
			<description>This is another variant of the late 19th century game of Reversi (aka Othello). Trap other pieces between your own to capture them but be aware that the opponent may do the same. Pieces will change sides (colors) dozens of times. Points are scored every time a chip is flipped, as opposed to OTHELLO where it is only at the end points are scored. Each player also has a STOP chip and two DOUBLE chips. The STOP chip is undetectable when played and only shows itself when the opponent attempts to flip it. The DOUBLE chips always show and it doubles the points scored in that row when it gets flipped. If there are two DOUBLE chips in a row being flipped the score is quadrupled. There are handy thumb wheel scoring devices for each player attached to the game&amp;rsquo;s board as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
