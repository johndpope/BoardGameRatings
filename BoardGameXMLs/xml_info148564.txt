			<description>From the designer's blog:&lt;br/&gt;This micro-game was written in two sittings in less than a day and has not been playtested (other than in my head) so I cannot vouch for how well it plays. I based much of it on the excellent game All For Me Grog by Ryan Shelton, my current favorite system to mess with, and threw in a little I stole from Kirin Robinson. Hopefully it all works for a supers game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This is an ultralite superhero rpg based on the system from All For Me Grog.  The dice required can be anything capable of generating numbers with parity (even/odd): coins or any polyhedral dice with an even number of sides can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
