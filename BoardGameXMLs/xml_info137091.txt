			<description>From Pilots, for Pilots:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condor: The Competition Soaring Simulator is designed to recreate the ultimate experience of competition soaring on your PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lot of attention was put in to create an environment which would create an immersion of real competition flying. This means that the aerodynamics and weather physics were in focus of the development. The result is amazingly real feel of flight in all flight regimes and weather conditions which challenges a real soaring pilot on a competition day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amazing feel of flight due to the advanced flight dynamics model&lt;br/&gt;      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Advanced 6DOF flight model for complete freedom of flying.&lt;br/&gt;     Accurate sailplane performance and handling &amp;ndash; also at and beyond critical angles of attack.&lt;br/&gt;     Sailplane damage simulation &amp;ndash; flutter, high G stress, collisions.&lt;br/&gt;     High time fidelity physics engine (up to 500 cycles per second).&lt;br/&gt;     Accurate ground forces for realistic takeoffs, landings and crashes.&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed, sub-object collision detection for mid air and ground object collisions.&lt;br/&gt;     Accurate conditions for a realistic towing and winch start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realistic weather model for all aspects of competition soaring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Realistic thermals life cycle: starting from the ground they reach cloud base, the cloud becomes bigger and more dense and later dissipates which causes the air below it to sink.&lt;br/&gt;     The location and strength of thermals is based on terrain sun exposure and ground features like forests, fields and villages.&lt;br/&gt;     Realistic daily sun travel which affects the frequency and strength of thermals.&lt;br/&gt;     Up slope wind on sunny ridges (anabatic winds).&lt;br/&gt;     Ridge lift with leeward downwind and turbulence, venturi effects.&lt;br/&gt;     Waves behind ridges, wavelength depends on wind speed and stability of the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;     Correct atmosphere pressure, density and temperature height distribution.&lt;br/&gt;     3D isotropic turbulence model for thermal and mechanical turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;     preset and custom weather conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed planes with fully animated cockpits &lt;br/&gt;     Multiplayer&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed terrain&lt;br/&gt;     Ability to record and analyze flights&lt;br/&gt;     Real-time NMEA output&lt;br/&gt;     Real-time flight parameters output&lt;br/&gt;     Various competition disciplines&lt;br/&gt;     Accessible to players of all skill levels&lt;br/&gt;     3D sound support&lt;br/&gt;     Native TrackIR support&lt;br/&gt;     Realistic forcefeedback support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
