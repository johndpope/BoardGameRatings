			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State of Jefferson: The 51st State is a story roleplaying game about the people of Northern California and Southern Oregon living off the grid in America&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;51st State.&amp;rsquo; Characters are farmers and loners, removed from the digital world and doing everything they can to live free from cumbersome state laws and taxations. But, is this place safe from modern day carpet baggers? Can folks truly live in harmony with nature? State of Jefferson explores the crossroads of modern living colliding with notions of true freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
