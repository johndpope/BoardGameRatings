			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you know...&lt;br/&gt;You are not in your own body. You can remember snatches of your past, of a heavenly existence, and of a terrible fall from grace, but no more. This place is only fleetingly familiar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you have been told...&lt;br/&gt;The thing that calls itself Ghede has told you that you were once something more than human; you were a god, a post-human, one of the Loa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your fellows carved worlds from pure matter, danced in the corona with suns and created life as playthings. You moulded the very stars themselves, and held worlds in the palm of your hand. Your world was called the Understar - a paradise beyond this reality. Separated from the material realm, your kind found delight in watching and manipulating the lesser beings trapped in a material existence on the Flame Worlds, playthings created for your pleasure. You called it Dreaming, an endless source of entertainment and intrigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But times change. You committed a crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A terrible crime, one that stood against all that your peers believed in. And for that you were thrown out, ejected, cast down to the lower worlds, named an Exile. Now the Understar seems little more than a vague memory that slips through your fingers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is hope. Ghede, the force that represents the Understar in the material reality, has offered you a chance to return home. All you must do is walk these lesser worlds performing tasks as required by your new master, and in doing so find a way to resolve the guilt of your crime. What you seek is forgiveness and a return to the Understar. Under Ghede's guidance you invoke your one-time comrades, the Loa, and through them reveal more of your home and your past. Doing so risks psychosis, but Ghede gives you the black pills it keeps to help with that, as long as you are good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is where you are - the Flame Worlds, a hazily remembered place of death and intrigue, among billions of souls trapped in this mundane existence. You and your fellow Exiles must accept Ghede's offer, and meet others of your kind to do his bidding. What will you discover among the Flame Worlds? Who knows, but if it ends your exile, it is worth it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Flames is a science fiction role-playing game of action, adventure, psychosis and discovery utilising a variant of the D6 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
