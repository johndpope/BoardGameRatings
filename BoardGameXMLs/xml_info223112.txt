			<description>A game of two halves is a two players game you are the coach of a soccer team and try to won the match. Choose formation of your team (442,433,451,...), roll one dice for each player in a row. The best in midfield win an attack. If you win an attack  you've the right to shoot. Substitute,penalty, red cards, star player are included.&lt;br/&gt;It is easy to add chrome for example use real team with real player and give them modifiers ( do not use the star player rule)&lt;br/&gt;Basically it is a multiple dice game but it incorporates a lot of basic soccer concepts and tactics so for all you footy fans out there this is a great way for a head-to-head challenge, or even a tournament with a few friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
