			<description>Like many MMORPGs, players can create their own character and explore and advance in an open world with other players that are also connected. A player may create a character using a variety of class/race/attribute combinations found commonly in most MMORPGs. A more dangerous addition to the gameplay is the potential for Permanent death also known as Permadeath. Upon character death, you have a chance of losing your character forever. The chance of losing your character can be reduced by sacrificing items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wizardry Online&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
