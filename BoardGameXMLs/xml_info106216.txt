			<description>Ren and Stimpy Show Part II: Fire Dogs is a Ren and Stimpy video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Based on the Nickelodeon cartoon, Fire Dogs was one of the episodes in the first season. The player has to search through the different levels of a firehouse to find different objects to go on the firetruck.&lt;br/&gt;It was more of a puzzle game than an action game as violence was few and far in-between and the goal was the sneak out of the fire station ready to fight fires before time ran out. If time ran out or if the fireman caught the player, then he would lose a life. Nintendo Power once claimed that the time limit was too strict and the AI was not complex enough. The second level would involve a trampoline and fighting fires before players are forced to repeat the first level again. After making it from Monday to Friday, the player finally is given an award and the player has officially defeated the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ren &amp;amp; Stimpy Show Part II: Fire Dogs&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
