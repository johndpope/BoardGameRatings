			<description>Abstract two player game with a soccer theme. The player that scores more goals than the other after an agreed time wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a team consisting of 11 figures. The playing field consists of 83 spaces with connections between them. On each space there can only be one figure or the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn a player can kick the ball in a straight line if he has a player next to the ball and move one of his 11 figures one space. If a player cannot kick the ball he can move two figures one space each (or one figure twice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some more rules like fouls, passing or kicking the ball over an opposing figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
