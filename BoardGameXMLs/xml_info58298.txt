							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">5150: The Negotiating Game</name>
									
			<description>The game is designed for adults who would like to learn and practice negotiation skills and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are part of a team that is trying to get a product to market. Each player has a different role (CEO, Content Expert, Creative Director, Union Boss, etc.) with different, often conflicting, priorities. As they move through different phases -- conducting research, designing the product, creating a prototype, production, and marketing -- players have two minutes per phase to agree on a course of action. If they cannot reach a majority vote, everybody loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name &amp;quot;5150&amp;quot; refers to the nature of negotiating, and is also a term used by California law enforcement as code for someone who is crazy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Game board&lt;br/&gt;     3 Situation Cards&lt;br/&gt;     9 Role Cards&lt;br/&gt;     15 Event Cards&lt;br/&gt;     Chips&lt;br/&gt;     1 Die&lt;br/&gt;     Timer &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
