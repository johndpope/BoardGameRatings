							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Esoteric Orders: The Cultist</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stars Are Right!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy worlds are full of secret societies that dress in strange garb, meet in hidden places at predetermined and arcane times, chant strange chants, and perform eldritch rituals whose significance could never truly be understood by an outsider. These secret orders, brotherhoods, and cabals are collectively known as cults, and their members, cultists, and they have captured the popular imagination for centuries, and are a staple of fantasy media. It is, of course, possible for a member of a cult to belong to any number of different classes, but while barbarians and druids get their own classes with special class features to set them apart from classes like fighter or cleric, and provide unique play experiences, the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a class designed specifically for cultists. Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Esoteric Orders: The Cultist presents a base class specifically designed for cultists, with unique and flavorful abilities that tie into the common expectations of cultists in fantasy media, such as their inherent madness, their penchant for communing with otherworldly forces, and committing ritual sacrifices. Each cultist also chooses a specific cult to which they belong, from among 15 included here, which determines many of their class features and abilities, ensuring that cultists belonging to different cults play very differently. Finally, the book is filled with beautiful art by Phill Simpson, which brings each of the cults to life before your eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
