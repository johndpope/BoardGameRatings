			<description>Eat Me! is a fun and simple card game about monsters eating other monsters. Bigger monsters eat smaller monsters, but even the biggest monster falls to the power of monstrous card combos and abilities. In this &amp;quot;monster eat monster&amp;quot; world, the monster (and player) who proves hungriest triumphs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player wants to build his personal stack of monster cards. To do this, he takes two actions from these five possible choices, repeating an action, if desired:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw a card from the common deck of monster cards.&lt;br/&gt;     Discard a card from his hand.&lt;br/&gt;     Eat a monster by placing a card on top of any player's monster card stack as long as it meets two criteria: 1) the card is a higher value than the top card of the card stack and 2) the card is a different color than the top card of the stack.&lt;br/&gt;     Breed monsters by discarding two cards of the same color from his hand, thereby earning a special monster power (e.g., look at an opponent's hand, or choose a card and put it in your hand).&lt;br/&gt;     Discard a three-card poker combination from his hand to perform a super monster power, such as eating a monster without meeting the criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends the instant that the common monster deck runs out. Each player then counts the number of cards in his personal monster card stack, and the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
