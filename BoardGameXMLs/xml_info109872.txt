			<description>4 players compete in a fast-paced turn-based racing-game. Control your speed, drift the corners and send your opponents off the track with lethal weapons. You need to make the best decisions with limited options. Where is the next bend, what is the speed of your opponents, what weapons are available and who can you push in to that race-ending trap? Make sure you cross the finish line first or see to it that none of the other players do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build the track before each race using tiles and customize their cars with equipment and weapons. Each new race delivers new challenges as cars are upgraded and tracks re-imagined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accelerating, hitting the brakes and using different equipment and weapons all needs to happen in a split second when racing so each turn your actions are limited. Managing speed is the key to victory! Enter the corners too fast and you crash, go hard on the brakes and weapon-pickups will be gone when you arrive and being careless might get you rammed in to traps by your fellow racers.  You need to race smart as taking damage will cause your top speed to go down. A few dents are fine but taking too much punishment will eventually end both the race and your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
