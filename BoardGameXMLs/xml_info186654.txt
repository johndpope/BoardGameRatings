			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miravlor is an ambitious role-playing rules set presented as numerous downloadable MS Word &amp;quot;DOC&amp;quot; files, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     How do I play?&lt;br/&gt;     Frequently asked questions&lt;br/&gt;     Introduction to Miravlor&lt;br/&gt;     Heroes and anti-heroes (classes)&lt;br/&gt;     Spiritual allegiances (belief systems)&lt;br/&gt;     Basic rules for combat&lt;br/&gt;     Character customization&lt;br/&gt;     Weapon charts&lt;br/&gt;     Equipment prices&lt;br/&gt;     Skills&lt;br/&gt;     Denizens of Miravlor (monsters and NPCs)&lt;br/&gt;     Animals&lt;br/&gt;     Magic&lt;br/&gt;     An invitation to the advanced game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The referenced &amp;quot;Advanced Game&amp;quot;, alternately called the &amp;quot;West RPG&amp;quot;, was a work in development that apparently was never published.  The materials suggest the game is intended to be multi-genre but the presented rules are definitively in the fantasy realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, characters have Attributes, Class, Levels, and Skills.  Character building is very complex but somewhat more flexible than similar class/level systems.  Likewise, combat and magic also are quite complex.  While the introductory materials invite new players to utilize the system, the actual rules suppose a reader quite familiar with standard role-playing methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
