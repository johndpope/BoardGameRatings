							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainous Archetypes Volume IV</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Good to Be Bad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sick of saving the world? Tired of being expected to leap at the chance to solve everyone&amp;rsquo;s petty problems? Have a thing for twirling mustaches and overly-elaborate deathtraps? Why not mix things up with a villainous character! At some point in their gaming career, everyone has considered playing an &amp;ldquo;evil campaign,&amp;rdquo; but with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game being devoted to goody-two-shoes heroes, it can sometimes be hard to find support. Want some evil options for your character? You&amp;rsquo;ve found them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new villainous archetypes for five different classes. Included are the eldritch devourer, an arcanist archetype that focuses on stealing magic from those around them, the doomsday cultist, a cleric archetype devoted to ruin and sacrifice, the callous outlaw, a gunslinger archetype whose deeds focus on cruel and unusual uses for firearms, the suppressor of wills, a mesmerist that excels at enslaving others, and the singer of midnight steel, a skald archetype that wears intimidating face paint and can raise hordes of the undead with his screaming songs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as Way of the Wicked, by Fire Mountain Games, or the first official Paizo adventure path made specifically for evil characters), or you just want an excuse to play an unrepentant, irredeemable villain, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for villainous NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
