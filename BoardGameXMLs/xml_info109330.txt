			<description>Each player starts with a shuffled stack of all cards from one suit (or two for a longer game). Players deal cards face-down into their own rows of front and back &amp;quot;trenches&amp;quot;. A player may peek at his own cards anytime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of one of three actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Reveal a card in the opponent's trenches.&lt;br/&gt;     Swap positions of two neighboring allied cards.&lt;br/&gt;     Attack: Flip two directly opposing cards. Discard the weaker card, and return the stronger card to the owning player. Each player slides a card from their back trench into the spot emptied by the attack and lays a replacement card in the back trench.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player left with only three cards loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
