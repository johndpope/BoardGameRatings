			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;  Well we've finally reached issue 3 of Critical Miss and it's beginning to look like we might actually be getting the hang of this magazine lark. (Let us know if you think we're being a bit prematurely optimistic here).&lt;br/&gt;      The best thing about doing Critical Miss is how it's reached out to people all across the world. So far, we've received letters and subscriptions from readers in the following countries: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Holland, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Portugal, South Africa, Venezuela, the United Kingdom and last but not least, the United States. If any of you guys are from some countries not on the above list then please drop us a line to let us know.&lt;br/&gt;      The other big news is that we are now listed on Yahoo which was a pretty nice ego boost for us. But that's enough self-indulgent waffle. I'd better let you get on and see what we've given you this issue. Hope you like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
