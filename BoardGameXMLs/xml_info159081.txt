							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clue / Parcheesi</name>
									
			<description>Clue and Pachisi together in a tin. It was available through Avon. It is based on the 1996 edition. The quad fold board is slightly smaller than the traditional game, but everything else remains the same. One side of the board is for the game Clue and the other is for the game Parcheesi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Parcheesi, each player has a set of pawns that start in his or her corner of the board. The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; section. Movement is controlled by dice. All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns. Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over. The winner is the first player to move all pawns &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
