			<description>&amp;quot;Realms of Chaos is a platform game written for MS-DOS, published by Apogee Software (now 3D Realms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realms of Chaos was distributed as shareware. It consists of three episodes, with only the first episode playable in the shareware version. The episodes are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Episode 1: Myraal Realm&lt;br/&gt;    * Episode 2: Goblin Realm&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;The game is still sold by Apogee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls two characters, a warrior and a mage, and can switch between them at any time. Both characters have slightly different abilities, and players are meant to use a different character for different situations.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Realms of Chaos, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
