							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Divine Hunters</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deities, taken as a group, value their followers like a devil values souls. That is, followers are essentially currency and power for those with the divine spark. Unfortunately for most deities, followers possess free will; nothing gets in the way more of the best-laid plans. Most times when a true believer strays, a simple atonement spell &amp;mdash; typically coupled with a suitable quest &amp;mdash; is enough to steer things back toward the deity&amp;rsquo;s favor. Sometimes, though, the offense is so severe an atonement spell just isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. Some offenses are so severe, so drastic, that forgiveness is nigh impossible. The only recourse in these circumstances is to dole out swift and severe punishment. Most of the time, deities are loath to interact directly with mortals. To handle these special circumstances, they have an unusual breed of hunters called the nel&amp;rsquo;barzoth. Divine Hunters presents four new monsters, including a CR 22 mythic version, to hunt your infidels; it also presents the GM with rules for creating new versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
