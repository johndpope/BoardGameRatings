							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grab</name>
									
			<description>Players sit in a circle, preferably on the floor as a large playing area is required, with the deck of letter cards shuffled and placed face down in the middle, within everyone's reach. One player shouts 'grab' to start the game, and everyone takes four cards and attempts ot spell a word. Each player lays their word in front on themselves, in straight lines, vertically or horizontally. The first player to use up all their cards shouts 'grab' and all players take four more cards each. Each player lays out their words crossword style, with people shouting 'grab' as they run out of cards, and everyone taking more cards on cue. The round ends when one player runs out of cards and there are none left in the central pile. That player scores five points, while the other players score -1 for each card they have failed to use. Any player found to have spelled any words incorrectly scores an additional -5 points for each such word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
