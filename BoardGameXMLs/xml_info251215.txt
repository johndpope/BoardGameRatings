			<description>Publisher's DTRPG blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond a doubt truth bears the same relation to falsehood &lt;br/&gt;as light to darkness. &lt;br/&gt;- Leonardo da Vinci&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the alternate reality world of Asiyah.

Noble houses and factions feud, reactionaries threaten to destroy all that has been built in this grand age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained within these pages is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A setting focused on an alternate reality Italy in the world of Asiyah.&lt;br/&gt;Details on several Italian cities, from the Floating city of Venice to Florence the City of Invention.&lt;br/&gt;Information on the strange realms of the Great Beyond, from The Faery to Sitra Ahra.
