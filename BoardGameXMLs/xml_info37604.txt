			<description>A nice tile-laying game where the goal is to make the longest snake possible, but it's not quite that simple. Snakes are built in various colors, and body sections can be added that match. Players can catch snakes that have a head and at least two body parts, but longer snakes are worth more points. So the idea is to wait long enough to get good points, but not so long that someone else catches the snake you've been building up. The first player to catch a snake gets the &amp;quot;snake bracelet&amp;quot;, and they wear this until a snake of a longer length is caught. The person wearing the bracelet at the game's end gets bonus points in addition to their snake points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
