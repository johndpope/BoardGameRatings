			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magna Mundi was planned as a spinoff game for Europa Universalis III, which aimed to add detail to the game's map and to steer the course of the alternate history portrayed by the game more towards real-world history by means of scripted events. A standalone version of Magna Mundi was planned to be developed by the mod's authors, operating as the development studio Universo Virtual, and to be published by Paradox. In June 2013, MM was cancelled by Paradox, who cited &amp;quot;lack of progress&amp;quot; in the project as the reason for this decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universo Virtual, claiming to have a game ready for release, announced legal action against Paradox. The leader of UV proceeded to claim he owned the Clausewitz engine underlying Europa Universalis because the license to further develop the Magna Mundi did not specifically refer to UV as not owning it and proceeded to open-source a game he called World Stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Mundi#Magna_Mundi_spinoff&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Mundi#Magna_Mundi_sp...&lt;/a&gt;;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
