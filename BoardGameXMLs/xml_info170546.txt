							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Krampus</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Tis the season... for MAYHEM!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Krampus is a devilish holiday-themed villain perfect for your Mutants and Masterminds 3E Campaign. The Krampus is fed up with people who &amp;quot;ruin&amp;quot; Christmas, and he's going to do something about it! Who is really beneath that devil's costume? What madcap plan does he have this time? Access the first issue of Rogues, Rivals &amp;amp; Renegades and discover the latest intel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Authored by Jack Norris, and with full color art by Alex Williamson, Denise Jones, and Ruben Byrd, this new super-villain is the first release in our Rogues, Rivals &amp;amp; Renegades series. Starting early in 2015, this series will become a regular product line offering NPCs suitable for dropping into super-heroic campaigns. Each character is designed as a villain, a potential ally with complications, or an outsider who might help the PCs one day and be at odds with them another! Each one has the potential to become a mainstay of your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogues, Rivals &amp;amp; Renegades are presented as files from a meta-human monitoring agency called METAs, with a loose frame story connecting them to Vigilance Press's own Beacon City setting. They are designed to drop into any setting with minimal effort, however, and the METAs commentary is written to give you a better picture of each character's personality and threat level. Each issue gives you a background for the character, commentary by METAs agents, a standee to print and play with, and the Hero Lab file for the character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
