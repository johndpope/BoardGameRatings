			<description>This game is played with lego pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Architect. He creates a Rule to which a lego-building must comply. The other players take turns to create small lego-buildings from a few pieces. The Architect reviews these buildings; &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; buildings are free, &amp;lsquo;faulty&amp;rsquo; buildings cost money. Players earn Victory Points for guessing the Rule. A round continues until either the Rule is guessed, or until all players are out of money. Then the next player is Architect. After all players haven been Architect once, the player with the most Victory Points wins. Rules below in dutch and english.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
