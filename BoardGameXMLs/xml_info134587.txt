			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you may have noticed, this isn&amp;rsquo;t your standard roleplaying game. We&amp;rsquo;ve taken everything you&amp;rsquo;ve ever loved about roleplaying and live theatre and brought every element into live, vivid, HD color, screaming at you until you can taste the blood and see the brain matter as real as your imagination will allow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Legacies (the game this booklet was designed for) is a game of Conspiratorial Horror/Survival. We&amp;rsquo;ve taken the best elements from each theme to make the darkest, most twisted game we could imagine - which is why we ask that only mature gamers play our games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is NOT about Storytelling&lt;br/&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t consider Dark Legacies a Storytelling game. It isn&amp;rsquo;t that simple actually. What we do consider it is new, revolutionary and inventive. We don&amp;rsquo;t want you sitting around with your friends listening to just one guy talk while you roll some dice and call that &amp;ldquo;fun.&amp;rdquo; We want you on the edge of your seat, plotting against your best friends, always thinking of how you&amp;rsquo;re going to best that Werewolf at the bar from the last encounter or how you&amp;rsquo;re going to sneak around the rules of the Great House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started&lt;br/&gt;Grab a couple of your friends, a Character &amp;amp; Demo Scene or Introductory Guide like this one and see what unfolds. All you need is your imagination, a little time and some depravity (just kidding). But seriously, the most important component to Dark Legacies is the ability to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. If you can do that and some simple math, you&amp;rsquo;re good to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
