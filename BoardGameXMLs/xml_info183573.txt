							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">8-bit Adventures:  The Forgotten Journey</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This JRPG, despite its retro look and feel, was first put out in 2013, but was re-vamped in 2015.  You can play as three characters: a wizard, a warrior, and a thief who go out on a quest.   The story-line is the main draw, with loot, monsters, and various vehicles.  As well there is a colour-based strategy to fighting JRPG battles.   The soundtrack is also from the 8-bit realm and was sold separately as well as with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
