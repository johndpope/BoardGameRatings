			<description>This is a 'press your luck' kind of dice game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each person is given two dice (with numbers 1 to 4, two sides have 1's, two sides have 2's), and some chips to begin.  Some chips are left in the center to form the 'pot'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a person's turn, he/she begins by rolling the 2 dice, examining the sum of the two numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they add up to 2, that person has been 'stung', and a chip is given to the pot, and play passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they add up to 8, that person has rolled a 'sting', and gets to take 2 chips from the pot, and play passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they add up to anything else, that person MUST roll again and try to roll a number equal to, or higher, than the sum of the first roll.  At this point ANYONE else playing can also try to roll a sum equal to or higher.  Anyone who succeeds gets 2 chips from the pot, anyone who fails loses one.  If the active player ends up going it alone, and succeeds, his/her winnings are doubled.  Losings are never doubled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play ends at a specific number of chips or when the pot is exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
