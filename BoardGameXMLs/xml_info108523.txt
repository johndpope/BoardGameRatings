			<description>This is a tactical space combat game in the Warriors of the Dark Star: The Age of the Neutron Wars series, and includes the second edition rulebook for that game (as a series rulebook).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        This pits the Fast Omega Ship &amp;quot;Formidable&amp;quot; Class, their Deadly Alpha Battleship &amp;quot;Victorious&amp;quot; Class, and their Fast Beta Battle Cruiser &amp;quot;Vengeance&amp;quot; Class, against the &amp;quot;Odin&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Thor&amp;quot; Class Dreadnaught with its Monadian Web and the Thor Battleships' Death Ray and Satellite Defensive systems. This game consists of a reliving of the Famous Battles with the Great Admirals, Star Marshals, and Battleship Conmanders in various Historical Engagements that occurred during the Monad Wars - the Exploits of the Black Prince, the Xenon Battle Cruiser &amp;quot;ACE&amp;quot; that had 20 &amp;quot;kills&amp;quot; to his Credit, etc. Includes the Famous Scenario &amp;quot;The Charge Against the Monad Star Base&amp;quot;, and the &amp;quot;Battle of Masters&amp;quot;. This Game is the Companion Game to the BFA game &amp;quot;Star Wars of the Xenon Empire&amp;quot;. Vengeance Crusaders is the opposite of Sun Slayers: it is the active seeking of enemy vessels and smashing them in individual encounters and small fleet engagements. In the first game the knowledge of weapons systems is vital; in this one Maneuver is paramount - weapons only second!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
