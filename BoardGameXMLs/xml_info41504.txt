							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twilight City: Dark Mysteries</name>
									
			<description>Twilight City: Dark Mysteries is a game of investigation and lovecraftian Mythology. Each player represents an investigator that was summon to the city in order to uncover a mystery. Each mystery is a game in itself for there is a set of original events that describe something that is happening as well as an original background different from the other stories. This is a game of story telling as well, because beyond the generic encounter the investigators will  be able to interact with the system in several ways: bribing, buying, paying, taking buses, walking, fighting, healing. Also there is the mechanic of Day and Night that make the encounters relevant both in information and in danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the stories will be written so they lead to a thrilling conclusion and each event will have as much atmosphere as possible. Players will feel as their investigator is wounded and need to move to the hospital, or if they need to reach to someplace at a specific time of the day to retrieve some information. Still finishing a story won't mean to render that story useless. Since the puzzle the investigators have to complete is random, the replayability is unlimited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nights in the Twilight City are very dangerous but there is no time to waste for the evil forces are always plotting for the doomsday and if you take too much time you will certainly fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has generic places that will be referred in the events with their own names. For example: &amp;quot;Go to the abandoned &amp;quot;WAREHOUSE&amp;quot; and meet Herb &amp;quot;The Rat&amp;quot; at 5 o'clock (AFTERNOON). He knows what's going on in the house of the terrible old man (OLD HOUSE)&amp;quot;. This way you know you have to go to the WAREHOUSE at any time in the AFTERNOON. But you won't find Herb &amp;quot;The Rat&amp;quot; at any other time. So time is essential to the plot. And the board serves to shape a new city with every dark mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
