			<description>Fields of War is a fast paced third person action MMO.&lt;br/&gt;The game is focused on large scale warfare and supports up to 200 players on the same instance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fields of War is a massive multiplayer third-person-shooter focused on large scale battles, territory control, skill and most importantly team play. The players are divided into two factions, North and South, coming from different climates and landscapes, and fight over control of the entire land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WORLD&lt;br/&gt;    A persistent world, hosted on our servers.&lt;br/&gt;    Epic 100 vs. 100 battle.&lt;br/&gt;    AI bots replace absent players.&lt;br/&gt;    Full dynamic day-night cycle.&lt;br/&gt;    Two distinct landscapes, offering strategic gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME MECHANICS&lt;br/&gt;The world is divided into territories, represented by cores that are connected to each other. Capturing linked cores expand the faction&amp;rsquo;s control of the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A core can&amp;rsquo;t be captured by a faction unless it&amp;rsquo;s linked to that faction&amp;rsquo;s main core (HQ). All cores that are somehow connected to the faction HQ are part of the faction&amp;rsquo;s Core Network. Players can transfer quickly between cores in the Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While a core can&amp;rsquo;t be captured unless it&amp;rsquo;s linked to the HQ, it can be taken from the other faction, thus potentially breaking their network. Once a core is not linked to a faction&amp;rsquo;s core network, it becomes &amp;lsquo;neutralized&amp;rsquo;, and players from that faction can no longer transfer to it. An entire sections of the network can be taken down by neutralizing just a single core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CUSTOMIZATION&lt;br/&gt;We implemented a robust customization system, allowing full control of the mech&amp;rsquo;s appearance.&lt;br/&gt;Camouflage patterns and colors can be altered to create virtually infinite possibilities so each mech is unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
