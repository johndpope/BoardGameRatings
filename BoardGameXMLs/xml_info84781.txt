			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Star Wars fan. Yes, in spite of the prequels. It&amp;rsquo;s sad that we Star Wars fanboys have to put that qualifier in these days, but such is the times we live in. As a Star Wars fan, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing the Star Wars games long before the prequels, which means long before Wizards of the Coast got their hands on Star Wars, and long before even Timothy Zahn wrote the first novels that gave the world a picture of what was going on with Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie after Return of the Jedi. That&amp;rsquo;s right; I was playing the d6 West End Games version of Star Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I first played Savage Worlds a year or so back, I thought this would make an excellent rules system for Star Wars, and lo and behold I found I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one who thought so. On the Savage Worlds Fan Conversion web page I already saw three good attempts to take a crack at it. Victor Lacroix&amp;rsquo;s own Star Wars 1.2.1 conversion SAVAGE! Star Wars from the d20 Saga Edition was, by far, the best one of the bunch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all due respect to Mr. Lacroix and the people who helped him make that work, I thought that approaching Star Wars by converting the Saga Edition&amp;rsquo;s version of things to Savage Worlds was the wrong way to go about it. Rather, the best way to making a Savage Worlds Star Wars game was to take what you see from all six movies and other materials as you see them, instead of what others interpret them to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With that in mind I set about to make my own Savage Worlds Star Wars conversion primarily because I was utterly tired of Saga Edition and d20 in general. When you&amp;rsquo;ve played Savage Worlds, you look at d20 with a whole new perspective, wondering why they bothered to make things more complicated than it needed to be. I found myself ignoring or forgetting most of the rules for d20 because they got in the way of the game play itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
