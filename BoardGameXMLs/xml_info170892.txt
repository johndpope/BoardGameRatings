			<description>Panjwayi: Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan is a FREE GAME. The content is available below as a .pdf, which includes rules, board, and pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A professional version will be available on Game Crafter in the near future, link to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight as Government of Afghanistan or the Taliban to control Panjwayi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panjwayi: Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan is a wargame unlike any you have ever played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panjwayi (pronounced PANZH-uh-way or panzh-way-EE) is a district of Kandahar Province, famous as the birthplace of the Taliban during the 1990s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After serious military defeats at the hands of NATO in 2006 and 2007, the Taliban are steadily reinforcing Panjwayi in the summer of 2008. No longer willing to stand up to NATO in set-piece battles which they know they will lose, the Taliban insurgents disguise themselves among the population, use Improvised Explosive Devices, and draw upon large numbers of expendable recruits arriving from Pakistan and elsewhere. Can the Taliban defeat the enormous technological edge held by the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) and their NATO Allies? Or can the GoA convince the wavering population to have faith in the new government, and set the conditions in Panjwayi for stability to take hold for the first time in a generation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose either side, and use your unique strengths against your opponent's weaknesses to determine who will win control of the symbolic home of the Taliban.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by a soldier who fought there, Panjwayi is easy to learn, quick to play, and hard to master. Using elegant abstraction to simplify complex military operations, Panjwayi captures the frustration and feel of the deadly summer of 2008.&lt;br/&gt;As the Taliban say of their enemies, &amp;quot;You have the watches, we have the time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
