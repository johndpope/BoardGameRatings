							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Von Hindenburg in Poland</name>
									
			<description>Von Hindenberg in Poland&lt;br/&gt;The Warsaw-Lodz Campaign, 1914&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wake of Russian successes in Galicia, Grand Duke Nicholas plotted an invasion to the mineral-rich German province of Silesia.  To forestall this, von Hindenberg transferred four German corps from Prussia to the southwest corner of Poland and launched an offensive toward Warsaw.  By 12 October, they had driven the Russians back to the Vistula, just south of Warsaw, but there, outnumbered and over-extended, they ran out of steam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Von Hindenberg in Poland simulates the intense back-and-forth struggle that began 16 October, with von Hindenberg's retreat from the Vistula.  Over the course of the ensuing six weeks, both sides surged forward and back, east and west, alternately threatening the other with potentially disastrous encirclements.  Special rules cover the effects of inferior Russian intelligence (hidden movement for the Germans), the combined effects of poor Russian logistical capacities and German scorched-earth policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the The Great War in the East Quadrigame.&lt;br/&gt;Folio edition contains Standard rules, Special rules, 17&amp;quot; x 21&amp;quot; map and 200 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
