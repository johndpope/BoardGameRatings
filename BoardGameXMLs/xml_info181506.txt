							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 â€“ SPAD XIII</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SPAD XIII was a French biplane development of the earlier highly successful SPAD S.VII. It was one of the most capable fighters of the war, and one of the most widely employed. The single-engine Spad XIII was faster than its main contemporaries, and it was renowned for its speed and strength in a dive. This aircraft was flown by famous French and Italian pilots and also by American pilots including the ace Eddie Rickenbacker. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
