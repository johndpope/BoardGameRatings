							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Presidents Game</name>
									
			<description>Learningames offers a new and exciting way to have fun while learning about the American Presidency.  Through these innovative and easy-to-play games players master important information about all presidents and their administrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to six players sit around the playing board.  The playing board includes the portrait of each chief executive.  In place of the names of the presidents are the numbers 1 to 43.  To begin the game a player draws a card from the deck.  Each card has the name of a president on one side and a number with important information about the head of state on the other side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game players win cards by locating and naming the president on the numbered playing board or by correctly challenging incorrect answers.  When playing advanced games, players master important information about the presidents identified in the basic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
