			<description>Congregate is a social political game where players use various Representatives to accomplish their hidden Agendas in a series of votes. Each Session (round) a player will choose a Proposition for all others to debate and vote on. Players augment their votes with different types of Representatives, from the highly influential Councilors to the destructive Spies. Whatever the approach, players must do anything in their power to accomplish their hidden Agendas and amass the most wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
