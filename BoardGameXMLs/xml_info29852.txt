			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Thought Eaters is a quick, cute maze game. Each player is attempting to navigate a path to the center of the board. If all goes well this path involves seven turns. Players draw and play two &amp;quot;turn right&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;turn left&amp;quot; tiles each turn to represent their animal's own planning. Each turn players also can move one tile anywhere on the board. If your plan is good enough your animal moves along its path of tiles. You will need strategy and diplomacy to reach the goal first.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
