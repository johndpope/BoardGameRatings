			<description>(from the rulebook, translated from Dutch)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Finland game is a boardgame for 2-4 players, where every player can learn about the possibilities of Finland as a holiday destination by doing a tour of Finland.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the desired game length players get a number of cards corresponding with destinations on the board which have to be reached by moving the player's pawn across the board. There are also additional cards which the players can get by standing on yellow spaces on the board which give players additional destinations to visit or the possibility to e.g. use air travel to move faster. The game ends as soon as a player has no destination cards left in his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Het Finlandspel is a promotional game distributed by travel agencies in the Netherlands in the early 1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
