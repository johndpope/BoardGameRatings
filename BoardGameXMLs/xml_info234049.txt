			<description>In My Weird School, players collect cards to build a crazy five-card sentence on their boards where the first two words rhyme.  After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Ella Mentry School, the weirdest elementary school in the history of the world. Things just got even weirder with the arrival of Miss Bernard, a new teacher encouraging kids to say whatever they want... about the other teachers! And that is just what you&amp;rsquo;ll do in this sentence-building game that proves school can be serious fun and certifiably weird!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
