			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Ball Z is a mystical action adventure game of riveting stories, driven by extraordinary characters that embody the essence of good and evil. It is a game filled with magical moments of wonder that reveal the charm, hu-mor, strengths, weaknesses and follies of the characters adventures, wise sages and diabolical villains that make up its casts of players. The most unique aspect of the DragonBall Z universe is the DragonBalls. It is said that he who holds the seven crystal DragonBalls will be granted one wish by the Eternal Dragon which is summoned by gathering together all seven of the balls. The wish may be for power, untold wealth or even immortality - the possibilities are endless. However, he who seeks to have his wish granted is wise to choose his desire carefully, for once the wish is granted, the DragonBalls are once again scattered to the four corners of the planet, where they await the next determined wish seeker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fan-made game uses copyright-infringing art and concepts derived from the eponymous media franchise.  It should not be confused with the licensed, commercial product produced by R. Talsorian Games, Inc..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
