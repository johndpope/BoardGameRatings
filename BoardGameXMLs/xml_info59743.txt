							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MicroFudged DIP</name>
									
			<description>From the author:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A year or more ago I found 1KM1KT and discovered a whole world of innovative game designs delivered for free to the roleplaying community. Among them, Timothy Dedeaux has given us two gems, Edge of the century and DIP-Styx. When I read these two games I realized that I could seemlessly adapt their conflict resolution system to Fudge and make Fudge even more abstract, which is, in my opinion a required feature for a universal gaming engine. No need to flip tens of pages anymore to compare the various weapons and vehicles listed by technology eras to build a complete weapons and armour list for your gaming universe. But Tymothy Dedeaux&amp;rsquo; works also gave me the opportunity to implement the Story Element detailed in Fudge. The goal is to get rid off the rigid turn based resolution system inherited from the &amp;quot;Great old one&amp;quot; and to produce a cinematic action resolution system where fun is the key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on Steffan O&amp;rsquo;Sullivan&amp;rsquo;s Fudge RPG, David Bruns&amp;rsquo; Micro Fudge, Timothy Dedeaux&amp;rsquo; DIP-Styx and Edge of the Century.&lt;br/&gt;Psionic powers based on Empire Galactique by Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Nedelec, range table taken from MegaTraveller published by GDW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
