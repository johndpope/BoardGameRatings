							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Climate Game</name>
									
			<description>Climate Game is a game which when played with strategy, negotiation and diplomacy, challenges its players to save the world from imminent destruction. With everyone&amp;rsquo;s effort and awareness, the emission of carbonic gas can be reduced before it is too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is both one of competition and of cooperation. It promotes competition because the player who emits no carbonic gas at all is the winner. But, integrated work of all the other participants is essential in order not to exceed the gas limits of the greenhouse effect that the planet can put up with. If this limit is exceeded, the Earth&amp;rsquo;s temperature will have risen to a level where human life is not possible and everyone dies/loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, participants must have a good degree of knowledge regarding gas emission and the greenhouse effect and also be very good at negotiating and formulating strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
