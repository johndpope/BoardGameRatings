							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scared Sheet-Less</name>
									
			<description>Moving into a new house is so exciting, especially one in a brand new neighborhood! People are moving in from all over the world... and so are the ghosts. Unfortunately, this town isn't big enough to contain so many spirits! The solution? Only the most scary, sheety ghost can stay. That's right, a real-life, astral scare-off! Thankfully, most of the new houses have full linen closets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Scared Sheetless, scaring is the name of the game! But let's face it, there's nothing scary about a naked ghost. The game starts out with you and your ghostly competitors alone in the new neighborhood, a neighborhood only big enough for one ghost. On your turn, roll your bones. Doubles reveal new sheets and the rest of your roll is movement. Match the symbols to move from house to house, picking up sheets and scaring your fellow ghosts as you go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win the game by being the last sheet-ed ghost!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
