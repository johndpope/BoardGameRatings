							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wizard&#039;s Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The young mage Andru Meadow has not been seen in some months and a comely young woman has taken up residence in his tower. Claiming to be his wife she shrugs off the locals. But many suspect that she is more than she seems and that she has done something to their beloved mage. The tower is darker now, with few lights within and now, the village has been plagued by a thief and there is murder afoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Tower, a Castles &amp;amp; Crusades adventure, designed for 3-5 characters with a challenge level of 6, should be playable in one session. It involves a simple tower located in any village or town of the Castle Keeper&amp;rsquo;s choosing. Though conceived as a tower sitting upon a cliff face, the adventure is highly portable so that the Castle Keeper can move it to a forest, desert, swamp or whatever terrain they wish. Simply change the opening descriptive text to better reflect the desired locale and make the winding stair a meandering path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
