			<description>&amp;quot;It's a race to be the first to assemble your winning baseball team.  Collect your Infield, Outfield, Pitcher, Catcher, Batter and score a Home Run. Scout for Recruits and Free Agents.  Try not to strike out or hit a fly ball as you compete to pull together your team.  Home Run Baseball SportACTION Card Game is the next best thing to being at the ballpark.&amp;quot; -- From the Manufacturer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a card drawing mechanic, players attempt to complete their &amp;quot;team,&amp;quot;by assembling one player card for each position (of the same color) and a Home Run card.  Different cards represent the different positions -- Infield, Outfield, Pitcher, Batter and Catcher, as well as special cards which cause different game effects, and wild cards which can replace other player cards on your &amp;quot;team.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
