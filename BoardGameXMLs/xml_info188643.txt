							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deepbridge Danger Day</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The South East gate of Deepbridge is a welcoming sight. You walk through it to find yourself on a wide road. This is Castle Row and it leads from one side of the town to the other, past the keep at the centre of the town. To your right is a large, well kept, busy inn, called the Sojourner's Rest. There is another street nearby called Snatchup Alley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure book for Legend of the Wayfarer presents a solitaire adventure for use with the game.  These proceed, typically, by presenting a paragraph or so of text followed by a test or decision which leads to another page.  Each adventure book also has a page of random numbers in case the player is in a location that does not facilitate die rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
