			<description>Intro&lt;br/&gt;It is a time of wizardry and power. In the esteemed Academia Magicas, novices from the House of Elementas shall be given their final test: Trial of Grandis. As a Chief Apprentice of your Noble House, you shall lead a quartet of novices through a maze of primordial elements on the ancient Fields of Grandis to earn your Elementor ranks and stand as honoured Magi of Magicas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;- Your objective is to win as much Victory Points (VPs) as possible, while striding through each terrain square to reach the end of the field. &lt;br/&gt;- The Trial ends when all terrain squares at the finishing line are occupied.&lt;br/&gt;- Each Player begins with 5 cards in his/her hand and draws 2 extra cards at the start of turn.&lt;br/&gt;- Each Player may conduct a maximum of 3 movement/actions with his/her playing cards during a turn.&lt;br/&gt;- Each Player can hold as many cards as he/she can in hand at the end of turn, but beware of the thief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards&lt;br/&gt;- There are 2 types of Cards that can be drawn from the draw deck: Scroll Cards and Action Cards.&lt;br/&gt;- Scroll Cards are used for basic movement to each terrain square (see movement)&lt;br/&gt;- Action Cards are special magic scrolls with extra spells such as VP Thief, Revive Mana and etc that can be used to your advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement&lt;br/&gt;- The Field of Grandis is a land of power, with terrains warded by elements that bars entrance from those who do not wield them. &lt;br/&gt;- Fire, Ice, Thunder and Poison Wards of varying degrees protect each terrain. &lt;br/&gt;- To stride the fields, you must be proficient in utilizing the Elementas Scrolls (Cards) to calm the elements of each terrain.&lt;br/&gt;- You can move straight or diagonal to the adjoining square by casting your Scroll Cards according to the element and number of scrolls required. e.g. A square guarded by a Level 2 Fire Ward can only be entered by casting 2 Fire Scrolls (cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory Points&lt;br/&gt;- The field is divided into sections, each section of terrain squares with their own VP value, ascending to the highest VP value at the finishing squares.&lt;br/&gt;- At game end, only the VP value of the terrain squares occupied by each of your Novices is accumulated.&lt;br/&gt;- VP Points can also be earned by performing the Lock Spell (see Lock Spell)&lt;br/&gt;- Player with the most accumulated VPs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lock Spell&lt;br/&gt;- When 2 or more Novices move into the same terrain square, the latest Novice to arrive at the square automatically performs a Lock Spell on the Novice(s) before it.&lt;br/&gt;- Novice under the Lock Spell cannot perform any movement or action until the spell-caster moves away from the square OR the spell is broken with a Lock Breaker action card.&lt;br/&gt;- There is no limit to the number of Novices occupying a square; the last Novice to enter a square will always be the spell-caster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trial of Grandis is a strategy card + board game with a minimum luck factor in drawing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free downloadable files (print &amp;amp; play game board, rules of play, etc) will be available soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
