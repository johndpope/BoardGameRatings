							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oathen</name>
									
			<description>A highly replayable fantasy based game designed to mimic the feel and pace of competitive arena e-sports. Oathen uses six heroes with their own unique playstyles and skill decks, it comes with three game modes, and a dynamically changing arena that makes each match unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure into a randomly generated game board full of traps and treasures, where you will battle it out for the title of arena champion. Players will pre-plan their turns ahead of time, studying their competitors and finding the right combination of abilities to grant them victory. Will your oathen hero unleash a flurry of blows against your target? Or will the other players play defensively to negate your attacks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat carries out one ability at a time, each player playing their next chosen action. The strongest of abilities will then go on cooldown, and will be unavailable for use until a certain number of turns has passed. Plan correctly, and you could pull off amazing combos - fail, and you may be exposed to such attacks yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arena is constructed with 36 of 52 total locations, providing boosts and traps that can alter your battle, and making every game into a unique match. Oathen also comes with different game modes, including arena, capture the flag, and round table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose between six Oathen champions to play as. Each one plays differently with 20 unique abilities to plan - including an ultimate ability that can turn the tides of battle. Future expansions will increase the number of heroes to 24, including defensive characters, healers, and devastating damage dealers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
