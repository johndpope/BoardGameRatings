			<description>``In the game, players take the role of Amagon, a Marine who is trapped on an island after his plane crashed. Inconveniently, his rescue ship is on the other side of the island, hence Amagon is must cross it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amagon encounters a variety of enemies which he can dispose of with his machine gun. He also has the ability (upon collecting and then activating the Mega-Key) to transform in to a larger, stronger version of himself called &amp;quot;Megagon&amp;quot;. Upon transformation, Megagon is given 1 hit point for every 5,000 points he scored as Amagon (whereas a single hit from any enemy or hazard will kill Amagon). Megagon cannot use the machine gun, but in its stead has a punch which does 8 times the damage and never runs out of ammo. At the cost of one hit point each, he can also fire waves of energy from his chest; these are much broader than machine gun shots, do 16 times the damage, and can hit multiple enemies in a single blast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Amagon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
