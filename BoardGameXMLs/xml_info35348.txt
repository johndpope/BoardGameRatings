			<description>The game is a 2 player game consisting of 38 identically-backed cards. 30 cards are of 6 football clubs (Birmingham, Luton, Stoke, Everton, Southampton and Middlesbrough) and 4 penalty, 2 offside and 2 goalkeeper cards. The object is to score goals, to do this both players are dealt 5 cards and then try to collect 3 club crest if the same type in his hand. The hand is built up rummy-style from the deck. A goal attempt is made by playing three cards face up on the table and is scored unless the other player has a goalkeeper or offside card available to play. Playing 5 club crests automatically scores a goal. After a goal the opponent must discard their hand but the scorer can decide on whether to keep the remaining 2 cards or not.  The game ends when 10 attempts at goal have been made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
