			<description>Battle Through Time is a computer game for the Commodore 64 computer, programmed by Ken Grant. Battle Through Time is a side-scrolling ground-based shoot 'em up game, in that the player has to drive a jeep through rough landscape and jump over potholes and obstacles, and shoot at enemies both on the ground and in the sky. Battle Through Time is themed after the most famous wars in the 20th century. It has seven levels, each with their own settings. Each level has its own music theme, which consist of computer renditions of various famous melodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Through_Time,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Through_Time,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
