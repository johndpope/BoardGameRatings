			<description>According to The Classified Encyclopedia of Chess Variants (&amp;sect;33.4, p305), Big Horse Chess shares little in common with orthodox chess except that it's played on an 8x8 board with pieces that hop like chess knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player scores a point whenever any four of their eight pieces form a square of any size. Pieces that are landed upon are removed from play. The game ends when one player is down to three pieces. Highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
