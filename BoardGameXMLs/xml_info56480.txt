			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Colors al Fresco is a roleplaying game of pulp-style adventure, set in an alternate Renaissance. The basic setting is Renaissance Italy &amp;ndash; as it might have been. Had there been fantastic, pre-industrial advanced technologies in the hands of a few. Had the Black Death never come. Had the remnants of highly-advanced civilizations been scattered around the world. Had reality been governed by mystical Forces instead of scientific laws. Had there been maniacal geniuses constantly plotting to take over the world. And, most importantly, had there been superheroes to thwart them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But these are not the superheroes of our times, or even our parents&amp;rsquo; times &amp;ndash; these are the superheroes of our grandparents&amp;rsquo; times, the action heroes of the pulps. Before the term &amp;ldquo;superhero&amp;rdquo; was coined. Before spandex costumes. When a man with a maniacal laugh, a pair of six-shooters, and the sole power to &amp;ldquo;cloud men&amp;rsquo;s minds&amp;rdquo; had the power to send villains scurrying for their holes. Pulp heroes are only slightly better than the rest of us, not the breed apart of the modern superhero. They may laugh in the face of an armed man, but it is not because they are unthreatened. They may operate outside the law, but only because the authorities have chosen to allow it. And they rarely have the luxury of existing outside the norms of society for more than an evening at a time. In short, while they have exceptional powers, pulp heroes are not so powerful that they may ignore the rest of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the PDF file:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules, as a downloadable PDF of the complete game. Includes the rules; a sketch of the setting, Italia, including several of the more notable Omegas; glossary of terms; character sheets, dice guides, and other handouts; and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
