							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Love for the Universalist</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, all you need to have fun with a class for another few months is a few new ideas to tinker around with. Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Love for the Universalist introduces four new Universalist focused schools that work to dispel the Universalist's current status as the choice for wizards who flunked out of magic school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane Researcher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Focused Research - Researching new spells becomes cheaper and faster as you level.&lt;br/&gt;     Inventor's Recall - You can prepare spells you invented without having them written down.&lt;br/&gt;     Optimization through Familiarity - Spells you invent get +1 to their DCs when you cast them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beastbonded Arcanist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Spellmarked Familiar - You can inscribe a limited number of spells onto your familiar, thus making it a backup spellbook.&lt;br/&gt;     Familiar Assistance - Your familiar gets bonuses to Aid Other checks targeting you.&lt;br/&gt;     Improved Empathy - Your awareness of your familiar makes it so you and your familiar cannot be flanked unless you both are flanked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bookbonded Arcanist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dear Spellbook, - Your spellbook is your arcane bond, has infinite pages, but can only cast a spell written in it as your bonus spell.&lt;br/&gt;     Spellbook Security - You get bonuses to the spells sepia snake sigil and explosive runes when they are cast on your spellbook.&lt;br/&gt;     Acquire Spellbook - You can cause your spellbook to materialize in your hand from wherever it lay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spellweaver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Artful Incantations - You add your Dex modifier to your Spellcraft DCs to identify your spells.&lt;br/&gt;     Insightful Gestures - If you take a full-round action to cast a spell, it gets +1 to its caster level. &lt;br/&gt;     Artful Gestures - Your insightful gestures also adds +1 to the DC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
