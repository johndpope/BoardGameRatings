							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Airship Port</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few miles behind the front lines, just out of reach for most artillery guns this little airship port has been set up. The airships, currently still uncontested sovereigns of the skies are part of a reconnaissance unit and usually serve as mobile artillery spotters. Sometimes though they are sent on reconnaissance missions deep into enemy territory as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The port is designed to service three airships. Usually they are moored at the central mast of the port. For repairs that have to be performed out of the weather the port is equipped with a single hangar though. The personnel is housed in a few large tents off to the side while the port as a whole is surrounded by a simple rag tag fence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over all the port gives the impression of a rather temporary structure. Everything it seems can be disassembled, moved and set up again within a few hours if the front line should move. The fenceseems to be the only visible security measure. Far from the enemy security does not seem to be abig concern, despite explosive nature of the airship's lift gas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
