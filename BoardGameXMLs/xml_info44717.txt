			<description>What Lurks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know the history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All have read about the founding of America. This history shows what led to the American Revolution and the cry for independence. The history is clear, and there is no real dispute over these events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or is there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a secret history, and this history deals with events that took place in the shadows. These events played a role in the history of the American colonies and the Revolution that few know about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth is hidden, and plots are afoot. Events are moving behind the scenes, and lurking in the shadows are agents with their own agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War is coming. The Siege of Boston is lifted, and General Washington is leading the Continental Army to New York. The enemies are many, but as to who they are, you do not know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newly revised and expanded, this edition of Colonial Gothic builds upon what has come before and also presents new options and guidelines for running a supernatural historical horror roleplaying game set during the dawn of the American Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonial Gothic is a supernatural historical horror roleplaying game set during the dawn of the American Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
