			<description>&amp;quot;Two player Card game simulating the stagnant Warfare&lt;br/&gt;of the Korean War's later phase.&amp;quot; Adapted from the World War I card game Attrition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. player begins the game with 50 squads and the Chinese player with 100 squads. The players alternate completing a sequence of five phases: Logistics (draw one card), Artillery Barrage (eliminate a random number of enemy squads - with the U.S. having more effective artillery), Charge Orders (the players may choose to charge, or such orders may be received by the Chinese player), Defender Fire Phase, and Trench Fighting Phase. Certain cards may be played to provide bonuses in some phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. player must eliminate the Chinese infantry and hold the hill. The goal Chinese player is to capture Pork Chop Hill by capturing all six of the territory markers from the U.S. player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solo-play suggestion is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
