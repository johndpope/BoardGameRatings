							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stringfellows: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>You &amp;amp; your friends have been invited for a night out with Peter Stringfellow.  The race is on to look your best.  There are 2 sets of cards - 1 with trivia questions you must answer and the other with items you must collect to ensure you look your best for your big night out!&lt;br/&gt; The 1st game involves getting yourself ready to go out - visits to the hairdressers, beauty salon and clothes shops.  Where you go for your preparations decides how good you will look for your night out - obviously you would rather go to a designer hairdresser than the &amp;quot;Pudding Basin&amp;quot; salon - likewise &amp;quot;last weeks socks&amp;quot; are not as desirable as &amp;quot;straight off the catwalk&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt; You travel around the board trying to pamper an primp yourself for your big night out.  This game ends and is won by the person who achieves the highest value of collected items.&lt;br/&gt; The second game takes place inside Peter Stringfellows' Club.  The object is to try and get next to your favourite star who is in the nightclub.  But be warned - there are many pitfalls!  You need to work your way past the stars, personal assistants and bodyguards or minders and your knowledge of celebrity trivia, drinks, dancing and music will be put to the test!&lt;br/&gt; The game ends when all the celebrity counters have been collected off the board - the person with the most celebrities around them is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game intended for adults (suggested age is 18 and over)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
