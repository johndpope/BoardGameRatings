							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phenomenon: the Extra Sensory Party</name>
									
			<description>A party game which is to be planned ahead of time, somewhat like a murder mystery party.  Only this time, players are exploring their psychic powers.  Players are to bring a personal object concealed in a plain paper bag for psycho-transmissions or something like that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game begins (after a warm-up period), players simply move along a board and partake in activities written on cards.  These usually involve some pseudo-science along the lines of the doctors from Ghostbusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game even includes a quartz crystal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
