			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can take on the role of a Bard, Monk, Paladin, Ranger or Thief-Acrobat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bard is a jack-of-all-trades - combining the skills of fighter, magic-user, historian, and sage - but master of none. Monks are monastic humans who hone their bodies through rigid discipline and devotion to the martial arts, monks are mystics who devote their lives to mastery of mind and body. Paladins are holy warriors who dedicate all they have and all they are to living, supporting and defending all that is lawful and good. Rangers are masters of the outdoors, patrolling and protecting large stretches of wilderness and acting as the first line of defense for more civilized and settled areas. Thief-Acrobats use their brains and skills to outwit and out-maneuver their opponents. You take that which others wish to keep, you go where others may not enter. You are a shadow, a rumor, a whisper in the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes detailed descriptions of each character class along with the requisite charts and nine pieces of original art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
