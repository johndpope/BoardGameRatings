							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sudan Campaign Wargame</name>
									
			<description>A rule book for map &amp;amp; board-campaign wargame. The game may be used to establish a tactical confrontation for a miniature table top battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for Wargamers either as a &amp;quot;board game&amp;quot; or as an adjunct to a tabletop Battlegame using miniature figures and scenery on a 5' x 5' or larger table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a BOARD GAME, a small campaign can be played using MAPS, ROSTERS and MARKERS supplied.  A complete campaign can be played in two or three hours.  In such a game, there is a great deal of &amp;quot;the fog of war&amp;quot;, grand tactical maneuvering, scouting, and simulated conflict between forces, and the issuing of basic pre-commands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an adjunct or OVERLAY to a miniature wargame, the game still uses MAPS and FORCE MARKERS, but also sets up circumstances for a Sudan era (1880's thru 1890's) tabletop battlegame using miniature figures.  Often during such a campaign there will be two or three separate table top battles and sometimes reinforcements can be brought in.  The game also has rules for combat between gunboats and feluccas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules have been devised for straight forward and fast play with minimal referencing to tables, and uses ten-sided (percentile) dice for moving, combat and morale resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes copiable maps, roster sheets and markers (counters) that the player needs to cut-out and mount themselves to play the MAP game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
