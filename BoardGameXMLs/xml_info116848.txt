			<description>Dance Dance Revolution Disney Channel Edition is a home version that, unlike other DDR games, was developed by Keen Games and not directly by Konami. It is the 4th Disney themed DDR game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the other games in the series, the core gameplay involves the player moving his or her feet to a set pattern, stepping in time to the general rhythm or beat of a song. Arrows are divided by 1/4 notes, 1/8 notes, and so on (with differing color schemes for each), up to about 1/32 notes. During normal gameplay, arrows scroll upwards from the bottom of the screen and pass over a set of stationary arrows near the top (referred to as the &amp;quot;guide arrows&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;receptors&amp;quot;, officially known as the Step Zone). When the scrolling arrows overlap the stationary ones, the player must step on the corresponding arrows on the dance platform, and the player is given a judgment for their accuracy (Marvelous, Perfect, Great, Good, Almost (close miss), Boo (complete miss)). Longer green and yellow arrows referred to as &amp;quot;freeze arrows&amp;quot; must be held down for their entire length, either producing a &amp;quot;O.K.&amp;quot; if successful, or a &amp;quot;N.G.&amp;quot; (no good) if not. Dance Dance Revolution X contains songs with Shock Arrows, walls of arrows with lightning effects which must be avoided, which are scored in the same way as Freezes (O.K./N.G.). If they are stepped on, a N.G. is awarded, the lifebar decreases, and the steps become hidden for a short period of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this core gameplay remains mostly the same on this Disney Channel Edition, the songlist consists mostly of songs from Disney Channel programming, including songs from Hannah Montana, The Cheetah Girls, High School Musical, That's So Raven, Kim Possible, The Suite Life of Zack &amp;amp; Cody.  So, unlike other DDR games, all of the characters selectable on Disney Channel Edition are from the aforementioned shows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannah Montana&lt;br/&gt;    Lilly Truscott&lt;br/&gt;    Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana&lt;br/&gt;High School Musical&lt;br/&gt;    Troy Bolton&lt;br/&gt;    Gabriella Montez&lt;br/&gt;Kim Possible&lt;br/&gt;    Kim Possible&lt;br/&gt;That's So Raven&lt;br/&gt;    Eddie Thomas&lt;br/&gt;That's So Raven/Cory in the House&lt;br/&gt;    Cory Baxter&lt;br/&gt;The Cheetah Girls&lt;br/&gt;    Aquanette&lt;br/&gt;    Chanel&lt;br/&gt;    Dorinda&lt;br/&gt;The Suite Life of Zack &amp;amp; Cody&lt;br/&gt;    Cody Martin&lt;br/&gt;    Zack Martin&lt;br/&gt;    Maddie Fitzpatrick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has two outfits available, Hannah Montana's secondary costume changes her to her true self, Miley Stewart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dance Dance Revolution Disney Channel Edition&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
