			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Good... to Great!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legendary Paladins is the first volume in our new series of class-focused player supplements, shining a light on the holiest heroes of them all. Paladins are eternally devoted to the ideals of goodness and righteousness. They are ardent crusaders against the forces of darkness, taking the offensive to push back the lawless and treacherous boundaries that would encroach upon society, but they are equally comfortable standing as stoic sentinels, holding back the onslaught of evil. Legendary Paladins provides you with a host of new options to make your paladins come to life, from new applications of existing abilities like oaths, vows, and smiting scourges, to whole new specializations with 10 new archetypes. It also includes over 20 new paladin spells and over a dozen new magic items specially designed for paladins, including 7 new companion holy weapons in the tradition of the most classic paladin item of them all, the holy avenger! Finally, Legendary Paladins includes a new paladinly prestige class, the Paraclete, perfect for enhancing your paladin's protective prowess and giving other classes a path to approach paladinhood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a great companion to the Righteous Crusade Adventure Path and its holy war against the invading demon hordes, but is equally valuable for any player seeking to play the purity of the paladin. We hope you enjoy using this book as much as we enjoyed making it and that it helps Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
