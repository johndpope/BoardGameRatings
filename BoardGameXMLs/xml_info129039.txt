							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Stories: Die Erweiterung</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of 30 mystery cards, 40 black cards with taboo words and a grim reaper card. The players try to guess the stories behind the scene outlined on the mystery cards without using the taboo words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the other Black Stories games, the central element are the mystery cards. They contain an illustration and a short statement about a spooky or crime event. On the back of the card, the story is presented in more detail. Only one of the players reads the back of the card. The others try to reconstruct how the crime happened by asking yes/no questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New about &amp;quot;Black Stories: Die Erweiterung&amp;quot; is that there are cards with taboo words. At the beginning of each rounds, three of these are selected. If one of the players mentions one of these words, the others try to slap the grim reaper card as quickly as possible. The player who correctly slaps the grim reaper card the fastest, wins the taboo card. The person who has contributed most to finding the solution gets the card. The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be combined with other games from the series. You can either just use the taboo word cards with other Black Stories instalments, or mix all the cards together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
