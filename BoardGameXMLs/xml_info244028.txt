We will be entering Early Access soon, and we'd love for you to get involved as we develop awesome mechanics like these:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch your students grow : Students evolve and earn new traits as they gothrough the roller-coaster ride that is high school. Watch them get bullied, find love, flunk exams, and learn more about themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select the best faculty: Teachers have different teaching styles, goals, and specializations.  Keep them motivated or else they might resign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specialize your school: Research and specialize in the Arts, Math, Sciences, Sports, Agriculture, or Vocational Studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micromanage your finances: Do the teachers get instant or brewed coffee? Do the kids eat healthy diets or cheap microwave lunches? It's all up to you!&lt;br/&gt; Customize Your School: Customize your school seal and motto to make a school that is uniquely yours!&lt;br/&gt; Go to the Principal's office: Student teacher relations, the parent-teacher association, and staff strikes are some of the random events that your principal will have to deal with.&lt;br/&gt; Modding and More: As the game develops, modding and other features will be implemented in consultation with players as we bring the game to fruition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
