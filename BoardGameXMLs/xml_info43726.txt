			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Is Best Friends?&lt;br/&gt;OK, it's a game about being Best Friends and all the little hatreds that Best Friends have for each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, I know. You're gonna say that y'all get along just peachy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, that's fine too. No one said any of this was true...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, between you and me:&lt;br/&gt;it really is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Friends is a role-playing game for 4 or more friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features a simple and genuinely innovative character creation system, and devilishly childish circle-triangle artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written and illustrated by Gregor Hutton Best Friends bristles with dark humour and an impish tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring an innovative group character creation system it requires only tokens, such as poker chips or shot glasses, to play. The simple rules are designed to get players telling stories of Best Friends and all their petty hatreds right from the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equally adept for playing characters in crisis or angst-ridden teenagers Best Friends is illustrated throughout with devilishly stylish art, which gives it a quirky care-free feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
