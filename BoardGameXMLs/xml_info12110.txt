			<description>Even though the maximum is 8 players any number can play (I've raced with 30+ cars before now).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to get round the board as quickly as possible. There is a racing line that each driver must find which is quickest by 15% but this can be hard to find if you are caught up in a race long battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is via two SLIK Moves dice (6 sided but with numbers only from 3-6) to ensure close racing. There are red and blue cards that can bring good or bad luck. These have to be acted upon immediately. Red are for entering corners and blue are for exiting corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can dictate how many laps to run around a really nice and detailed board. The idea is to reflect real racing where passing can be difficult as you may have to go off the racing line and and make it stick! So, essentially it is a mixture of skill, luck and good dice throwing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
