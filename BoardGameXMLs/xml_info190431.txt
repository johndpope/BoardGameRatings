			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strays is a light-hearted, story-driven, role-playing game where players take on the roles of talking animals, adventuring as dogs, cats, and other beloved pets.  Explore your neighborhood, defend it from scary critters, and go on exciting adventures, all inspired by the animated classics so many of us grew up with.  Make your own furry companion to dive headfirst into the ongoing struggles between Naughty and Nice, and take a stand for good kids everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strays is family friendly and welcoming by design, and open to all manner of gamers, but particular the younger ones whose parents might want them having fun in less violent games and settings.  With a fast-moving system -- powered by Fate Accelerated Edition -- that's aimed at a &amp;quot;PG&amp;quot; level of violence, and with it's nearly 100 pages filled with pictures inspired by fans' real-life pets, Strays is an accessible, easy to learn, game that's perfect for young gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ebook for Strays includes everything you need to get playing;  the core Fate Accelerated Edition rules, a brief description of the whimsical world of Strays, optional rules for &amp;quot;Tangles&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Nice Points,&amp;quot; and a handful of sample NPCs and archetypical characters to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
