			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a world of the Imagination&lt;br/&gt;Where subtle, yet cunning decisions pave the way to Victory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this time of peril, your most trusted and elite Forces have heard your call to Battle.  As you watch them assemble, you recall the previous Victories were gained through intelligence and a keen sense of strategy.  Explore every option, then choose your course of action - but, remember, your opponent will be doing the same...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactics must be used which recognize the strengths and weaknesses of your opponent's battle forces, as well as your own.  Slow-moving ground forces can successfully defend key sectors of the Battle Grid, while swift-moving ground forces race through alley-ways to the attack.  But always be aware of the power of the air forces and the Ranger which, when skillfully positioned, can be devastating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, it is time to clear your mind so that you can imagine the impossible.  Be prepared to change course in a heartbeat, yet always keep the ultimate goal firmly in mind.  You are ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play:  Players execute one option per turn and alternate turns until victory is attained.  The battle forces consist of the army under the command of a player.  Siege occurs when you can attack your opponent's commander on your next turn.  Victory is attained when your opponent cannot excape siege.  Opening setup is similar in look to a chess game, and each individual type of fighter is able to move in a different way.  The fighters include both ground and flying forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground forces can be positioned by movement, or in certain cases through spinning, or through BOTH spinning and movement.  Flying forces can fly in the flight zone established by the ground forces (portals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
