			<description>Newsroom is a worker placement game where you get to manage your own international media outlet. The aim of the game is to publish your newspaper editions earlier than other players thus gaining the trust of your audience and of the advertisers and boosting your global presence as an International media outlet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning of the round, news come out in different countries around the world in different fields (politics, economy, sports, culture). Each story is associated to countries with the roll of dice. Players have in their disposal a Press team and send its members to cover some of the stories, by interviewing people and getting their news copy back in the paper. &lt;br/&gt; Each edition is divided in 4 blocks (newspaper columns) and has to cover at least 10 content points which derive from the news pieces that journalists bring back or, later in the game, from advertisements. Once the edition content is complete, the paper goes to the editors while journalists are free to get some more news stories from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the editors have checked your story, the copy moves on to printing and is published. Its time to collect money, to pay your Press team and to hire better journalists, or more editors or printers to get your next edition even faster. Remember, the competition in the media is fierce and if you lose time the other media outlets will get your story out and it will then be worth nothing to you or your audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based in the queuing theory, Newsroom is an easy to learn but hard to master worker placement- economic management game where speed and effectiveness determine the winner. Much like in the real media world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
