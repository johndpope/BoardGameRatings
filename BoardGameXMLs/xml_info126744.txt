			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controls used in this game are the right arrow key, left arrow key and either the space bar or the ctrl key. The left and right arrow keys are used to aim and the space bar or ctrl key to fire nuts at monkeys. The goal of each level is to dislodge all the monkeys. Monkeys are dislodged by attaching two nuts of the same colour as the monkey to the monkey. The water level is also constantly rising and there is a glowing line slightly above the surface. If any nut, monkey or other object touches this line, the game is over. There are four worlds, each with five levels. However, if one loses the game, he has to start at the first level of the first world. There are no save points in this game. For each level completed the player gets 10000 points and a time bonus of anywhere between 10000 and 0. There are also 5 tips to help the player as he progresses throughout the game, which can be found by enabling tips in the instructions section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
