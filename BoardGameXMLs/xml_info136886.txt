			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the year 2006 and an enourmous oil reserve has been discovered in the Barents Sea near the Russian-Norwegian border. Norway lays claim to the territory and begins deep-sea drilling in the region, despite the outcries of the bankrupt Russian government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against his government's wishes, General Alexander Krugov leads a rebel secessionist movement on a bold plan of action designed to jump-start the Russian economy: they will send their Rapid Response Unit into the Barents Sea to lay claim to the Norwegian oil sites. Krugov's gambit will throw the world into war, and the deadliest modern air battle ever witnessed will erupt between the United States Navy and the Russian Air Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The next-generation flight simulation in the critically acclaimed JetFighter series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two games in one: fight for the U.S. or the Russians in two extensive campaigns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Three cutting-edge aircraft: the F/A-18 and F-22N for the U.S. and the MiG-42 stealth fighter for the Russians&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     High-production cinematic sequences featuring rich characters and engaging story lines from both sides of the conflict&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Accurate geographical realism generated from government topographical data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Network play allows you to test your combat skills against your friends&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
