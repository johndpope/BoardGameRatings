							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hello, Dolly!</name>
									
			<description>A terrible storm has rumbled through the mountains, and Albert's sheep have all run away. Help lead them back home! Well, some of them anyway as you want to get the sheep that you tend home before the other player does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hello, Dolly!, each player owns nine sheep which each start the game on one of the 18 mountains that surround the valley. Albert the shepherd starts the game on a green clover space on the path that circles the valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the active player moves one of his sheep in a straight line until it hits either the edge of the board or another sheep; this movement cannot block another sheep from moving on a subsequent turn. The player then moves Albert clockwise on the path as many spaces as the number of spaces moved by the sheep that turn. (For example, if the sheep moved four intersections, then Albert moves four spaces.) If after moving, the triangle where Albert is located has sheep on all three vertices, then Albert collects those sheep, removing them from the board and placing them on the path back to his barn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who first gets five of his sheep on the path to the barn wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
