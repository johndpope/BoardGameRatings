			<description>Finally, your search for an authentic all-you-can-eat meat-themed dice game ends here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meat Sweats: (noun) a condition of profuse sweating due to the over-consumption of meat protein combined with elevated levels of adrenaline in the human body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a meat-loving chef participating in the &amp;quot;International Shweaty Awards&amp;quot; - an annual competition for chefs by chefs. Chefs travel the world competing to be the best among their peers. &lt;br/&gt; The chef that both serves and consumes the most delicious meats receives the coveted &amp;quot;Golden Shweaty&amp;quot; trophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets one &amp;quot;Craving die&amp;quot; for visiting the other chefs' restaurants. The Craving dice have various meats available on each face; these dice are rolled simultaneously to determine the meat the visiting chefs crave for the current course: Chicken (1 pt), Double Chicken (2 pts), Sausage(2 pts), Sausage (2 pts), or Steak (3 pts).  The final side of the craving die depicts the infamous &amp;quot;Meat Sweats.&amp;quot; Visiting chefs furiously roll their die to (potentially) request a better meat before the next course is served; others stop rolling to avoid a chance at getting the meat sweats (gaining 0 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player each round takes on the role of a Chef in his/her own restaurant.  The active chef rolls 5 &amp;quot;Chef dice&amp;quot; when the other players are ready to be served. Only one type of meat (chicken, sausage, or steak) may be delivered each round, chosen by the active chef from among the available meats rolled.  As the active chef rolls, some dice will come up as empty trays (no meat), which may not be rerolled.  The active chef receives points for all meats served each course until the other players have eaten all the meat in the restaurant. Then the active chef role passes to the next player and all other competing chefs travel to the new active chef's restaurant.  The game ends when all players have been the active chef and the final chef runs out of meat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short, light game for 3 to 8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
