							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Blazers Technical Manual and Warship Recognition Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the Author's Preface:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This manual provides players of the Star Blazers Fleet Battle System with detailed explanations of the warships and battle craft used in the game. This is also the first English language reference work to provide a comprehensive catalog and history of the spacecraft and weapon systems portrayed in the television and movie series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hardware included in this manual is drawn from the first two Star Blazers television series and their associated movie releases. The statistical data was translated with permission from the publications of Academy Press, a company owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki of Voyager Entertainment, Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last, the definitive reference book for Star Blazers fans! This data book is the first ever to bring together the ships and weapons of all three space powers from the acclaimed science fiction animated series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 490 illustrations depict the mechanical exterior views of ships of the Earth Defense Force, the Gamilon Empire, and the White Comet Empire, as well as battle craft, support craft, weapons systems, and battle maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleet organization, command structure, weapons systems, and tactical doctrines of each power are covered in extensive detail. Mission profiles of all ships and battle craft describe the purpose and role each vessel serves in its respective fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
