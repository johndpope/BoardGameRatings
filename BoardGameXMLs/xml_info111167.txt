							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">10 Commandments Dominoes</name>
									
			<description>This is a card game published by a church in Singapore, to teach players the 10 commandments and how they should be applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'dominoes' are cards divided into two squares, with a commandment (either the number or the text of the commandment), a name (of a person or place), an action or a picture (e.g. a golden calf). There are also two six-sided dice: one has the numbers, 1 to 6, the other has special symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 61 dominoes are dealt out evenly to all players (up to four) and the remaining card is placed face up in the middle. Players then try to lay dominoes down by matching them with the ends of the domino line on the table (like conventional domino games). Squares match if their content are related (e.g. the number of the commandment will match the actual words of the commandment). Any player can challenge a match, whereupon the person laying the domino &amp;quot;must explain himself with proofs from the bible or they can seek an outside moderator&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After making a match, the player rolls both dice to determine who will play next (based on the number rolled and the symbol that comes up).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to finish all his or her cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
