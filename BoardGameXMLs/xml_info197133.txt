							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Project X Zone 2</name>
									
			<description>Like its predecessor, Project X Zone is a tactical role-playing game in which players strategically maneuver their characters across a field to battle with the enemy. Characters are paired up into Pair Units, with Solo Units consisting of a single character able to assist them when linked together. In battle, players use well-timed attacks and combos to do as much damage to the opponent as possible before their turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Project X Zone 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
