			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scattered across the face of Exodus are the Nexus Gateways, ancient magical portals that connect with each other as well as other worlds and dimensions. They cannot be controlled completely, though&amp;mdash;on occasion they open without warning, sometimes bringing terrifying things from across the planes. One such occasion brought the wandering hero known as the Monkey Prince, who left behind tales of his madcap adventures and a powerful weapon known as the Dancing Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasure of NeoExodus: Dancing Dragons is created for use with your NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting home gaming for the Pathfinder RPG. The Treasures of NeoExodus series focus on creating unique and interesting magical and mundane items that you can use in your NeoExodus home games that give you more a personal connection to the item. This PDF comes with a background and history of the Dancing Dragons, its special mundane and/or magical qualities plus magic item containing detailed information and blank versions of the cards. Everything you need to incorporate Dancing Dragons into your character&amp;rsquo;s background and your gaming sessions is here making them even more appealing, special and personal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
