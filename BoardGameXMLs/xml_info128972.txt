			<description>Build up a full meal using recipes from all French Regions by answering trivia questions about French gastronomy. The game comes with a full cookbook of the 264 dishes mentioned in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions are the main part of the game - they come from a deck of cards, each card corresponding to one region local dish and containing 4 different questions - e.g., what composes a traditional dish, where the name of specialty comes from and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is randomly assigned a french region at the beginning of the game and tries to build a full menu - first course, main dish, cheese, desert, drink and a speciality - preferably with recipes from the region. First player to have a complete menu win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a player answers correctly a question, he/she will be able to either add it to his/her own menu if the dish (written on the question card) was from the same region and that the menu slot is still empty. Otherwise, a token mechanism still allows the player to eventually fill in its menu slots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
