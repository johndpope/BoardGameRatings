							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le Wine Game</name>
									
			<description>Le Wine Game is a wine tasting party game for 1 to 4 couples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The host selects four wines, places them on numbered locations on the &amp;quot;game board,&amp;quot; and lets each person sample the four wines. A notepad/scoresheet is provided for each couple to take notes on the wines. Then the wines are removed, and the host again distributes samples of each wine to the guests. The guests now attempt to identify the wines using their notes. The first taster or team to call out the correct identification is declared &amp;quot;Wine Judge of the Evening.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to help players learn about wine. Wine tasters are encouraged to file away their notes in a note box (provided) so that they may have &amp;quot;a permanent record of all your wine tasting impressions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
