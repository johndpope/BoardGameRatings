			<description>M1 Tank Platoon II (sometimes referred to simply as M1TP2) is a M-1 tank simulation released by MicroProse Software in 1998 for Windows 95/98/Me. It is the sequel to M1 Tank Platoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This vastly improved version incorporated many new features, including much improved graphics as well as multiple campaigns, and multi-player options. The ability to play as Armoured Cavalry, Marines or Army Platoons added another dimension. The manual accompanying the game, at over 100 pages, was itself a work of art and a suitable technical primer on such things as armour types, tactics, vehicles and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version allowed the player to play many positions in the four tanks that comprised the platoon. A player could play as a tank commander under cover (&amp;quot;buttoned up&amp;quot;) or open on the .50 Cal HMG Commanders HMG. Other positions included: Gunner and 'Outside 3-D Scrolling View' of any unit on the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a patch available to upgrade the game to allow for improved HMG and map performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of this game's troubled development and its apparent lack of success is documented by John &amp;quot;Spoons&amp;quot; Sponauer in this article at SimHQ: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.simhq.com/_land/armor_archive/Tank_Platoon_History.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.simhq.com/_land/armor_archive/Tank_Platoon_Histor...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;M1 Tank Platoon II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
