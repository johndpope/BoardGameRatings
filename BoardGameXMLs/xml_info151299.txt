							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Codex of the New Earth: The Cult of the Wraith</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He Who Sees, Lord of the Watchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the maddened courts of the Crazed the Wraith is riddle even to his foes. For two hundred years Solomon Nkwame has fought an unending battle against his demented peers, his loyal Watchers striking from the fog of precognitive invisibility and maiming rival cults with secrets stolen from within their own ranks. Does the Wraith truly seek to liberate the New Earth from the scourge of the Crazed, or does he merely desire a world scraped clean of his rivals?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Cult of the Wraith you will learn of Nkwame's polymorphic past and get the tools you need to decide his own role in your game. Is he a valiant protector from a lost age, a bringer of knowledge and freedom from the agonies of the Crazed? Or is he only a more seductive kind of lunatic, a deceiver who lures his minions in with hopes to feed their desperate desires? Design the Wraith's back story to suit your own game and let your players discover the truth as best they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Details on Solomon Nkwame, the mysterious Crazed known as the Wraith.&lt;br/&gt;     Information on his secretive cult and the forbidden training in psychic mastery that they offer the desperate outcasts of the New Earth.&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics for his cult members and the arch-psion himself.&lt;br/&gt;     The nullifying art of Abnegation, a brand-new psionic discipline to use in your own game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cult of the Wraith is written for the Other Dust post-apocalyptic role-playing game, but its contents are fully compatible with the free Stars Without Number role-playing game, including a section on using the Wraith in your far-future campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
