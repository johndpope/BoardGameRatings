							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LSD: Linearity, Simplicity, Duality</name>
									
			<description>Warning: This game is only for 2 players or 4 players, not for 2-4 players as described in the summary. You cannot play a 3 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From publisher's website:) Don't be fooled by the size (10&amp;times;3.8&amp;times;3.8 cm), LSD is a complete abstract tile placing game for 2 or 4 players, with no luck involved!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With just an open hand of 20 tiles, try to be the first to get a row of your tiles on the table. Blocking paths, capturing tiles, and reducing the opponents ability to play new tiles are all ways to gain the advantage. Play with 4 players to experience the weirdest 'team play' ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is easy to learn, the complexity of this game will definitely surprise you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
