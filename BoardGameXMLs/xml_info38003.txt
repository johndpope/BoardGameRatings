							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dipole Chess</name>
									
			<description>This game is a cross between regular chess and Mark Steere's Dipole.  The game is won by either capture your opponent's King instead of checkmating, or by having your opponent not be able to move any pieces.  This is done by restricting non-capture movement to only moving forward (straight or diagonally), rather than laterally or backwards.  Castling remains the same as in normal chess, and pieces may capture as the do normally, including laterally or backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small change in the results results in a game that last only a finite number of turns, and with one side guaranteed a win.  Even though the game is more restrictive in some regards over normal chess, it is still a deep game.  Due to the game being a cross between Dipole and normal chess, it bears the name Dipole Chess.  Fans of chess and Dipole should consider checking this game out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest version of the game rules for Dipole Chess can be found here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSdipolechess&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSdi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Zillions adaptation of the game can be found here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.zillionsofgames.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/90451?do=show&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.zillionsofgames.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submission...&lt;/a&gt;;id=1617&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
