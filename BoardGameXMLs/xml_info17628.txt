Usually these territorial skirmishes led to a lot of ill-mannered screeching, which was very impressive but rarely decisive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this changed when one enterprising monkey learned that a pulled-back tree branch could launch a breadfruit some distance through the forest. This discovery set off a chain reaction of intensified development into offensive and defensive forest technologies. The monkeys quickly learned that catapults worked better than pulled-back tree branches. Research into fortifications became necessary, as a means of defense against the constant rain of deadly breadfruit launched from catapults. All monkeys were issued saws in order to aid them in procuring the raw materials necessary for the war effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, as the sun rises over the Great Wood, a feeling of determination accompanies it.
