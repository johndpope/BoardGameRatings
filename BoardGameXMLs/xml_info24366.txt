			<description>One in a series of sixteen Flipsiders games designed to resemble pastel colored audio cassettes. The game contained a metal gameboard that would flip out with the snap of the wrist. A storage compartment at the top of the game would hold the magnetic pawns. A spring-loaded switch would spin the wheels of the cassette to generate random numbers and events during play. The game would hang from a blister pack on display at the store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The left spinner is used to indicate upstream and downstream movement. The right spinner is used to indicate distance moved. The first player to reach the finish line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
