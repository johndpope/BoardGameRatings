			<description>&amp;quot;Pearl King&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contents are:&lt;br/&gt;7 board tiles (one side display &amp;quot;water&amp;quot;, the other &amp;quot;beach&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;80 oysters counters (40 have pearls)&lt;br/&gt;12 pearl cards (1 with a little crown)&lt;br/&gt;1 special die (4 sides: oyster, 1 side: moon, 1 side: oyster with arrows)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players try to find pearls on the beach. The 7 board tiles are laid out in such a way, that 5 tiles show water (the sea), 2 tiles show sand (the beach). Each beach tile carries six face down oysters. It is low-tide and the waterline will recede (= a tile is turned over) whenever a moon symbol is rolled. New oysters are put on the new beach tile. After all tiles have become beach, it is high-tide: each moon symbol rolled means that a tile has to be turned over again. When all tiles have become water, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;A player rolling an oyster may look under an oyster: if it is empty, he puts it back, if there's a pearl, he takes the counter. If he rolls the arrow symbol, he also looks for an oyster but puts an additional oyster on one of the beach tiles. The player with the most pearls gets a pearl card. The player who first has three pearl cards after consecutive plays, receives the crown card and may call himself the pearl king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
