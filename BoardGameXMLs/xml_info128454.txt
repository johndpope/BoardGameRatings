			<description>From Continuum Games website:&lt;br/&gt;Animoes takes the classic game of dominos and makes it easy for children as young as three to play. Instead of dots, each piece contains cute animal characters. Children match animals as they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animoes offers a unique twist at the end of the game. The player who has played all of their pieces first, becomes the &amp;ldquo;Spin Master&amp;rdquo;. The &amp;ldquo;Spin Master&amp;rdquo; spins the spinner board until an animal is identified. The player to the right of the &amp;ldquo;Spin Master&amp;rdquo; must act like the animal the spinner has identified. If the spinner lands on the Duck, the next player must act like a Duck &amp;ndash; quack like a duck, walk like a Duck and do whatever he/she thinks a Duck would do. It is a great way to end the game laughing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are oversized (4&amp;quot; x 2&amp;quot; - perfect for little hands) and dishwasher safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;36 Game Safe Custom Plastic Tiles (8 Different Animals)&lt;br/&gt;Spinner Board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
