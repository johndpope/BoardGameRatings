							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly: Howden Editiion</name>
									
			<description>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rear of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howden, originally Heaffudene, grew at a crossing point (Bridgewater) along the Old Derwent (Hailgate) after Lake Humber had started to silt up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town has a history that starts before the Domesday Book and has several royal connections, King Edgar gave his first wife Howden Manor, William the Conqueror gave the church (later developed into the Minster) to the Bishop of Durham and King John gave Howden the right to hold an annual horse fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howden was a coaching town and although it does not have a railway, it is the M62 that brings people here today.  AVisitor can enjoy the Georgian architecture around the Minster, shops and cafes around the Market Place, a community venue in the Shire Hall, a walk around the nature reserve of Howden Marsh or recreational time in The Ashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local firms have helped to bring Howden MONOPOLY to fruition to celebrate The Ashes 90th anniversary.  This edition is about the comunity, by the communityand for the community.
