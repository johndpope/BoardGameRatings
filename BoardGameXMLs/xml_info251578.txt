							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bug World</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Bug World?  Bug World is a realm where insects, crustacean and other arthropods rule in lieu of regular mammals.  These bug-folk have formed complex civilizations, cultures and mythology and have done so despite living in a world of astonishing violence.  Young but-folk are warned with tales of monstrous flying beasts that see by sound, screaming behemoths of bristling quills and legends of foul being crawling from the ocean to consume whole cities.  Many a foolhardy adventurer having scoffed at the warnings found in fairytales has met a grisly end at the beaks, claws and jaws of such creatures of supposed myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
