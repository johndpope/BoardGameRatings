			<description>From the publisher webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule package includes the booklet - wire bound, with laminated cover -   plus playsheets and 'cut outs' (compass, turning aids, etc.) and a 'running example' (a walk through scenario illustrating various rule mechanisms). The rule book includes a full list of vessels; a description of each; an example fleet list; and for those who would like more information on the period, the appendix includes some historical notes and a list of recommended reading material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow for battles under oars, under sail, or a combination of the two and cater for anything from a single ship up to large fleet actions. Rod's Ability Chart system is used - a tried and tested method of reducing dice throwing and paperwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serenissima is designed to be user friendly and easy to understand. The rules give an authentic result with a reasonably short time and include all the aspects of warfare at sea during the Renaissance period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As was the case at the time, warfare 'under oars' predominates. However, should players wish, mechanisms exist to allow their vessels to go into action under sail or a combination of sail and oar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics for all the main vessels of the period, whether oared, sailed or combined, are covered, so players have a wide choice as to the composition of their fleets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serenissima is a full rule set, as opposed fast-play. However, it was felt unnecessary to give comprehensive sailing attitudes for vessels under sail. Their rudimentary sail plans meant that unless the wind was favourable (generally from the quarter or astern), they tended to anchor to await better conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
