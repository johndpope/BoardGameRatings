							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">...And That&#039;s It</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thats it. We are done. Humanity is over. You are the last group of survivors and the first sign of the plague has been seen among you. Now you know your destiny. It will not be painful, it will not be violent, but one by one you will fall asleep and never wake again. What do you do on this last day of humankind?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you put words around the loss of your friends, the loss of your immediate family and your own imminent death? It is impossible, but through the childish act of drawing, this game tries to come just a step closer to expressing and reflecting on these thoughts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... And That's It is a quiet and thoughtful game about loss, but also about friendship and togetherness. The style of play is slow and dull, focusing on the solitude of creating together. It's a scenario of concentrating all your feelings into small gestures, like a simple drawing, a careful touch, a dull look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core rules are available only in Danish; a one-page play summary is provided in English to support international players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
