			<description>The Medium Armored Recovery Vehicle M2-B &amp;quot;Mickey ARV&amp;quot; is a front-line walker capable of handling critical tasks such as destroying heavy fortifications or helping another damaged robot. It's powerful crane can lift even the heaviest vehicles on the battlefield and can also crush almost anything on its path....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deluxe Edition models are not just &amp;ldquo;pre-painted&amp;rdquo;. What we offer is the exact replica of Vincent Fontaine&amp;rsquo;s work, Dust Studio&amp;rsquo;s Master Painter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRANE&lt;br/&gt;A vehicle with this equipment can lift very heavy objects: it can enter a space with an anti-tank trap. By spending 1 ACTION it can lift this obstacle and move it in an adjacent square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENGINEER VEHICLE&lt;br/&gt;A vehicle with this skill has many special properties, thanks to its specialized crew and equipments:&lt;br/&gt;- if it's in contact with a Bunker, it can destroy it by spending 2 ACTIONS to do so: the vehicle needs a full activation. At the end of it, the Bunker is destroyed and all units inside are destroyed as well.&lt;br/&gt;- the vehicle can freely enter a Minefield. When inside a minefield, it can chooses to spend 1 ACTION to clear the space it's in from any Mines. The space can then be crossed by any unit without harm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RECOVERY VEHICLE&lt;br/&gt;A vehicle with this skill has many special properties, thanks to its specialized crew and equipment:&lt;br/&gt;- the vehicle gains the SELF REPAIR skill.&lt;br/&gt;- the vehicle can gather a friendly destroyed vehicle and bring it back to the rear: it can then be salvaged. When you play with a RECOVER VEHICLE, place a marker on the gameboard for any ground vehicle you loose (flying or naval vehicles don't count). If the RECOVERY VEHICLE can manage to go in the space with this marker, it can load the destroyed vehicle (this costs 1 ACTION). The destroyed vehicle has now been salvaged: its parts will be used in another battle. Count only half the destroyed vehicle AP cost when figuring Victory Points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
