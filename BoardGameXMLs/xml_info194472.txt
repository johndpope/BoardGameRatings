			<description>Jugger TTG: Dogskull Heroes is a tabletop board game simulation of a real-life modern sport which is based on a fictional gladiatorial sport featured in a 1980's cult movie, &amp;quot;The Blood of Heroes&amp;quot; (also known as &amp;quot;The Salute of the Jugger&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Salute to the Jugger&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1989 movie, &amp;quot;The Blood of Heroes&amp;quot;, filmed in Australia and starring Rutger Hauer portrays a post-apocalyptic world, similar to the Mad Max movies, in which the central focus of the bedraggled society is a brutal gladiatorial game called &amp;quot;The Game&amp;quot;. In this movie a rag-tag team of players, called &amp;quot;Juggers&amp;quot;, fight their way through the barren lands to earn the right to play in the big league of The Nine Cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cult following of the movie saw the emergence of Jugger as a sport where the brutal weapons in the movie were replaced with padded foam weapons (also known as spars or pompfen). First emerging in Germany, Sport Jugger quickly spread through out Europe, Australia, and the Americas. So popular has the sport become that in 2014 the German World Masters Tournament, The Deutsche Meisterschaft, attracted 74 Jugger teams from across the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2015 Jugger fanatic and games designer, Stuart Shaw, took on the challenge of creating a tabletop board game by fusing his game system, Siostam, with modern Sport Jugger rules. The result is an exhilarating, fast paced action tabletop game, Jugger TTG: Dogskull Heroes, where you get to take charge of your own Jugger team and lead them to victory and glory against the best Jugger players in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
