			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was officially cancelled or abandoned and is no longer in development. An unfinished version(s) of it may or may not have been made available to the public at some point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome to Nosgoth, the new bloodthirsty, free-to-play, competitive online multiplayer title from Square Enix and Psyonix set in the Legacy of Kain universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re very excited to reveal the game to you today.  There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of speculation about what exactly Nosgoth would be, so we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to finally talk openly about the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nosgoth is defined by fast and brutal melee versus ranged gameplay.  You&amp;rsquo;ll fight in team-based multiplayer battles as one of two warring factions &amp;ndash; the Humans or the Vampires.  The Humans are merciless hunters trained in an arsenal of lethal ranged weaponry and specialized devices.  The Vampires, meanwhile, are vicious predators that rely on ferocious up-close attacks augmented by their innate inhuman abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The servers for this game went offline on May 31st, 2016, so it is no longer playable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Nosgoth Development Blog. (First entry, final page)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
