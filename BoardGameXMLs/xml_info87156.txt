			<description>Legends of the Diamond is a Nintendo Entertainment System game that features legends of the baseball world including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, among others. There is exhibition mode as well as tournament mode, that can be loaded with passwords. Each player uses his career stats to determine how well he plays on the baseball field. Fielders have to be controlled manually and baseballs can be manipulated mid-flight like in an arcade game. Since it is dubbed as the &amp;quot;Baseball Championship Game,&amp;quot; the ultimate goal is to win a championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Legends of the diamond&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
