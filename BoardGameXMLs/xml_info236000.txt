							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horrors: The Scary Story RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrors: The Scary Story RPG is a tense game of investigation and discovery while being hunted by a killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters aren't monster hunters or demon slayers, they are just everyday people who suddenly have to deal with a bloodthirsty monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a race against time as the players have to discover what the killer is and how to defeat it... before you become it's next target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Horror won't be easy to figure out as the Narrator creates his own unique monster from the given rules. You will be able to make just about anything, from classics like vampires and werewolves, to newer horrors like animatronic bears or tall faceless men and everything in between. All Horrors have a weakness, though, so even if you make something tough doesn't mean it will be unbeatable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
