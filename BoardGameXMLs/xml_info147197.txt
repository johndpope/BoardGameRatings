			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the kraken. These oceanic titans are staples of oceanic fantasy (and science fiction), and it seems a wonder that any ship can cross the ocean without being downed by one of these great squids. In the transition from 3.5 OGL to Pathfinder, the mighty kraken got much mightier, skyrocketing its CR up into a realm where few players are likely to reach. As a result, all of the krakens in this book attempt to create meaningful encounters with evil squids that can be fairly attempted by characters who aren&amp;rsquo;t nearly at their peak already. The first of these is the barbed kraken (CR 8), a smaller kraken that lacks the size, shipwrecking capacity, and magical talent of the standard kraken, but which has poisonous and debilitating barbs on its long arms, and a maddening glare fitting for a monster of the deep. The seaquake kraken (CR 13) specializes in creating giant vortices in the water, which it uses to sink ships and devour their crews. Finally, the dominator kraken (CR 15) is even more intelligent than its kin, and can project a telepathic field that allows it to control each and every creature within range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
