							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic is slightly different from other role-playing games in that the focus of the game is on the play, not the creation, of heroes. Mythic is, as its name suggests, based heavily on the sorts of heroes found in, well, myths. Gilgamesh, Achilles, Odysseus, Heracles, Beowulf, Siegfried, Arthur; the characters you create in Mythic may not be as famous as these, but their deeds will be no less heroic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though set in a fantasy world, Mythic strives to maintain a fair level of historical accuracy. Also, Mythic is set up to conduct play beyond the simple level of hack n slash dungeon delving often expected from fantasy rpgs. Characters are expected to be part of the game world, not some nameless killing machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
