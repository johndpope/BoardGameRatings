							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tainted Olive - Chapter 2</name>
									
			<description>Tainted Olive can best be described as a blend of comics, fantasy novels and good old-fashioned puzzle solving. It is an ongoing story through a dark fantasy world that gets more fleshed out with each chapter.&lt;br/&gt;After Silvian manages to leave Parentium, he heads to Dua Castros in order to find out what happened for the shipments of olives and metal to stop. But before he can get to the city, he must traverse Kontiya &amp;ndash; or as known among townsfolk, the Woods of Unrest.&lt;br/&gt;Chapter Two is a fast-paced escape through the forest and the mountain, which nevertheless manages to introduce more of the world and expand the backstory of both Silvian and the characters around him.&lt;br/&gt;Happy playing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
