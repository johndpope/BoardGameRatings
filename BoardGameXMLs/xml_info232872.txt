							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Relic Knights: Codifier Togan &amp; Cecilia</name>
									
			<description>Few of the ancient Imbach race choose to follow the path of the Aethyric Doctrine, finding aethyric patterns to be too fickle to rely on. Togan on the other hand revels in the chaos inherent in the energy that binds the universe together. Cursed with insatiable curiosity and gifted with his races&amp;rsquo; naturally long life span, there are few Codifiers in existence who can match his mastery of the Doctrines. Unfortunately, Togan&amp;rsquo;s curiosity also leads him to become the source of an uncommon amount of mischief. He is banned from as many planets, stations, and ships as any corsair. Many husbands and fathers would like nothing more than to see Togan clasped in irons (or worse) due to his scandalous behavior. Cecilia, his personal Doctrine scribe, follows in his wake desperately trying to make amends and keep the catastrophes contained to disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Codifier Togan and Cecilia are two multi-part pewter miniatures provided with a single 50mm premium base. Models are unpainted and require assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
