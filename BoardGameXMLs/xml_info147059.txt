			<description>from the Kickstarter blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spheres of Power is a completely new magic system usable with Pathfinder and other D20 fantasy games. Rather than simply being a new way to access the old system (spell levels, spells per day, spell slots, etc.,) Spheres of Power reworks everything from the ground up, giving players and GMs a talent-based magic system that provides everything they need to explore whole new settings and characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paizo Blurb&lt;br/&gt;Spheres of Power is a completely new magic system for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, built from the ground up to provide an easy and intuitive approach to concept-based magic.

This makes Spheres of Power easily translatable to a multiplicity of worlds and even gaming systems without the need of any other volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this book you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     20 magic spheres, including alteration, creation, conjuration, dark, death, destruction, divination, enhancement, fate, illusion, life, light, mind, nature, protection, telekinesis, time, war, warp, and weather&lt;br/&gt;     11 new base classes, including the thaumaturge, the elementalist, the mageknight, the armorist, the occultist, the eliciter, the soul weaver, the fey adept, the symbiat, the hedgewitch, and the shifter&lt;br/&gt;     Advanced magic, including rituals, spellcrafting, advanced talents, item creation, and incantations&lt;br/&gt;     Casting traditions, allowing both players and GMs to customize not only their characters, but even the entire concept of magic for their game&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of new feats&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of new magic items&lt;br/&gt;     NPCs for every new class to spark ideas or drop into a game&lt;br/&gt;     Guilds and Organizations to sprinkle throughout your world&lt;br/&gt;     Sample worlds, ready to play or to provide guidelines for adapting Spheres of Power to a plethora of settings and world ideas&lt;br/&gt;     And more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
