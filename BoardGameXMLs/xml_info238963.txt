			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE NORTH SEAT is an adventure module for the 5th edition of Dungeon and Dragons set in an original world of present gods and heavily inspired by folklore and myth. In troubling times marked by the disappearance of a shrine and the Speakers who watched over them the small fishing village of Hostadd must band together to gather supplies for the omen-marked winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYERS will have access to eight races that will feel familiar, but with a distinct edge honed specifically for the setting and include the hardy Normans, the inquisitive Ratfolk, and the mysterious Safar. The eleven new backgrounds will help settle the characters into Hostadd and integrate them amongst their community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
