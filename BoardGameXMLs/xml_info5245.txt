							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Derivation</name>
									
			<description>A board game released late in 2002 and is a multi-game in one with an emphasis on creative wordplay, phrase guessing and a whole lot of fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Half of the game features the theme which is where the players hear a common word of phrase used on popular culture such as &amp;quot;cut to the chase&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spam&amp;quot; and then fabricate the origins of those phrases to fool the other players into guessing their false derivation.  The other half is split into three different mini games all built around the same key phrases.  Two involve trying to guess the popular word or phrase by either charades/drawing or talking about the phrase but not using any of the words in the actual question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last part involves pure chance where a random event migh help or hinder the current player slightly.  Winning the round in these various activities will earn cards with an individual letter which eventually spells out &amp;quot;D-E-R-I-V-A-T-I-O-N.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to do this wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
