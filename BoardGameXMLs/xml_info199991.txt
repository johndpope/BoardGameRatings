							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enchanter Class for Labyrinth Lord and OSR Games</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The most powerful spells of Prospero, the great magician of William Shakespeare's The Tempest, were not cast by his hand. He had his faithful air spirit, Ariel, cast them for him. Prospero is an Enchanter, cajoling a local elemental spirit to do his bidding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this class for Labyrinth Lord and OSR games, Enchanters can perceive and communicate with local nature spirits, such as nymphs, fairies, kami, and more. They don't cast spells, but rather they convince local nature spirits to cast spells for them. This class could also work with other kinds of spirits, such as spirits of the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find the Enchanter class, as well as simple rules for finding and commanding elemental nature spirits to do their bidding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
