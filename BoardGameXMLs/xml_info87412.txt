			<description>This game was created and released in response to the &amp;quot;modest video game proposal&amp;quot; issued in late-2005 by activist attorney Jack Thompson, known for his opposition to sex and violence in entertainment, including computer and video games. This challenge dared computer game producers to release a game following a &amp;quot;script&amp;quot; he outlined, in which the grieving father of a child killed by a computer gamer takes vengeance by murdering many people connected with the gaming industry in a brutal manner. Thompson promised to contribute a $10,000 donation to the charity of choice of Paul Eibeler (then-chairman of Take-Two Interactive, one of the game companies most heavily criticized by Thompson) if such a game were released. However, he has since claimed that the proposal was only a joke, and currently, no charity has been designated by Eibeler. The makers of the gaming-related webcomic Penny Arcade have, however, made a $10,000 donation in Thompson's name to Child's Play, a charity they founded to provide children in hospitals with toys and games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;O.K&amp;quot; in the title refers to the initials of the protagonist, Osaki Kim, but together with the second part of the game's name is also a play on the accusation that video game violence is being considered normal by manufacturers and gamers. The reference to a &amp;quot;Murder Simulator&amp;quot; refers to what Thompson regularly proclaims all violent computer games to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm O.K is a side-scrolling game with 16-bit era low-resolution graphics that shares (to a degree) the basic gameplay (and somewhat lowbrow humor) of the Metal Slug series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;I'm O.K â€“ A Murder Simulator&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
