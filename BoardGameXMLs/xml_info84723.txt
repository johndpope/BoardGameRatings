			<description>Football simulation for 2 to 6 players. The game consists of defense cards, midfield cards, attack cards and action cards. Each move is started by playing a midfield card. The cards have a color code that determines which kinds of cards can be played next (i.e. an attack card (red) can only be played if the previous card contains a red color code). Attack cards also show a number of balls that has to be surpassed by the next player. A player who cannot counter an attack card catches a goal and has to take all the cards from the current stack; the last player to play an attack card before that takes a scoring card. When the card stack is used up, the player with most scoring cards is the winner. &lt;br/&gt;Action cards can be used to reverse player order, pass an attack to the next player, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
