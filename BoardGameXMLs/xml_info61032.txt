			<description>Big Bad Ball Busting Bloody Battles&lt;br/&gt;BRUTAL is a Fantasy Combat Horror Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES BRUTAL THE BEST FANTASY Combat GAME EVER?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EASY TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn so a child can play. Roll some dice against each other and whoever Rolls the highest sum wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPLEX STRATEGY&lt;br/&gt;Complex enough to challenge the most serious strategy lovers. Shift dice from Attacking to defending between rounds, March Formations across Battlefields, and use interactive role-playing Actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAST AND FURIOUS&lt;br/&gt;Battles move very quickly, as the Game Master counts down Combat seconds at an alarming rate. During a BRUTAL battle, the players continue to move and Attack all at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNPREDICTABLE&lt;br/&gt;Opposing dice Rolls are used instead of lookup tables as much as possible. This provides more random results and Avoids wasting time flipping through a book trying to find a table of pre-determined values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLE-PLAYING OR WARGAMING?&lt;br/&gt;BRUTAL is both! Characters can join armies and be used within Wargame battles. Characters can hire troops and use Wargame techniques during role-playing battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
