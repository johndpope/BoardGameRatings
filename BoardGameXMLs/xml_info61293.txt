							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Purple Magic (D20)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purple is the colour that flesh becomes when exposed to cold. It is the colour of death, unlife and the chill that is left at the end of all things. When all the other energies are spent and nothing else remains, all that is left is the frozen void. Those that seek to use magic to tap into this ultimate end often see the after effect of the Colour surrounding the aspects of their magic as all matter fades before the power of nothing. It is at the end of the spectrum, before everything fades into the Ultraviolet. Those with mastery over Purple magic are powerful necromancers and users of elemental cold magic. They can also drain the energy out of people and things, occasionally using it to extend their own powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mages that seek to develop the power to use the magic of endings might become Devolutionists. These specialists in Purple magic learn to create a powerful connection to the ultimate void, able to unleash the power of it upon any that should raise their hand against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Clerical or Mystical domains &lt;br/&gt;    a linked reclassification of one twelfth of the spells of the players handbook, with some new spell effects to fit the spells into Chromatic Magic Theory &lt;br/&gt;    a whole new character class, the Devolutionist. This spellcaster is a powerful necromancer and user of Purple magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
