			<description>Wall Pipe is the sequel to our DOS game, Oilcap. Race against the clock as you try to place down pipes in an effort to keep the water flowing as long as possible. Gain extra points for connecting tubs, sinks and more. A fast pace, a lot of strategy and planning are needed to reach the higher levels. Many surprises await you as you try for the Top Ten High Scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
