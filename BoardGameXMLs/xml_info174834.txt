							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Plague of Storms</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grey-black storm clouds hang low over the Redwater Valley, rolling in from the mountains and heading north, following the course of the river, yet barely troubling the Silver Sea beyond the estuary city of Port Landing. No one has seen the stars in weeks, but what omens can be read portend a great and terrible doom following in the wake of the thunder and lightning. The Redwater collects the rain and swells up its banks, rising water drives subterranean monsters to the surface, the dwarven justicars have retreated to their hidden stronghold, and the mutated denizens of the Wildlands grow ever bolder in their raids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters find themselves in the middle of this growing chaos, and they are the only ones who can quell the literal rising tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plague of Storms presents two campaign fronts for Dungeon World, half a dozen dungeons, three compendium classes, and a host of NPCs for the player characters to ally with, betray, befriend, antagonise, or murder &amp;ndash; or possibly all of the above, in that order or some other. Plague of Storms provides a solid framework for a GM to weave their own story within while still remaining flexible enough to accommodate the swings in fortune of a typical Dungeon World game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
