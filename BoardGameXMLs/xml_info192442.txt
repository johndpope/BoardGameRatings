							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Galactic Battle Mounties</name>
									
			<description>The Earth is under attack by the fearsome Eclipse and his 14 Zodiac Colossi. Their mission is to take over the world, and the Super Galactic Battle Mounties are the only ones who can stand in their way! That&amp;rsquo;s why Eclipse has launched an all-out offensive on the city of Kingsmount&amp;ndash;home of the Battle Mounties and the source of their power. If the Mounties&amp;rsquo; Command Center on Mt. Royal falls, there will be no one left to stop Eclipse. Save Kingsmount; Save the World!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Galactic Battle Mounties is a fully co-operative city defense game that features a battle system emphasizing cooperation and combination. As the Zodiac Colossi swarm into the city, aided by their minions, you will work together to protect it. Alone, you are not powerful. It is only when fighting with your teammates that your true power is realized. You win if you survive the onslaught by defeating Eclipse and his Zodiac Colossi. You lose if your Command Center falls, destroying the source of your power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGBM consists of 12 episodes (rounds). Each episode, in turn, consist of 4 phases which the players take simultaneously:&lt;br/&gt;Spawn, where you will find out your monster(s) of the week and the episode sub-plot.&lt;br/&gt;Plan, where you will deliberate strategy and move your Mounties to where they need to be.&lt;br/&gt;Battle, where you will all roll your dice to fight monsters and lemmings.&lt;br/&gt;Retaliation, where the Zodiac Colossi fight back and damage the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
