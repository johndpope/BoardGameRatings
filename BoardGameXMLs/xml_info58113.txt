Introducing &amp;quot;Script Crypt, Vol 1: Psychos and Sickos&amp;quot;, a collection of adventure scripts for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible Roleplaying Game. Originally released in electronic format as part of the Horror Rules Season 1 and Season 2 e-Scripts, these little horror comedy gems are now available in print. All four Scripts are built around the lighthearted and fun-loving &amp;quot;Psychos and Sickos&amp;quot; theme and feature a delightful and colorful assortment of axe-weilding maniacs, homicidal freaks and sinister stalkers (we recommend you play with the lights on). Also, with expanded Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists, each gripping and terrifying Script becomes four Scripts - that's 16 times the mayhem! With that many Psychos and Sickos, how can you go wrong?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Complete Adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Script is a complete adventure, including all the classic Horror Rules elements: Story, Bad Guys, Cast, Walk-Ons, Chain of Events... even Mood tips and Plot Pushers!
