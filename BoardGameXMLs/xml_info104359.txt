			<description>Think game, think science, think fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ROY G. BIV players will compete in a family style, head to head  set collection game, which involves a science themed learning experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first player to collect and play a colorful array of seven cards that represent a rainbow and WIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will draw and play cards which represent the 7 colored components of a rainbow from a common draw pile, in a race to be the first to make their rainbow appear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful creation of a rainbow is accomplished by playing a card of each color, in order (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet), to form a set of cards deemed a rainbow. But beware, opponents can rain on your parade, and influence how long it will take your rainbow to appear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
