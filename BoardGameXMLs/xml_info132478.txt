			<description>This game is similar to the dexterity classic Ker Plunk. Sticks have to be removed without wooden ghost figures tumbling down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Clear plastic sheets are put on the sides of a wooden castle towers. Wooden sticks are then put through holes in the plastic so that they cross the tower. Wooden ghosts (in black, white and orange) are put on top of the sticks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;A six-sided number die is rolled to determine the start player. Players then take turns rolling a six-sided colour die. The active player has to remove a stick marked with the colour determined by the die roll. Then it is the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game:&lt;br/&gt;Removing as many sticks as possible without a ghost falling on the tower floor. If a ghost hits the floor, the player responsible loses a turn. Players keep the sticks they removed and any ghosts they caused to fall. At the end of the game, points are counted as follows: Each stick is worth one point. Each white ghost counts one minus point, orange ghosts two minus points and black ghosts 7 minus points. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
