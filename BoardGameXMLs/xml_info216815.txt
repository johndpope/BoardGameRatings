							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mario Golf 64 Board Game</name>
									
			<description>In this board game adaptation of Mario Golf 64 from the Nintendo 64, players play through a full course of golf (18 holes), or the half-course (9 holes). Players assemble large cardboard tiles to make each of the 18 holes as well as assemble the plastic putting green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the hole has been assembled, players in turn take control of a 4 inch tall mechanical Super Mario figure. Players choose the golf club (drivers/irons/putter) they wish to use for each stroke on each hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the appropriate club has been placed in Super Mario's hands, players pull back a lever to make Super Mario hit the small golf ball down the cardboard course. Players take turns on each hole, choosing their club for each stroke, and hitting their golf ball towards the green. The player with the lowest stroke count at the end of the game is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
