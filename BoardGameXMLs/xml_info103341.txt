							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dunger Derby the Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Dungers are smelly, short sighted, hairy, violent beasts lacking intelligence. What to do with them? RACE THEM! Up to 5 players can grab their Dungers and race through checkpoints to be the first to cross the finish line. However Dungers have trouble listening and are as likely to run into a wall or the the completely wrong direction as they are to head where you want (oh and did we mention the traps on the track?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player indicates the direction he hopes his Dunger will run.  Dice are rolled to see if he is listening.  If he is not listening you roll to see what direction he is going to run.  Then dice are rolled to see how far your Dunger runs that turn.  Running into walls and boulders knocks your Dunger out but knocks some sense into them letting you control their movement better when they wake up.   Running into another players's Dunger results in a fight with the winner getting to decide the direction the loser's Dunger runs for his next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dunger Derby the Board Game has easy to learn rules is meant to be played in 45 minutes or less for a great family game night.  We have test gamed the game with several 6 year olds (with the parents helping them play) and we've had them have a lot of funs watching the pigs run, knock themselves out or get into fights.  As a result we've rated Dunger Derby the Board Game for ages 6 and up based on our testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
