							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Backpackers Motel</name>
									
			<description>7 backpack tourists are on their way to a motel. There is only one room available with a bath. Two rooms have a shower, two rooms have a tap, and the last two rooms doesn't have any water at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The backpackers try to do their best, to arrive as quick as possible at the motel, to get the best room available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to predict the order of arrival of the backpack tourists. They can manipulate this by rolling dice. The special orange die, gives the player the possibility to place a backpack tourist backwards on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
