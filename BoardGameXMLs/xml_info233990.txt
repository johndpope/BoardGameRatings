			<description>Vanagard is a collaborative story telling game that utilizes some role-playing and board-game elements. At its core, it's a game of exploration, teamwork and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-6 players will take turns revealing story cards and weaving a continuous story that will take their Vanfolk on an unforgettable adventure. While one player weaves a tale inspired by the story card, the others will play their Vanfolk, overcoming the challenges presented. Each player at the table will get a chance to reveal a story card and will get to spin their portion of the story. If you like the stories of Narnia and Red Wall, this game is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simple core mechanics ensure that Vanagard is playable by a wide range of player, from age 7 to 77. There are 6 talents in the game, and they appear on both Nature cards and Talent cards. These talents are used to overcome the challenges presented in the scene. Runes are drawn to set type and difficulty of the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may create their Vanfolk characters as they play, ensuring that you can jump right into the action from the moment you open up the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXTEND the game with new card decks. As the Vanfolk increase their level, add-on decks present a natural evolution to the rules. These add-on decks include magic items (relics), spells, profession cards and other goodies that evolve the Vanfolk as they embark on a series of adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add-on decks will also include new tools for the story-teller, in the form of challenge decks, story plots and many more interesting features. All of these are optional add-ons allowing you to tailor the game experience to your personal taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
