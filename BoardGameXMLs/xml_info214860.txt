							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frost Tiger</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Native to the Empire&amp;rsquo;s frozen Northern provinces, the Frost Tiger is a predator of the deadliest variety. Larger in size than its kin from warmer climes, its physical power is matched only by its cunning. Blending in with its snowy surroundings, it can stalk its prey for miles without being seen and unheard. Attacking with precise and lethal force, its quarry will often be dead before it even knows that it&amp;rsquo;s being hunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadly as it is when it&amp;rsquo;s unseen however, the Frost Tiger is at its deadliest when it&amp;rsquo;s been cornered. Their massive jaws are powerful enough to rip a man&amp;rsquo;s arm clean off. Imbued with subtle magic, its claws will likewise leave the flesh of would-be attackers not just bloodied, but frozen solid. Few who challenge a Frost Tiger in direct combat live to tell the tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of its deadliness (or perhaps because of it), owning a Frost Tiger became something a status symbol for wealthy citizens during the peak of the Empire. Rich merchants, lords and kings would pay handsome sums for a caged Frost Tiger. Most major cities, in turn, had at least a few living within their walls. After the empire collapsed, many of the beasts escaped from their cages, turning their new urban environments into hunting grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
