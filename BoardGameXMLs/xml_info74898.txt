			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3, released as Dragon Ball Z 3 (ドラゴンボールZ3, Doragon Bōru Zetto Surī) in Japan, is a video game based on the popular anime series Dragon Ball Z and was developed by Dimps and published by Atari  for the PlayStation 2. It was released on November 16, 2004 in North America in both a standard and Limited Edition release, the latter of which included a DVD featuring a behind the scenes looks at the game's development. The game's story mode yet again plays through the the events of the Dragon Ball Z timeline, and the game includes several characters and events from Dragon Ball Z movies (like Cooler and Broly), Dragon Ball GT (like Gogeta), and the original Dragon Ball series itself (Kid Goku). Other features the game includes are a versus mode, an items shop, a tournament, and a battle ranking stage where the player has to challenge the AI in a hundred fighter challenge. Moving a spot above after beating who ever is next in the ranking. The fighting mechanics have also been enhanced from the preceding 2 games making the game closer to its anime counterpart in terms of combat (which was well received by fans of the series and gamers alike). Budokai 3 has a roster of 42 playable characters. The game released in Japan by Bandai on February 10, 2005. Like Budokai 2 before it, the Japanese version of Budokai 3 added several costumes not present in the North American version. The North American Greatest Hits version of Budokai 3 adds these costumes, as well as the option to switch the audio to Japanese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
