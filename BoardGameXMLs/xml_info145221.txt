			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oselbridge is a welcome waystation for weary travelers on the Genin Trail, the road between Tashal and Thay in eastern H&amp;acirc;rn. The bridge is the only crossing of the Osel River and most travelers spend a day or two at this oasis of civilization. Because of its strategic location, there has been an on-going dispute over control of Oselbridge for centuries. The bridge has been seized from time to time by Pagaelin tribesmen and the kingdoms of Kaldor and Chybisa; none have established any lasting authority. A seasonal trading post maintained at the bridge by the Mercantylers' Guild is a favorite rendezvous for tribesmen, adventurers, brigands, and riffraff.&lt;br/&gt; The Oselbridge article describes the bridge's history and the various factions vying for control of it. It includes full-color GM and player maps of the area around the bridge and trading post.&lt;br/&gt; This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics article and was originally published in 1989 as part of Hârnlore 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
