			<description>From the instructions: OBJECT OF PLAY-&amp;quot;Scuba Dive Game&amp;quot; is a game designed for the non-diver as well as the diver. Many basic concepts are introduced to the player as well as a variety of realistic problems and &amp;quot;hazards.&amp;quot; Each player must become a certified SCUBA diver and is then allowed to &amp;quot;dive&amp;quot; the board and work toward obtaining treasures from the various sources on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic goal of the Diver is to obtain enough money from the SCUBA obtainable treasures to purchase the certification and equipment necessary for &amp;quot;Hard Hat&amp;quot; diving. Only after obtaining the Hard Hat gear and certification card can the Diver enter the &amp;quot;Blue Hole&amp;quot; in the center of the board and obtain the $1,000,000 treasure which wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
