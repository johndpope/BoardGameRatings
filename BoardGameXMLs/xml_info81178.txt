			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HE'S A-MAZE-ING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody's run into Kwirks - like when your shoe laces got tied together, or socks never matched...and behind it all was the original - Kwirk himself. But now, Kwirk, the Chilled Tomato, is in a bit of a stew. Somebody has set a trap for his main squeeze, Tammy. And Kwirk's the only truckin' Tomato with a chance to rescue her from this puzzling predicament. With Kwirk, you'll mash through many a maze, move bunches of blockers, outwit plenty of pits. And, just when you think the labyrinth is licked...a trickier one appears. So put on your shades, get your thinker in gear, and remember...Tammy's only got one hope...you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
