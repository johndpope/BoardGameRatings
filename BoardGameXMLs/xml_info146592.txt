							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crootle: A Card Game of Kaleidoscopic Proportions</name>
									
			<description>Crootle is an abstract game that entails matching colors. There are 112 Color Tiles in a standard deck, along with 20 Corner Tiles.  Each tile in the deck is 1.375&amp;quot; square. Crootle uses four colors, red, green, blue, and yellow.  Each Color tile is divided into quadrants, each quadrant one of the four colors. A Color Tile may have each of its quadrants a different color, or they may be all the same, or a combination. Because there are four colors, there are 256 color combinations possible, 112 of which have been selected to make this standard deck. A Corner Tile is the same size but is solid in color. A set of Corner Tiles consists of one of each of the four colors in Crootle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game of Crootle is to connect two corners of the playing field together. Each game the Corner Tiles are randomly set, and each player randomly selects their path, or rather their two corners to connect. Four players could feasibly be on the same path as each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through timed turn play, each player draws Color Tiles and matches them side to side, trying to connect, or block their opponents from connecting, their two corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun for anyone who sits down to play.  Playing head to head with players of equal ability can prove to make a challenging game.  Test playing has found audiences in children 7+, adult party games, senior players, and even some autistic and other mentally challenged persons have enjoyed the task of connecting Color Tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
