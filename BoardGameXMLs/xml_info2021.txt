			<description>from the translation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a distant time, when magic was still on the earth, there was a ritual among the great wizards by which they measures their power. They each sent a precious gem. With the power of their mind, they raced the stone over the three continents. Ice had to be navigated, and lava chasms has to be crossed. Wizardry would allow them to change the size of the stone. The winner was the first to get his gem around the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The square tiles with the small gem are the game pieces. For each gem there are 4 different sizes. Each player has only one of the stones on the board at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player moves his stone according to the size of the stone. The tile moves as many space in one direction as the size of the stone. Players can change the size of their stones during their turns. Stones that meet bump each other. The chasm is impassable, so players must build bridges across the chasm. 12 bridge pieces in 2 colors are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spell cards can change or move the bridges. Bridges are also the start and ending spaces for each stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
