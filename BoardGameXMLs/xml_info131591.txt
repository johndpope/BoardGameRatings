							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure in Talis</name>
									
			<description>In this Interactive Fantasy Text Adventure Game, your mission is to help the Village of Talis from trouble. Adventure of Talis combines BGG, VGG and RPGG together:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- VGG: the final file will be a small, single .exe file, and need .NET Framework at least ver 2.0. Recently all Windows version already have .NET Framework ver 3.0 or higher, so it can be played easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- RPGG: you start with STR=1, INT=1, AGL=1, HP=1, GOLD=0, TIME=0. You will improve your stats along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- BGG: you are summoned to a village (the Village of Talis), and the people there play modern board games! (what? why? how? Nope, I will not spoil the surprise ).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And: in the game you will find many clues about many games. If you can mention the answer, you will get GeekScore. This is a geek side-mission, for fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has a NOTES button that will bring you to the Notes Screen, which features:&lt;br/&gt;- Auto map. It draws the map as you go around between locations!&lt;br/&gt;- A place to write notes &amp;amp; clues&lt;br/&gt;- Mission &amp;amp; progress reminder&lt;br/&gt;So: no need to prepare any paper+pencil/pen! &lt;br/&gt;(of course, you may ignore the NOTES button and do it the old fashioned way: draw your own map!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the game on &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.jackdgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.jackdgames.com&lt;/a&gt; (on FREE GAMES menu)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
