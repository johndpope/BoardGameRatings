			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find yourselves in a tavern. The warm glow of the hearth casts its bloody light about the smoke-filled room, as weary and grim-faced travelers huddle over their drinks, eying you suspiciously. Suddenly, for no discernible reason, you band together with 4-6 other people you've never met, trusting one another instantly with your lives, your wealth, and your future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this is how your games have been beginning lately, maybe its time to shake things up a bit. Within this product, you will find 47 fun, imaginative and inspired ways to bring your PCs together for the campaign ahead. No more barfight cliches, no more forced party composition, and most importantly - no more uninspired opening scenes to start your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;47 Fantasy Adventure Hooks is completely system-neutral, and provides you with simple but exciting options to start out your next adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harness up, stow your supplies, and ready yourselves for the road! The adventure is about to begin...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
