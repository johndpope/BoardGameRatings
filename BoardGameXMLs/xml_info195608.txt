			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are defined by Attributes (Body, Mind, and Balance, with values distributed from a points pool) and a variety of derived Attributes.  Characters also have three dice pools derived from Attributes:  Corpus, Psyche, and Pax.  Damage causes a reduction in Attributes; Attribute damage and expended points pools are regained through rest.  Action resolution uses a dice pool mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supposes that characters' primary activities will be combat and violence.  The combat mechanics dominate the rules.  In addition to notable physical prowess, characters have advanced mental capabilities that allow them to use supernatural powers (most of them centered on combat).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published to an online competition forum without any author identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
