			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card Game 2+ players. Players are trying to see who can get the best nights rest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a Sleep Track marked with five stages ranging from Awake (stage 0) to Slow Wave Sleep (stage 4) to show which Sleep Stage the player is on. The players play Sleep Cards to advance to deeper levels of sleep. Wake Cards are played on an opponent to reduce the opponent&amp;rsquo;s Sleep Stage. At the end of each turn, a player gains a number of Sleep Tokens equal to the player&amp;rsquo;s current Sleep Stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The game lasts 16 turns. Each turn represents Half an Hour. This would correspond to a full nights sleep of 8 hours.&amp;rdquo; The winner is the player with the most Sleep Tokens at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
