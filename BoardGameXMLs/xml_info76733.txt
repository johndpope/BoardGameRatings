			<description>Estonian erotic board game; is great for couples for getting to know each other a little better and this game is also a great party game as well. You can find out a lot more about your friends, their wishes and for sure you will hear a lot of stuff you have never heard before. And it doesn't matter how long you have been together, this game fits all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The has very easy rules and moving is with dice.&lt;br/&gt;You roll the dice and move on the heart shaped board. You get to the black space, you miss a turn. If you get to a space with ? on it, you get a card and do as it says. The last one to finish the game, will have to obey to the winner until the next game or all night long.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
