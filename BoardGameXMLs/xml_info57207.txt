			<description>Asakusa was the commercial heart of old Tokyo. And now it is one of the most famous sightseeing area in Tokyo, because it has retained the spirit of Edo-era,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are city fathers of Asakusa. You walk around sites of Asakusa, and place your men to the sites. When there are already other player's men, you can kick them out by placing more number of your men! You can get income from the sites with your men when you arrive there again. But please keep in mind of the cost to hire the men -- to be the king of Asakusa, better business sense is also important as well as the power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
