			<description>This card game is a traditional Quartett game using the picture cards but it also has a second game that uses the backs of the cards. This game is called Catcher Quartett and is only for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a wrestling move on it.The four moves are Press, Pin, Drop Kick and Body Slam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt half the deck. Both players choose a card secretly and then both cards are revealed simultaneously. If they are not the same, the following applies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRESS beats PIN&lt;br/&gt;PIN beats BODY SLAM and DROP KICK&lt;br/&gt;DROP KICK beats PRESS&lt;br/&gt;BODY SLAM beats DROP KICK and PRESS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strongest card takes the weaker card. Play continues until all the cards are used and the player with the most cards wins. If you want a longer game you can continue until one player has won all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
