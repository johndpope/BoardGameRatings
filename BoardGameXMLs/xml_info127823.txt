							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terrible Swift Swordfish</name>
									
			<description>An LPS bonus mini-game, Terrible Swift Swordfish is a solitaire simulation of the Royal Navy's bold and devastating attack on the ships of the Regia Marina in the port of Taranto during the night of November 11-12, 1940.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In two waves, the player send his Swordfish carrier-based biplanes laden with either torpedos or bombs to attack Italian ships or bomb port facilities respectively. Damage inflicted is determined by chit-pull (or dice rolling in the case of flak).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As additional Swordfish enter the map on their pre-designated bombing runs, Italian flak and anti-torpedo defenses grow more coordinated and deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player attempts to maximize his Victory Points by sinking ships and bombing facilities, all while trying to avoid the loss of his Swordfish Biplanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
