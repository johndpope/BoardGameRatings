							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Complete Guide to Liches (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No creature is more feared than the lich, for the lich embodies the very essence of malign magic. Powered by phylacteries that are literally vessels of evil, liches live for thousands of years until their decaying physical forms finally crumble - and even, some live on. Their centuries-long horizon line gives them ample time to study, plot, and plan, and their devilish schemes are often generations in the making. No other creature possesses the same potential for long-term influence, nor does any other creature have the time to study dark magics for so long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Complete Guide to Liches covers all aspect of lichdom, from the most evil of undead lords to the rare redeemed liches, who have sloughed off their undead lives of evil. It introduces new lich variations, such as the philolich: a mortal lover reanimated by her lich companion to keep him company as he whiles away his centuries. The &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; lich is examined in detail, along with several new varieties, including the monstrously powerful drowlich and the time-challenged novalich (whose more limited creation rituals give him but one year to complete a specific task). Finally, there are new feats and prestige classes to make lich NPCs even more deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Complete Guide to Liches is a stand-alone, world-neutral sourcebook covering everything you ever wanted to know about liches, both as a player and GM. This 3.5 edition completely updates the original version, and brings this sold-out sourcebook back into your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
