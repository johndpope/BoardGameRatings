			<description>OPFOR Steel on Steel returns to the days of massed near-peer armies &amp;ndash; but in contemporary times. The game pits the BLUFOR (U.S.) against OPFOR (World Class Opposing Forces).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game both players select appropriate combat and combat support units to capture key terrian. Each brigade area is then assigned a Mission Card for that battle sector. EAB (Echelons Above Brigade) units, from divisional units to air power, are drawn to give a hand of force multipliers. Combat and combat support cards are revealed to find initial strengths in each terrian sector. Mission cards are revealed to modify those strengths. Finally, EAB cards are played from the hand one card at a time in final attempts to win in each battle area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who wins two of the three key terrian battle areas is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
