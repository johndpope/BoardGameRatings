			<description>Score the highest total number of points by capturing pyramids pieces on a Fuji-San board. After strategically placing their pieces, players take turns trying to surround and capture the most valuable pieces on the board. This is done first by a player picking up two pieces off the board; one is discarded, and the other placed back on the board somewhere. Then they remove one &amp;quot;surrounded piece,&amp;quot; which is placed into their score pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
