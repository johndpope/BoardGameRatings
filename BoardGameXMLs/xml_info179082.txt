			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure &amp;amp; Outlawin' Gamblers and Gunslingers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old West:  After the Civil War ends, a group of former soldiers quickly finds themselves at the end of their means. Their meager pay-out from the war doesn't last long, and herding cattle and sheering sheep is seasonal work. Eventually, then, these former soldiers begin to supplement their incomes with various acts of outlawry, using the skills they learned during the war. It isn't long after that before they become a gang of Outlaws in truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
