			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate is a turn-based, squad level tactical game set in the Warhammer 40000 universe. As Captain Kruger of the Ultramarines space marines chapter, your duty is to hunt down the Chaos traitor forces of Lord Zymran, and find out the reason behind their incursion in Imperial Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos Gate puts the players in command of a Space Marines force. Before each battle, players choose their forces among the available marines and vehicles (each individual marine has his own statistics) and choose their equipment. Battles are turn-based (each character having a number of action points to expend each turn to move, fire or take other actions), displayed in isometric perspective. The game is very faithful to the Warhammer 40k universe, including lots of equipment from the tabletop game (terminator armor, weapons, dreadnoughts, land speeders...), psykers, Chaos Demons...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a single-player campaign, a random scenario generator, a scenario editor and can be played with up to 3 other players on a LAN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
