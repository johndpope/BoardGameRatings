							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hole of DOOM!!!</name>
									
			<description>Hole of DOOM!!! is akin to Battling Tops in that players spin tops on a wooden board, trying to push the opponent into the dreaded hole of DOOM! For 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Cubiko website....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In late 2012, whilst playtesting 'Clockwise'  eight year old Samuel continued his annoying habit of spinning the games delicately designed cog mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Samuel stop it! Turn the cogs gently, don't spin them.&amp;quot; I pleaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now Samuel is a great playtester and since he seemed obsessed with his spinning discovery, and wasn't about to stop any time soon, I decided it was best to follow his lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So there we were spinning the cog mechanism harder and faster when suddenly the smallest cog jumped from its hole and spun by itself.  Well that was it, Samuel completely dismantled the wooded mechanism and began spinning each cog individually. Biting my lip, I reluctantly joined in and a game which resembled the classic 'Battling Tops' ensued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I gradually warmed to the abuse of my cogs, however, our makeshift board was littered with 5mm holes and the spinning cogs would fall as they cross them. Samuel thought this was great and he called them holes of DOOM!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
