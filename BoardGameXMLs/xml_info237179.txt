			<description>&amp;quot;Natural disasters will quickly be a thing of the past.&amp;rdquo;  - Those were the thoughts of S&amp;ecirc;ni Lativ, meteorologist and chief engineer of the weather department on Lightning Technologies after the latest test with his newest invention: The weather machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He can see how controlling the weather will change the world, but never in the way he ever imagines it. As soon as the news about controlling the weather come out in the media, a significant struggle rise over his invention. Businessman wants to make it a commodity, politicians a weapon. His company just want to sell it to the highest payout. &lt;br/&gt;Tourism, agriculture, private companies, governments, secret organizations. In a minute everyone wants a piece of this machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are executives working to Lighting Technologies trying to achieve the highest place on the company board. To do that they can follow different paths, showing loyalty to the company and the dream of the scientist by working towards the benefits of the earth climate or just selling the weather services to the highest bidder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a tile placement game to build and manipulate the weather using the Machine, resource managing to feed its needs, and goals achievements.&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics so diverge from action selection, worker placement and tile placement and hand management. Players will try to point the machine to complete their contracts and at the same part increase their power in business and climb the stairs of the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose all the 8 actions available to them, and they resolve it in any order they want one at the time.  The action selection is based on the quadrel created to Vinhos, and the actions are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Gather resources, 2. Use Weather Machine, 3. Change machine target, 4. get a deal, 5. accomplish a contract, 6. Help Lativ 7. infiltrate a company, 8. Try a promotion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
