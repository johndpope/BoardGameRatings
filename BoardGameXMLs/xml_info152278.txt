			<description>Rock city is a dice placement game in which players command their own band and compete to develop and present the best songs during the three festivals of this great city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before each of the festivals, players have 6 rounds of action. In each round, players roll 3 dices each, and during his turn he can perform one action. To perform the action, the player will use 1, 2 or 3 dices. The round goes on until no player has any action left (i.e. dices).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actions vary between perform in underground bars, practice your musics, write new lyrics, buy materials at the music shop, publish a sample CD or just perform at the Casino to get some extra cash. Each of those spaces needs a different combination between quantity of dices and the sum of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once players have written one or more lyrics, they are ready to try to get the best melody possible for that tune!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the player with most points, that will be earned by playing musics during the shows. You can also earn points by adding a nice production value to your show or having some fancy different instruments on your band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
