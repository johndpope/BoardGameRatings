			<description>Combat between gangs, military, bounty hunters, scavs, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are either squads or individual heroes/cyborgs.  At the start of the game, players give all of their units orders and then begin activating them. At the end of the turn, players may attempt to change their orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is done by rolling to see if you hit and then rolling for damage.  Troopers can be suppressed or killed - heroes get a saving throw to avoid the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A point buy system is provided - there are some differences among the factions - the government troops and police tend to be better equipped while the rebels, scavs and savages are fast moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 scenarios provided: Encounter (a basic firefight), Raid and Capture and Assassination.  Unlike some other games on the same topic, there is no campaign system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
