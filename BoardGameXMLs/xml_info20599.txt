			<description>Elsmea, another world of warlocks and witches.&lt;br/&gt;You are high school students at Academy of Witches. &lt;br/&gt;A half year before graduation, doctress Diana invite all of you into her lab. &amp;quot;Welcome and congratulations, my bewitched girls!&amp;quot; She says &amp;quot; You are elected as candidates for the most valuable witch&amp;quot;. Then, the elfin doctress adds niceties with gorgeous grin. &amp;quot;Only one of you will be laurelled as the Witch of Elsmea of the year. The winner should read ambitious message at graduation. Questions? &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Doc,&amp;quot; One of you say &amp;quot;what is standard for the examination?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The instructor witch winks. &amp;quot;People of Elsmea know the way. They need fetishes or magick items for their poor lives. Go ahead and make their days happy! Class is dismissed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. Like the legendary witch who made glass shoes, pumpkin coach and mouse-coachmen for Cendrillon, you must create and use or give some magick items for citizen of Elsmea. Every 3rd month, doctresses check the folks' Favors of each region about you, and fill in report cards as Brownie Points (BP). Who can be the best? At the end of 6 months, the player scored highest BP win a game as the Witch of Elsmea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To create fetishes, you must collect and fuse elements(clear colored beads) from all over the Elsmea (Game-map).&lt;br/&gt;But your rivals aim same thing. And fusional process is static. Thus to win, you must control all things!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
