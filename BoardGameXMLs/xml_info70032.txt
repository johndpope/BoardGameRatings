			<description>&amp;quot;Warriors of Might and Magic is a game in the fictional Might and Magic universe. It was released on three different consoles generating three totally different games. Although they all follow a similar storyline each game was unique, for instance they all had their own unique levels and monsters. As well as this there were other differences such as, on the Playstation 2 version items could be bought and sold at merchants, however on the Playstation version a choice of only three weapons were available (a sword, an axe and a mace) which upgraded each time you found that particular weapon (for instance you have a sword, you find another sword upgrading your sword to level 2 etc). On the Game Boy Color version (which was a 2D game) the fighting system was limited and static etc. On the whole there are many differences between the three games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Warriors_of_Might_and_Magic,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
