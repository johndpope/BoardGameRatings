			<description>Sadowa covers the one day battle (spread over 13 turns)  between the Prussians and the Austrians (and their Saxon allies) during the 1866 Bohemian campaign. Standard game (4 pages of rules), and a more advanced game with setup information (an additional 4 rules pages) with simultaneous plotting and some minor changes to the core system. Units represent infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Rules cover combat (ranged fire and close assault), line of sight, terrain, stacking, zones of control, redoubts, reinforcements, superior Prussian morale, optional Prussian Command, and Austrian &amp;quot;Kamikaze&amp;quot; Hussars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadowa is a rather simple tactical design, with amateur production values, die-cut counters, and a color 22 x 14 inch map. Published by Fusilier Games (Aberdeen, Scotland), this game game was un-boxed (zip) with a cardboard cover sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
