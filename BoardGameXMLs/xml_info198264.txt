			<description>A pirate &amp;amp; treasure game with stamps for 2 to 4 players aged 6 years and up.  &lt;br/&gt;Each player picks out a pirate. &lt;br/&gt;The game sheet is torn from the game pad, crumpled up and smoothed out again, so that it is wild and weavy as the sea. 10 treasures are placed onto the game sheet using the treasure chest stamp and the gold ink pad. &lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns in a clockwise direction. On your turn, put the die onto the game sheet. Cover it with the dice cup so that you can no longer see the die. Now raise the dice cup slightly and push it over the game sheet like a ship on water and stop at a free treasure of your choice. Carefully lift up the dice cup and see what is on the die:&lt;br/&gt;Saber: You can keep the treasure! Stamp your pirate stamp onto the treasure. It now belongs to you and no one else can ever steel it.&lt;br/&gt;Jolly Roger (pirate flag): The black pirate has struck and stolen the treasure! Take the Jolly Roger stamp and the black ink pad and stamp the treasure out. It is now lost for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;Treasure chest: Take the treasure chest stamp and the gold ink pad and stamp another treasure chest on any free space of the game sheet.&lt;br/&gt;The game is over as soon as all treasure chests have been stamped. The player with the most treasure chests wins. There can be more than one winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
