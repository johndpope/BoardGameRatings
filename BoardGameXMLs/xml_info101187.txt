			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TX-1&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay was similar to Pole Position, in that the player, piloting a Formula One racecar, needed to reach a check point in a certain period of time in order to continue playing. While negotiating the course, the driver needed to exercise caution in the turns, as excessive speed would cause the car to skid; additionally, the driver needed to pass slower cars carefully to avoid a fiery crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Pole Position, each stage ended at a branch point; depending on which way the driver turned, the course would be substantially different. The final two stages of this five-stage game were based upon famous Formula One races of the time and were identified by the name of the country; the path chosen during the previous three stages determined which &amp;quot;races&amp;quot; could be run in the final two stages. TX-1 was a pioneer in this style of play, which would be copied by myriad other games, especially Sega's successful Out Run series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
