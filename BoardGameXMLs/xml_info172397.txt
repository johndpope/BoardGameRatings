							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wells of Wonder: Arcane Fonts</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A New Kind of Magic For Your Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy worlds are full of strange and mystical fonts, wells, and fountains that can imbue unknown magics upon those who drink from them&amp;hellip;or so the tales say. In truth, these fantastical elements are rarely seen in roleplaying games, as their mystical nature is often at odds with the strict, codified rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents rules for creating your own arcane wells with wondrous properties, and ensuring that they remain balanced and usable in your game. While the focus of the book is primarily sources of water, the same rules apply equally well to other things&amp;mdash;such as mystical fruit, or meat, to name just a couple of examples. Mix and match different benefits and limiters to create a natural source of mystic power that fits exactly what you want for your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
