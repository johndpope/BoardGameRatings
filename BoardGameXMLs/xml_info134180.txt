			<description>Asphalt 7: Heat is a 2012 racing video game from the Asphalt series, developed and published by Gameloft. It was released on June 21, 2012 for the iOS and marks the first time in the series that a game is the same for both the iPhone and iPad. The game was launched for Android on 29 June.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asphalt 7's gameplay is very similar to that of previous games in the Asphalt series, with the player given the option of either tilting the device or touching the side of the screen to steer. The game also has a multiplayer mode, both local through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and global through an internet connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features predominately the same tracks as Asphalt 6: Adrenaline, although it adds some new tracks, and tracks from the previous game are missing (Cape Town, Monte Carlo, Hong Kong and Detroit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asphalt 7: Heat has a total of 64 cars divided into 7 classes, depending on its respective tier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Asphalt 7: Heat&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
