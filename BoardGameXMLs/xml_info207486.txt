							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infinities: Defiance of Fate</name>
									
			<description>Infinities: Defiance of Fate is a strategic adventure game based in a cross-over setting of fantasy and science-fiction worlds connected by multiversal rifts. As these rifts open, factions from each world collide as their realities blend into one another. However, the cross-over doesn't end with the story. The game boasts a hybrid gameplay style, blending strategy card game and tactical wargame mechanics with narrative elements. A leader acts as your avatar as you immerse yourself into the game&amp;rsquo;s worlds. Each leader is represented as a playmat with an attribute track and a unique set of abilities called Gambits. You can play unit cards in your leader's group to bolster attributes and gain new abilities. You can also play ability cards to perform one-shot effects or prepare cards in your Timeline for future activation. For your turn, roll action dice and use them to explore map tiles, play cards, attack other leaders, and secure objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinities offers two primary game modes: Skirmish and Adventure. In Skirmish mode, players strive to collect more points than their opponents from a randomized set of objectives. The sets of objectives are found on Scenario cards, which have gameplay themes such as &amp;quot;survival of the fittest&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;escape the horror from beyond.&amp;quot; Skirmish mode functions as an ideal pick-up mode in addition to providing an avenue for competitive play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Adventure mode, two factions use an Adventure Guide to follow a branching narrative campaign with varied, asymmetric actions, objectives, and win conditions. Based on the events and outcomes within an adventure chapter, players will proceed to one of many possible chapters and make a thematic change to the game's assets for the remainder of the campaign. These changes range from removing leaders, shuffling cards into other decks, or permanently increasing action dice. Additionally, each chapter may change allegiances, leading players through free-for-all, team, one vs. all, and cooperative engagements. This makes it quite likely that players will experience both sides of the story throughout a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With shared or separate decks, dice manipulation, shifting turn order, a player-created game map, optional unlockable powers, a myriad of dynamic victory conditions, and session-specific actions, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that the possibilities in this game are infinite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
