							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of the Ancient World: The Oracle&#039;s Breath</name>
									
			<description>Legend has it that the 'Oracle's Breath' is a powerful relic. Whosoever possesses the trinket can write his own fate. 'Rumors often exceed the truth,' you smirk to yourself. It is no surprise, however, that one day, Caius, a powerful merchant, approaches your group and makes a very lucrative offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Return the Oracle's Breath to me, and I will pay each one of you who comes back 300 silver pieces,' he states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that was weeks ago. Now as your skiff approaches the damp wooden pier in the smothering fog, only one thought races through your mind. &amp;quot;What have I gotten myself into!&amp;quot; So you grab your weapons, and tie off, preparing for riches and reward, or a fight for your life in search of the Oracle's Breath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oracle's Breath is a complete fantasy adventure for solitaire or group play. This game includes the adventure booklet, game rules, playing pieces and game board. It is suitable for ages 12 and up and can be played with either the included Legends of the Ancient World games system or other game systems such as Melee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.darkcitygames.com/display.php?series=LAW&amp;amp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.darkcitygames.com/display.php?series=LAW&amp;amp&lt;/a&gt;;id=21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
