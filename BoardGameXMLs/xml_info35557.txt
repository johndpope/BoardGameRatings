							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Games in Middle-earth</name>
									
			<description>An official game, under license from New Line Cinema, created by Games Workshop and published by DeAgostini, a company best-known for their partwork magazines.  Battle Games in Middle-earth was a fortnightly publication with each issue containing game rules, painting and modeling articles, card &amp;quot;standee&amp;quot; figures, etc.  Included on the cover were sprues of plastic 25mm figures (by GW sculptors), paints, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wargame rules, as might be expected, were very basic and die-roll heavy.  Later issues of Battle Games featured more advanced rules to cover special abilities, magic, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title proved more popular than the publishers expected and the deadline was extended several times.  Issue 91 was the final issue in July 2006.  The title was published/distributed in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Malta, South Africa, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Poland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Games in Middle-earth is related to The Lord of the Rings: Strategy Battle Game with some overlap in the range of miniatures, but it was marketed as a game in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
