			<description>Italian cycling game published in the 1960's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game is set up, the road cards are turned one by one, starting from the one that is farther away from the finish line. Most road cards have a rider underneath, each of the twelve different riders appears under four different cards.Every player is supposed to manage one (or more) riders. When one rider shows up, he loses strength and therefore has less chances to be the winner, which is the last rider to appear, the one under the finish line banner. The game includes items like banners, public &amp;amp; price money. The track is formed by cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
