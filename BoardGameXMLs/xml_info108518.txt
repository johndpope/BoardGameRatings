							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Emmitt Smith Football</name>
									
			<description>Emmitt Smith is former Cowboys all-pro running back Emmitt Smith. Like Troy Aikman NFL Football, the player can make his own plays. Most of the text in this game uses a classic video game typeface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possible modes of play include: exhibition mode and season mode. Smith added his voice on the game; giving positive comments on big gains and negative comments on negative plays. Most of the standard rules of the National Football League at the time of release are used (four quarters of 15 minutes, 100 yard field, etc.). However, the options allow the player to change some of the rules used in the actual game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Emmitt Smith Football&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
