			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty village at a nice cool elevation, perfect for growing agave. A paved road connects it with the M54 highway. It would be a real paradise, in fact, if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t right under one of the most active volcanoes in the hemisphere, Volc&amp;aacute;n de Colima - which our ancestors probably knew as Tzapot&amp;eacute;petl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The volcano rises 3860 meters and billows and sputters menacingly. The land around the volcano is owned by a vicious drug lord named Moran, a man who thinks nothing of murdering his rivals with power drills and muriatic acid. Luckily he is far away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large segment of the document is intended for print-and-play use as a series of two-sided, full-color cards; color has game significance.  The document uses two page sizes - one for the rules and one for the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
