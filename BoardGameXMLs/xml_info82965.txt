			<description>Dirty Harry: The War Against Drugs, also referred to as simply Dirty Harry on the game's cover and in the in-game menus, is a 1990 video game based on the Dirty Harry film franchise starring Clint Eastwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a side-scroller, in which players must guide Dirty Harry throughout San Francisco. He wears a blue suit, although it can be exchanged for a white suit. He wields his signature .44 magnum, and players have to ability to draw the weapon without actually firing it. This allows the player to walk around while aiming at punks and dare them to feel lucky. Most notable, in reference to real-life handguns, the .44 also exhibits a recoil effect when fired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other weapons consist of LAWs rockets, harpoon guns, and explosive remote-controlled cars. When injured, Harry's health can be restored by eating chili dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Film references&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is non-canon to the film series and novels, it however incorporates several references to the film series. The game uses digitized speech to deliver both of Harry's famous lines (&amp;quot;Make my day&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I know what you're thinking...&amp;quot;), and the showdown occurs on Alcatraz island. This feature pre-dates Duke Nukem 3D's many digitized phrases by six years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dirty Harry: The War Against Drugs&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
