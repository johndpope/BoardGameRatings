			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five by Five is a (choose your trait) style RPG that makes unique use of the d6 (called the d5 - a 6 is read as a 0) to create an easy to learn and easy to play universal task resolution system. The game is meant to be flexible enough to satisfy a variety of settings and easy enough to pick up and play right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the Five by Five game system is the 5&amp;times;5 dice roll. Players roll two d5&amp;rsquo;s and multiply the results. This basic mechanic gives an average unskilled person around a 30% chance of success and ranks of skill tend to improve this chance in roughly 10% increments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat rules include examples for weapons and armor both archaic and modern, an open ended damage mechanic for the possibility of spectacular critical hits, and rules are included for unique traits like super powers or magical abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
