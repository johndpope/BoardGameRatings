			<description>Two sets of variant components for Divine Right, and accompanying rules articles by Jon Freeman, published in issue 34 of The Dragon magazine (February, 1980).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12 ambassador cards give names and diverse personalities to the ambassadors in Divine Right. Each player receives an ambassador personality card at the start of the game. The cards specify various advantages and disadvantages (including die-roll modifiers) for each ambassador.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12 siege train counters are attributed to Freeman's gaming group, the White Mountain Gamers of Washington state. In addition to the rules for the use of the siege train counters, a couple of other variations for the Divine Right siege rules are proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both sets of variant components are printed on a single cardstock sheet bound between pages 6 and 7 of the magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon #34 referred to itself as &amp;quot;the Divine Right issue&amp;quot;, as it also contained a number of other articles about the game, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Designer Glenn Rahman's suggested changes to the 1979 edition published by TSR&lt;br/&gt;     The official second edition rules changes from the TSR design department&lt;br/&gt;     Tom Wham's proposed optional rules that did not make it into the published game&lt;br/&gt;     Two articles suggesting a number of gameplay variants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
