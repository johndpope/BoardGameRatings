			<description>Scourge of War is the definitive American Civil War grand tactical wargame of this generation.  With impressive 3D graphics, an award-winning AI, pausable real-time play, historical battlefield terrain and orders of battle down to the regiment and battery level, Scourge of War captures the tactical challenges that faced the real Union and Confederate commanders more than 130 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Scourge of War: Antietam, the second major battle expansion for Scourge of War: Gettysburg, players will take command of the Union or Confederate forces during the battles of Antietam and South Mountain in September of 1862. Antietam became known as the first major battle to take place on Union soil and the single bloodiest day of battle in American history.  Incredible heroism and sacrifice on both sides made this one of the hardest fought battles in the entire American Civil War and also gave President Abraham Lincoln the opportunity he sought for the Emancipation Proclamation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scourge of War: Antietam contains 26 new single-player and 2 new multiplayer historical scenarios.  Weather and battle times have been authentically and historically recreated. Historical documents are included for players to enjoy and understand one of the most important battles in the American Civil War.  The many successful and unsuccessful command choices also leave room for a great many alternate historical outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking place on four new incredibly detailed and accurate maps, Scourge of War: Antietam aims to deliver the ultimate and challenging Civil War strategy game experience for both beginner and experienced wargamers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scourge of War: Antietam is an expansion and requires Scourge of War: Gettysburg  to play.
