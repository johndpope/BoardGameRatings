			<description>Ritualia is a fun, light strategy game, where each player starts as a Hermit, leader of a Cult of Nature and competes the other players to become the Prophet of the Realm. The Map of the Realm is always different and compiled by players from 48 tiles, before the game begins. Each Cult has an unique advantage throughout the game, moreover, additional artifacts will grant other powerful advantages. A player's turn is as short as possible, to keep everyone interested: each player throws the dice, chooses one action and performs the effects of that action. The main goal is to gather resources: converting villages or finding powerful artifacts. Luck plays its role in this contest, a dice is used at the beginning of each turn, and each player can sometimes draw cards from three different decks: Artifact Cards, Ruin Cards or Debate Cards. Sacrifice tokens can be obtained during the game and used as extra dice points. The game ends when a player has enough resources to perform the Ritual of Ascending at the King's Castle and becomes the Prophet, winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the epic world of religious doctrines, where everyday events may help shape the world to come.&lt;br/&gt;You start this Game of Truths as a Lost Soul, longing for spiritual fulfillment. As soon as the doctrine is revealed to you, set forth to spreading it among the villagers. Some of them may prove too resilient to new ideas, so you may have to use powerful artifacts to help you on your holy quest. As your popularity rises, your tasks will become easier, but be warned that your competitors may challenge you at any time.&lt;br/&gt;Who will emerge as the True Prophet of the Realm?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
