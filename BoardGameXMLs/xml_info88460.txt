							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scrabble Switch-Up</name>
									
			<description>Scrabble game features six interchangeable board games. You can play the classic game, or try a version with &amp;quot;blanks&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;blockers.&amp;quot; You can even design your own custom game with the nine mini-boards.  Some of the boards have themes like &amp;quot;outer space&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;in the clouds.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other than the classic game, here are the variations you can try with Scrabble Switch-Up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blanks and Blockers: If you play a letter that covers a blank or block square you take the appropriate tile. A blank acts as a normal wild card with the added bonus that it doesn't count as one of your seven. A blocker is a tile you can play immediately to prevent someone else from using a specific square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bustin' Out:  Make words that lead you outside the walled in junkyard. This variation also uses cards - land on a guard dog and draw a card that you can use to mess up another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyper-Race: A two player game with the object of making words crossword style that lead from the space station at the top to the earth below. Land on a comet and get a free blank tile. Land on a flying saucer and draw a card similar to the guard dogs above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free for All: Uses a smaller 9X9 grid with the expanded rule that words can now be made diagonally with a limit of three words made per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surprise: Allows you to completely change the traditional Scrabble board by mixing up where the premium spots are located plus adds new ones such as wild and quadruple score. You have nine double sided squares that you use to make up the entire board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
