			<description>The magistrate leaned back from his desk and sighed. He had so much to do and little time or money to get it all done. In his hand was a report of goblin raiders attacking farms to the north. On his desk where other requests for aid, complaints about bandits along the high road, undead shambling about a local graveyard and many more calls for aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaning forward the high magistrate called in his assistant, a small, frail looking man with small eyeglasses perched on his thin nose. &amp;ldquo;Yes milord?&amp;rdquo; the small man asked with a swift bow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Handing the report on the goblin raiders to the his assistant, the Magistrate told him to give the job to, &amp;ldquo;That dwarf, what was his name? You know, the one that help us out with the troll some weeks back. He and his band of adventurers did a good job on that assignment, let us see how they fair with goblins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a bow, the bespectacled man turned and left, calling for a runner to go find the dwarf, who know doubt was drunk in some tavern, rewarding himself with the gold he had earned on his last job for the city&amp;rsquo;s chief trouble shooter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Heroes for Hire, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions. Take the role of a city bureaucrat, as you seek to solve one problem after another. Most of your day-to-day dealing though, has to do with adventurers, their hiring and then sending them off to solve one of the many problems that plagues your city. Can you build up a stable of reliable heroes who will slay the dragon you need dead, or find the grand treasure that you need to offer as a wedding present to the king&amp;rsquo;s third cousin. Seek glory through the blood and sweat of others, and rise to the top position within the realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
