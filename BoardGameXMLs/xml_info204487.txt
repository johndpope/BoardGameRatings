			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of years ago, a slumbering assortment of human refugees was brought to a lifeless frozen planet by an enormous space ark. Clouds of terraforming nanotech were seeded into the planet&amp;rsquo;s weak atmosphere. Over the course of a few decades, the frozen world grew warm and vibrant with plant and animal life, just like the distant Earth that humanity had left behind. The ark&amp;rsquo;s advanced A.I.&amp;mdash;after overseeing the terraforming process&amp;mdash;woke its human cargo and sent them down to the planet&amp;rsquo;s surface, beginning the story of humanity anew on an alien world both familiar and strange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than living in unity, humans soon fragmented into a number of warring kingdoms, the majority of which returned to a feudal existence based on technologies they could build with their hands: agriculture, masonry, metalworking, and so on. The nanotech clouds, space ark, orbital A.I., and other unseen wonders became the stuff of myth and legend. Only a few small enclaves&amp;mdash;hidden on mountain peaks and in secret valleys&amp;mdash;maintained expertise in advanced technology, allowing a select group of people known as the Lumen to live extremely long lives thanks to seemingly magical devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
