							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jury Box</name>
									
			<description>This Parker Brothers game series from the thirties is somewhat similar to the modern murder mystery party game genre. Each game in the series included six cases and twelve crime scene photos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is currently being reprinted by On-Line-Products. The following information is from their website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Unlike modern murder mystery party games, which are elaborate affairs that sometimes require extravagant character portrayals, The Jury Box is a more informal, easy to play party game. The players are members of a jury who get to examine evidence against an accused person. They each then try to unravel the case and decide if the defendant is guilty or innocent.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each series of The Jury Box comes complete with six different court cases that you get to solve. The cases have an outline with state's evidence against the defendant, along with two pictures of the crime scene and ballots for the jurors to cast their verdicts. You even get the actual solutions to these realistic cases.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
