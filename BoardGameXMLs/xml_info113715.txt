			<description>Add a little fun to your next family meal.  The Original Dinner Games features 51 games fun and easy games to play while you eat.  Each card contains a different game to play with the family at dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinner Games is not just one game but over 50 different games in one box.  Some of the games might be considered activities in that there is not a clear cooperative or competitive winner, but getting your family to talk at dinner is a win for everyone!  Many of the games do however define rules for winning and losing, such as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fireman Fran&lt;br/&gt;One person starts by describing characteristics of someone's job or occupation.  For example: &amp;quot;He wears boots, a thick coat and rides on a truck.  Who is he?&amp;quot;  The first person to guess that he is a fireman wins!  The winner continues the game with a different job, such as schoolteacher or pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game is color coded for a different skill that the game exercises such as &amp;quot;Creative and Critical Thinking&amp;quot; in the example above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
