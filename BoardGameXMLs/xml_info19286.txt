							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fun House</name>
									
			<description>Fun House - From the Klix Pocket Travel Games from Tiger Electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board folds out, the magnetic pieces (player pieces and prize markers) are stored in a built-in compartment and the dice are self-contained in a see-through compartment. The dice are 'rolled' by pushing and releasing the 'dice snapper'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prizes worth varying points are distributed throughout a 4-room funhouse. You have a limited number of moves in each room. If you run out of moves before you exit the room, you lose the prizes you've collected in that room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To Win:  Race through all four rooms of the Funhouse to win more prizes than your slow-footed opponent and without running out of moves! You have a limited number of moves to get through each room and the challenge gets tougher.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
