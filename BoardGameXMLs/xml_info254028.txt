							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Serengeti: A Race For Life â€“ Migration</name>
									
			<description>Migration is the second expansion aka thematic pack for Serengeti: A Race For Life. It contains 30 cards and provides an alternative to the starting setup as well as changing the dynamics of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Migration the emphasis is on grassing animals, a class of animals found in the game that is further expanded in this expansion with the addition of the Zebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zebra takes center stage in this thematic pack and is required in every game playing with this setup, alongside the Wildebeests (special cards) that drives a new majority that players will need to vie for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course no Great Migration would be complete without Crocodile watching their every move, so expect a game of attrition where our grass-eating friends can roam free, but not as freely as they'd wish!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
