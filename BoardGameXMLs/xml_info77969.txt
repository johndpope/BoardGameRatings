							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Utopia: The Creation of a Nation</name>
									
			<description>Utopia: The Creation of a Nation is a strategy video game. It was developed by Celestial Software and published by Gremlin Graphics (later known as Gremlin Interactive), in 1991 for Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS. It was later released for the Super NES in 1993, by Jaleco in the USA. This release made use of Nintendo's SNES mouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, taking place in the future, on a new planet, is open-ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the player's task to colonize the new planet, manage the colony and raise the quality of life for the citizen in order to reach utopia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially the player has a few colonists with a lot to do. The player needs to build everything from scratch. Building takes time and free colonists, in addition to money. Buildings under construction are depicted by scaffold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However certain buildings require personnel (hospitals, labs, mines, factories, shipyards ...) and therefore the player has to engage in population management. The player also has to micromanage features such as tax rate, birth rate and trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, each world also has a competing alien race which is trying to colonize the same planet. There is no option to form alliances, which means that the player's population must come into conflict with the aliens. The player never actually gets to see the alien city, as it is located outside the playable map, but must instead rely on espionage to find out what the aliens and their city look like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Utopia: The Creation of a Nation , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
