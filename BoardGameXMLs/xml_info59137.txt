			<description>Each player plays a rabiit which moves around a game board. When a rabbit meets another rabbit, that one has to flip open the top card of his or her stack. If it is a carrot, it is lost - if it is an &amp;quot;&amp;Auml;tsch&amp;quot;-card, the &amp;quot;defensive&amp;quot; player gets a chance to receive a carrot. The stacks are arranged, so it is not random. On certain fields, player flip over the top card of their stack - if it is a carrot, it can be put into the home area. The first player to have a certain number of carrots in the home area is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
