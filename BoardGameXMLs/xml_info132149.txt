			<description>Age of the Clankomatics is a free customizable card game, set in a cyber punk world of mindless cyborgs, giant man eating plants, biplane squadrons and criminal samurai for hire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is usually played with two players, though there is a variant for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to destroy your opponents headquarters while trying to defend their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds, each player taking it in turns to play. During a round a player will deploy unit cards into their field of battle and attack their opponent. Once a player has worn down his opponent's forces, he can go in for the kill and attack his opponents HQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another element of the game are the special units, giant monsters and constructions that can only be brought into play if you have the resources. These cards are hard to deal with and prevent games from becoming a defensive stalemate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the cards played have a cost, and this cost is dealt with in a unique fashion. Each player has a number of power tokens, and when you play a card, you must give your opponent a number of tokens equal to the cost of the card. This way, if you play a very expensive card, you enable your opponent to match you on their turn. Play a very cheap card however, and you choke your opponents resources, limiting their options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
