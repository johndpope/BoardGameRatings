							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Omega the End Times Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Published by Forerunner Publishing a division of Friends of the Bridegroom, Inc, Omega the End Times Board Game is a game of knowledge (trivia question and answer) based on biblical eschatology. Trivia questions are based on knowledge of certain books of the New King James bible, such as Daniel, Matthew, and the Book of Revelation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board contains six colored tracks that extend from left to right along the rectangular game board. Each colored track corresponds to six colored playing pieces. Each player selects a colored playing piece and places it on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the player gets an opportunity to answer a trivia card question. If answered correctly, the player moves forward along the track and they get to draw special &amp;quot;oil&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;crown&amp;quot; cards that count for victory points at game end. The tracks have certain phases which represent passage of time. For example, the left most track section is the present, the middle of the track corresponds to the &amp;quot;tribulation period&amp;quot;, the end of the track corresponds to the &amp;quot;millennium&amp;quot;, etc.. The first player to reach a time-based stage causes all other players to immediately move forward to that stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win the game, a player must answer questions correctly allowing them changes to collect oil and crown cards that are worth points. When a player reaches the final stage of the track, all players get one more turn. Then card-points are added up to determine a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an educational game focused on the escatolagical teachings of Friends of the Bridegroom, Inc, AKA International House of Prayer, located in Kansas City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
