							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uncle Albrecht&#039;s Lab</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About two days ride East of Greyhawk, near the Western edge of the Cairn Hills, there is a small square tower. Built over 100 years ago for some lord or other, it was abandoned and reclaimed several times since. The most recent owner has been Albrecht Nimblenoodle, an altogether loopy Gnome wizard of no small power. Albrecht took possession of the tower 20 years ago and had it majorly refurbished as his lab and workshop. Over the years, he has slipped deeper and deeper into the grasp of madness and evil, and his experiments have gotten more and more dangerous. Albrecht&amp;rsquo;s latest experiment has resulted in his demise. He summoned an Erinyes devil and tried to negotiate a contract with it. He was not as skilled a negotiator as he had thought. His tower now contains a collection of undead, traps and outsiders waiting to be sprung on unsuspecting PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4th - 6th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
