							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bibi Blocksberg: Die verwunschenen Schl√ºssel</name>
									
			<description>The players try to get the keys to the sorcerer's castle to find Bibi Blocksberg's broom (Bibi Blocksberg is a witch from a well-known German children's series). They roll two dice and either add up the results or subtract one from the other and decide whether to use the roll or to pass it on to another player. The keys, which lie on certain fields of the board, have to be reached exactly to pick them up. The sorcerer is moved when certain results are rolled, and he picks up keys even when just passing them. At the end of the game, the party with most keys is the winner (sorcerer or players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
