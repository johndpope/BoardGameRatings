			<description>In this children's game, each player has a number bread crumbs that he should feed to the ducklings. There are five ducklings, each with a hidden colour (red, blue, green, yellow or orange).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns pressing the (electronic) mother duck. She'll either call a colour or quack. If she calls a colour, the player whose turn it is has to pick the duckling with the right colour. If he does so correctly, he may feed it a breadcrumb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the mother duck starts quacking, the player may move all the ducklings in the pond, until she stops quacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all his crumbs (by feeding them to the ducklings) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
