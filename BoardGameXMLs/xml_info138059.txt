			<description>Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue (known informally as Dangerous Dave 3) is a platform game developed by Gamer's Edge and published by Softdisk in 1993 for DOS computers. It is the sequel to Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion, and is also the first Dangerous Dave game to not be programmed by John Romero. This is because he, John Carmack, Adrian Carmack and Tom Hall had left Softdisk by this point to form id Software. It was followed by a sequel, Dave Goes Nutz!, which shares similar gameplay elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the previous title, Dangerous Dave is on a mission to save his little brother Delbert, this time from the evil &amp;quot;Dr. Nemesis&amp;quot; (who is also the main antagonist in Softdisk's Catacomb franchise).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dangerous Dave's Risky Rescue&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
