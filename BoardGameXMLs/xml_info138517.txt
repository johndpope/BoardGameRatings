							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Celtic Tales: Balor of the Evil Eye</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Celtic Tales: Balor of the Evil Eye, the player is the ruler of one of 18 tribes in Erie.  The player is tasked by the goddess Danu with the goal of becoming the High King of Erie by uniting the tribes, either through military action or diplomacy, and leading them in battle against Balor, leader of the Fomors.  The player leads a number of champions (and can recruit more champions as the opportunity arises) to a diverse range of tasks including improving and cultivating various provinces and engaging in a range of diplomatic and military actions.  Certain champions have access to magic spells that provide a range of advantages (increasing the cow population, or providing more wood to chop down, as well as helping in combat).  As champions act, they gain experience, improving their prowess, providing some RPG elements, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
