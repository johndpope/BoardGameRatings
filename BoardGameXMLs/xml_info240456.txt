			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever thought, &amp;quot;Huh, D&amp;amp;D is an amazing game, but I wish there was more of a game show element too it!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I didn't think so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that's okay! Because while &amp;quot;The Dangerous Game&amp;quot; does have the adventurers competing on a game show for a group of unsavory wizards, it is largely a wilderness survival adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your players against the horrors and shenanigans of The Island.  Will they become yet another failed group of adventurers picked up by the wizards? Or will they go on to win the grand prize?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dangerous Game is an adventure created for 4 3rd level characters, but this can easily be adjusted to fit your party better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
