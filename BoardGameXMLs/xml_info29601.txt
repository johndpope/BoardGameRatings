			<description>From the description on the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metagon is a game of skill in which chance plays a small part. It can be played by two, four or six players either singly, in pairs or teams of three. The components of the game are 36 different octagonal tiles or metagons and a playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Metagon is to gain tiles from the playing ground. This can be achieved in either of two ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The simplest way of winning tiles is to create a straight line with three adjacent tiles having the same coloured motifs in the same relative position on each tile. Lines may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. When a player has formed a straight line, he removes the two tiles placed earlier in the line and places these in a separate 'scoring stack', face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The second way of gaining tiles is to form a parallelogram by aligning the same coloured motifs on four tiles in the same relative position on each tile. Parallelograms may be any size and aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When a player has placed a parallelogram he removes the three tiles placed earlier and adds these to his scoring stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when players have placed all their playing stack tiles on the board.  The player with the most tiles in his scoring stack is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
