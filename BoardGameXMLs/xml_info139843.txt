							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Con</name>
									
			<description>The setting is a horror convention. Your goal is to get close enough to nab the guest of honor&amp;mdash;Desir&amp;eacute; Delamorte, your dream girl&amp;mdash;before the convention attendees discover that you're not just in costume. At game's end, one monster's going to get mobbed by con-goers. And one just might get away with the girl.&lt;br/&gt; Each deck contains 56 cards--that's four monster suits and a couple of extra-special cards. Each suit includes the monster itself, ten convention attendee cards, one Desir&amp;eacute; Delamort card, and one Flash Armstrong card (her sports star boyfriend).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to capture as many Desir&amp;eacute; Delamort cards as possible, while avoiding attendees of your own suit. You especially want to avoid the Flash Armstrong card; he riles up any suspicious attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, each monster has a special ability: Dracula's mesmeric gaze, Mummy's whirlwind, Werewolf's shape change, and Frankenstein's Monster's sheer strength, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add suits for monsters from the other decks in the series (Return of Monster Con, Son of Monster Con, and Monster Con: Cthulhu Pack), and you can play with as many as sixteen players! Each game also contains a pair of non-suited cards&amp;mdash;from &amp;quot;Sleeping in the Movie Room&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Necronomicon&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;to add their own twists to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4 decks include the original with Dracula, the Mummy, Frankie, and the Werewolf; the Return of Monster Con with the Amorphous Blob, Alien Changeling, Invisible Man, and Swampy; Son of Monster Con with the Bride of Frankenstein, Undertaker, Phantom of the Opera, and Ghost of Room 13, and; the Cthulhu Pack with the Cthulhu Cultist, Innsmuoth Cousin, Pickman's Apprentice, and Nyarlathotep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each deck, you can play with three or four people ages 13 and up. Playing time is about 30-45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
