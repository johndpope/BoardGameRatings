			<description>Fantastic Storytelling is a new card game which enables players to tell hilarious, unique stories and score points. Fantastic Storytelling is a brand new card game for telling unique, hilarious stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amateur and professional linguists alike can craft crazy, imaginative stories with the aim of making people laugh and scoring points - and it's as easy as laying down a few cards. The premise is simple - the longer your story is, the more points you score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines my love of writing, comedy and games into one little box, which enables players to create ridiculous, silly, funny and crazy stories. There are so many cards that no two stories will ever be alike! 360 professionally designed and printed cards, along with the instructions on how to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anybody can play, but due to some of the combinations that could arise whilst playing, it is recommended that players are 18+. You can play with 2-8 players, or even alone to try and improve your Fantastic Storytelling skills!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
