							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">KORE RPG Guidelines</name>
									
			<description>The KORE RPG is a universal system that can be used to create games in any genre.  From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KORE Guidelines are a complete set of Role-playing rules that can be used to imagine any world and play any genre of game. The flexibility of the rule-set was paramount in the creation of the guidelines. At each point, I continually asked myself if the game required this rule to be present or if it could be eliminated.  Some of the rules that were not necessary for the set to feel complete, but were elegant and loved by play testers, were allowed to remain under the optional category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
