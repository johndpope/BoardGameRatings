			<description>From the back of the package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mighty Overlord treading the path of legend needs strong leaders to oversee his many minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your Road to Legend Lieutenant tokens alive with 3D minis!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thaadd the Destroyer serves the Titan Warlord with his enormous bulk and strength. While leading a brigade of ogres, Thaadd makes short work of anything standing in his way. Armies, cities, heroes... it makes no difference, all must be destroyed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cost: 15.&lt;br/&gt;Avatar: Titan Only.&lt;br/&gt;Power: Hordes of the Things.&lt;br/&gt;Minions: 2 Ogres, 1 Master Ogre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities have their Defense rating reduced by one while under siege by him.  He has Reach and Knockback.  If he deals at least 1 damage to a hero (after applying armor), roll a black power die. If you roll a surge, the hero must choose and discard one of his equipped items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
