			<description>Showtime Presents: the great Cable Challenge. The Exciting New Game That Tests Your Skill (And Luck) As A Cable TV Operator!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a die and moving along the spaces on the board from &amp;quot;Franchise Hearing&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Launch&amp;quot; then on to &amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players landing upon &amp;quot;Cable Break&amp;quot; spaces must draw a cable break card and immediately carry out it's instructions. Some of these are to be used only after &amp;quot;Launch&amp;quot;. Upon landing on any of the four red spaces, a player must stop and end his or her turn. At his or her next turn, the direction that the&lt;br/&gt;Player must take will be determined by the roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the last red space on the board a player must stop and then, on each subsequent turn, roll the die continuously until reaching a combined total of 7 or 11. If 11 is exceeded the Player must wait until his or her next turn to try again. The first Player to reach the &amp;quot;Success&amp;quot; circle with no Cable Break Cards in his possession has met the Cable Challenge and wins the Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
