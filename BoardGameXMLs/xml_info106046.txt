							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Who Watches the Watch Fires?</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for the daring by Jonathan Roberts, converted for use with the AGE system by Josh Jarman.&lt;br/&gt;The watch fires of Friula warn against invaders, because Friula&amp;rsquo;s small army relies on the surrounding badlands to defend the city and its sparse farmland. Any attackers must cross treacherous hills and travel a road rife with blind gullies and steep canyons. Even a modest force can bleed aggressors white long before they reach the city gates&amp;mdash;but only with enough warning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A line of watch fires stands along the southern road to Starlight Keep and the Sticks of Trombei. At the first sign of an invasion, the guards light the fires, the city locks its gates, and the banners of Friula ride out to thwart the invading army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now, the watchfire keep has been taken by treachery, and your heroes discover the betrayal by chance. Can your heroes retake it in time&amp;mdash;and light the watch fires?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for beginning characters in the Midgard campaign setting, and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 pages including complete map. A set of high-resolution maps for this adventure is available for $2.99 from DriveThru RPG in the Fantastic Maps series by Jonathan Roberts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4th Edition D&amp;amp;D version of this adventure appears in Kobold Quarterly #18.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
