							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced Prestige Class: Night Hunter</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's never a priest around when you need one and even when they are they're highly unreliable. If their faith isn't strong enough you end up overrun by the vilest of creatures. Then there's the issue of dealing with the church bureaucracy just to get the job done. If only there was someone who was reliable and just as ruthless as the creatures they battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally there is. Enter the Night Hunter. This single-minded individual is not bogged down with issues of morality. Sometimes you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet and the Night Hunter is willing to do just that. The Night Hunter is an expert tracker and has an almost sixth sense when it comes to the creatures of the night. The other key to the Night Hunter's success is his versatility with weapons. Regardless of what the situation is the Night Hunter has the tool for the job and knows how to use&lt;br/&gt;it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
