			<description>Waterdeep and Skullport in the Age of &amp;AElig;ther&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1888 by Dale Reckoning, and the lands of Faer&amp;ucirc;n are in the throes of a techno-magical revolution. Ancient arcane lore mixes with cutting edge science, propelling the Realms into a new age: the Age of &amp;AElig;ther. Magical factories churn out marvelous wonders and modern conveniences, mighty locomotives and elegant airships cross nations in hours or days instead of weeks or months, and messages whispered across the &amp;aelig;ther bind distant lands together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And at the swirling center of this revolution: Waterdeep, the City of Splendors. Always a hub of trade, learning, and innovation, as well as vast criminal enterprises and supernatural conspiracies (past and present), the city plays host to the best and worst that the Realms have to offer. Sages and historians across Faer&amp;ucirc;n agree, the new age was set into motion in Waterdeep &amp;ndash; in the great melding pot where artisans, mages, scholars, and technologists from across Faer&amp;ucirc;n could meet, discuss, debate, and experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
