			<description>In this Princess-Lillifee-themed children's game players try to build garlands as long as possible for the unicorn's birthday party. To do so, players have to collect cards. The 36 cards consist of two parts of different colours (some of them have the same colour on both ends). Players take turns rolling the four colour dice. Dice are then grouped into pairs of two to determine which two cards the player is allowed to take (e.g. if a player rolls orange, yellow, green and green, he/she could take an orange-yellow card and a green-green one). If a player can't use a combination to get a card, he/she removes one card from the game instead. &lt;br/&gt;When all the cards have been distributed, players put together their own cardss like they would put together domino tiles, i.e. with matching ends next to one another. This part of the game is basically a solo puzzle activity.&lt;br/&gt;The player who manages to put together the longest &amp;quot;garland&amp;quot; (row of cards) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
