			<description>An alien race known as the Broskams have just finished their annual winter hibernation and there is only one thing on their minds, to get out of the hibernation cave and get some warmth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broskams is a 2-4 player card drafting, simultaneous action selection, tile laying and tile manipulation game that takes place over four rounds. The player with the most warmth points (victory points) at the end of the fourth round is the winner of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round, every player receives 6 cards that represents the different Broskams and each of their special powers. The players will draft these cards one at a time and pass the remaining to the players on their left (and right depending on the round) until they have a new hand of 6 cards. After that, the players will choose one of their 6 cards and reveal them simultaneously. Then, starting with the first player, everyone will use the card they revealed to either place one of their Broskams onto the board (leave the cave) or use the special ability printed on the card, moving their Broskams closer to the sun for more warmth points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
