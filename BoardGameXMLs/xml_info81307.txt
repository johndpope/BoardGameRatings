It's difficult and dangerous job, on way awaits them a lot of surprises and bad ambushes. Take the challenge! Lean more about the disappearance and more friends will join your team, the greater the chances to find Woody and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game&lt;br/&gt;Choose a player token and place it on the &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;To collect the biggest amount of tokens - points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Youngest player will start. You move by rolling the dice and collect token when moving. Every place on board has a token, until it is removed for some reason. Then the place get unactibe or contains a picture, which hold a surprise or a trap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STOP - think about things and miss a turn&lt;br/&gt;DICE+1 - Roll again to find Woody faster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 3 - step three extra steps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YELLOW STAR - take free token&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has many paths to choose from. Some tokens contains special abilities like extra move or one less move, which help you to collect more token when you move around the board. When the last token has been collected, it means, that Woody now has been found and the race to the finish line now begins. While the race is on to the finish, player who lands one the DICE+1 space, can roll the dice and that to the final score or move the number rolled ahead. The first one to reach the finish will get all unused tokens next to the game board. If there aren't any left, can roll dice and take the amount of tokens from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PS! Tokens with picture of Cowgirl, Woody and Buzz gives 2 points, while all the other ones 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count the score and the one with the biggest score is the winner and hero who saved Woody!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
