			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For as long as you can remember, you have been victims. Even after reducing the senseless attacks on nearby villages and trying to lead a peaceful, isolated life they still came. Every few weeks another group of &amp;ldquo;heroes&amp;rdquo; would barge in to your lair just because it was there, and they would not hesitate to try and kill everyone in sight and take all the precious things you&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to collect. Sometimes your clan was able to beat them back, but other times you simply weren&amp;rsquo;t so lucky. When your clan is going on their ninth chieftain in the last six months, you know you have a problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the time you and your group of warriors were there to try and fight them, and sometimes you managed to kill one or two of them before having to inevitably retreat, but now it&amp;rsquo;s different. It&amp;rsquo;s as if they waited for you - the clan&amp;rsquo;s latest and most highly trained protectors - to leave on a routine scouting trip so they can waltz in and ravage your lair. The ninth chieftain and the remainder of your clan didn&amp;rsquo;t stand a chance this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enough is enough! Your clan may have been decimated (again) and your latest leader may be dead, but there is no way you are going to let these paltry &amp;ldquo;heroes&amp;rdquo; get away with it this time. It&amp;rsquo;s time to go in there to take your lair back, and show these gutless intruders what a proud, fearless kobold is truly capable of!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revenge of the Kobolds is a Dungeon and Dragons&amp;trade; 4th Edition &amp;ldquo;challenge&amp;rdquo; adventure designed for between four and six 1st level characters. This adventure is designed similar in concept to the Lair Assault series of mini-adventures published by Wizards of the Coast. It is designed to be used within a single game session with characters specifically made for this challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure the players are all kobolds who return to their lair only to find it occupied by &amp;ldquo;heroes&amp;rdquo;. They must reclaim their home by killing every intruder they find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
