			<description>Grab your digging tools and prepare for Gem Rush, an easy-to-learn, 1-6 player blitz to build a magical gem mine. Use your gem cards to construct new rooms, and use the rooms to replenish your gems. Race your friends for fortune in rush mode, or work together to save the mine in crisis mode. Either way, you've got to dig fast and manage your gems carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gem Rush: Second Edition includes:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;   A bright new graphics facelift for the rooms, gems, characters, skills, and even the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;   Play alongside your friends in Cooperative Mode, or see who the best dwarf is in Competitive Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;   New magical gems including Echoglass, Orichalcum, and Warpstone -- each with properties that impact a sagacious player's strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;   Player Skill cards so each dwarf wields an individual special ability which helps them compete. Includes dwarven poetry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
