							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World of Aden: Thunderscape</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;World of Aden: Thunderscape is a swords &amp;amp; sorcery computer role-playing game for DOS. It had a sequel called Entomorph. The game is based on the world described in the fantasy trilogy World of Aden: Thunderscape. The player controls a party with up to six members with skills, spells and equipment.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The world of the Thunder Age has a distinctly steampunk feel. The world has recently-and drastically-changed from medieval swords-and-sorcery to a mixed renaissance and Industrial Revolution tech level. Flintlocks and muskets are the best weapons an adventurer can hope for, but there are extremely expensive, very powerful machine guns called &amp;quot;storm cannons.&amp;quot; The world has also recently fallen under the effects of the &amp;quot;Darkfall&amp;quot;, an event causing thousands of demons or &amp;quot;nocturnals&amp;quot; to enter the world, along with Corrupted, those who have made a deal with the forces of the Darkfall for power-and usually a curse of some sort.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;World of Aden: Thunderscape&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
