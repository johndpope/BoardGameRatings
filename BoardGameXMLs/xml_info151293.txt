							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terra Mystica: Acrylic Overlay Set</name>
									
			<description>This laser cut accessory fits precisely over the top of your faction player mat, providing spaces for each building, power disc bowl, ship and shovel level. In addition, each overlay comes with an innovative interchangeable corner section allowing for the 2 &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; factions that are dramatically different than the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each set is comprised of 5 Bases, 5 standard Faction Corners, and 1 each of Mermaid and Fakir Faction Corners. All of the components are laser cut from 3mm Acrylic and may contain a protective film/paper on one or both sides that is easily removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- - - We have been made aware of thickness variability in the production process of Acrylic. Normally this would not be an issue as each overlay or tracker was its own independent entity. However, with this overlay implementing interchangeable parts it is conceivable that you might notice it. Even though we are attempting to cut each set from the same sheet, the variations still persist, so there really isn't anything to be done except let you know about the potential cosmetic inconsistencies. - - -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
