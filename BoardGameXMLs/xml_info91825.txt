			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Double Dragon (Neo-Geo)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Dragon (ダブルドラゴン?) is a 1995 fighting game spinoff of the Double Dragon series developed and published by Technos Japan. It is based on the 1994 Double Dragon movie, which in turn was based on the original arcade game. It was originally released for the Neo Geo (in AES and MVS formats) and later released for the Neo Geo CD and PlayStation (the latter ported by Urban Plant). It was Technos Japan's last Double Dragon game before the company went out of business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays like a conventional fighting game of its time, that is battles are one-on-one and conducted on best two-out-of-three matches. One of the unique aspects of Double Dragon is the lack of specific punch and kick buttons like most fighting games. Instead, there are four attack buttons of varying strength and speed, which can perform punches or kicks depending on the character's position. The player's character and his opponent have a super move meter called the &amp;quot;charge meter&amp;quot;, which is overlaid on the character's remaining health. The less health the character has, the quicker it will fill up. &amp;quot;Charge moves&amp;quot; are usually performed by executing the command of a regular special move and pressing two attack buttons simultaneously at the end instead of just one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
