			<description>Deus Ex: Invisible War (or Deus Ex 2) is a first-person video game developed by Ion Storm Inc. and published by Eidos Interactive. Released simultaneously for Windows and the Xbox video game console on December 2, 2003, the game is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Deus Ex. Invisible War was well-received commercially, holding 80 and 84 scores at Metacritic for the Windows and Xbox versions, respectively, and selling more than 300,000 copies in North America. Despite this, the game's critical reception was not as positive as its predecessor's for example, PC Gamer gave Deus Ex a score of 94%, while Invisible War received an 83%. This was due to a large number of design choices, which led certain critics to label the game as being dumbed down from its predecessor. It has sold more than 1.2 million copies, as of April 23, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invisible War takes place twenty years after Deus Ex, in a world being rebuilt after a catastrophic event called The Collapse. Following a terrorist attack that destroys the city of Chicago, the player assumes the role of Alex D, a trainee at the fictional Tarsus Academy, whose support is sought by several organizations. As the game progresses, the player learns of conspiratorial factions which seek to drastically change the world. Invisible War was designed to allow player choice in both plot and gameplay, with branching plot lines and emergent gameplay elements. This freedom of choice was widely praised by critics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Deus ex invisible war , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
