			<description>SAVAGE WAR OF PEACE is a solitaire game of Combat during the French-Algerian War (1954-1962). The player assumes the role of a commander of combined French forces in Algeria. As commander, you are responsible for securing your Area of Operations (AOR) by successfully conducting various military operations in order to locate and destroy the enemy. Although there are many units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;The objective of SAVAGE WAR OF PEACE is to successfully complete a number of missions and destroy enemy forces in order to gain Victory Points (VP) for the French Forces. The player can choose to play a short game (4 Missions), an average game (6 Missions), a long game (8 Missions) or a full Tour (12 Missions). Once all Missions have been resolved (successfully or not) the Player totals his VP and compares this with the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
