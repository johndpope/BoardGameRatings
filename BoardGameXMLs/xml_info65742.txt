			<description>Trivoli is a compelling and simple game in which the whole family will enjoy! The game offers two magnificent structure excellent game, only to turn around the carousel and you can play another game on a another board. Rotate the carousel turn one level and try to make our own secret character or picture. Beware, however, from establishing a false picture, which you may help another player win! The game teaches 3D and logical thinking in a way that makes the child want to play the game again and again! Winner is the one who get the picture together first or the the other side of the carousel!&lt;br/&gt;The game is played like this: you have a six sided classical dice with three circles on each side. One of those is painted black: the one in the middle, second or the most outside one. And each painted circle is twice on hat dice.&lt;br/&gt;Rolling that dice decides which part of the carousel you can turn.&lt;br/&gt;Then you watch the picture you got at the beginning, and see, if you can create that by turning the rolled circle around the center. If you succeed creating that picture, you get one chip from the center bowl. Get the most of these to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
