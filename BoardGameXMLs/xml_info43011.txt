							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robotico</name>
									
			<description>Robotico is the rethemed and reworked version of Politico, Small Box Games' first released game, and more than just the name has changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Robotico, players are in charge of factories and are attempting to manufacture the latest and greatest robots to work in their factories.  Players have two actions: Manipulate or Fabricate, and the number of actions they get for the round depends on what the other players secretly choose to do.  There are a limited number of robots available, and all players need them for their factories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differences between Robotico and Politico:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of players has been streamlined&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Manipulate action (formerly the card action) hinges on a card combination system, nearly doubling the original number of unique special actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game now ends when all of the current model cards have been revealed, with players earning points for the robots they Fabricated OR when a player has acquired 13 robots, with at least one of each type, whichever comes first(which eliminates the back and forth drag found in Politico).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robotico is not compatable with Politico, they are two separate games that share a common mechanic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
