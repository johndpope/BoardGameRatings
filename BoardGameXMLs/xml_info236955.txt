							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3Deep Core Rules (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3Deep is a fast and simple role playing game intended to allow play in any world setting but designed to emulate the episode structure of classic TV and movie Sci Fi and Fantasy. It does this by making even beginning characters capable of handling the great variety of situations that the plot lines and story arcs can throw at a character or team of characters. 3Deep&amp;rsquo;s flexibility means that you can play in any genre world from medieval fantasy through the modern age to Sci Fi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the design criteria for 3Deep is that all the rules needed to play should be able to be contained on a single side of paper and only require the most common of dice. These single sheets can be found at the back of this book. One sheet covers the core rules for normal play and the second is for the solo rpg rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
