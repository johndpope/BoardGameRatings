			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t stand the heat&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When this place opened it was packed three meals a day, but lately things have gotten a bit slow. A few two-star Yelp reviews and a new bistro owned by a celebrity chef have driven most of your customers away. Management isn&amp;rsquo;t talking, but there have been rumors that the mysterious owners are planning to shut the place down if the money doesn&amp;rsquo;t start rolling back in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s late on a Friday afternoon and every table in the restaurant is booked for the entire weekend. The wild stories about VIPs and food critics can&amp;rsquo;t possibly be true, but nervous excitement spreads through the kitchen staff to the front of the house, from busboys to bartenders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cooks prep their stations with furious speed; the Chef is everywhere at once to double-check the spices in each dish. The servers meticulously memorize the specials while polishing flatware until it sparkles. The bar staff stocks up on fruit and ice, dusting the liquor bottles and lining clean glasses on the bar like ammunition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is this the restaurant&amp;rsquo;s last chance to prove it can still turn tables and make money before they close the doors for good? Will this weekend be a culinary miracle or just another horrible FIASCO?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
