			<description>&amp;quot;This exciting and realistic finance and investment game is the first computer based economic game in the world. Economic thinking together with the computer`s flexibility in programming give maximum freedom to the players to plan the accumulation of millions. With the electronic computer, the haphazard chance of &amp;quot;rags to riches&amp;quot; is replaced by skill and judgment. The player who learns the value of economic planning will most likely win the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trading simulation game from the 70's in which players use an included &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; to generate stock data used to see how successful their investments become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
