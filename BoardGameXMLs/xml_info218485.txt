			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When high school students break into a mysterious lab, they are caught in an explosive accident which endows them with powers to interact in the universe beyond its standard three dimensions. With the ability to become undetectable and able to bypass physical barriers, they embarked on an exciting but short-lived career of crime. When SCHRODINGER was arrested her partner, TESSERACT, laid low. A few years later, SCHRODINGER was offered a deal for freedom. She would use her unique abilities to assist authorites in taking down other &amp;quot;untouchable&amp;quot; super beings. Anything was better than lock-up, so she agreed. Shortly afterward, her suspected partner-in-crime came forward as a new hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCHRODINGER &amp;amp; TESSERACT are two very unpredictable heroes able to defy and break physics in numerous ways from being invisible and intangible, to seeing around corners, to manipulating four-dimensional objects in ways that radically impact the three-dimensional world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...And maybe the occasional item might end up in a dimensional pocket. No one will miss it, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
