							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dragon&#039;s Hoard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire and Gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first trilogy of White Box Adventures reaches its fiery climax with The Dragon's Hoard, an adventure for between six and eight characters of 7th to 9th level for Swords &amp; Wizardry WhiteBox!. After defeating the wererats of Willowford and discovering the terrible secret of the Nameless Wizard in his hidden tower, a band of brave heroes must brave the volcanic flaming pass and challenge an ancient red dragon and his fire giant army! The fate of Willow Valley is in their hands! Featuring new monsters, devious traps and a climactic finale to the story which began in The Wererat's Well and continued in The Wizard's Tower, this adventure can be played as a close to the trilogy or stand completely on its own. Can you brave the Keep of the Flaming Pass and claim the dragon's hoard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
