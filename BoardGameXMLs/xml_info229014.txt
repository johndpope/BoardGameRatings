							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Quest for Fire</name>
									
			<description>A One-Round Living City Tournament Set in Procampur&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A letter was sent to the Thultyrl from a priest of Kossuth requesting permission to build a shrine in the Temple District. As with all other requests of this nature, the request was denied pending proper submission through the Quorum of Temples. The response received was unacceptable, especially since a shrine to his most-hated rival was already supported within the city. So a curse was placed upon the city: All those who venerate the name of Istishia will lose the privilege of fire. It is up to the PCs to appease Kossuth and bring fire back to Procampur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
