			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast, Furious Fun&amp;hellip; in the Far Future!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A mini-sand box for High-Space!  Set on a space station above The Remnant, this game-in-can introduces your heroes into the dog-eat-alien world of prospecting for artifacts in The Lantern Nebula.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The public view-screen in the Altitude Bar showed the red and purple haze of the local nebula as a gorgeous backdrop to the Dalliance, as it slipped into its docking bay. Inside the Dalliance, Captain Gerrad Pang was in a foul mood yet again. &amp;lsquo;Why does that pre-pubescent bastard rockhumper always beat me to the Remnant? I swear the universe has put a curse on me!&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Because you are both slow, and stupid,&amp;rsquo; Bonaparte spat back at him. &amp;lsquo;I would not need all the time you take to prep for launch. Why all the systems checks? Are you a coward?&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Shut up, you stupid computer. You are not even a real intelligence. You are artificial. What would you know? If the life support fails it is not you who will freeze to death!&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;Not for the first time that day, Gerrad wished that he had enough capital to replace the starship&amp;rsquo;s positronic core. Maybe he would have... if that young bastard didn&amp;rsquo;t keep beating him to the best finds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Hurry up and dock already,&amp;rsquo; Gerrad continued. &amp;lsquo;There&amp;rsquo;s someone in the Altitude that I really need to speak to...&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Euphoria is a Game-in-a-Can scenario presented by Storyweaver Productions, and is an excellent way to start gaming in the setting of The Lantern, using the High-Space rules. This adventure is centered around the notorious Altitude Bar on Euphoria, the space-station which orbits above The Remnant - the unstable, broken planet once home to ancient civilizations and now the stalking ground of treasure seekers and artifact hunters alike! This module details the Altitude Bar and other sections of Euphoria, and provides NPC characters and starship descriptions to help kick-start your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is not linear in the way it progresses. Rather, it is a &amp;lsquo;sandbox&amp;rsquo; in which your heroes will adventure. But there is a time constraint... inevitably, the Remnant will undergo a &amp;lsquo;shift&amp;rsquo; that unearths a sizable portion of new land, drawing scavengers and relic hunters like bees to honey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aliens!&lt;br/&gt;Synthetics!&lt;br/&gt;Gadgets!&lt;br/&gt;Starships!&lt;br/&gt;Space battles!&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Turmoil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
