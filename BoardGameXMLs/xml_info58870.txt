			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Alchemy is typically a perplexing art for common folk in a fantasy setting. In any world where the majority of people must toil to survive, the idea of someone&amp;rsquo;s life work being to stand around boiling liquids and talking about the &amp;lsquo;essense of rare matter&amp;rsquo; is quite alien to them. Alchemists in a fantasy world are rarely considered anything other than strange folk with ways that set them apart from the rest of society. Of course, this is not always the case. The first time an invading band of humanoids is turned aside by thunderstones and tanglefoot bags, the alchemist responsible might find himself very popular indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the tenth book of the Power Classes series from Mongoose Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20 system game, each of these mini-supplements introduces an entirely new core character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all-new low cost.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
