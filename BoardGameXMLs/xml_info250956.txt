							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle of the Holy Sands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perched on a cliff that overlooks the desert lands to the west, the Castle of the Holy Sands was once the stronghold of an order of Paladins. The corruption of their leader by a demon led to in-fighting and then extinction. The ruins of the castle stand there to this day, outliving its builders by centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 20 x 30 map depicting the ruins of a large castle in a dry, arid, desert environment. Wide sandstone steps wind up the side of the castle, overlooked by high walls. The castle is entered via a ruined gatehouse, with an inner bailey surrounded by the remains of delapidated buildings, some with fine floors hinting at their previous glory. The castle is on a high cliff, although those willing to scale the cliffs will find the walls have collapsed in places, allowing entry that bypasses the gatehouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
