			<description>Finally! The innovate action-puzzle game that you've been waiting for. Amazingly simple yet insanely addictive, once you start you won't be able to stop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed specifically for the iPod/iPhone touchscreen. Match 4 or more pieces of the same colour by rotationg layers on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every piece you match reduces your quota for that color, progress through each level by making enough matches to reduce all quotas to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It sounds easy, but as you complete each level the quota increases and the timebar decreases at a faster rate. So you'll need all your skill and concentration to keep going.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Unique and addictive gameplay&lt;br/&gt;-An intuitive control scheme designed specifially fr the iPhone touch screen&lt;br/&gt;-Endless hours of replayability&lt;br/&gt;-Special pieces, such as bombs and locks enhance the gameplay and strategy needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
