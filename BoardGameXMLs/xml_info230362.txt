			<description>Publishers' Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game, you and your friends play as comic-book heroes, either from the pages of Sentinel Comics or from your own imagination! Join forces against terrible villains and fight in dangerous environments, all in a tabletop roleplaying game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game &amp;ndash; Starter Kit comes with everything you need to play your first entire super-heroic campaign! This starter kit comes with a ton of information and gameplay content across thirteen booklets. The first booklet is the Gameplay Guide, which includes all of the rules of both how to play a hero for the individual players, and also how to run adventures, for whoever will be the Game Master, a.k.a. the GM. This booklet will teach players, regardless of their familiarity level with roleplaying games, and make the learning process for playing the Sentinel Comics RPG quick, simple, and straightforward. The next six booklets are all character folios - a separate hero sheet booklet for each member of the Freedom Five, plus one more for their former intern Unity! The character folio booklets will not only present the character sheet for each hero, but also teach how each portion of the hero sheets are used, and how that sheet relates to the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt; The last six booklets are the most exciting. Each is a complete adventure, aimed at both teaching Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game through actual play and also telling the story of Sentinel Comics, in the aftermath of the Sentinels of the Multiverse card game. These adventures will introduce game mechanics and also notable characters and locations. They will tell a story that is engaging but also allows the players to take part in telling the story and advancing the plot. The six adventure booklets each act as a complete issue of a comic, with all six of them telling a self-contained story arc. By the end of the last issue, players will have braved dangerous environments, fought deadly foes, and (hopefully) foiled the plot of one of the most notable villains from the pages of Sentinel Comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
