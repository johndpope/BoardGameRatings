			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xcrawl, the game that got expelled from college for throwing a spring break anhkhegger, is back! Now powered by the mighty Pathfinder gaming engine, Xcrawl is more fun than ever! Maximum Xcrawl: Studio City Crawl is just a tiny taste of all the amazing adventures to come. Strap on your sword, call your agent, and get ready for victory and a lifetime of red carpet interviews and Scrooge McDuck money, or defeat and death, or worse: a one-way ticket back your old job at the mall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for Pathfinder characters of levels 6-8. In the Studio City Crawl, the players take on the roles of a group of seasoned Xcrawl adventurers challenging a dungeon as a newly minted team. While there are dozens of individual crawls across the Empire, this is the first time one has been held in Studio City, making this a historic event. If the team performs well in Studio City, then this could be their ticket to the big time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Studio City Crawl is a one level fully-lethal exhibition event. Five teams are challenging the dungeon, one after another. All teams that complete the entire dungeon shall are brought to the stage after the competition, and the audience is asked to clap for their favorite. A massive &amp;ldquo;Clap-O-Meter&amp;rdquo; is brought out, and whichever team receives the loudest applause is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
