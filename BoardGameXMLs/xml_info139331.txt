							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Progress?</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;In this game you pit your wits against chance, disease, moneylenders and an unjust world. Even survival is a success, but which of you will make most PROGRESS up the social ladder.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes the part of one family, consisting of 3 characters. Each family starts out as a labouring family, but by hard work, saving and a lot of luck, may afford to get one member of their family a better job. By advancing each member of the family, the players try to progress to the top of the social ladder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A family game for 2-6 players, produced by Traidcraft, a UK charitable organisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
