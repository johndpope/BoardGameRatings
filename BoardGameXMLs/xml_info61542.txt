							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Jalan</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of Jalan is a self-contained StarCluster RPG game. The Book of Jalan is set on the world Jalan, a world settled by Homo Erectus a million years ago, through the agency of the alien Seeders. The people of Jalan have evolved a powerful psionics based magic, vastly greater than that of the humans of the rest of the Cluster. As a result, the greatest Power in the Cluster, SaVaHuTa, has declared Jalan off limits to any contact. Small teams of deep-cover scientists observe the natives, who have developed a technology approximately that of the Renaissance to Regency period on Earth - matchlock and wheellock black powder guns, huge ocean going sailing ships, and pervasive magical influences. SavaHuTa dares not let these powers out into the Cluster, but by it's own rules, it must open up Jalan once a practical steam technology is available, and that day is coming very close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of Jalan is a single book containing everything needed to run a campaign on Jalan, and is interoperable with all StarCluster 2 products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
