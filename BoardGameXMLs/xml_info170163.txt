			<description>Kids vs Goblins is an action adventure game for the iPad. Players take on the role of three children, stranded on an island as they look for their kidnapped baby brother. The kids take on the twisted goblins, former humans corrupted by magical stones of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each kid has a set of magical spells they can use to defeat the goblins, but they can only carry a few spells at a time. With more than 60 spells to unlock there are many difficult choices to make, keeping the gameplay fresh and interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover six beautifully realized 3d levels, each with a host of different missions for hours of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
