			<description>&amp;quot;Zit-Zingo:  The Travel Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions:  Game is played like Bingo.  Players watch for objects along the road and cross them off on cards.  First player to mark five objects in a row is winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When younger children play, change rules so that first object seen by all players goes to first player; second object to second; etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may try for Double-Zingo (two lines of five in a row, Triple-Zingo, or even Grand-Zingo - entire card filled&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variation of the game for two players is for each player to be assigned one side of the road - players place a check mark on their card as objects are seen.  Time or mileage limit is set and player having most check marks on his card is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
