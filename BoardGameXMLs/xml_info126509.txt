			<description>Pathological gets your friends and family laughing with hilarious explanations to get you out of sticky situations! You start by drawing a situation where you wouldn't necessarily want to tell the truth, and then you wager how many words of different points you think you can fit into your tall tale, and then you weave a story using the words you've drawn to explain your way out of the situation. You get to keep the points you've drawn if more people think your lie is a good one than don't. It's great for parties and family game nights where everyone wants to have some good light-hearted fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
