			<description>This game is played with a deck of standard playing cards. An equal number of cards are dealt to each player but not all the cards. Then tricks are played, and during the game trump is selected. The goal of the game is not to win face cards, i.e. the player who reaches 31 points worth of face cards loses a life counter (everyone starts with 3 of those). Losing the last life counter means that player is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
