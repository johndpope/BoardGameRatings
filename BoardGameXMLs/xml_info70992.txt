							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demonface Killer</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When battle hardened soldiers lose their nerve and the bravest of mystics cower in fear, there is only one place left to turn. The Demonface Killer is a ruthless hunter who devotes his entire existence to ending the existence of others. Demons, devils, evil spirits and mortal foes of every stripe fall before the ferocious assault of this deadly combatant. There are unnatural horrors in the world that even the most fearless warriors hesitate to face. There are savage war chiefs whose brutality deters even the most determined foe. There are kings and spellcasters so well guarded that no one would dare move against them. No one, except the demon faced. These hunters of the damned are unflinching and without remorse. No one is safe from a Demonface Killer who has been properly motivated. Anyone who dares to get between a Demonface Killer and his target is quickly rewarded with a painful death. This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All the information to play a Demonface Killer prestige class in your NeoExodus or other home setting.&lt;br/&gt;     All New Demonface Killer Feats including Fist of the Cursed Dragon and Neckbreaker&lt;br/&gt;     Demonface Killer counters for miniature games&lt;br/&gt;     NeoExodus: A House Divided Initiative Card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
