							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galactic Fighter (1981)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On patrol in your Galactic Fighter you encounter wave after wave of alien attack craft, trying to penetrate your defenses and attack your home planet.  If you let any ships slip past you, the enemy will send another squadron of the same type of ship.  After each attack wave, a space tanker will try to rendezvous and refuel your fighter.  Each squadron is worth more points, but each attack wave has more ships.  How long can you hold out?  Color and sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
