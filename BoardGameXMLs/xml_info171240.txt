							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dirigible</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, 16 x 10 inch map of a Dirigible, and includes the VTT (Virtual Table top) files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Damn, the Allies attempt to seize our blimp! You there, stop them! Nothing can halt our advance towards the bomb drop site. Death to London!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take to the air and float into the skies above with our dirigible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dirigible is a single interior map of a gondola undercarriage attached to the bottom of the blimp&amp;rsquo;s airbag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dirigible is intended for historical, pulp, steampunk, and modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zeppelin Terror: The Nazis decide to send a new weapon of terror during the Battle of Britain. A zeppelin with a payload of bombs in the luggage section! The crew is an experienced Luftwaffe pilot with a crew of eleven Fallschirmjaeger paratroopers equipped with Luger pistols, Messer gravity knives, and parachutes. The zeppelin is escorted by a fleet of Messerschmitt Bf 110 Zerstorer fighter bombers whose orders are to get the zeppelin to London by blasting any Spitfires out of the sky with any surviving Messerschmitts dropping their payload at that time. This daring nighttime raid must not succeed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters can play as Spitfire pilots trying to blow up the Messerschmitts and get to the zeppelin and/or the paratroopers that are sent up in a cargo plane to board the zeppelin. With the zeppelin over England, they are ordered to capture the zeppelin rather than destroy it since if it crashes it may be worse than the Hindenburg disaster. With the Allies closing in, the Nazis try and hold them off and drop their payload before their pilot changes the trajectory of the zeppelin down towards London!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
