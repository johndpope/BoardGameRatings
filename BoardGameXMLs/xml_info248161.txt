			<description>A fun and educational geography game of Ontario!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geoscope is the original geography series of games that offer a visual representation of our world. The games are exciting to play and fun to learn on the gameboard maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In series 007/009, Ontario, the players get to know the province through the race along the path from the southernmost region to the northernmost area using &amp;quot;Place&amp;quot; cards, which tell you about the city you've landed on and advance you forwards, and &amp;quot;Chance&amp;quot; cards, which contain trivia about the Ontario and the board itself. Get the answer to a Chance card wrong, and you'll move backwards to the closest safe space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the first player to reach Polar Bear Provincial Park at Winisk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
