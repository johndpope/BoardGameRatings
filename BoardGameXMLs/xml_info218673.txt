							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World At War 85: When the Lion Roars</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When The Lion Roars is the SEVENTH volume in the World At War 85 Series of games of fast and furious platoon-level combat. The series is set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III. With the Warsaw Pact armies driving deep into Western Europe, and as China simultaneously decides to take advantage of the global distraction to settle some old territorial scores, the Middle East erupts as well. Israel launches a pre-emptive strike to deflate yet another attempt by the Syrians to re-conquer the Golan Heights. But the Syrians have rebuilt their army in the three years since they were defeated in Lebanon by these same Israelis. And the Syrian High Command has anticipated such a move by the Israelis. They have developed a counter-strategy with a simple goal: drive the Israeli Army into the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;br/&gt; The World At War 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, formation activation, random turn length, close air support and air cover are all smoothly integrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Basic, Advanced and, for each Volume, Optional Rules.&lt;br/&gt;     Units include:&lt;br/&gt;         ISRAELI Merkava-2 Main Battle Tank&lt;br/&gt;         ISRAELI F-4E Close Air Support Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;         SYRIAN T-72 Main Battle Tank&lt;br/&gt;         SYRIAN MIG-23 Air Cover Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;         SOVIET AIR ASSAULT Infantry&lt;br/&gt;         SOVIET MI-24E Attack Helicopter&lt;br/&gt;         US MARINE CORPS M-60 Main Battle Tank&lt;br/&gt;         US NAVY F-14 Close Air Support Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;         &amp;hellip;and many more.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
