			<description>Easy to Use&lt;br/&gt;Standard Windows interface&lt;br/&gt;No-hassle networking&lt;br/&gt;Share files easily &amp;mdash; even drag from your browser onto the tabletop!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kitchen table&amp;quot; licensing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System Embracing&lt;br/&gt;Any game you can play on your physical tabletop&lt;br/&gt;Easy-to-use, yet robust and powerful dice roller&lt;br/&gt;Play the latest indie game, your favorite OSR clone, or your own homebrew system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like a Real Table!&lt;br/&gt;Move and sort virtual dice on the tabletop - play Dogs in the Vineyard online&lt;br/&gt;Index cards, tokens, virtual miniatures, and text objects&lt;br/&gt;Draw on a virtual wet-erase battlemap or import your favorite map images&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Philosophy&lt;br/&gt;EpicTable is about keeping groups together and building new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve that, we believe that it's important to get out of the way&amp;mdash;to make the virtual tabletop as fast and easy to use as your physical tabletop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's why we use a centralized messaging system to avoid networking configuration issues, why we handle all the transfer of images and other data for you transparently, and why we don't try to do a lot of rules automation that forces you to do a lot of prep for the sake of the tool instead of for your players and your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
