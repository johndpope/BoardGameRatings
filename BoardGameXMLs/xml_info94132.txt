			<description>The globe's major powers have turned a state of emergency in the wake of extremist attacks into a strike for freedom, merging their weapons resources and technologies into a clandestine project entitled Operation Phoenix. In control of the most advanced Gun-Ship technology, you're the best shot the free world has for peace. Your objective is clear: Resolve All Situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Fast 3D arcade action based on military campaigns involving ultra-realistic vehicles and massive sprawling environments&lt;br/&gt;    * Customize your chopper with hell-fire missiles, shockwave bombs, chain guns, and other weapons of destruction&lt;br/&gt;    * Players can compete against one another in multiplayer mode over Deathmatch landscapes or join forces in battles against armies of advanced enemy AI&lt;br/&gt;    * Missions take place in diverse areas all over the world -- the Middle East, Africa, Alaska, Panama&lt;br/&gt;    * Passage of day to night and changing weather effects such as rain, snow, sandstorms and fog all contribute to heightened combat tension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
