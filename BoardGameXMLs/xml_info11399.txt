			<description>Black Gold (Texas Tea), the sister game Mississippi Banzai , is yet another in XTR's many alternate-history wargames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one takes its cue from the post WW2 oddness of Tomorrow the World.  It's 1948 in the alternative-world where the Germans and Japanese won WW2, conquering our entire planet. Now they intend to square off against each other in one final night-marish showdown for world domination. The Japanese resolve to strike first, launching a 110-division offensive into the German Middle East. Their goal is to smash through Persia and seize the vital Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil fields. German missiles, Japanese Commandos, the Mahdi and his Moslem insurgents, German P-1101 jets, Maus heavy tanks, .. See what your super-elite Emporer's Loyal Hebrew's tanks can do to the vaunted Storm trooper Division Gobbels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with a 20 page rule book, and alternative history, 300 counters representing divisions, regiments and air attack wings and includes Beginner's and Advanced rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also interesting to note that this game depicts a battle in Iraq &amp;amp; Kuwait, at the same time of the real Gulf War is in progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
