							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">They Met in a Tavern</name>
									
			<description>An Old School One-Shot Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Met In A Tavern is a single set-piece scenario which includes four pre-generated characters. It was originally written for one shot or convention use. Notes are also included for using the content in an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;About a day&amp;rsquo;s journey by loaded wagon from a good sized trading city, at the edge of a small farming community, sits a moderately successful inn and tavern called The Merchant&amp;rsquo;s Rest. Due to an unlikely confluence of circumstances, four exceptional people with as many reasons to mistrust each other as they have to cooperate, are about to be caught up in a tide of violence and dark sorcery which will threaten not only their own lives but those of the local populace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
