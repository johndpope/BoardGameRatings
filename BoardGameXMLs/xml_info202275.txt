			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BaRPG is the unholy result of a one-night stand between a drinking game and  card based RPGs. From the side of RPG, BaRPG has inherited a melange of exciting characters to play, a definitely sexy level system, dice-rolling and booty (Err&amp;hellip; I mean epic loot!). From drinking games, it has inherited a series of ridiculous games that will keep you drinking. Though in the end there will be a clear winner, we like to think the true prize is in the friends you will make along the way&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played between 3 to 7 players. Each player receives a character card, and a level and damage tracking card. Every round all players (except whoever last levelled up) roll a dice, highest roll then checks if what was rolled is higher than their current level. If so, that player levels up, reads out their character's power (which is a drinking game), and the group then plays that game. At the end of the game, someone will have to take 'drinks' as well as take damage. The game then enters a market round, where players can 'buy' additional item cards. These item cards can be used at any time during the game, and can either assist players or thwart the efforts of others. The game then returns to a new round of dice rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach level 6 wins, and yes there is even an item that can be played against another player to put him/her back to level 1. There are in total 10 characters with associated games, and these characters will swap during the game as part of the item card mechanics. Additionally, losing a total of 4 'sober' (damage) points will also return the player to level 1, force them to change their character, and lose all accumulated items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
