			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, that's right. Not being able to win is a feature! The problem with nearly all village sims is you tend to reach an inevitable point where you can't lose the game. You just become to skilled at knowing exactly what to do, and in exactly what order, the game loses all of it's appeal and you run off to play something else. That's not the case with Castles! Castles aims to make a game you can't win. Every day, the game gets progressively harder with no end in sight. The goal of the game isn't to win, but to survive as long as humanly possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survival&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Castles, you'll find yourself in a harsh and unforgiving environment, constantly trying to find new ways to keep your little villagers alive for just a few more days. But eventually, you will lose. As you play, you'll unlock more content, like additional buildings, items and units you can use in your next attempt to see if you can survive even longer than the last!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build a village... and die trying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major part of the game is village management, and trying to discover new and creative ways to keep yourself alive as long as possible. In Castles, you will plan many days in advance how you're going to build your village and survive the inevitable onslaught of the monsters that will attack you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Addition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been developed by Raymond Doerr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
