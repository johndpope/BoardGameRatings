			<description>To bear the Templar's Curse guarantees its wielders will end up in Hell when they fade from the mortal coil. The Templars have borne the curse through the generations, passing it down to their sons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who activate the curse are the only ones who see the world turn to Hell. To all others, it would seem only that their opponent is faster, stronger, and more capable&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Templar's Curse, even horses gain the ability to ride faster and jump further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activating the Templar's Curse puts the power of Hell at the one's disposal. Increasing speed and power, as well as granting new abilities beyond mortal men, it is a power to be reckoned with. But at the cost of one's life, and with Death lurking in the shadows&amp;hellip; One must use it wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Templar's Curse gauge is divided into three tiers. While the first will slowly refill automatically, the second and third will fill only when the curse begins to feel the lust of the battle. Should the gauge fill entirely, the curse will automatically activate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While in the curse, the souls of the damned and lost become visible. Purifying them and sending them to their final rest may yield benefits to those would seek redemption for their deeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cursed souls who fall in battle are instantly driven into the vision of Hell&amp;hellip; where Death begins to stalk toward his claim. At this point, one must buy time with one's limited powers before one's partner comes to help, or Death will taste his victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Cursed Crusade&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
