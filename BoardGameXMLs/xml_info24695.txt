			<description>Flickers! is the first game of the Canadian-owned company Eagle Games Ltd. From their website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flickers!, the movie trivia game that leaves nothing to chance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flickers (slang):  a motion picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That explains the name of the game. But why do we call it the movie trivia game that leaves nothing to chance? Because in this game,  the element of chance has been eliminated.  There are no traditional dice to indicate space moves on aboard; there are no exact number requirements to win the game and there are no free rolls of a dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only playing piece is a color-coded cube corresponding to movie categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flickers! is scored, and won, solely on your knowledge of the movies.  You score points (or lose them) based on what you know about the movies, from home-grown fare to foreign treats, from the 1930s to the present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flickers! has been created and designed to be fun for the casual once-a-month movie goer as well as challenging enough for the avid movie-a-week film buff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flickers! can be played by any number of adult players, anytime, anywhere.  It can be played by individuals, or in teams. It can be played at the dining-room table,  in the park, or in the back seat  of a car on a road trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if any of the question and answer cards pique your curiosity, go out and rent the movie. You may have no idea what delights you are missing when you don't explore all the genres from all the decades, and the works of stars past and present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above all, enjoy.....the movies and Flickers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
