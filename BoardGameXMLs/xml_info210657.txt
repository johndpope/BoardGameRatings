			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awesome Powers is a supplement for the BASH! Ultimate Edition RPG. Inside, you will find new Powers, new Enhancements, new Limitations, and new ideas to incorporate into your BASH! campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiefly, this product is designed to allow you to create characters with themes, making use of pre-designed powers.  You can use these powers for inspiration, or you can even create your character by rolling for powers at random. As the Awesome Powers library grows, so will the list of available powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 9 of Awesome Powers deals with powers of a temporal nature: Hyper Speed and Time. It is ideal for building super speedsters, time travelers, or those who can simply manipulate the speed that time passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyper Speed allows you to tap into super-sonic and even faster-than-light speeds, enabling you to accomplish amazing feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time gives the user the incredible power to slow, speed, or even stop time itself. It also includes the power to travel in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of the powers in Volume 9 are completely unique, as they interact in new ways with Hero Points and Setbacks, or make use of newer game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements, Advantages, Disadvantages, and a rules update on when to Multiply and Divide damage and Time Paradoxes and Alternate Timelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 9 has included a Random Power Generator compiling all powers from Awesome Powers 1-9. So now you can completely create a character without needing to flip through multiple books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
