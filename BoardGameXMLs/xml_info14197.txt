			<description>A simple family game about the challenges of keeping up your academics while also maintaining a social life. Similar to School Daze: High School, but with a bit more challenge, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Manage your tuition money, making sure you have enough to pay for each year.&lt;br/&gt;    Events come up now and then that may affect one or more players.&lt;br/&gt;    At the end of Senior year, each player multiplies their Social score by their Academic score, and the player with the highest total wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    School Daze: High School&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
