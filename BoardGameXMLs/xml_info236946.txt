			<description>&amp;quot;An epic party game designed by adults for adults&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It will get dirty and you're gonna love it!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You want to understand and think like the group you're playing with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions are asked to the party group and the answers will either be what the majority decides or the actual census of the group. Answer correctly to score points and win.  Our game is made for kick ass adults who like to party and rule the mob!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Mob Rules and Mob Blank cards: You do not necessarily answer a question with what you think the answer is but what you think the majority of the group will answer. You want to have a mob mentality. If you guess an answer that is in the majority, you score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mob Census cards: You want to guess the total number of people in the group who have done what the card asks. You want to guess the correct mob census.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts by nominating one person in the group to be an all-time Question Master. The Question Master is tasked with reading all questions and controlling the tempo and tone of the game. If people are talking and having fun, slow the game down and enjoy the moment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played through three rounds. Whoever scores the most points at the end of the game has the ultimate mob mentality and wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
