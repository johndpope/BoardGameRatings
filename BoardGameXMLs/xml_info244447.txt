			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the sun settles in behind the distant mountains the smell of rotten flesh invades your nostrils. Though you are on the right path everything around you feels very wrong. The wooded area feels warped and cursed, the sounds of small weird things scurrying about around you make the hairs on neck stand up. This place is frightening, and you are not sure if you will make it out of here alive. Still, you must journey on... night fall has approached and the Butcher cannot be allowed to kill once more...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rural Apocalypse: Antler Valley is an adventure location setting for post apocalypse themed role playing games. The contents of this product is system generic, allowing the GM (Game Master) to quickly convert it to be used with the role playing game system of their choice. This product can be used as either a rural drop in location for a much larger post apocalypse campaign adventure or used as an adventure on its own. Lead in hooks are provided to assist the GM with luring the player characters into the area. There's information about many of the various NPCs that the players will encounter as well as detailed information for each of the numbered locations on Antler Valley's hex map. An unnumbered hex map is available as well in case the GM wishes to give the player's a little something to give them a bit of a clue- without giving it all away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the information about designated adventure areas the author has included a chart of 50 random encounters in Rural Apocalypse: Antler Valley. This is to allow the GM to fill in some extra goodies in those otherwise unnumbered hex spaces (each hex equals 100 acres). Some space for written game converison notes has been provided throughout the product as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
