			<description>Each player builds a portfolio of mutual funds through purchase, sale, and trade.  Players roll dice and move around the board, landing on squares and drawing cards that make funds in their portfolios rise and fall.  Some cards allow players to swap their poor funds for the good funds of others, or cause various catastrophes in their funds.  Players can also earn bonuses for being the first to traverse each quarter of the board, or for accumulating all five funds in any of the six fund sectors.  After four quarters of the board have been completed (eight quarters in the two player version), the player with the highest value of funds plus cash wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
