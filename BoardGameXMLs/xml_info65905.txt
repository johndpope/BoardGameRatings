							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Designing Sci-Fi Scenarios</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to be ready to run a game, all a referee needs is a scenario. But what if the players don't want to do that scenario? Good question.... A referee's job can be tough. This book makes it easier by offering a simple, complete mission generation system for role-playing games with science-fiction themes. &amp;quot;Designing Sci-Fi Scenarios&amp;quot; provides valuable guidelines for creating and running adventure hooks, travel and dramatic encounters, adventure climaxes, epilogues, and even downtime events, so the referee is always ready to run a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endless adventure possibilities can be created simply by flipping a few playing cards. Rapidly determine the Who, What, When, Where, and Why of the scenario. Quickly identify Patrons, Mission Objectives, Adversaries, Motives, Finances, Rivals, and even Unexpected Plot Twists. Tables are cross-referenced and arranged so that successive card-flips build upon each other and add to the players' and referees' enjoyment. And though written with the Era Ten setting in mind, results can be adapted easily to any science fiction RPG campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
