			<description>From the Invisible City Productions website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A zany game of combat with paper doll monsters for two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: You're a monster locked in mortal combat with your enemy. Your goal is to completely dismember your opponent and grind his or her torso into a bloody pulp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a monster that has four attributes (Speed, Strength, Smarts, and Health), and each monster's attributes are different. On each turn, your monster can perform many different actions (Move, Turn, Attack, Attach Limb, etc.) If you're the last Monster with points in your health pool, then you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
