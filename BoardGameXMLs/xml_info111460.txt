							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New Konfederacy (HERO 6)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuilding the nation from the wreckage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuilding it in strength and unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuilding it free of taint and corrupt blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuilding it into a beacon of faith and protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surely everyone can agree with that plan. But the devil is in the details: the nation they rebuild is the Confederacy, or worse. The strength and unity they seek are tyranny and conformity. The blood they would purge is that of their fellow Americans. Their beacon is a flaming cross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this 16 page PDF you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Details on the Klan's organization, activities, and resurgence after the Serpentfall!&lt;br/&gt;     Information on the Grand Kounty of Birmingham, and the Klan's own Army of the New Konfederacy!&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics for Night Riders, Klandestine Agents, and ever the supernatural Hell Haint!&lt;br/&gt;     The Town Subversion Generator, perfect for generating settings for new adventures in Klan-busting in the Mayoralities of North America!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Konfederacy was released for both the Savage Worlds and the HERO System (6th Edition) RPGs.
