			<description>An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the Game: The player wins who first connects his opposing sides of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player 'owns' two opposing sides of the board. It is advised to mark the sides of each player (at least by placing all the pieces of the players on his sides only). The players may decide whether they want to place the board between them with the corners facing to them or whether they want to sit at an right angle with the sides toward them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of play the board is empty. One player starts the game. The play then alternates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At each move the player whose turn it is has three options of play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     He can enter one of his pieces onto the board;&lt;br/&gt;     Move on of his pieces on the board; or&lt;br/&gt;     Capture an opposing piece with one of his own pieces on the board. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player wins the game who is the first to get an uninterrupted line from one of his own sides of the board to his other (opposing) side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
