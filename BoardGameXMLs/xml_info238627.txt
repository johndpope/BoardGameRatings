			<description>Easy, fast, exciting 2-6 players Age 6 to adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win by discarding your cards first.&lt;br/&gt;Place them in the centre of the table when you can.&lt;br/&gt;Better still place them on your opponents stacks and watch their faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 6 sets of cards numbered 1-20.&lt;br/&gt;Place all the cards on the table face down and shuffle the cards. Each player takes an equal two stacks and places them face down in front of them. &lt;br/&gt;Each player takes one card from a stack and places it face up in the centre of the table. If it is a 1 he places it down. He then takes the next card. If it is a 2 he places it over the 1. He keeps drawing cards until he can no longer follow a number. The first card he cannot place he puts down on his own face up deck. This ends his turn. &lt;br/&gt;The next player now takes a turn but as well as the cards in the centre he can also add to an opponents stack. As long as you can add to a stack you continue your go. &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to run out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
