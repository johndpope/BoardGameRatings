			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surprising, exciting and addictive, this game-book, written and illustrated by David Velasco and Felix Sotomayor, blends the best of fantasy novels, video games and the world of the role. Dig in a land of magic and enemies, each action will help you improve your character's record . Fight to death, bet your coins, participate in drinking contests, discover treasures, steal nonstop, upgrade your armor, get new and powerful weapons, learn spells, get drunk in a tavern or enjoy the pleasures of the flesh in the company of a prostitute. All this and more is what awaits you in the mythical Land &amp;Uacute;rowen, where the road to become hero will be fraught with surprises. Create your character, choose your race and profession and indulge yourself in the adventure in a dangerous world where every action you do and every decision you make mark all your future. 'H&amp;eacute;roes del Acero' (Steel's Heroes) is a game-book in the style of the classic 'Choose your own adventure' that triumphed in the 80s, but it has a very dynamic and exciting gameplay, completely renovated and aimed at an adult audience, rules that allow you to enjoy the pleasure of throwing the dice, to improve your character and use countless objects, such as weapons and armors, potions, charms, coins to spend on vices, and so that each time will make you more powerful. Not surprisingly, to create this book the author has used a great experience for over 15 years as a tireless master role, and habitual consumer of console and computer games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
