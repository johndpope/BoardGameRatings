			<description>Dominoes variant played using hexagonal pieces.&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are divided equally amongst the players and a start player chosen. The start player places one of their hexadoms, Second play must place on of their pieces matching one of the sides. Subsequent players must place matching two or more sides.&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot place a piece they miss a turn. Play continues until one player has placed all his Hexadoms - they are the winner. If no player can place a Hexadom then the player whose pieces show the fewest dots is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
