			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec is a racing game that shuns the arcade-y steering, acceleration, and crashes in favor of a more realistic experience.  As such, the game has gone to great lengths to make everything as close to real-life as they can, including an impressive car list that spans the globe and includes over 150 models.  GT3 even takes the realism to the point of making you go through a driver's test to obtain licenses needed to participate in premiere-level races.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the amazing selection of automobiles, the real-world courses are also stunning and match extremely well to their actual counterparts.  The Gran Turismo career mode is incredibly immersive as you struggle to make an impact on the racing industry as a fledgling racer with little-to-no cash.  How you choose to bolster your garage and what cars you buy for it are completely up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec was released for the PS2 in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
