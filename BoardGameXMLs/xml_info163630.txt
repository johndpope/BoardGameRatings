							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stay and See Georgia: It&#039;s a PEACH of a game</name>
									
			<description>Players move around a map of the state of Georgia leaning fun historical facts about the state while racing to visit eight locations first.  The game contains a map of Georgia, 100 location cards, four small colored cars, 32 green chips and four peach tree cards (with eight peaches on each tree).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin the game by choosing a car and taking 8 green chips and a peach tree card showing 8 peaches.  The players then draw a card from the location deck and place their car at that place.  That card is then placed at the bottom of the deck.  The players then draw a new card, reading it aloud to all.  This will be their first location that they will need to travel to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and move their car, trying to reach the location on their card.  When they do, they place a green chip on a peach on their tree, draw a new card and repeat journey on to the next location.  The winner is the first person to reach eight locations, covering all their peaches with green chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Information is from rules on the back of the game box.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
