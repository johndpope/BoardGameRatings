							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Simpsons: Bart &amp; the Beanstalk</name>
									
			<description>The game merges the existing universe of The Simpsons television series with the fairy tale of Jack and the Beanstalk. In the story, Bart Simpson goes to market to sell the family cow, but is swindled by a clever miser (played in the game by the character Mr. Burns) who trades it for magical beans and a slingshot. When Bart takes the magic beans home his father Homer Simpson accidentally eats them and spits them outside. A beanstalk grows, Bart climbs to the top, and adventures in a giant castle ensue. Bart meets several characters from The Simpsons on these adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Simpsons: Bart &amp;amp; the Beanstalk is a side-scrolling platform game. It is single-player only. The player of the game controls Bart in a total of seven levels. They are: &amp;quot;Up the Beanstalk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Outside the Castle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Giant's Cupboard&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Soup Du Jour&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Giant's Room&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Escape from the Castle&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Down the Beanstalk&amp;quot;. In order to complete a level, the player must collect a certain amount of gold coins. Bart is faced with a number of enemies on every level, and he can use his slingshot to fend them off. He can also pick up dynamite, which kills all enemies currently on the screen. The enemies featured in the game include beetles, hornets, flies, ducks, rats, and fire flies. On some levels, Bart also has to defeat a boss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Simpsons: Bart &amp;amp; the Beanstalk&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
