							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Destruction of SPI Center</name>
									
			<description>A tongue-in-cheek game by Greg Costikyan, self published when he was a playtester at SPI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map was inspired by what looks like a fire alarm/evac map like you may see posted in your workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is the SPI trolls (playtesters) are in revolt against their SPI masters, Howie Barasch, Jim Dunnigan, Terry Hardy et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to run around knocking people out in an attempt to take over the building, the SPI guys can knock out playtesters and drag them to the elevator, having the security guard remove them from the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The weapons are dice, the soda whoosh guys have their soft drinks, a few other items to spice up the mix, a Sherman tank in the store room!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is gauged on how quickly you clear the building, taking into consideration that the pizza delivery every night at 8 pm stuns the playtesters into a mass move to the break room!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes the lyrics to &amp;quot;We're an Armenian Band&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
