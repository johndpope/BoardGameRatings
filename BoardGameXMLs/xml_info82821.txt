			<description>From the Publisher Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerial warfare has evolved&lt;br/&gt;Aerial warfare has evolved. So have you. As a member of the ultra-secret H.A.W.X. 2 squadron, you are one of the chosen few, one of the truly elite. You will use finely honed reflexes, bleeding-edge technology and ultra-sophisticated aircraft - their existence denied by many governments - to dominate the skies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will do so by mastering every nuance of the world's finest combat aircraft. You will slip into enemy territory undetected, deliver a crippling blow and escape before he can summon a response. You will use your superior technology to decimate the enemy from afar, then draw him in close for a pulse-pounding dogfight. And you will use your steel nerve to successfully execute night raids, aerial refueling and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will do all this with professionalism, skill and consummate lethality. Because you are a member of H.A.W.X. 2 and you are one of the finest military aviators the world has ever known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. 2 is the second in the line of the 'Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X.'-series. Once again this is a game in which the players flies several different jet fighters. Gameplay focusus on action, not avionics, so this game leans more to arcade and 1st + 3rd person-view shooter, than to flight simulator. To drive that point home, the adviced supplemental for PC is a Xbox360 controller, not a flight stick and throttle.&lt;br/&gt;Still, this game strives for a higher realism than it's predecessor. The story has more 'it could happen now' elements, with terrorists blowing planes out of the sky near an American airbase in the Middle East, than the mercenaries fighter pilot armies featuring in part one. This attempt is also visible in gameplay, for instance by the addition of take-offs, landings and in-flight refuelling.&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a new technology to adept satelite images for ground textures, resulting in a more realistic ground view. It even features a menu option detailing the old HAWX(1) technology and comparing it to the new HAWX2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
