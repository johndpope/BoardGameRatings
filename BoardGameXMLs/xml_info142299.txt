							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swords and Heroes: Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>Swords and Heroes is a unique, history-based tactical game that allows players the opportunity to battle some of the greatest armies in history. The flagship game of the independent company ZAMA Game Design, Swords and Heroes challenges players in a simple-yet-engaging combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a detailed &amp;ldquo;Cards and Shards&amp;rdquo; system that uses board-based tactical &amp;ldquo;shards&amp;rdquo; to represent battlefield units of the respective armies. Basic statistics and abilities of these units are represented by beautifully-designed game cards held by each player. Units range from light-armored infantry to long-ranged archers or heavy cavalry, but vary wildly based on the historical civilization chosen by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After custom-designing their armies using a simple point-based creation mechanic, players field their armies and face off for the control of the board with easy-to-learn dice-based turn mechanics. Players also make use of &amp;ldquo;General&amp;rsquo;s Orders&amp;rdquo; cards that offer players powerful and unique means of shifting the course of battle. Once the enemy has been eliminated from the board, the remaining general stands victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Swords and Heroes: Starter Set comes with all of the necessary rules and game components required, as well as two Classical Age armies: The Roman Empire and the Germanic Tribes. Future expansion packs will also offer players additional armies, such as Han China, Alexander&amp;rsquo;s Macedonia, Parthian Persia, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
