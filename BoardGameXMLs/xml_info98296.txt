			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a mercenary, ex-miner who takes on the task of destroying the automated mining equipment that put him out of a job. The player can select from several characters, but they do not alter the gameplay. There are 20 levels spread over 4 worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed in a top-down view showing your &amp;quot;screwjumper&amp;quot; plummeting down through a mineshaft. The player is supposed to maneuver the character so that he can destroy the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; objects while avoiding the &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; objects. You also have access to dynamite which can be lobbed at objects, but it also must be used to destroy the reactor at the end of each level (ie. the bottom of the shaft.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single-player has access to all 20 levels, as does online multi-player. Local multi-player can only be played on 7 of the levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
