			<description>Publisher's catalog description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for miniatures and role-playing in the heydey of the French colonial empire, including charts, diagrams, and maps for donning your white kepi and fighting with the French Foreign Legion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A role-playing game of the French Foreign Legion 1850-1930.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a set of miniatures and role-playing rules, and as such has two separate combat systems. Although these systems are separate in the functions they fulfill, they are integrated in the sense that it allows an individual to take part in a larger action.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;With a GM, this booklet is intended as a jumping-off place, a beginning spot, and not intended as the all inclusive and definitive set of rules for the French Foreign Legion.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;[T]he intent of this set of rules is to create the atmosphere of the days of glory that existed at the end of the 19th century and in the early days of the twentieth century, days when patriotism and colonialism were not necessarily curse words.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's character attributes are Strength, Firearms Accuracy, Dexterity/Agility, Hand to Hand Combat, Constitution, and Military Ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
