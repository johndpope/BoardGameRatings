			<description>Double Dragon Neon is a video game in the Double Dragon series of beat 'em up games and is intended as a reboot of the Double Dragon series; As with previous installments of the series, the player takes control of martial artists Billy Lee (Player 1) and Jimmy Lee (Player 2) in their fight to rescue Marian from the Shadow Warriors gang, this time led by the super-lich Skullmageddon. The journey starts on the city streets and progresses through an outer-space fighting dojo, an Oriental-themed countryside, a genetics lab, and a graveyard before concluding at Skullmageddon's palace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the standard punch, kick, and jump buttons and a designated run button, the player now has a evade button for dodging attacks. If the player times their evasion right so as to perfectly dodge an enemy attack, they will &amp;quot;Gleam&amp;quot; by briefly glowing red, during which time their attacks will be more powerful. The player can collect life-replenishing sodas, money to buy items from shops, and special mixtapes that can be equipped from a pause menu. Two different tapes can be equipped at once: one to grant the brothers a powerful attack that consumes a separate energy meter, and one to alter their statistics and grant special effects (such as making it easier to stun enemies or healing HP with every connecting blow). By collecting multiple copies of a tape, its effect gradually increases until it reaches a maximum capacity. Each tape's maximum capacity can be increased further by visiting a &amp;quot;Tapesmith&amp;quot; and paying him Mythril, which is obtained from defeated bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a two-player game, both Billy and Jimmy can utilize a special &amp;quot;high-five&amp;quot; technique to split and share their life meters to an equal amount, or to instantly trigger a Gleam effect. If one player is defeated in battle, the other player has a limited time to revive him before a life is deducted (unless both players are defeated together). When one player is completely out of lives, he can steal one from the other player if he has at least two left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Double Dragon Neon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
