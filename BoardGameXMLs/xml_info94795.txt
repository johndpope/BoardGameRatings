			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medabots: Infinity is an action RPG title in the Medabots franchise. Ikki and Metabee have come to the Toru-Toru Land amusement park to compete in the Medafighter race, and if they win, Ikki will receive a year&amp;rsquo;s pass to the park for free. Beneath the bright surface, however, something more sinister lurks, and the Rubberobo gang is hiding in the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The television series is loosely similar to Pokemon &amp;ndash; children befriend and train with robots in the hopes of becoming the best Medafighters in the world. In Infinity, the player visits a number of Toru-Toru Land attractions, where Metabee is deployed to explore the area and defeat any enemies that he comes across. The stages are littered with traps, enemy fighters, and obstacles that will slow progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When opponents are encountered, a Robattle will take place. Players can use head and arm parts for different attacks, or charge up a power attack using Medaforce. Defeating an enemy Medabot will unlock bonus parts that can be used to customize your robot for battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also Robattle their friends or the AI in Arena mode. Two Medabots are pitted against each other in 1-on-1 combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
