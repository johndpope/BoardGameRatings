			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1992 Konami released a coin-operated arcade game based on the series titled Wild West C.O.W.-Boys Of Moo Mesa. The game is a side-scrolling &amp;quot;run 'n gun&amp;quot; action game similar to Konami's own wild west-themed game Sunset Riders. Ryan Brown worked closely with Konami on the game's development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters in the game are Cowlorado Kid, Dakota Dude, Marshall Moo Montana, and a new character made for the game named Buffalo Bull. The game can be configured to allow up to four players to play simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's controls consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for shooting and jumping. Pressing both buttons simultaneously will cause the player character to perform a stampede attack, do a spinning jump, or use any equipped item like dynamite sticks and tomahawk blades. The player can uncover a variety of power-up items by shooting flying chickens, which includes a rapid-fire Machine Gun and a Power-Up for wider bullets. Unlike Sunset Riders, the player has a three-unit life gauge that allows the player to take three hits before losing a life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
