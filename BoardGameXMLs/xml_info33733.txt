							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Athene</name>
									
			<description>With the unspeakable events of Troy behind them, the Greek Captains steer their ships for home. But Athene will not let these acts go unanswered and marshals the storm clouds as they have never been marshaled before, and nor will they be again. As the storm rises, and the currents take a greater and greater hold of your ship, can you steer your way home, or will you be swept into an inescapable whirlpool, or off the edge of the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Athene is a game for 3-6 players. The game is played on a grid of tiles. The tiles start off as calm seas, and players play cards to control the movement of their ship. But as the game progresses, the tiles are turned over to reveal the currents, and the players have less and less control of where their ship goes. The longer a ship stays at sea, the more valour the captain will earn, but ultimately you have to get home before the seas become unsurvivable and your ship is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to lack of interest, JKLM have decided not to produce this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
