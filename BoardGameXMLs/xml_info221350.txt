			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4 PCs of Levels 3-5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord and Lady Scarlet are wealthy, well connected and generally well liked - for nobility. Their social talents have lead to them hosting a national embassy on their estate, which now see a constant exchange of visiting nobility of all stripes. As one of the most well connected people in politics, Lord Scarlet is a perfect person to ask for a favor that requires political clout: which is why the PCs are paying him a visit. Yet they arrive at an unfortunate time. Mere minutes ago, Lord Scarlet was found dead in the library of his own embassy, in the middle of hosting a small group of business partners to discuss an upcoming venture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
