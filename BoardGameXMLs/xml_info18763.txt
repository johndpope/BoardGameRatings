			<description>The game consists of a deck of cards with letters on them. There are black letters, red letters and 2 special joker cards (which can be used as any letter).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turns flips over the top card of the deck and puts it in the play ares (visible for all players). The first player who is able to form a word (minimum length : 4 letters) with the revealed cards, gains points. The longer the word, the more points are scored. There's a bonus if the word is entirely made of letters of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play until you reach a number of points agreed upon before play starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
