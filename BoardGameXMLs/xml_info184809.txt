			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character generation starts with twelve Attributes which are randomly generated with 1d100 each.  Life Force Points are next generated with 1d20 multiplied by several factors yielding something in the neighborhood of fifteen points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills in the game are created by the players--there is no published Skill List.  Characters have 1 to 20 Skills, depending on their Intelligence Attribute.  Skills also have a percentage score attached to them, though they are assigned by GM fiat.  To use the skill, the player rolls 1d100 and scores below the Skill level for success.  Experience Points are gained in categories and are spent to increase Skills in that category.  Combat and Magic use are handled as Skills.  Damage is subtracted from Life Force Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game presents a very short equipment list, heavily focused on weapons and armors from a variety of technology levels.  A very brief Monster Creation format also is offered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
