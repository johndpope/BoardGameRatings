			<description>The Battle of Durk's Well is a simple asymmetric wargame. One player controls settlers (led by Anders Durk) who have settled in a valley and the miners working nearby. The other player is a nearby wizard who sends a group of Orrks and Spooks to poison the well (on which both settlers and miners depend) and burn down the settlers' houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the designer's notes, the settlers and miners are inadvertently damaging the Orrks' and Spooks' environment, so it's not a simple good-vs-evil battle (although the background doesn't affect the gameplay to any great extent).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components consist of a 4-part paper map (with hand coloring, it appears), paper counters, and a set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
