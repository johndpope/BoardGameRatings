			<description>You pick a random slang term from the deck and everyone writes a made up but convincing definition for the word and anonymously hands it in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One person reads all the definitions aloud, including the actual definition of the word, which is randomly mixed in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone guesses which definition is the real one and get points if they do. They usually fall for someone else's bullshit definition -- which earns its author a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differences to regular balderdash would be more of a party-game for the adult crowd, adult-material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
