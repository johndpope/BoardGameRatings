							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gladiator Sen So</name>
									
			<description>Yes, you are a Gladiator! You have two strong arms, one for each weapon. The enemies are new, but this is nothing new, arena combat is your life. The crowd and you grow restless; it is time once again to bask in yet another victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gladiator brings the Gladius, Spatha, Parma(shield) and Net to Sen So.  If you like dual wielding and dishing out damage, the Gladiator is perfect for you.  The Gladiator is a single player set that can be played against any of the Sen So variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sen So game system uses a unique set of octagon cards and card holders. Players have to set (program) actions before their current action is revealed. All players reveal actions together. This provides fast play for even large numbers of players.  Game scoring provides balance and keeps the leaders on their toes. Players are required to choose their weapons and abilities for each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
