							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In The Soup</name>
									
			<description>A Tiddly Winks type game. The game comes with 4 miniature salt cellars, 4 small counters of differing colors and 1 large snapping piece. The object is to try and not knock over any of the Salt Cellar pieces while landing on the same color area as the area that you started in. A counter must be clearly on the same and outside of the soup dish.  Any piece resting on the same color scores 15 points and counters resting on a different color scores 5 points. Each salt cellar still standing scores 5 points.  Minuses for any counter IN THE SOUP (minus 10 points), every salt cellar down but not in the soup (minus 5 points) and for every salt cellar down resting clearly over the line separating the soup from the edge of the Soup Dish (minus 5 points). Game is played in turns to a score of 100. First to that score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
