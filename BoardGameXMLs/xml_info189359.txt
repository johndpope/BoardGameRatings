							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Second World War at Sea: South American Navies</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Second Great War setting is based on the premise that the First World War came to a negotiated end in late 1916, leaving the great empires intact but planting the seeds of renewed conflict a generation later.  Second World War at Sea: South American Navies looks at the involvement of Latin America's leading powers: Argentina, Brazil and Chile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these fleets has undergone the expansion and reconstruction allowed by strong economic growth and relative political stability - without a German economic collapse to fuel it, the Great Depression is no more than a world-wide recession. Political and especially economic ties have aligned the Latin powers with their European partners: Argentina with Italy, Chile with Britain, and Brazil with the Central Powers of Imperial Germany and Austria-Hungary, while maintaining a strong trade relationship with the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their fleets reflect this: the Argentine battleships have been re-built along the pattern of the Italian Conte di Cavour class, the Brazilians much like American battleships, and the Chilean ships like their British near-sisters. And each has added new ships and aircraft from those sources in pursuit of a balanced fleet. Of course, there are airships as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South American Navies is a supplement for the Second World War at Sea series, based on battles that never happened. There are 12 new scenarios in a story arc following the participation of the South American fleets in the Second Great War. It is not a complete game: Ownership of Cone of Fire (and only Cone of Fire) is necessary to play all of the scenarios included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South American Navies includes 90 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces: 50 &amp;quot;long&amp;quot; pieces representing major warships and 40 square ones representing aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
