			<description>The Lost Worlds system appeared to slip away after late eighties spin-offs into the realms of Battletech (Science Fiction Combat Book Game) and Star Wars (Lightsaber Dueling Pack). However, in the late nineties the system was briefly revived (and revised) again for use in a series of comic books. The Battlebooks started out with characters from the Marvel Universe and later expanded into other comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two cards were bound into the comic book. One listed the rules and identified the features of the game. The second card was the character's Maneuver Card which listed the actions the character could take in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay was similar to Lost Worlds. Each player picks a character and game books are exchanged so each player has a book that depicts POV illustrations of the opponent attacking. Maneuvers are simultaneously selected and the matrix encoded into the books determines the results of each exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book mechanic also featured in:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Lost Worlds&lt;br/&gt;     Star Wars Lightsaber Dueling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
