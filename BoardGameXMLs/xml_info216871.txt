							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hull Breach!: Anaheim Production Platfiorm</name>
									
			<description>Originally released as part of Hull Breach!'s Corporate Wars box set, this individual deck has been revamped and improved for the current edition of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anaheim Manufacturing Corporation is one of the Big Three Megacorporations in the Hull Breach Universe. It has been said, often, that Anaheim is what would happen if Enzo Ferrari was to buy Walmart, Bandai, and Acme, and merge them. Anaheim and its subsidiaries make or at least market... well, just about everything. Furthermore, everything is shiny or chromed or customizable or upgrade-able.  They are the epitome of &amp;quot;Everything you wanted... and MORE!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
