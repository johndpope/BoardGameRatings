			<description>Move your tents and herds and take as many areas of use. But be quick, the rival tribes do not sit still!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nomads is a smooth, compact game for two to four players. Pastoralism is not just another quick card or dice game, everything revolves around the moving and positioning of tents and camels. Thanks to dice the momentum continues it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you roll the dice which decides whether you can move your tent or your herds, and to which location. Form groups to defend against other players, or to overtake other players' tents/herds. Take the most areas in use and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
