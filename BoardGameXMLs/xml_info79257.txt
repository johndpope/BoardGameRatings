			<description>From the Publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play Rusty, the first human born in the Void, who must take on the Watchers in a quest to stop their domination of Earth. With the aid of Nikola Tesla, and his state-of-the-art rocket pack, Rusty must take down the Watchers and their minions across three intense levels of action and intrigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years ago the great scientist Nikola Tesla became trapped in the Void, a hostile place between our world and the world of the Watchers. For years Tesla and the band of Void-born humans known as the Survivors have battled against the evil Watchers as they attempted to create a stable portal that would enable them to finally conquer humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the role of Rusty, warrior test-pilot and Tesla&amp;rsquo;s trusted friend. It is Tesla&amp;rsquo;s belief that where armies have failed, maybe one man, armed with Tesla&amp;rsquo;s technology, can succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fate of the human race rests in your hands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive to DSiWare - Dark Void Zero&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Dualscreen Support&lt;br/&gt;The DSi&amp;rsquo;s dualscreen architecture allowed for a genuine remake of the original PlayChoice-10 title on this modern console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Local Leaderboards&lt;br/&gt;Ranks for overall score. Compete to become the best-of-the-best!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Localization&lt;br/&gt;Full language support for English, French, Italian, German and Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Soundtrack&lt;br/&gt;Featuring an 8-bit soundtrack, composed and performed by famed Battlestar Galactica composer Bear McCreary.&lt;br/&gt;All music was created using actual NES hardware (fused with a MIDI controller), and the result is truly authentic 8-bit music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Fully Retro&lt;br/&gt;From graphics to gameplay to music to the faux-history, Dark Void Zero gives players a true retro experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
