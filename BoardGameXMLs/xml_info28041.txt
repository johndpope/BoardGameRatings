			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Note that all details for this game are preliminary. This game has not been released, and since its announced release date has long since passed, this game might never be released. This listing serves as a historical record; you are invited to submit corrections or update this section if additional information comes to light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time for maneuver is past. For weeks, Union and Confederate armies have played cat and mouse in the mountains of North Georgia, vying for the prize of Chattanooga. Rosecrans, sure of success, has divided his forces and plunged headlong into pursuing what he believed to be a beaten foe, intent on catching the enemy before he retires behind the next mountain range and has to be out-maneuvered all over again. If the Confederates can turn and strike before Rosecrans can gather in his own scattered troops, Rebel fortunes can yet be redeemed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long overdue and complete remake of the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series game &amp;quot;Barren Victory&amp;quot;.  David Powell has substantially updated the historical data after several years of additional research and will provide one of the most accurate renditions of the Battle of Chickamauga ever to see print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first International Game Series and Gamers partnership will provide a unique perspective on this very popular and critically successful game system line.  Adam Starkweather is developing the design, and Mark Mahaffey has created the new artwork for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
