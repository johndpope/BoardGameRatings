			<description>Pictionary, also known as Pictionary: The Game of Video Quick Draw, is a NES puzzle game, written by Software Creations Ltd., and released by LJN Toys Ltd., and Pictionary Incorporated in 1990. Players may play in up to four teams of unlimited players. This game is also notable for having an 8-bit rendition of Another One Bites the Dust by the English rock band Queen as one of the music tracks in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two modes of play; Regular Game mode, and Alternative Game mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regular Mode&lt;br/&gt;In Regular Game mode, you can either play in teams, or against the CPU. If you play against the CPU, or if you play with only two people, then the game is played by completing a series of minigames, every point scored revealing a part of a picture, and after the minigame is over, you must guess what the picture is, based on the amount you've been able to reveal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're successful in guessing what the picture is, then you can &amp;quot;roll&amp;quot; a virtual die, to decide how many spaces you may move along the &amp;quot;board&amp;quot;. The first person to reach the end of the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play in teams of 2 or more, then a &amp;quot;designated drawer&amp;quot; is chosen, and instead of the computer drawing a picture, you yourself draw a picture of something the computer has pre-decided upon (For example, 'snowmobile') using the controller, and if it is correctly guessed, the user must use the honor system to tell the game whether or not the answer was guessed correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your team guesses correctly, you may roll the virtual die, and proceed that number of spaces down the board. Whomever reaches the finish space first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternative game mode&lt;br/&gt;Alternative Game Mode is played much the same way as &amp;quot;Regular Game Mode&amp;quot;, except instead of the Computer supplying an answer, the designated drawer does so himself, and both teams may guess instead of just the drawer's team. At the end of a round, the game asks which team was successful in guessing, and you may choose &amp;quot;Nobody did&amp;quot;, Team 1, Team 2, Team 3, or Team 4. If no one wins, then play moves on to the other teams designated drawer, and a new round begins. If a team guesses correctly, they may roll the virtual die, and proceed down the board. The first team to reach the end of the board is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pictionary (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
