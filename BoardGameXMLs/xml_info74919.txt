			<description>Subtitle: A Fantasy Quick Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;The Orcs have been breeding again! It is spring time once more, and with the melting of the winter snow, one highland village knows that this time of year means it is time once more for their annual Orc Hunt. The mountain orc population is very large after most winters, and this spring looks set to provide the most bountiful harvest in years. The orcs populate several glens and cave networks east of the village, their territory eventually extending up into the highest and most dangerous peaks of the mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your party has found itself in the village just as the pre-hunt festivities are starting up and have been asked if they are going to participate in the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
