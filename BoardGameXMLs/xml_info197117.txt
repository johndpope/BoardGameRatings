							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rogue Trooper (1986)</name>
									
			<description>An isometric shooter by Piranha Software for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of killing Norts whilst searching Nu-Earth for 8 vid-tapes containing evidence of the Traitor General's involvement in the Quartz Zone Massacre, where all of the G.I.s barring Rogue were slaughtered. On finding all 8 tapes, Rogue has to return to the Souther base of Milli-Com to prove the General's treachery and the extenuating circumstances of his going AWOL. During the game, as well as the vid-tapes, players could also pick up medi-kits to regain health and ammo boxes to feed Gunnar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several aspects of the comic were included in the game, such as Nort pillboxes (visually based to some degree on hardened field defences used by the British in World War II), a Quartz-like 'Glass Zone' and most notably the personalities of the bio-chips, which would announce the presence of enemy soldiers, give health and ammo status reports and make sarcastic and derogatory remarks at the Norts and to Rogue himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_Trooper_video_games%238-bit_Computer_Game_.281986.29 Rogue Trooper video games]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
