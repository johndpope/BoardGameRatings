			<description>A golf boardgame containing 9 courses. The courses are stylistic rather than realistic in their portrayal, containing colored fields and numbered circles. The players use two ordinary six sided dice and move their markers to circles with numbers that are the same as the sum of their throw. The distribution of the numbered circles is made so that bad shots are less likely to occur (ie. bunker, ruff etc.) than shots to fairway. Putting is made using a special dice. Every hole has a small rule set that makes unusual events possible, such as hole in one etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
