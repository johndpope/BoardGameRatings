							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swing States</name>
									
			<description>Swing states is the game of political domination!  Players take turns rolling for votes and then players use those votes to choose which state to influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a Player's Turn:&lt;br/&gt;The current player rolls 4  6-sided dice.  If a die has your parties matching color on it it is counted as one vote for your party. &lt;br/&gt;(colors are included in the published version, &lt;br/&gt;otherwise  1-2-3 = Elephants 4-5-6 = Donkies.  With your party's votes, you may purchase state/s influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;States are influenced by Votes.  Your own &lt;br/&gt;parties color costs 1 vote, while your opponents color and the independent party's color (Green) cost 2 votes to influence. You may influence as many states as you can with your votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a state is already occupied you may influence it by paying double the cost it would normally cost you.  The only states that don't apply to these rules are the Swing States (Orange Colored states)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
