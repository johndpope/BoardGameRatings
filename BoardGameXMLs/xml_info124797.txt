			<description>Hang on to your helmet...Max Damage is back! Carmageddon: Reincarnation is going to reintroduce the gaming world to the original freeform driving sensation, where pedestrians (and cows) equal points and your opponents are a bunch of crazies in a twisted mix of automotive killing machines. It&amp;rsquo;s the racing game where racing is for wimps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally released for the PC in 1997, Carmageddon was an instant hit thanks to its anarchic gameplay and over-the-top surreal comedy violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in 1997 a small, independent game studio called Stainless delivered its first PC game to an unsuspecting world. Rich in humour, bathed in gibs, and relishing its instant reputation as the poster child for everything that&amp;rsquo;s wrong with society (and therefore right in a videogame), the smash hit Carmageddon and its successors sold over two million copies worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course the copyright and truck-loads of cash went to the EVIL publisher, but Stainless survives to this day, still independent, still kicking, and still releasing successful products. (Check out our other work and credentials at stainlessgames.com.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After years of negotiation, the original founders of Stainless recently bought back ALL the rights to Carmageddon. So now it&amp;rsquo;s back in its rightful home, we&amp;rsquo;ve embarked on the journey that will reboot the brand, and we want YOU to join us on that journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carmageddon featured real-world environments that had been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level was sprinkled generously with power-ups that had a vast variety of mad effects: gluing pedestrians to the ground or rendering them blind so they couldn't see you coming; turning your suspension to jelly or your car into solid granite; arming you with the awesome Pedestrian Electro-Bastard Ray or the Pedestrian Flame-thrower - and a whole lot more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Kickstarter Page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
