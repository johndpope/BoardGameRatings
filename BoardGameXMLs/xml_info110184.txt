			<description>Putty Squad is a 1994 video game for the SNES, and while it was also developed for the Amiga 1200, Mega Drive, and MS-DOS, these ports were ultimately unpublished. It is the sequel to Putty (1992).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Putty Squad is a platform game in which the player controls an amorphous blue blob, tasked with rescuing imprisoned putties. The player's putty can stretch in a variety of ways: sidewards to cover ground faster, squash flat to absorb pick-up items, stretch upwards to climb, morph a fist to attack, or inflate to float upwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Putty can collect stars that increase his attack power: at first increasing the potency of his punch, but later allowing him to blow darts, electrocute enemies or throw bombs. This star power is reduced every time Putty is hit by an enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Putty Squad&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After over 20 years, the Amiga 1200 version was released as a free download on the System 3 website on Christmas Eve 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
