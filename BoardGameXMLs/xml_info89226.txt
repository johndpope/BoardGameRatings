							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Giro Ciclistico d&#039;Italia</name>
									
			<description>Italian cycling game from just after WWII about the Tour of Italy. It uses roll &amp;amp; move mechanics but technically it's not a race game because the winner is not the player who reaches the final square on the board first but the player scored the most of points on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
