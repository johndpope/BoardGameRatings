			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARCANA AGENCY: THE THIEF OF MEMORIES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New York, October 1932. Malevolent forces are at work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange things are happening in New York. When the detectives of Arcana Agency are called upon to discover how and why a corpse has walked out of a hospital morgue, they soon realize that this is only the first in a chain of bizarre events will forever blur the divide between life and death - and that will strike at the heart of Arcana Agency itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure YOU must guide detectives Humphrey Brown, Joe Strelli and Tom Shanigan through three intertwining adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In 'The Mystery of the Morgue Marauder,' Humphrey Brown and Tom Shanigan must retrace the steps of Charlie Strubb - a man supposedly shot dead just 24 hours earlier. Why is a corpse leaving a trail of crimes across New York?&lt;br/&gt;     In 'The Mystery of the Murdered Marvelous Mask,' Joe Strelli's evening at the theater is ruined when a stage magician is killed by a strangely elusive assassin.&lt;br/&gt;     Finally, in 'The Thief of Memories' the three detectives begin to see how recent events fit together, and they must face a wholly inhuman foe - a being that is able to elude memory itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOUR choices will decide if the detectives are successful, and whether the Thief of Memories remains free to terrorize New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
