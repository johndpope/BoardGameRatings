			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Exodus, there are none that are more dangerous than the five person lead terrorist and criminal organization known as the Folding Circle.  The Folding Circle rarely concerns itself with large-scale military style movements &amp;ndash; The Folding Circle prefers to work with pinpoint strikes, sending a small group of powerful individuals to achieve some aim or another. Usually, one of the leaders will travel out to wherever a problem or opportunity has arisen and deal with it accordingly. The Folding circle doesn&amp;rsquo;t control territory in the sense that a nation does.  The members of this organization are highly mobile and powerful, capable of traveling to an area spied through the Star Fountain, dealing with the &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo;, and returning.  This travel capability means that a member of the Folding Circle can appear anywhere, at any time, with basically no warning. This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     History of the Folding Circle&lt;br/&gt;     The Folding Circle &amp;ndash; Goals and Agenda&lt;br/&gt;     The History of the Leader of the Folding Circle: Makesh the Undying (CR 4, 10, 14, 20 &amp;amp; 24), Nysska (CR 3, 7, 11, 15 &amp;amp; 19), The Destoyer (CR 5, 9, 13, 17 &amp;amp; 21), Emok Zenyaka (CR 2, 6, 10, 14 &amp;amp; 19), and Haru Anon (CR 5, 10, 15, 20 &amp;amp; 25)&lt;br/&gt;     Relations with the World of Exodus&lt;br/&gt;     Four all new Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; Feats&lt;br/&gt;     Allies of the Folding Circle: Seeker-in-Flame (CR 10), Axo the Wildstorm (CR 14) and The eight members of the Brotherhood (CR 10 &amp;ndash; 15)&lt;br/&gt;     Initiative and Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;     NeoExodus: A House Divided Character Sheet&lt;br/&gt;     Combat &amp;amp; Initiative Tracker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
