Why use real coins when you can use &amp;quot;virtual coins&amp;quot;...it's like owning your own arcade parlor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the impressive features include:&lt;br/&gt;٠ Configure music, sfx, and save options.&lt;br/&gt;٠ View detailed statistics about time played, games played, medals&lt;br/&gt;    won, and overall completion percentage.&lt;br/&gt;٠ Visit the Shopping Mall to spend your tokens.&lt;br/&gt;٠ Earn the right to enter the Challenge Room for additional gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;٠ On-screen Help to discover Game Objective, Controls, and Hints.&lt;br/&gt;٠ Vanity board with top 5 scores and player initials for each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
