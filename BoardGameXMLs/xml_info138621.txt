			<description>FIVE-OH! Is a card game with a humorous approach towards society&amp;rsquo;s finest.  The &amp;ldquo;boys in blue&amp;rdquo;.  Collect cards to form units of different types of cops.  Solve crimes as they pop up with specific units you have gathered.  Watch out, there are action cards also that can change the police force you have so diligently been recruiting!  You never know what will come up, just like in real life &amp;ldquo;on the beat&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with five cards in their hand.  During game play, you have numerous different actions to choose from on your turn.  You are attempting to collect different types of &amp;quot;cop&amp;quot; cards in order to &amp;quot;address&amp;quot; calls for service you choose to play.  Solving or rather &amp;quot;resolving&amp;quot; calls for service results in points, depending on the difficulty of the call for service and the number/types of cops required.  The winner is the first one to acquire 50 points worth of solved calls for service.  The trick to that is you want to make sure you don't have a lot of unresolved calls in front of you because they count against your final score at the end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game incorporates dice as well for &amp;quot;shootout&amp;quot; cards.  A simple mechanic in which the bad guys hit on a roll of &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; and the cop(s) hit on a &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;.  Winning shootouts get you points as well, losing shootouts costs you cops you have gathered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also actions that allow you to recruit (steal) cops from other players (precincts), get extra cards for &amp;quot;grants&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a lot going on in this game!  You must keep an eye on your opponent's precinct, as well as try to manage your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
