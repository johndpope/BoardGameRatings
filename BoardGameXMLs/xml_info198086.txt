							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rushi</name>
									
			<description>Rushi is a fast-paced board game for 2 players. The object is to get all your cards to your opponent's side. Use strategies like blocking and trapping to beat your opponent. Every game is different, and you'll want to play over and over again to try new ways of outsmarting your opponent. Rushi is simple enough for a 5-year old to understand but has enough strategy for much more complex game play. This game has the spirit of classic board games like Checkers or Chess, but has a unique and fast-paced game experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Each player starts with:&lt;br/&gt;    3 Single Arrow Cards&lt;br/&gt;    2 Side Arrow Cards&lt;br/&gt;    2 Corner Arrow Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with 6 cards on the board, and 1 card in hand. Players take turns placing the card in their hand on the board, and can only place their card on a square that one of their other cards is pointing to. Players cannot place their card on top of another card. When a player places their card on a square, they must pick up the card that was pointing to that square to play on their next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
