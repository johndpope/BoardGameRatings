							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caribou Hunting: The Bow and Arrow Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Bow and Arrow game is a simplified model of one aspect of Eskimo life which allows players to experiment with different strategies for solving the problem of the hunter providing food and clothing for his family. The Caribou player moves a herd of 40 Caribou; each Eskimo player may hunt independently or cooperatively, killing caribou until the herd moves into one of the lakes or off the game board. The game contrasts with the more productive and cooperative technique of hunting from kayaks in The Crossing Place Hunting Game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Man: A Course of Study, Unit 6, for 5th grade elementary students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
