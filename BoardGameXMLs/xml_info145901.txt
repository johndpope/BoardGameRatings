			<description>2-8 player word game that's all about 4-letter words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is simple: write down as many 4-letter words as you can think of within 30 seconds. The words you chose are based on certain criteria established by a roll of the Game Mode die, which includes 6 different game modes: Starts With, Ends With, Dual Rune, Rhymes With, Relation, and Weak Link. The first three modes are letter-based, and decided on the roll of a D20 letter die. The last three modes are word-based, and decided on the flip of a Word Card. Only 4-letter words are allowed (no plurals), and only unique words earn you a point (ie. if another player has the same word as you, neither of you earn a point for that word). First player to 44 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has unique custom packaging, in an engraved wooden box that measures on 3.5&amp;quot; x 5.5&amp;quot; (just a bit bigger than an index card!), and has a wood-and-glass timer, and wooden and bone-colored dice to keep with the old-world runic theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
