							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stars Without Number: Revised Edition - Free Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 3200 and mankind's empire lies in ashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jump Gates fell six hundred years ago, severing the links between the myriad worlds of the human diaspora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the long isolation of the Silence falls away as men and women return to the skies above their scattered worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be among them once more?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stars Without Number: Revised Edition is an old-school-inspired game of sci-fi adventure, one built from the ground up to encourage sandbox play and simplify a GM's job in providing it. Familiar mechanics are employed to forge new worlds and explore new possibilities, guidelines built on long experience used to help a group venture in wholly new directions. Within the full-color pages of Stars Without Number: Revised Edition, you'll find&amp;hellip; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Backwards compatibility, as the Revised Edition is built to work cleanly with existing Stars Without Number supplements and materials. The new systems slot in smoothly, and you can take or leave them individually as your group prefers.&lt;br/&gt;    Expanded character creation, with PCs now customized by special talents and character foci, new options for psychic characters, and new ways to make your hero mechanically distinct. Yet the process is still smooth and quick, with a special quick generator spread to create a hero from nothing more than a half-dozen die rolls.&lt;br/&gt;    Refined psionics, with more options to distinguish your psychic hero's powers and more flexible choices for their abilities. Tailor your psychic to your concept, whether as a cynical gunslinging brainguard or an ascetic psychic healer from a world of austere psionic scholars.&lt;br/&gt;    Improved starship combat, with decisive roles for every member of the party. Build your own starships with the included system and employ new hardware and new starship mods to make your ungainly crate the fastest contraband runner this side of the Veil Nebula.&lt;br/&gt;    New systems to support additional types of play, including rules for hacking, remote drones, and expert technical modification of gear and starships.&lt;br/&gt;    Upgraded tools for sandbox sector creation, with forty new world tags to help define a GM's stellar creations, guides for adding additional system points of interest, and material to help a GM define the interesting traits of the worlds they create. These tools aren't just a clump of random tables, they're a framework to boost your own creativity and help you make fast, good, playable material for your game.&lt;br/&gt;    Augmented adventure creation guidelines. Aside from a hundred piping-hot adventure seeds that mesh smoothly with the world creation tools, Stars Without Number: Revised Edition also includes content to help you turn your vague ideas into a playable evening's adventure. Guidelines on challenges, rewards, and complications in play are all aimed toward the working GM, the man or woman who's not just theorizing their adventures, but actually responsible for making something fun for the whole group.&lt;br/&gt;    Tools for creating aliens, Virtual Intelligences, and hostile human foes, with guidelines for handling potentially-hostile encounters and creating the kind of fearsome xenobeasts that can challenge the doughtiest explorer. Or perhaps you want to be an alien or robot? You'll find the tools for that in Stars Without Number: Revised Edition.&lt;br/&gt;    Faction rules, for handling the background warring and intrigues of hostile groups. Need to add life and motion to your stellar sectors? Sprinkle in a few factions to make news for the PCs to respond to, or use these rules to handle the colonies, spy agencies, mercenary companies, or other enterprises your heroes establish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So leap forward, brave adventurer! The stars await you, and the wild glories of an untamed sky!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
