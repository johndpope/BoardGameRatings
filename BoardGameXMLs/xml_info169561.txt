			<description>Insight Out is &amp;quot;the game that gets your family talking.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The easy-to-learn format is perfect for any child age 3 or older.  Two sets of age-appropriate question cards promote communication and discussion with children of any age.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insight Out is a roll-and-move game in which players move their cards along a track, drawing cards and answering questions or performing actions based on the spaces they land on.  Questions are designed to stimulate discussion among family members, and there are two levels--for younger and older children.  If a player chooses not to answer the question or do the action drawn, he or she may go back to the original space and re-roll once.  If the re-roll also results in drawing a card, then the player must do the action on the card or go back to the original space and lose his or her turn.  The winner is the first player to reach the Finish space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An advanced game adds a few extra rules, such as spaces where cards may be given to another player and the need to roll the exact number to land on the finish space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
