			<description>Players must travel around the Austrian city of Vienna in a tram, All the points of arrival has facts about the stops along the route. A die is used for movement. Quiz questions need answering at some point and the correct answers are within the rules. The winner is the first player to complete his route and return home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I only have a reproduction of this game and I have no idea when it was first made. My edition is from the 1980's but the original must be over a hundred years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
