			<description>Experience all the thrills and excitement of Major League Baseball.  You are the manager of a National or American League team vying for first place and on to the World Series.  Everyone can play.  Your six year old (by the roll of dice) plays right alongside Mom and Dad while they answer the Trivia question cards.   There are over 500 True and False, multiple choice or direct response questions on 100 cards.  All this happens on two different parts of the unique gameboard with Manager and Umpire cards getting into the act adding to the frustration and momentum that are all part of the real baseball world.   This is an officially licensed product of Major League Baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
