							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombacalypse (Savage Worlds Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have completed the overhaul of Zombacalypse for Savage Worlds! Weighing in at 99 pages of content, this book has been completely examined and converted from its &amp;AElig;ther roots into a pure Savage Worlds product. Tables have been clarified and made to be easier to read, and the information within is strictly for Savage worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like the original book, it contains 30 adventure hooks and the adventure Behind Enemy Lines, set in the American Civil War. It still contains all of the information from the original version of the book, which has been positively compared to other game products such as All Flesh Must Be Eaten. Usable to enhance your other zombie adventures and campaigns, this book contains information for the Savage Worlds Zombies as well as 13 zombie qualities to make them easier or harder to fight. Suggestions for using them in a wide variety of settings and zombie creation methods are included as are lists of improvised weapons and explosive devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If that wasn't enough, there are 11 example zombies in addition to the standard Savage Worlds zombie from the Savage Worlds Core Book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a taste of what's inside:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An Expanded Adventure Hook, Behind Enemy Lines&lt;br/&gt;     11 Fully stated Zombie types, plus the original Zombie from the Savage Worlds Core Book&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for making your zombies according to 13 qualities found in movies and other media&lt;br/&gt;     Rules of improvising weapons and creation of explosives to deal with the zombie horde&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
