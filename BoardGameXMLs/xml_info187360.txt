			<description>Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neo-Hunt 2 is a round-based board and card game for 3-6 players.  Each player controls a single &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; (a bio-engineered humanoid reptile).  The goal of the game is to kill other players' &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; and to eliminate &amp;quot;trooper&amp;quot; units (game tokens).  Play continues until only one &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; remains or until all &amp;quot;trooper&amp;quot; units are destroyed.  If multiple &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; units remain then scores are tallied to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is randomly created by assembling it from hexagonal sector tiles.  Players are given one random &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; card and one &amp;quot;trooper&amp;quot; card; &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; units are initially deployed in a hidden state.  &amp;quot;Trooper&amp;quot; units are then places sequentially on the board.  Players then draw a full hand of action cards and play begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds in &amp;quot;rounds&amp;quot; during which each player gets a turn.  Each player's &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; can make an attack upon a unit it can see, either &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;trooper&amp;quot;.  Successful attacks deal damage (which may be insufficient to remove a unit).  Destroyed units are removed and scored.  Players also draw special cards and may play them, taking whatever action is described.  After the players have moved all &amp;quot;trooper&amp;quot; units then move or fire at visible &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; units following a basic rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is print-and-play and published for free access via HTML.  Components and rules are downloadable in PDF format.  Color printing is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
