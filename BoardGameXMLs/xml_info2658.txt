			<description>&amp;quot;Integralis - The big free-for-all at the bookbinding shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integralis is a game about the bitter fight to fulfill jobs. In this game, you are the leader of a project team in a bookbinding shop. Together with your team (your cards) you try to handle the mountain of incoming job. There are small orders, which are relatively easy to fill but yield only small profit, and big orders, for which a great deal of work must be done. Big jobs also bring big profits, however. The prize that our team receives for a successfully completed job is dependent on the number of tasks. However, the number of machines is limited and the competition among the teams is rough. No methods are shunned in the constant effort to keep away opposing workers or hinder their performance, not even bribery or sabotage. The only thing that matters at the end of the game is which team has the most money.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-From English rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
