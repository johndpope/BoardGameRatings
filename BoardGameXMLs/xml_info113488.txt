			<description>Shooter fans deserve more. And those who haven&amp;rsquo;t discovered the pleasure of twin stick destruction deserve an entry point. Introducing Waves, a twin stick shooter that can be played by anyone, but with a high enough skill threshold to keep even the most hardened shooter fan entertained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waves has been built from the ground up to be accessible, yet require mountains of skill to master. It cuts away the fluff and boils everything down to what&amp;rsquo;s really important: Highscores.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to clear the arena of enemies while racking up a big fat Combo with swift kills and well timed Bombs and if it all gets a bit too much you can use your Time Buffer to slow down the action and turn defeat into victory. Players can compete across five different game modes with online high-score tables and Achievements in their pursuit of perfection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KEY FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Slow down time at will with the Time Buffer.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Decimate enemies with well timed bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Chain together kills for massive combos.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Battle against your friends scores with the online leaderboards.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Keyboard/Mouse and Dual Analogue Controls &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Awesome soundtrack by the one and only SMILETRON.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME MODES:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 3 minutes to get the highest score you can in Crunch Time &amp;ndash; Perfect for boiling an egg.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Level up and defeat the fearsome Cubes to extend your time in Rush.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 3 Lives and more baddies than you can eat but watch out for ambushes in Survival.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Bombing Run is all about the Boom. No guns but lots and lots of Boom. BOOM!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Challenge puts your skills to the test with 20 levels and only 30 seconds each &amp;ndash; Try and 5-Star them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
