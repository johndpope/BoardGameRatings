							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Brain Game</name>
									
			<description>Fast-paced, trivia-laced, fun entertainment for the whole family. The objective is to race to &amp;ldquo;the brain&amp;rdquo;. With a flurry of flashing lights and sounds, the 3-D brain randomly chooses one of six categories. Then you choose one of three difficulty levels. Watch out &amp;ndash; board events can quickly change the destiny of the game, so it takes more than brains to win. Great for developing thinking and social skills. For 2 to 4 players, play a long or short version. Includes game board, electronic brain, 280 question cards, 4 playing pieces, 2 dice. Requires 2 AA batteries, not included. Ages 9 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
