							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wraiths</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the wraith. While the numerous spectral undead can be somewhat difficult to keep track of (the category includes, but is not limited to, allips, banshees, ghosts, poltergeists, shadows, spectres, and wraiths), each of the wraiths in this tome is formed when a creature dies under certain circumstances, and is animated by the rage or despair surrounding the circumstances of its death. The first wraith in the book, the plague wraith (CR 7), is created by plague victims who are shut away and left to die by the healthy. They carry a number of deadly diseases, including the dreaded wraith&amp;rsquo;s wasting, which slowly transforms the victim into a plague wraith himself, and they can possess the bodies of those suffering from diseases. The second wraith is the lifedrinker wraith (CR 9), whose touch instills a deadly curse that blocks healing, and which can drain the life force from victims in a 30-ft.-cone. Finally, there is the doom wraith (CR 14), which spawns large number of standard wraiths from the creatures it kills, and can leave foes in an apathetic stupor, though it can be fought by the power of concentrated hope and goodwill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
