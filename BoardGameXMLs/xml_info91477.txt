			<description>I think some of the best games have a number of characteristics in common: they have simple rules, they are quick and they have a high replayability factor. The Stonehenge games are a good example of this. With this in mind, I recalled a number of these games and all of a sudden, there was the idea of creating a game of my own; a quick racing game with easy rules and a high replayability factor: Stonerush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 3&amp;ndash;5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: The players are druids who come home to Stonehenge after a hard days work. As part of their daily ritual (or just having fun), they try to be the first to run around the great stone circle. The player whose druid arrives first on case 30 of the outer ring is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: - The board&lt;br/&gt;- The number cards: you will need all the cards, except the &amp;quot;night&amp;quot;-cards from 13 to 30.&lt;br/&gt;- The trilithon cards&lt;br/&gt;- The 5 figures, also called druids (even with 3 or 4 players!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a figure reaches case 30 of the outer ring, the players reveal their trilithon card. The player whose color matches that of the figure that reached case 30 is the winner. If this color belongs to no-one (for example in a 3-player game), the winner is the player who has advanced the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant: for a quicker game, use the bluestones as the racing track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
