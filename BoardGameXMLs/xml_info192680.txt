			<description>Psychological game or training for self-discovery and group dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Up to 8 players can participate. On a players turn he draws a card of a selected difficulty level (beginners, advanced, professional) and decides to fulfill one of the tasks of that card (red = creativity, yellow = interaction/confrontation, blue = self-discovery, green = articulation). The other players decide how good the task was performed and the active player received rewards in coloured tiles that he can place on the board in the pattern he likes.&lt;br/&gt;Over the time the board is filled with the patterns of the individual players. You can play either until the board is filled or for a certain time. All players are winners as they know more about themselves than before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
