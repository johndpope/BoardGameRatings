							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oh Peg It</name>
									
			<description>This is a roll and move game with two different playing pieces: pegs and circles (otherwise known as bolts and washers). There are three of each in three colors (black, white and orange. There also is a set of 40 Oh Peg It cards, each with a familiar saying that swaps out a word and replaces it with &amp;quot;peg&amp;quot;, and instructions for gaining or losing spaces or points. There is a set of 200 small dried beans as scoring tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player takes either a set of pegs or one of circles, and rolls one die per turn. He may split the roll between two pieces. If a peg and circle land on the same space, both players score: the pegger (piece landing) gets two points and the player pegged gets one point. The game ends when one player reaches the end of the track with all his pieces, and the winner is the one with the most points at that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three kinds of special spaces: Double Score does just that for both players pegging on one; Oh Peg It means taking a card from the deck and following instructions; and Chastity Square means no pegging here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sexual allusions in this Summer of Love era game are pretty obvious throughout. Aside from the male-female pegging mechanism, the cards also include sayings like &amp;quot;I could have pegged all night&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;We'd rather peg than fight&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Pegging makes the heart grow fonder&amp;quot;. A second deck of blank cards is provided for those who want to get more daring or creative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
