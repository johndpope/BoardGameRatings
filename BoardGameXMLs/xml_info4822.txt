			<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HARD DRIVE HOMICIDE -or- Who Offed the Icon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Sillycon Valley, California, and to the Boardroom of Snaphu Software, Inc., where you've been summoned by the CEO himself, Major Hugh G. Snaphu, to attend an urgent late-night business meeting. The reason for the meeting remains a mystery, though the Major did mention in his email that &amp;quot;the sparks would be flying.&amp;quot; Could Snaphu Software have slipped from the #1 spot in the hard-core software wars? And why did the Major invite his main competitor, Bill D. Phences, CEO of MacroHard, Inc.? And what is the secret behind Snaphu Software's meteoric rise to the top anyway, especially since, prior to owning his company, Major Snaphu had been an Airforce jet jockey, and knew nothing about software? In any case, this is one meeting that's sure to be murder . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALSO ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MEETING WILL BE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Florence &amp;quot;Flo&amp;quot; P. Disque, the lovely and luscious Personal Administrative Assistant to Major Hugh G. Snaphu, CEO of Snaphu Software. Highly efficient and energetic, Flo is a master at anticipating the needs of her boss, aware of what he wants even before he asks. She's gung ho and outgoing, and known to be gutsy when going after a goal. And despite working in a corporate setting, as a former cosmetics salesperson, Flo prefers the most feminine of fashions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bill D. Phences, now in second place in the software wars, thanks to Major Hugh G. Snaphu's meteoric rise to the top. Yet Bill is still called the King of the Computer Software Industry, since his company, MacroHard, held the #1 position for years. With an IQ of 392, Bill is not only resourceful and rich, but known to be ruthless when it comes to the competition. He always wears a business suit and glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvey &amp;quot;Har&amp;quot; D. Riive, a computer software engineer who graduated from MIT before he'd even acquired all his permanent teeth. A true child prodigy, he is now Snaphu Software's top technical talent, helping the company rein high above the rest. Brilliant and baby-faced, Har is far too busy to find time for fun, let alone notice the change in fashions. Thus his wardrobe tends to be slightly outdated. As an asthmatic, he carries his inhaler wherever he goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C.D. Rhomme, the wise and wondrous Head of Accounting for Snaphu Software, who is highly qualified when it comes to calculating. Born and raised in Arizona, C. D. has always had an aptitude for arithmetic. Often described as being amicable and equitable, C. D. appreciates people as well as corporate profits. When it comes to clothing, C.D. is thankful for the latest trend in &amp;quot;Business Casual&amp;quot; attire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Margaret &amp;quot;Mar&amp;quot; Keating, the marvelous Director of Marketing at Snaphu Software. Pretty as well as professional, Mar is known for her niceness, and sometimes considered too naive for the hard core world of computer software. But Mar often defends herself by saying, &amp;quot;I'm only kind until someone crosses my path. Then that's the last stupid thing they do.&amp;quot; Mar wears nothing but business suits and professional attire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sergei &amp;quot;Ser&amp;quot; F. Dinette, the Director of the Shipping Department at Snaphu Software. As a former United States Postal worker, Ser thrives on efficiency. But in his job and with his work load, efficiency counts. For as far as he's concerned, the Shipping Department is the pulse of the company. Direct and determined, Ser is a big believer in honest and up-front communication. He prefers to wear military-type clothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. Leanne Baybee, the gorgeous gal pal of Major Hugh G. Snaphu. Yet despite her striking good looks, Leanne truly subscribes to the maxim that beauty is only skin deep. Unique, extravagant and known to be an independent thinker, she might be considered unusual by the average citizen. But she hardly cares about criticism from the mediocre masses, as she lives by her own set of standards. Of course, she has an exceptional sense of fashion, one that always flatters her features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S. P. Anaugge, a computer software engineer new to Snaphu Software. Dedicated and detail-oriented, S.P. is determined to make a good impression, and not afraid to work long, long hours, sometimes staying at the office late at night when no one else is around. For S.P. knows that perseverance and persistence can bring great rewards, not to mention an early retirement. Wanting to fit in with the company dress code, S.P. wears appropriate professional attire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is the ultimate in easy entertaining! In fact, it's the kind of game where you can call a bunch of friends the day before and put the party on the next night. It's written for food delivery and the costumes only require your guests to go to their closets. Plus, two of the characters, C.D. Rhomme and S.P. Anaugge, can be played as either male or female characters, so you don't have to worry about getting an even number of men and women. Like I said, it's the absolute easiest mystery game to host!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And because the setting is a late-night business meeting, I suggest serving the food on paper plates and using plastic utensils. The drinks can be served in mismatched coffee cups, since people in a work environment would each have their own coffee mug. To make things even more fun, I'd also recommend hanging a few pie charts around, showing the comparison between Snaphu Software and MacroHard Software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides all that, these are some of the funniest characters we've ever created. Flo P. Disque is cosmetically challenged, and A. Leanne Baybee is absolutely . . . well . . . you'll just have to play the game and find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
