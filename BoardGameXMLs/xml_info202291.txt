			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Far from Home, characters are called Saviors. They roam the universe in search of hubs, massive cities once built by humans, to reactivate the lost technology they contain and bring back the light in humanity deceased empire. Most of these hubs are now shadows of their former self, only housing a few humans in their machine bodies and their robotic helpers to maintain the knowledge and glory of humanity. When meeting a Savior, humans generally react favorably, seeing them as the hope they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find centuries ago. They still see them as weird creatures though, for people who lived millennia in their machines bodies, such a flesh and blood creature is frightening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
