							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Space Bar</name>
									
			<description>The Space Bar is an adventure game co-developed by Boffo Games and published by Rocket Science Games and SegaSoft  in 1997. The game featured a 3-D environment which allowed the player to rotate (as opposed to Rocket Science's earlier production Obsidian  in which the camera was usually fixed), and a humorous cast of aliens in the framework of a mystery. The player fills the role of a detective, interacting with characters and objects via a first-person interface. The name itself is a pun, as the game takes place in a bar in outer space--literally a &amp;quot;space bar&amp;quot; rather than the space bar found on a computer's keyboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, The Space Bar , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
