							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eternal War of the Candy Realms!</name>
									
			<description>A candy themed card battling game, where players compete to win real piles of sweet loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I noticed that there aren't a lot of games that both kids and adults would want to play.  Either games skew too young, and parents get bored... or the games engage only adults and are way too complex for a child.  So this one has a lot of references aimed at the 20-40 year age range, but is totally family-appropriate for most kids 8 and over!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gimmick is that each player brings a pile of real sweets (or a candy substitute of your choosing) to fuel their warriors in battle against each other, with a &amp;quot;Land Card&amp;quot; mechanism that keeps it from becoming &amp;quot;pay-to-win&amp;quot;.  Its perfect for gatherings with a lot of snacks, or for the holidays when there are lots of sweets to be divided up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why would you want to win a giant pile of candy?   Candy is awesome!   Who doesn't want first dibs on a giant pile of candy!?  Plus, you can share it with your friends and family, silly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
