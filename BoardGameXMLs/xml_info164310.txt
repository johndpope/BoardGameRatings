			<description>From the Front Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cult of the Dragon has come to Phlan, a lawless refuge on the Moonsea. Now, with no significant authority to stop the cult, other power groups in the Realms - The Harpers, Order of the Gauntlet, Emerald Enclave, Lords' Alliance, and even the Zhentarim - must unite to stop the cult from fulfilling its dark purpose in the city. Join the fight by participating in any one of five different missions aimed at stopping the cult. An introductory adventure for 1st-level characters.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Defiance in Phlan, a D&amp;amp;D Expeditions adventure, part of the official D&amp;amp;D Adventurers League organized play system and the Tyranny of Dragons storyline season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This introductory adventure is designed for three to seven 1st- level characters, and is optimized for five 1st level characters. It can also be played by 2nd level characters, although those characters might have a much easier time playing the adventure. Characters outside this level range cannot participate in this adventure. Players with ineligible characters can create a new 1st-level character or use a pregenerated character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is broken up into five mini-adventures, each of which takes approximately one hour to complete. A group can play through any or all of these adventures in whatever order they choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
