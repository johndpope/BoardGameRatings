			<description>Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls is a 1994 American-produced sequel to Technos Japan's Double Dragon series.[4] Unlike the previously produced Double Dragon games, Technos had little or no credited involvement in the development of the game outside of licensing the series' name to publisher Tradewest (the publisher of the first Double Dragon and Super Double Dragon). Instead, the game was developed by Leland Interactive Media, a subsidiary of Tradewest. Unlike the previous games, which were side-scrolling fighting action games or beat-em-ups, Shadow Falls is a Street Fighter II-style head-to-head fighting game based on the animated Double Dragon TV series. Technos would later produce its own fighting game based on the Double Dragon movie the following year simply titled Double Dragon for the Neo Geo. Shadow Falls was originally released for the Super NES and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and later released for the Atari Jaguar by Telegames in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
