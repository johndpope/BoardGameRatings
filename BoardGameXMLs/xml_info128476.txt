			<description>A simple children's racing game themed around the story of the kobold Pumuckl (a character from a German radio play and TV series for children).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master Eder (the carpenter with whom Pumuckl lives) has discovered mice in his workshop and is going to bring in the neighbour's cat to catch them. Pumuckl has one last night to play with his little friends before the cat gets there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a player's piece symbolizing a mouse. The mouse is put on the mousehole of the same colour. The cards - which show either a picture of Master Eder (3x) or die spots from 1 to 6 - are placed face down in the middle of the board. The cheese tokens are placed on the corresponding spaces on the board. When a player rolls the die, he/she has to turn over one of the nine cards. If the number of spots on the die is the same as that on the card, the player gets to move his/her mouse that number of spaces. If a card showing Master Eder is turned over, the mouse is scared and hides inside the last mousehole it has passed. A player who has collected two cheese tokens gets to advance to the next mousehole. A player who lands on a Pumuckl space has to make a grimace and then rolls again. The game ends when the first mouse safely reaches its own mousehole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
