			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game presentation requires some degree of familiarity with QR Codes and methods for interpreting them as a byte stream which, in turn, can be read as text.  The game itself is presented as a single QR Code containing the rules.  The design rationale behind this presentation was an attempt to conform to the design challenge theme of &amp;quot;a different audience&amp;quot; - here, the intended audience is a tech savvy one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is very free-form.  It provides a &amp;quot;dream-world&amp;quot; setting that permeates the &amp;quot;real-world&amp;quot; and encourages players to seek out and surreptitiously record hidden messages which will presumably lead them to other players of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
