							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">International Football Whist</name>
									
			<description>The game is played with 4 players in teams of two. 44 cards are used, consisting of 4 teams numbered 1 to 11 representing footballers from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales from the 1940s. The object of the game is to move the ball counter into your opponents' goal and thus score. The ball can only be moved along the lines drawn on the playing board. This is achieved by winning tricks as per normal whist. However, trumps are chosen by the starting player who moves the ball onto a team's badge (which become trumps) on the playing board. The winner of the trick may move the ball one space. If the trick is won by leading with a trump, 2 spaces may be moved. When a goal is scored, the ball is returned to the centre spot and the player to the left of the scorer starts. The game ends when the cards are exhausted twice, once for half time and again for the end of the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
