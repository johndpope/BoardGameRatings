			<description>This track game is based on the Disney movie. You use the Magic Wand (which is gummy at one end) to pick up cards from a stack that tell you how far to move your slipper piece along the track (past various scenes from the film). When you reach the Castle space at the end, you reach into a bag and try to pull out a Slipper whose color matches your playing piece. If it does, you win. If it doesn't, you go back to the Pumpkin space and must approach the Castle again. A version without the Wand, and using a card draw at the Castle instead of the Slipper bag, was released in 1965.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
