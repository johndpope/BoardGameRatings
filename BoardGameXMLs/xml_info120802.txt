			<description>NeoGeo Battle Coliseum (abbreviated NGBC or NBC) is a 2 on 2 tag team fighting game for the Atomiswave arcade board. The game features characters from several titles published by SNK and ADK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot Line:  In February, 2017 of the new Japanese era there is a man trying to rule the NEOGEO World. &amp;quot;I will topple NeoGeo's most powerful warriors and put myself on the throne!&amp;quot;. We knew that if he managed to obtain NeoGeo world's awesome power, world domination would not be far from his reach. This man, who sat at the heart of the &amp;quot;WAREZ Conglomerate&amp;quot; with overwhelming financial power behind him, had already set out on his ambitious path to gain NeoGeo World's power. Those who knew the truth of his intentions were already trembling with fear... As NeoGeo World drew closer to the verge of disaster, a WAREZ sponsored fighting competition was announced. This event is called &amp;quot;NEOGEO BATTLE COLISEUM&amp;quot;. The Federal Government is worried about the situation, and has secretly dispatched its two best secret agents, Yuki and Ai. A world on the verge of eternal darkness... The future of NEOGEO World is now in the hands of the warriors.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system of the arcade NGBC, as previously mentioned, is a 2 vs. 2 tag battle, regardless of how many players are playing. While the 2-player game system is similar to most tag-team systems of other games, the single player system is unusual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's single play is more like a survival battle, where the player must beat enemies after enemies as long as possible. However, the game gives the player 300 seconds, and when time-out occurs, instead of win or lose, the player will face the boss (depending on how well they perform). Only at this point of time is when time out will determine the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a single-play, the rule is to defeat any member of the team, not both team members. That is, unlike most tag-team systems (but similar to Kizuna Encounter or Tekken Tag Tournament), where all opposition must be beaten in order to win, in NGBC the player only needs to beat up one member of the opposite team to win, without the need to fight the other member if the former is defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survival battles are divided into rounds of 3 battles, and after a player manages to clear 3 opponent teams, they are given a chance to use one of the three game services provided:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is to gain more time. Extra time helps the player to beat more teams, which is so because the game records the number of teams defeated in the hi-score table.&lt;br/&gt;    The second is to gain full power gauge. This is simply to blow the opposition away as soon as the next battle starts.&lt;br/&gt;    The third is adding more life. Self-explanatory, especially due to the winning condition mentioned earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, if the player loses and chooses to continue, they're given the option to use one of three continue services to help give them a boost getting back into the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first takes your opponent's life gauge down to 1/4 full.&lt;br/&gt;    The second fully maxes out the player's special move gauge.&lt;br/&gt;    The third adds more time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Assault&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also abbreviated as D-Assault, it's one of the new super moves in this game, when the character makes a rush attack that, if connected successfully, calls the partner to perform together a special tag team autocombo, similar to games like Marvel vs Capcom or Tekken Tag Tournament. In addition to that, certain characters have special D-Assaults. Here are some of the possible combinations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuki and Ai have 2 different D-Assaults, depending of the leader character. If the leader is Yuki, he calls Ai and they combine their powers and transform into Atomic Guy (one of the monsters from King of the Monsters) for a few seconds, and all his attacks are unblockable.&lt;br/&gt;    In the case of Ai, she calls Yuki and both create a super attack which shocks all opponents on-screen. The name of this move is ASO II: Last Guardian.&lt;br/&gt;    Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami make the technique they both used in KOF 97 to defeat Orochi. In this attack, Iori grabs his opponent by the neck while Kyo charges a devastating blow.&lt;br/&gt;    Terry Bogard and Rock Howard share special D-Assault attacks, rightly named &amp;quot;Storm and Stream&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Buster and Storm&amp;quot;. It's a combination of their famous supers with variations depending of the leader character; either being a Shining Knuckle/Power Stream combo or a Buster Wolf/Raging Storm combo.&lt;br/&gt;    Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia both attack with their signature Zan Retsu Ken/Genn'ei Kyaku moves and later make a backjump finishing with a double Haohshokoken, while the background goes black and a dragon and a tiger (that represent Ryo and Robert, respectively) appear on the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Neo Geo Battle Coliseum&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
