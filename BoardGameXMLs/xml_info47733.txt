							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lady in Distress</name>
									
			<description>Lady in Distress (mission module TS 003) was written for GenCon XIV.  The module can be played as a tournament event or as part of a campaign and instructions for how to do this are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module places the player agents in the role of a strike team sent to neutralize a terrorist group, lead by Manuel de Gama, that has seized the cruise ship M/S Corona.  The cruise ship just happens to be transporting microbiologist Dr. Miguel Salcedo and a sample of his new deadly strain of bacteria, so players must be careful not to contaminate the passengers.  The module is intended for 5-7 players and includes 6 pre-generated characters originally used for tournament play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
