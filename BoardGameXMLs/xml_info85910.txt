			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He said, &amp;quot;Ogham is a gift from the Mother Goddess to her children, the druids. She gave it to her son, Oghma, the Danann warrior-poet, and he in turn gave it to us. It is a language of nature, of magic. It is as deceptively simple as some notches on a rock, but it hides the secrets of creation.&amp;quot; I told him I wanted to learn the secrets of ogham, thinking he would do as every other adult around me had always done, laugh and shoo me away. But he didn?t. &amp;quot;You are not a druid,&amp;quot; he said, and my heart sunk. &amp;quot;You are a bard, a fili, and you must fulfill that destiny first. When you are a fili come back to see me, and I will teach you then.&amp;quot; It was twenty-two years before I went back to study with Connor McCroghan, but he was still waiting for me, and indeed he taught me the secrets of ogham. And it is in his honor and memory that I created the ogham stone that today marks his resting place.&lt;br/&gt;- From the journal of Amergin &amp;Oacute; M&amp;iacute;l&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bardic Lore: Ogham details this ancient Irish written language for your d20 Fantasy game. Learn the history and myth of this once-secret language, and infuse your campaign with its runic magic, allowing druids to tap into the very magic of nature. Includes a short history, an ogham reference chart, notes on ogham magic and its place in the world, as well as magical ogham stones, two new feats, including the powerful Scribe Ogham, and Lore/Knowledge information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
