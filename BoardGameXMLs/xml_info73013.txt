							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness â€“ Episode One</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Modified Penny Arcade Adventures is an adventure game which mixes 3D gameplay with 2D interstitials and cinematics. The gameplay consists mostly of seek-and-find puzzles, reminiscent of adventure games, where the player must collect items and return them to a character to advance the plot. They can also collect spare robot parts to upgrade their weapons. Battles consist of a real time combat system similar to the ATB system of Final Fantasy Games, with context sensitive button presses reducing damage or being used to carry out special attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with the narrator reading the first verse of a poem, later called The Quartet for the Dusk of Man. The player then designs a character of their choosing; with an introduction in the 1920s suburban neighborhood of the Player. A mysterious voice instructs the Player, whose home is quickly destroyed by a giant steampunk robot, while smaller ones attack. After a brief tutorial, the player teams up with Tycho Brahe, a scholar of Apocalyptic Studies turned detective, and his exceedingly violent partner who fought with the devil, Johnathan Gabriel, in search of information on the robots.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Penny_Arcade_Adventures:_On_the_Rain-Slick_Precipice_of_Darkness,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
