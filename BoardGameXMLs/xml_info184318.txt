							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hawkridge Hideout</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find Hawkridge Hideout, it's because someone wants you to find it. The Hawkridge Hills have always been a lonely place, which is why they were chosen to be the site of a tomb, centuries before. And when a group of bandits came to the area, it seemed the perfect location for their hideout. Nestled in a small cave at the back of the ancient tomb, the site is easily defended, and is now full of the spoils of the robbers industry. And if someone comes looking for trouble and doesn't back down, there's always a secret escape route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 20 x 20 map depicting a hideout in a cave, behind an abandoned tomb. Ruins stand amid the trees outside, and the tomb is reached via a small set of stairs. The occupants of the hideout have built a simple barricade of boxes and barrels, and inside the cave, accessed from behind a tomb, the bandits have space to store their goods and sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
