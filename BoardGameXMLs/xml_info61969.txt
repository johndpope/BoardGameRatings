							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Maze of Screaming Silence</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far, far beyond the lands most men know, lies the cruel and mysterious Empire of Yagga-Kong &amp;mdash; a mountain domain so distant and so deadly that few travelers have returned to speak its name. As wicked and as ancient as the Yagga-Kong are, they are only a shadow of the monstrous Nameless Ones who came before them. The Nameless Ones vanished millennia ago, victims of their cruel gods and unclean appetites, but they left two artifacts behind. A maze, built at an insane, nearly unlivable altitude, and the terrible,&lt;br/&gt;thirsty thing that dwells there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a thousand years, Yagga-Kong have offered a fabulous reward to anyone who can find their way through&lt;br/&gt;the maze. Every generation or so, someone lives to claim it. Will you be the first this century? Then come to the Last Redoubt, where the mountains scrape the dome of the sky and the air makes men bleed from their ears. Come walk the twisted streets of the City of the Damned and brave the depths of the Maze of Screaming Silence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
