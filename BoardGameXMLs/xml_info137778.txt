			<description>Trivia cards about baseball legends past and present with over 200 different trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;With questions on each card getting progressively more challenging &amp;ndash; starting with &amp;ldquo;Rookie League&amp;rdquo; questions for young fans and ending with &amp;ldquo;Hall of Fame&amp;rdquo; questions for true baseball aficionados.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read the question out loud and try to answer the question correctly. If you answer correctly, pat yourself on the&lt;br/&gt;back and score a card. If you answer incorrectly, try to make up&lt;br/&gt;an excuse to justify your lack of baseball knowledge&lt;br/&gt;When you are done the card, move to the next card.&lt;br/&gt;Who has the most cards at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
