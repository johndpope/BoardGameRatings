			<description>Elementabble is like a game of scrabble with a scientific twist.&lt;br/&gt;The Players use tiles to form words on a gameboard, but instead of the Alphabet the tiles show the chemical elements of the periodic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Player draws 10 tiles and gets two &amp;quot;-273,15 &amp;deg;C&amp;quot; tiles. A new word has to cover one of two startingpoints on the board or use at least one element of a word already on the board or be separated by an absolute zero tile from a word on the board.&lt;br/&gt;Some Elements can also be used as Joker, in that case you cannot get points from them.&lt;br/&gt;The Player score points according to the atomic numbers or the atomic mass (e.g. if a Joker element is used as the element and not as Joker). There are Bonus Points for longer words.&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games Ends when one player reaches at least 1000 Points, no one made a new word for two rounds or a Player forms the word &amp;quot;Schluss&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;end&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;The single player game ends at reaching 4500 Points or if the player exchanges three tiles in a row without forming a new word. The game is lost if the Player didn't reach 4500 Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
