							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters of the Entropy Wars 2: Magurishta&#039;s Menagerie</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's such a charming thing. There it floats, fluttering purple and pretty on the ocean current, like a gentle painting of a jellyfish come to life. It would be quite a peaceful scene if everything else weren't swimming away in a blind panic. Also, if there weren't forty more rising from the depths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters of the Entropy Wars: Magurishta's Menagerie is a pack of three monsters, rating CR 0.5, 4, and 5. Inside, you will receive stats for the Brineslayer, the Bloodshrike, and the Arboreal Stalker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brineslayer is a sea jelly that mindlessly hunts in swarms and dissolves living flesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bloodshrike is a small, finch-like bird that will adamantly, if unwisely, attack creatures many times larger than itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the Arboreal Stalker is the cross between a dire weasel and a gnomish nightmare lurking in the trees ready to pounce and eat hapless adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pack, you'll find a full stat block for each monster, art, and strategy ideas for how to implement them in-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
