			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know that moment when your players have slain the bad guy and his minions ... the moment where the normally upright and righteous characters become total fiends and loot the still cooling dead bodies ... well, this is for those moments. And let's face it those moments come along a lot!&lt;br/&gt;This list contains 100 trinkets and curiosities that will make the pilfering more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;Not a gold coin or gemstone amongst them this list of items contains more unusual items - mysterious notes, items, potions, keys, items of clothing ... the list goes on.*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All handily laid out in a numbered 1-100 table so you can roll percentage dice each time a character loots a corpse and surprise them with something they just won't have seen coming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items have few in-game mechanical effects (although some do, mostly they are designed to encourage story-telling and story hook potential ... what does the key open ... who brewed that potion ... who's disgusting handkerchief is this?*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get the idea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus Content:&lt;br/&gt;Honestly, because there was some space left on the last page we also wrote and included, just for you, a:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6-part Shadowfell Random Events Table&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;it was that or leave a page half blank and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do that to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     At The Grinning Frog, we have written over 30 of these lists - most generic with a few themed. That's over 600 different items that players might find in pockets or backpacks ... the examples listed above aren't guaranteed to be in this specific list but we do guarantee that there will be lots of cool, interesting trinkets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list has a Shadowfell theme so suitable for any adventures on that plane. Also, perfect for any undead or vampire adventures and campaigns such as the Curse of Strahd etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
