			<description>Suzerain combines elements of Deckbuilding with more traditional Trick Taking games. Throughout the game players will be playing to tricks in order to gain cards from the middle. After a trick the card gained, and the one used to gain it, will go into the player's discard pile. When a player plays their last card in hand their discard pile becomes their new hand and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is based upon sets of ranked cards as well as the Pawns and Courts which interact with certain ranked cards for bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for the Decktet; a deck with 6 suits and many double-suited cards. For more information on the decktet visit decktet.com or check out the BGG listing for Decktet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
