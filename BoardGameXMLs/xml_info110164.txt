			<description>he Peace Keepers, released in Japan as Rushing Beat Shura (ラッシング・ビート 修羅). It is the third game in the Rushing Beat series, following Rival Turf! and Brawl Brothers, although the three games were localized as unrelated titles in North America. Presented in a &amp;frac34; perspective, the game is a beat 'em up which was released for the Super Nintendo.  The manual of the North American release details the localized story. The game takes place in the year 2015, after the &amp;quot;economic wars&amp;quot; of 2011. The Deutchland Moldavia (DM) corporation rules most of the world and its resources, conducting mysterious genetic experiments. Four people affected by DM's research- Flynn, Echo, Al and Prokop -seek revenge on the corporation for its wrongdoings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six selectable characters in the game; up to four players can play the main game mode simutaneously if the Super Multitap is connected. The game is a standard beat'em up game in which players face a slew of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The controls are the standard punch, special attack, taunt, jump and block. There are also super moves. The Peace Keepers has multiple endings with multiple branching paths, each path with its own boss fights and cut scenes. A versus mode is also available, in which two to four players can face each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Peace Keepers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
