			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scavengers was originally designed to be played as a short campaign, giving the players the opportunity to have their character go through an entire career as a space salvager. Several of the mechanics were made to support this: the increasing amount of danger points and the speed of which the characters acquired their wealth. Still, there is nothing in the way of using the game for longer campaigns, and the core book even offers some suggestions of what game mechanics that needs to be changed to achieve this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, a longer campaign dedicated only to looting can become stale and uninteresting, unless something more is offered to give it a sharper, dramatic edge. In this supplement are two extended campaigns to be used for Scavengers. Both of them increase the scope of the game, and make it better suited for longer campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is Magpies of War. Instead of being a regular salvager crew, the player characters are active participants in the galactic civil war. By finding important pieces of secret intelligence on shipwrecks, they can sell them to the warring factions for high profits. But they must beware, if one faction grows to strong, it may defeat the other factions, and put an end to the Randians' lucrative salvaging business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second campaign is Boardroom Salvagers. The PCs are not satisfied with getting rich of their salvaging, they want to be super wealthy. With the conclusion of their initial salvaging careers, the original crew forms a salvaging company, and hire employees to continue their work. In this campaign the players string together multiple characters, seeing how each of them fare in their career, how the company prospers throughout, and how powerful the original company founder can get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this supplement offers new threats. They are intended to be used mostly with the Magpies of War campaign, since they are tied to the intelligence gathering mechanics of this campaign; but they can easily be used in any Scavengers game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
