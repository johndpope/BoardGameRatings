			<description>Esso Baseball Challenge was a card game published by Imperial Oil (aka Esso in Canada) in 1988. It was a single deck of cards that contained various types of cards that represented calls in baseball (i.e. ground ball, single, home run, wild pitch, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players laid out the cards for the bases in the traditional diamond formation and then used runner cards to mark where their team's players were on those bases. Players took turns at bat/pitching. Based on the cards drawn, they moved their players around the bases and scored runs. Essentially, it used the same rules as baseball itself ... but they were simulated using a deck of specialty cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was distributed at Esso stations in Canada during the summer of 1988 (for about $2). For baseball fanatics, this was a fun diversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents of the deck:&lt;br/&gt;63 game cards&lt;br/&gt;4 base cards&lt;br/&gt;4 runner cards&lt;br/&gt;1 rules/sample score card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
