			<description>Hard Line is a 2 player game where the aim is to be the first player to get a winning line of 4 dice on the board. 16 dice (8 black, 8 white) are rolled at the start of the game are are not re-rolled at any point during the game. The dice may not be turned over. On his turn each player takes any die (of either color) and places it onto the board. There are several different types of lines that will win the game (all white, all black, all matching the color of the spaces they are placed on, a straight, all odd, all even), so you have to be very careful to watch for all the possibilities so that you don't set up an easy win for your opponent. Because the distribution of numbers will be different from game to game, you have to change the way you play accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
