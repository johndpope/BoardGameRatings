			<description>Mystique Pillars is a game for The Mystique Deck, in which 2&amp;ndash;6 players compete to play all the cards from their hands onto four growing pillars of cards.  The game is played in two phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Open draft phase, in which everyone gets to see which cards go into whose hands.&lt;br/&gt;     Building phase, in which everyone takes turns either:&lt;br/&gt;         &amp;hellip;playing a card onto a pillar by matching two attributes with the topmost card of that pillar, or&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;         &amp;hellip;drawing the top card from the deck, and covering the topmost card of a pillar with it &amp;mdash; no need to match anything.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
