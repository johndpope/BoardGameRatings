							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Milton Keynes Go</name>
									
			<description>A variant board for the classical game Go, based on a street map of Milton Keynes.  Milton Keynes has approximately grid-style plan, but the boundaries of the map are irregular, and there are four places where two &amp;quot;parallel&amp;quot; streets intersect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other rules are as in normal Go.  However, the tactical properties of the irregular boundary majorly affect gameplay:  for example, there are places where it is possible to create an eye by playing only one stone.  Also, because the Milton Keynes board (77 points) is much smaller than even the reduced-size 13&amp;times;13 Go board (169 points), the game is much shorter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created as a side event at the 2001 Milton Keynes Go Tournament, and subsequently made available on the Web as print-and-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
