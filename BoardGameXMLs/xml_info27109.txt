			<description>Players are property developers seeking to achieve the pre-determined victory conditions by aquiring property and selling at a profit. Income is gained from holding properties and getting rent,but along the way disasters can befall the struggling developer and there are the ever-present expenses to be paid. The winner is the first to achieve the pre-arranged victory conditions; these are agreed by the players and range from playing for a time limit to holding x number of properties and x amount of cash; thus the game length is variable based on the time avaiable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is produced and published privately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.Propertunity.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.Propertunity.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
