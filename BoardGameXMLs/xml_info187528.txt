			<description>Moon-Sun-Angel includes sixteen cubes, eight each in two colors, with each cube featuring the moon, sun and angel on three sides and having blank faces on the other three. Players takes turns placing one cube in the playing area, either on the game board or on another cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player can create a row of four cubes that feature the same symbol or color, that player wins. Alternately, a player can create two rows of three cubes to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a successful launch at the Tokyo Game Market in November 2015, a new edition was produced in January 2016 under the name e-SOLO-e (絵揃), which is a Japanese word that means &amp;quot;match symbols&amp;quot;. Three editions were produced, Spiritual (a copy of the original Moon-Sun_Angel edition), Japanesque (和風絵揃), and Cat World (Nekoten ねこの天使). The last had artwork by Shukoko Yamamoto based on her artwork of Cat Angels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
