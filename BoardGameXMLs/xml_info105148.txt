			<description>E6: The Game Inside the World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT IS E6?&lt;br/&gt;Earlier this year Ryan Dancey suggested that d20 has four distinct quartiles of play:&lt;br/&gt;Levels 1-5: Gritty fantasy &lt;br/&gt;Levels 6-10: Heroic fantasy &lt;br/&gt;Levels 11-15: Wuxia &lt;br/&gt;Levels 16-20: Superheroes&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been some great discussion about how to define those quartiles, and how each different quartile suited some groups better than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E6 is a game about those first 2 quartiles, and as a result, it has fewer rules, a low- magic flavor, and it is quick and easy to prepare. I have playtested the system extensively with my crew, and it works as intended. There seems to be a lot of lively debate about E6, and some real interest in how it works, so I&amp;rsquo;ve revised it here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
