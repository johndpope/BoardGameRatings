			<description>German Eagle vs Russian Bear is a war game that covers the action from 1941 to 1944 on the Eastern Front during World War 2.  The game offers several scenarios that let players recreate and replay the battles between the German and Soviet forces, such as Operations Barbarossa and Bagration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players alternate their turns to move and attack with their forces, rolling dice and consulting tables to determine if they have routed or eliminated enemy units.  Their combat is further affected by weather, terrain, and fortifications.  Supply lines also play a part in the players' strategic concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game lasts until it has reached a pre-agreed turn or a player has won by achieving his or her victory conditions, which usually involves controlling a certain amount of cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE DO NOT JUDGE/RATE GEvsRB BY ITS ANDROID VERSION!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
