			<description>Food for Thought is a trivia game based on food knowledge. Players must answer trivia questions in the categories agricultural, culinary/gourmet, cultural/historical, medicinal/nutritional, commercial, and pot luck categories.Once questions are successfully answered, players receive category cards, and the end of the game is achieved when a pre-agreed multiple of the different set cards is reached. The game board is similar to Trivial Pursuit in that it is a spoked wheel. When trying for the final answer, a punitive mechanism is used, whereby players providing a wrong answer must relinquish one of their victory cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
