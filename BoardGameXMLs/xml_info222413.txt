							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fussballspiel Fortuna</name>
									
			<description>Each player has 10 field players and one goalie. Movement is determined by a die. The direction may be changed once during movement. If a player gets on the same space as the ball he gets an extra move for the ball. The ball can't change direction during movement. The ball may move through occupied spaces. If the movement of the ball ends not on the space of a friendly field player, the opponent gets his turn. If the movement of the ball ends on one of the three numbered spaces in front of the goal, the goalie catches the ball, if he rolls one of the numbers shown on the space the ball is in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an agreed on playing time the player who gets the most goals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
