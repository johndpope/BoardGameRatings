							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Munda: Parara and Surrounding Islands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A map for the western side of New Georgia focusing on Parara and some of its surrounding islands, for use with the Arrghh Bottom Sound RPG.  This is part of the New Georgia campaign setting being slowly prepared for release- and due to techonology limitations (me more than the computer) the massive 'one mile to the hex' map of the New Georgia islands will eventually appear, first by one segement at a time maps such as this, then (please, hopefullly) a full map with all the cities, towns and other features for the campaign setting.  The names are drawn from a variety of sources, it seems the World War II names have been mostly replaced with other titles, plus a few fanciful insertions by me, so while the map is reasonably accurate for the loaction don't be too shocked to discover variations, this is intended for use in a fantasy RPG and not as an accurate representation of the islands at any one time in their history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
