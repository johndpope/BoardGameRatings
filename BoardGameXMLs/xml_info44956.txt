							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Back East: The North</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the 128-page sourcebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I'm A Yankee Doodle Dandy...&lt;br/&gt;A Yankee Doodle, do or...die? Lets hope not, pardner. It's time for your heroes to head Back East and see all those places their schoolmarms told them about; places that were the birthplace of the Union; places that have over a century of history behind them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eastern lawmen don't like anyone going heeled but themselves, so your heroes are going to need all their wits to survive the mean streets of the industrialized North. Visit the heavily-fortified captial of the Union, Washington, D.C. Take a train to New York City, but beware Boss Tweed and Tammany Hall once you get there. Journey to Philadelphia to investigate the Masonic Conspiracy, or off to Boston to see the strange denizens of the Fire Zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As if that wasn't enough, this 128-page sourcebook for the Origins Award-winning Deadlands roleplaying game comes complete with a whole passel of new abilities and fightin' maneuvers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? The evils infesting the heart of the Union aren't going to turn themselves in, pardner. It's time to saddle up and head Back East!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
