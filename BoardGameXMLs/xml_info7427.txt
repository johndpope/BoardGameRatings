			<description>Brings the thrill of the basketball court to your own easy chair. You and your opponent analyze your own plays -- choose your winning strategy. Game gives you all the results. Baskets scored -- fouls -- out of bounds, etc. The fun, action, and excitement of the basketball court. It's all here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic Data Controls Corporation released a series of electronic board games under their &amp;quot;Computer Games&amp;quot; line, primarily consisting of two-player sports games. The games all used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a  game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
