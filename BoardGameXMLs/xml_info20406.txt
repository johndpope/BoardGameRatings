			<description>Eagles of the Gulf !, part I was published in Battleplan #9, as an expansion to the Air Superiority line from GDW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material was the ground support companion to the Desert Falcons expansion. The introduction notes that to play this expansion requires owning Air Superiority, Air Strike and Desert Falcons, making it risky to publish as a regular module. So the magazine format was chosen to publish the material. The material was to be published in two installments. Unfortunately, Battleplan,No.9 turned out to be the last issue so part II was made available in two parts in issues 11 and 12 of Air Power, a newsletter published by J. D. Webster and Tony Valle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
