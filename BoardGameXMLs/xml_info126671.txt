							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BrainBox: London</name>
									
			<description>Did you know that Marble Arch was moved from outside Buckingham Palace in 1851? And that Big Ben is the largest four-faced chiming clock in the world? BrainBox London is crammed full of interesting facts and figures about the UK&amp;rsquo;s capital city. An added bonus is that the cards can be linked together to form a large map of London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner. This simple concept can be played by all ages and in large groups as well as a 1 person game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material and designed in the UK, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
