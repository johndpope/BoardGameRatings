			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sexy Ninja Death Squad (or SNDS for short) is a fast fire card game designed for 2+ players than can last from 15-25 minutes. Players furiously attack each other and defend themselves in order to be the last ninja standing. Each card can be used in attack or defence and placed in the Head, Body or Legs position depending on it's tabs. There is an Active Character Token (or A.C.T.) which signifies the active player. On receiving this you draw one card and can play one card on the players sitting next to you. They then have to block this attack with a card of their own OR give you a hit token (you have 3 of these in the standard game). When you lose a hit token you recharge your hand back up to 5 cards. Lose all 3 and you are defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three special indicators which can appear on the cards and these signify 'Flurry', 'Riposte' or 'Ninja Star' cards. When a Flurry card is played in an attack you immediately draw another card and can play another attack card. If another Flurry card is played then you draw and play another attack and so on...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Riposte is played in a defence you immediately draw another card and can play an attack card on the player your attacker. If a Flurry card is played then its free second attack can hit any valid player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third type of card is the Ninja Star which can attack anyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flurry and Riposte cards chain without limit which means your games get very hectic very quickly. The more people who are playing the more fun it becomes because more players means more ACTs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not uncommon for other players to attempt to kill steal by lobbing a ninja star across the table, or you having to change tactics when your carefully prepared Flurry chain gets blocked and you have Riposte attacks to survive. Sometimes it is better to take the damage, lose a hit token, recharge your hand and come out swinging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
