			<description>The object of the game is to accumulate the greatest number of &amp;quot;sales&amp;quot; (points) by completing sales of insurance to prospective clients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Life was specifically designed to be played by financial security advisors of the AXA insurance company. This roll-and-move game has a predetermined course for each player to follow. Along the course, each player will encounter &amp;quot;clients&amp;quot;, who will ask questions of the financial security advisor.

When a player lands on a coloured space, the player to the right must pick a card from the corresponding stack and read the question on the back of the card. If the player answers correctly, he has made a &amp;quot;sale&amp;quot; -- and gets one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After having completed the course, the player who has accumulated the largest number of &amp;quot;sales&amp;quot; (points) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
