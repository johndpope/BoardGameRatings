							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Times of Peril</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5E core rules make passing reference to other technology levels, which is fascinating, but difficult to implement without a lot of planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume gives a guide to some options for games set during Renaissance, Victorian times or the ever popular Steam-Punk era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is by no means a complete set of rules, but a starting point that you can use for your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Times of Peril you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Three new races&lt;br/&gt;    Four new classes&lt;br/&gt;    Variations on existing classes&lt;br/&gt;    New equipment&lt;br/&gt;    Feats, magic, monsters&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a world whose technological advancement from the renaissance onwards is fuelled not by the imagination and brilliance of great thinkers, but by the influence of a great intelligence from the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An almost unfathomable mind that reaches back in time to manipulate its own creation. This is the Binary One, an artificial intelligence from the future reaching back and making pacts with warlocks in the past, influencing thinkers and inventors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a push, the world advances, guns, railways, explosives, airships and exploration all ahead of their times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the world the Binary One is building for itself as it prepares the intelligent races for the time they will build it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some would call it a world gone mad and they&amp;rsquo;d be right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a world where we adventure in the shadow of the clouds of tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
