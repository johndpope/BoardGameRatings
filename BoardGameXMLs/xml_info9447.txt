			<description>This is a supplement from The Wargamer #30, for Squad Leader and provides RULES, 3-Scenarios, and (3)-Mapsheets for use with other components NOT included but available with YOUR Squad Leader games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mapsheets are the same size (8-1/2&amp;quot; by 11&amp;quot;) as the standard Squad Leader boards, are NOT mounted and have FULL colors(in a Pacific Island Beachhead motif) printed on them. They also have a designation (P-16 Tarawa) printed on one of them maybe for some future Scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RULES detail their introduction, background information on the Japanese, a Map of where the entire Scenarios(20 of them)are taking place all over the Pacific arena, and the 3-Scenarios depicted here. &lt;br/&gt;These are: &lt;br/&gt;S.P-4-To the Death:Yae Take-Okinawa, April 15, 1945; &lt;br/&gt;S.P-6-Airborne Samurai:Buraen, Leyte Island, Philippines, December 6, 1944; &lt;br/&gt;S.P-9-Bloody Betio:Betio Island, Tarawa Atoll, November 20, 1943. &lt;br/&gt;They are presented in familiar Squad Leader format with any Special Rules used included in the notes section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many Special Rules included of which these are some of them: Starshells; Air Support-Napalm; Caves; Special Invasion Rules; Tunnels; Dogs; Special Infiltration Rules; Weather-Climate; Booby Traps; Dated Japanese Play(for after 1943 Scenarios)&amp;amp; Misc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also some game counters that Players will have to produce themselves, prior to playing these. A note is made stating that in the future, MORE Scenarios and possibly, related game Counters will be provided in later editions of the Wargamer magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bill Wilder originally self published Blood &amp;amp; Sand as an independent publication in the following three parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part I: Against the Rising Sun (1983).
