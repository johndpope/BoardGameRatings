			<description>Spots is a traditional Irish card game. A bit similar to Rummy, but older. Designed for four players, but can be played with three players using a 'dead hand' or with five players if the dealer 'sits out'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a standard 52-card deck, each player is given eight cards and each turn a player must first draw a card from either the deck or the discard pile. A maximum of four cards may be laid on the table, either as a new set or connected to any existing set. At the end of the turn a player must discard a card from hand. Thus each player can make no more then two sets each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has no more cards or when the deck is depleted, the game ends and players receive penalty points for all cards in hand. These are equal to the number of spots on each card, hence the name of the game. To clarify: Ace=1, 2=2, 3=3..., jack/queen/king=10 penalty points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional rules: The ace is always low, so cannot go behind a king of the same suit. A player may play a double, which is extremely rare. These are exactly eight connecting cards of the same suit. The discard pile may not be spread out but the deck may be in order to know how many turns may be left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
