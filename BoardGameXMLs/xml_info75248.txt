			<description>From Wikipedia supplemented by User Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures: Dizzy's Candy Quest was the second Tiny Toon Adventures-related game released on the Nintendo Game Boy Color. It was released in October, 2001 and was developed by Lost Boys Games (now known as Guerilla Games) and published by Conspiracy Games (now knows as Conspiracy Entertainment). Warthog Games developed the first version of this game for the Game Boy Color. As with so many others from this franchise, it is a single player platform game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storyline&lt;br/&gt;Montana Max has built a robot to steal all of the candy in the world for Elmyra Duff. However, the robot wasn't programmed all that well, so they've also cloned Hamton J. Pig, Sweetie Pie, and Gogo Dodo as well as others to retrieve the robot for reprogramming. But one obstascle stands in their way: Dizzy Devil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
