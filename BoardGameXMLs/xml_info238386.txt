			<description>The tomb of the manor of the Eimpfildster is haunted. The hunters must catch the ghost before the end of the 12 chimes of midnight. The ghost mustn't get caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content:&lt;br/&gt;a board&lt;br/&gt;rules&lt;br/&gt;a 12-sided die&lt;br/&gt;1 blue hunter and his 4 blue detectors&lt;br/&gt;1 red hunter and his 4 red detectors&lt;br/&gt;For the ghost: a marking sheet, a pen and the hiding screen with the coordinates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting:&lt;br/&gt;If there are two players, one of them plays the two hunters.&lt;br/&gt;The ghost is not represented by a token. Thanks to the coordinates on the hiding screen, the player will discreetly indicate the moves of the ghost on the marking sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game:&lt;br/&gt;Each turn corresponds to a bell chime. The ghost plays first. Then, the two hunters play together without any given order. The turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the 12th chime, if the ghost didn't get caught, he wins.&lt;br/&gt;The ghost gets caught when a hunter and the ghost are on the same square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of the ghost:&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, he has to move to a square adjoining the one he is on. If he moves to a square where a detector is, it immediately disappears.&lt;br/&gt;The ghost moves to a square with a red detector. It disappears and cannot be used anymore. The hunters know where the ghost is.&lt;br/&gt;The ghost can delay the effect of a blue detector and a red detector for one turn, once in the game.&lt;br/&gt;He can do it when he moves to a square with a detector or when a hunter puts a detector on the square of the ghost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of the hunters:&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, they can:&lt;br/&gt;- either move to an adjoining square&lt;br/&gt;- or put a detector of their own colour on an adjoining square&lt;br/&gt;- or, but only once in the game, take back one of their detectors from an adjoining square.&lt;br/&gt;Caution! If a hunter moves to a square with a detector, it disappears and can no longer be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le tombeau du manoir des Eimpfildster est hant&amp;eacute;. Les chasseurs de fant&amp;ocirc;mes doivent capturer le fant&amp;ocirc;me avant les 12 coups de minuit. Le fant&amp;ocirc;me ne doit pas se faire attraper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
