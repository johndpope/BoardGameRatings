			<description>A Dice Game for Children and all Cookie Lovers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;America's newest high-speed family game for all ages 5 to 105.  It's fast, furious, deliciously fun and every player is in the game until the final shake. The Kook-ee dice roll, the Kook-ees fly in every direction: Right, Left, in the Jar, out of the Jar...just be sure to  hang on to yours. All ages can play and its great for teaching counting and right and left for pre-schoolers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very similar to LCR. Instead of LCR***, the &amp;quot;cube selectors&amp;quot; show L,R, cookie jar, and 3 smiley face. Everyone starts with three cookie chips, rolls the number of dice equal to how many cookies they have, and follows the dice instructions. There are some minor extra rules: if you roll three smileys you get to take one back from the center/cookie jar, but that only happens 1 in 216 rolls. You also must roll all smileys to win the game, instead of just winning when you're the last one with chips/cookies. If the final cookie must go in the center/cookie jar, the game is a draw and you must start all over. Finally, there is a scorepad - you cross off one cookie for winning and an extra one if you had more than one cookie left when you won. Essentially, it is LCR with a theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
