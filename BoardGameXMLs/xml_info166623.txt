			<description>From publisher description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Co-operative Deck-Building!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runestriking is an ancient and powerful magical technique, passed down from dwarf to dwarf. It's most powerful working are jealously guarded, and some secrets have been lost to the ages when no-one worthy was found to learn them. Tsula is known as one of the most powerful living runestrikers, and she chooses to put her art to use serving the good of everyone. Many trouble-makers have made the mistake of assuming that her skills don't extend to the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
