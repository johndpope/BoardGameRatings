							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aether Revolt Planeswalker-Deck-Set</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Kaladesh Inventors' Fair, a celebration of innovation and ingenuity, was a ruse. A revolt takes place on Kaladesh. The renegades have seized control of large portions of Ghirapur. Led by Pia Nalaar and aligned with aether-pirates, essence-drainers and weaponsmiths, they seek to overthrow the authority of the Consulate. The Consulate responds with increased security and surveillance, the seizure of unregistered inventions, the monitoring of aether distribution, and the enforcement of a city-wide curfew. The Gatewatch and Ajani Goldmane support the renegades, while searching for the nefarious planeswalker Tezzeret.&amp;quot; Look for all new mechanics in Aether Revolt like 'Improvise' that enables you to pay a generic mana cost with the help of your artifacts, also look for new cycles and themes to continue exploring the world of Kaladesh. Aether Revolt products are available in the following configurations, make sure to check the Title and Description of each listing to determine which item or items are included in the listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
