			<description>A memory game where whiskers are painted on the players' faces.&lt;br/&gt;The kittens are very fond of eating sweet and colorful candies.  Mama cat however does not approve of this eating sweets and catches them at it again and again.  Which kitten will be best at not getting caught by its mother at eating sweets and thus only gets the smallest nibbling mustache?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One by one in a clockwise direction the kittens turn a candy and move on to the next free square of the corresponding color.  They had better take small steps as they will get a whisker painted on them every time they cross the Mama square.  The kitten with the least amount of whiskers will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ages 4 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
