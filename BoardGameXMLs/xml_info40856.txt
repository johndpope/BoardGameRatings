			<description>From the Southern Cal ASL Club web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melee Pack II has six scenarios, with a little something for everyone! We take you to the steppes of the Crimea, the jungles of Ecuador and the heart of Stalingrad. We&amp;rsquo;ve got vehicles of all description waiting for you to shift into gear; from a trio of AVREs to a quartet of ISU-122s to a&lt;br/&gt;lone StuIG 33B to a T-60 conga line. We give you battles between titans, from Assault Engineers fighting Assault Engineers to Dogfighting Air Support. Our scenarios range from tournament-size to super-size.  Like things simple, without all those tanks and guns and things? We&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered! How about a complex challenge you can sink your&lt;br/&gt;Grognard teeth into? Take two, their small! Wanna fight on the Red Barricades map? Done! Did I mention the AVREs? Did I mention the Firefly backing them up? Bam!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melee Pack II also contains a set of our wildly popular Scenario Cheat Sheets! If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen one before, a Scenario Cheat Sheet depicts vehicle and gun notes based on the forces involved, the date and any special rules. What you wind up with is a sheet of information specially tailored for each vehicle and gun for that scenario. It saves us a lot of time looking up rules and we hope you&amp;rsquo;ll find them useful also.  Melee Pack II is packed with great ASL...you&amp;rsquo;re gonna love it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenarios are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;July 5, 1941&lt;br/&gt;Border, El Oro Province, Ecuador:&lt;br/&gt;Peruvian regulars of Agrupamiento del&lt;br/&gt;Norte have crossed the border trying&lt;br/&gt;to push along the coast of southeastern&lt;br/&gt;Ecuador. An Ecuadorean Border&lt;br/&gt;Detachment has taken up defensive&lt;br/&gt;positions in the dense jungle, ready to&lt;br/&gt;block the invaders&amp;rsquo; path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;June 6, 1944&lt;br/&gt;Juno Beach, Normandy, France:&lt;br/&gt;The AVREs, Shermans and men of the&lt;br/&gt;26th Assault Squadron and 79th Armoured&lt;br/&gt;must break through the entrenched&lt;br/&gt;positions of the 736th Regiment.&lt;br/&gt;Of course there is also the little&lt;br/&gt;matter of the minefield, the shattered&lt;br/&gt;bridge, the stream and the pillboxes.&lt;br/&gt;MP8: CRATER LAKE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;December 18, 1944&lt;br/&gt;Rocherath, Belgium:&lt;br/&gt;Dietrich&amp;rsquo;s 12th SS Division must capture&lt;br/&gt;the Elsenborn Ridge and only the&lt;br/&gt;village of Rocherath stands in his way.&lt;br/&gt;Can the troopers of the American 2nd&lt;br/&gt;Division and 744th TD Battalion hold&lt;br/&gt;their positions against this powerful&lt;br/&gt;combined arms SS force?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;April 12, 1944&lt;br/&gt;The Crimea, Russia:&lt;br/&gt;The 4th Ukranian Front has assaulted&lt;br/&gt;the Crimea from the north, forcing the&lt;br/&gt;German 17th Army to hastily retreat&lt;br/&gt;towards Sevastapol. Can the 49th&lt;br/&gt;Mountain Corps&amp;rsquo; landsers hold their&lt;br/&gt;line in the steppe until the men of the&lt;br/&gt;10th Romanian Infantry pass through?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;November 11, 1942&lt;br/&gt;Stalingrad, Russia:&lt;br/&gt;Operation Hubertus&amp;rsquo; push for the&lt;br/&gt;Volga has been blunted. Russian&lt;br/&gt;tanks and troops, including Assault&lt;br/&gt;Engineers, have been ordered to&lt;br/&gt;counterattack. Unfortunately, German&lt;br/&gt;Assault Engineers and assault guns&lt;br/&gt;have been sent in to renew the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May 14, 1942&lt;br/&gt;Nepokrytaia, Russia:&lt;br/&gt;The Soviet offensive toward Kharkov is&lt;br/&gt;threatened. Strong German forces&lt;br/&gt;have struck the 38th Army&amp;rsquo;s flank. Despite&lt;br/&gt;excellent air power, the Germans&lt;br/&gt;of the 211th Regiment and the 3rd Panzer&lt;br/&gt;Division find themselves facing&lt;br/&gt;evenly matched forces at Nepokrytaia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
