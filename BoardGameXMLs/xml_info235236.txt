							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Isle of Mists</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grand Silver Crest lake, fifteen miles at its widest point, has long been a source of foodstuffs and revenue for the Great Kingdom. The fishing villages that dot the area surrounding the lake all have a measure of prosperity and life is generally pleasant. For as long as any can remember the patch of land that rests in the middle of the lake has been known as Misty Island due to the fog which covers the lake during the winter and seems quite reluctant to leave with the coming of spring. The island is not a place that is intentionally shunned or avoided but everyone who has set foot on the island- mostly fishermen weathering a storm- tell of a sense of unease that seems to permeate the island, itself. There is nothing remarkable on the island, except that some hardier souls report a network of limestone caverns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
