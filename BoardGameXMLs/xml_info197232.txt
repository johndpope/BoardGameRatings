			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruesome Gangs is an exciting Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&amp;reg; compatible product line providing the Game Master with a collection of non-player characters (NPCs) designed to work together from the perspective of backstory, game mechanics, or both.  The groups are presented at different Challenge Ratings to increase their utility for multiple gamers.  In addition, this allows player characters (PCs) to encounter one of these groups early in a campaign and then again after both teams have gained experience with minimal extra work for the Game Master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the entire team is unsuitable for inclusion in the campaign at the time, then NPC stat blocks can be used individually as needed.  A mixed approach can also be interesting.  By introducing a single foe into the campaign, this product gives a number of friends or allies that foe could call upon after running afoul of the PCs!  This gives the Game Master a ready-made answer to who would the NPC go to for assistance, or even who would come to avenge his death at the hands of the PC party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using This Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product presents the overall history of the NPC team as well as the backstory for each individual member of the gang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each NPC has four stat blocks (CR 4, CR 9, CR 14, and CR 19) demonstrating his progression and growth over time.  As a visual indicator, the color of the name bar designates which stat blocks from each NPC are of equivalent Challenge Rating along with the CR text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each gang is comprised of multiple members which can include a mixture of races, class levels, and templates.  This section helps the Game Master compare different gangs&amp;rsquo; capabilities and make-up at a glance without having to review each stat block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Members&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ingerd Dwarfbiter &amp;ndash; CE female thicken ogre&lt;br/&gt;    Muzzug Dwarfbiter &amp;ndash; CE female troggle&lt;br/&gt;    Rumblegut Dwarfbiter &amp;ndash; CE male stoneblood giantkin ogre&lt;br/&gt;    Runt Dwarfbiter &amp;ndash; CE male ogrekin orc&lt;br/&gt;    Skarrok Dwarfbiter &amp;ndash; CE male thicken ogre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composed of ogres and half-ogres, this gang is very melee-capable even with the shaman and sorcerer members due to the sheer size and strength advantage of the races.  The group layers rogue and slayer abilities to further the melee devastation.  The addition of a rock-throwing ranged specialist and earth elemental sorcerer makes them a threat at any distance.  The team rounds out with a powerful battle shaman capable of enhancing combat abilities and healing injuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group has several advantages designed to fight against dwarves specifically; however, many of these are easily tailored to any other race.  As befits ogres, they are motivated by hunger and include members capable of turning defeated enemies into a delicacy.  Their voracious hunger and desire for various exotic foods provide one of many hooks for bringing this gang into a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
