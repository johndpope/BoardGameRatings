							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Pack 15: The Champion Pub and Whirlwind</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack adds recreations of two pinball tables to Pinball Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Champion Pub was released in 1998 by Bally. It is set in a backstreet pub playing host to a boxing ring. The theme is around training your boxer, earning jewels on your belt, defeating opponents in the ring, and aiming to win the Pub Championship. You train by completing tasks such as the jump rope, the speed bag and the heavy bag. When having reached a high-enough life level from training, the Heavy Bag rotates to reveal the head of your opponent. Defeating the opponent is achieved by hitting him in the body, or by launching off ramps to hit him in the head until his life is reduced to zero. Other hits can be achieved by scoring combos off the various ramps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whirlwind was released in 1990 by Williams and is themed around storm-chasers. The original table included a fan which blowed in the player's face when the storm starts picking up. The playfield includes three rotating discs, which can throw the ball in unexpected directions, and six jet bumpers, which also add a high degree of randomness - perfectly complementing the theme of the table. The primary aim of the game is to activate Feel The Power Multiball by locking two balls. In order to activate the locks, various storm and navigation themed activities need to be completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
