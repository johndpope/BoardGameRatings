			<description>DIX PETITS INDIENS is a French game based on the murder mystery novel by Agatha Christie in which ten people on an island get murdered by 10 different methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board represents the island with the locations of where the 10 bodies can be found.  The 10 characters are represented on 10 red cards and the 10 methods of death by&lt;br/&gt;10 blue cards. These are shuffled and placed face down on the 10 red and blue spaces on the outside of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it is his turn a player can (and must) carry out one of the following three actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Simultaneously turn over one red and one blue card.  Look at their contents (in secret) and then return them face down to the spaces from which they came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Move his playing piece along one yellow line to a neighboring black or red space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.    Write down on a record sheet any information concerning the cards turned over in previous rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is for players to work out where the matching red and blue cads are located and then move their playing piece to the appropriate location on the board to 'discover the body' (by turning over the two matching cards).  Successfully doing this earns the player one of 10 &amp;quot;little Indians&amp;quot;.  Making a mistake means the player loses his next two turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all 10 bodies have been discovered, with the winner being the player that discovered the majority of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
