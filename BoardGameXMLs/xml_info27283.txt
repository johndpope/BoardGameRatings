							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Babble</name>
									
			<description>Babble is an electronic sound reversal game.  The players take turns pushing the Record button to record a target word or phrase into the Babble game outside of earshot of the other players.  Then the other players take turns attempting to guess the target phrase correctly.  First they push the Play button which plays the target phrase backwards.  They can do this a few time then they must push the Mimic button and attempt to speak the backwards phrase as close as they can.  The Babble game then immediately speaks the mimicked phrase backwards which, if the player did a good job, should sound like the original target phrase.  The player then guesses the target.  If they are wrong the next player takes a turn.  If they are correct the round is over and the next player records a new target phrase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
