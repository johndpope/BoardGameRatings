			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is nearing dusk, and you are tired from traveling the dusty road. Ahead of you, at the intersection of the Traders Road and the road that leads through the swamp of Shadowmoor, you see the welcome sight of a traveler's inn. The inn is a solidly built two-story building. Hanging over the doorway of the inn is a shingle with the painting of a silver crown. Beside the inn is a large corral. Behind the inn is a small log house, a smoke house, an outhouse, and a large barn. Attached to the barn is a chicken coop. A fenced in mud pit has a large sow and four piglets. Thirty feet behind the inn, on the banks of the marsh river, is a boat house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 9th - 12th level characters.  Usually distributed as a ZIP archive containing a formatted DOC version and seven image files (including six maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
