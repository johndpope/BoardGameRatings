							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Brass: a game of colonial exploration (Game Chef 2005 edition)</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Expedition Afrique&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1892, the French led a military campaign in Dahomey, the &amp;quot;Slave  Coast&amp;quot; between Nigeria and Togo, against its kings so that they might  have control of Porto Novo, a coastal city. They marched all the way to  Abomey, the capital of the land, and found the rulers gone. They  amused themselves by looting the city for souvenirs. The French press  was most impressed by a white parasol decorated with human jawbones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They never saw the inside of that parasol. Inside it was a map drawn  in human blood, a map that pointed to a legendary city deep in Africa's interior. This city was called the City of Brass, a bastion of ancient  African civilization full of treasure, both gold and knowledge. Sadi Carnot, the president of France, sent a expedition on that  doomed journey. It only took three weeks for them to become hopelessly lost in an uncharted land. To this day, no one knows what happened to them. According to legend, only one of them made it, and his  greatest wishes were given unto him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you will play those lost souls. Trapped in Africa's interior, with a map drawn on a parasol and not enough resources, you  search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note about the content of this game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was done in one week with minimal research. In addition, while there is no magic in this game, it is a fantasy. The nobility found among the people of Africa is not balanced against the savagery found here. Like all peoples, the historic Africans had both high nobility and awful destruction found in them. Even though this game depicts the negative side of culture disproportionally, the author is fully aware that is not the only side, or even the dominant side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
