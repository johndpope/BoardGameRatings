			<description>designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;one bit of DCCRPG really captured my imagination: The character funnel, which turns four sad-sack level-0 characters into one level 1 PC by the power of dice and almost-certain death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character funnel brings a very OSR approach to a very OSR problem. The problem is that most retro-styled games have very swingy character creation. The beloved Iron Man stat generation system (roll 3d6 in order for each ability) is particularly bad in this regard. &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DCC&amp;rsquo;s OSR solution is very nifty: It accelerates the building of that character history. Let&amp;rsquo;s outline it briefly: Each player creates four level-0 PCs. Each of these receives a tiny fragment of personality and backstory: A race, profession, and a few meager possessions. You then send these sadsacks through the meat-grinder of a typical D&amp;amp;D dungeon. The few who manage to claw their way from -100 XP to 1 XP attain level one, and get a class and a proper place in the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea, then, is that players learn to love the idiots who survived simply because they&amp;rsquo;re the ones who managed to beat the odds. &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a damned great idea. But I wanted to use it with my system of choice, rather than DCC, and I wanted a free version of the idea so even non-DCC players could enjoy it. So I wrote up a Basic Fantasy version (.pdf; .odt also available).1 This should work just fine with most other OSR games, as well, though you&amp;rsquo;ll need to adjust saves and AC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
