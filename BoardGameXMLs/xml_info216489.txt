			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crisis in the Caucasus: The Struggle For Nagorno-Karabakh is a game representing a modern day war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The game takes 90-120 mins to play. This is the third release in the Modern Crisis Series. In this game we are releasing updated system rules that will include a new system for logistic management of your forces. This allows for more realistic gameplay as well as better representing the harassment of enemy supply lines during war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into game phases, such as movement, combat logistics, and the consolidation phase. The conclusion of these phases marks 1 game turn. This is a great intermediate war-game meant to bring new players to the hobby as well as being a challenging play for the veteran wargamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
