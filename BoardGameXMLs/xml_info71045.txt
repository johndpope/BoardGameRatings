			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2089, the universe is a cold, dangerous place. It&amp;rsquo;s up to the U.S. Space Marine Corps to secure the safety and security of U.S. interests in outer space through cutting edge tactics, training, and an armory full of high-tech firepower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USSMC FM 7-22: Space Boarding Operations is a military-style field manual designed to read like an actual U.S. Space Marine Corps guide to boarding hostile spacecraft in 2089. Its author, Lt. Col. Oliver Cass, is an active-duty U.S. Army officer experienced in both real-world operations and manual writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USSMC FM 7-22 is also the official publication of TerrorWerks, a heart-pounding live-action roleplaying experience. TerrorWerks players assume the roles of U.S. Space Marines, civilian engineers, and corporate executives thrust into the heart of an orbiting refinery being ravaged by an unknown alien horror. Using their wits, skills, and an arsenal of fully-automatic Airsoft weapons, the Marines battle their way through the station, racing against the clock to save themselves and any survivors. TerrorWerks debuted at Origins 2007, where it was an overwhelming success and received extensive media attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USSMC FM 7-22: Space Boarding Operations is a fascinating read, and can be used in conjunction with any sci-fi roleplaying or miniatures game. The book includes:&lt;br/&gt; -A complete background on the universe of 2089&lt;br/&gt;-Detailed, room-to-room combat tactics for boarding and securing a starship&lt;br/&gt;-Instructions for multiple training scenarios&lt;br/&gt;Lock and load, marine! It's time for a bug hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
