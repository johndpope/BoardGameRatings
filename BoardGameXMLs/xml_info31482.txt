			<description>The first chapter is the game. It covers all aspects of naval warfare during the American Civil War. Ramming, mines,&lt;br/&gt;subs are also covered. The game is historical with one slight twist. It was written for what the ships were designed to do, not what they actually did. In this light two very powerful and equal fleets set sail. The players are the difference that decides the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other chapters provide historical data to enrich the game. The original game has grown to be a one stop info source for the vessels of the ACW. For those without ship models.&lt;br/&gt;110 different ships are provided on the cards on the CD. 90 vessels are drawn in black and white in Chapter 7. It also contains ACW photos of many of the ships. The game is design for all scales. Only four rules are different for the larger models, mainly distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
