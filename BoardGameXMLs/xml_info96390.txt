			<description>Welcome to Crashbot Derby! In this board game, you play as one of 8 superpowered robots competing in the ultimate mechanized demolition derby! Attack your enemies with wild weapons, treacherous traps, or just by crashing into them! Don&amp;rsquo;t get sidetracked, though: the object is to cross the finish line first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're in a race with up to 5 other players; your goal is to complete 3 laps (enter a checkpoint space 6 times, essentially) first. Along the way, you may step on special spaces that will give you sparks (the &amp;quot;currency&amp;quot; of this game), cards, or allow you to activate your unique Robopower!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you may do these things:&lt;br/&gt;- roll a 6-sided die 2 times &lt;br/&gt;- spend sparks if you have them&lt;br/&gt;- play cards if you have them&lt;br/&gt;You can do these in any order. You can spend sparks &lt;br/&gt;or play cards between die rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, racing is only part of it: the other part is fighting! You can attack your opponents with the cards in your hands , which usually represent a gizmo you can use offensively. You can also spend 3 red sparks to shoot opponents... and of course, as the name implies, you can crash into them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are never eliminated from the game, they continue racing until a winner crosses the finish line!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
