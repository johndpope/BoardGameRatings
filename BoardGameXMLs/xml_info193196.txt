			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of adventure ranging from the epic to the mundane, StoryCube: The Roleplaying Game offers rules for utilizing the random images of Rory's Story Cubes (no affiliation whatsoever) to create character and situation based narratives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes on the role of a character in a world that is crafted through an interactive story-telling experience between the players and the game master, a rules arbitrator who helps direct the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StoryCube: The Roleplaying Game offers a form of roleplaying in which stats and equipment are less important than creative thought while still leaving options for those gaming tables that would prefer a more tactical experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be a group of magical adventurers trying to overcome unbelievable challenges? A unit of government spies trying to do their part for their country? A group of corporate salarymen and women trying to impress a client?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anything's possible with StoryCube: The RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
