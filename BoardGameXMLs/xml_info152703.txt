							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quad Kingdom Chess</name>
									
			<description>Quad Kingdom Chess is a chess variant for two to four players, utilizing a standard chess board with two rows added to each side (called a Kingdom) for the players' starting positions, and with a line of pawn promotion much drawn between squares six rows out from each Kingdom.  Players need only reach the square adjoining the line for promotion--crossing it is not necessary.  Four squares of empty space at each corner of the board are called Towers and are not in the field of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to force an opponent's King into Checkmate.  Each player has his own colored set of standard Chess pieces, which move and capture the same as in ordinary Chess, but for a few variations related to this multiplayer adaptation, including an optional point system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
