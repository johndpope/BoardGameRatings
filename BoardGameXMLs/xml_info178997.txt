			<description>Guardian City was named for the League which kept the people safe during the last Great War. Previous Leaders have included the Atomic Wizard, Blue Streak, and Human Meteor. But now, Guardian City is in need of a new Super Hero to head the Allied Legends League. Each hero is on a quest to earn Feats of Bravery, in consideration of being nominated to run the League. To keep things interesting, Commissioner Freeman has enacted a Rule of Brawl, which will give heroes the opportunity to prove their mettle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero Heads is a card game of Super Heroes and their ability to Save the Day. All the heroes of the game are from the Golden Age of Comic Books including such heroes as Miss Masque, Blue Beetle, and the Black Terror. Captain Marvel proved to be one of the most popular superhero comics of the Golden Age, regularly outselling the adventures of Superman during the 1940s. The Core deck is for has 70 Cards and is playable by 2 to 5 players, including 10 Public Domain Super Heroes, 10 Crisis Cards, and 40 Feats of Bravery Cards. The game is a quick card drafting game that is best played in rounds--the average round taking around 20-40 minutes. For those of you that are a fan of the Golden Age of Comics and enjoy quick competitive card games, then Hero Heads is a great choice for your upcoming game night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a Super Hero to start their game, then dealt five cards from the Core Deck. Players compete to be the first to obtain all nine required Feats of Bravery, using simple symbol mechanics to give the player the sequence needed in order to win. This mechanic resembles poker or gin--each Super Hero has a sequence needed to win seen on the card as signs in the form of road signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also Special Powers and Crisis cards which allow players to force opponents to discard important cards breaking up their sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each hero's turn, they must perform one action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw a card from core deck&lt;br/&gt;     Play a Special Power or Crisis card&lt;br/&gt;     Discard any number of cards to discard pile&lt;br/&gt;     Obtain all Feats of Bravery needed&lt;br/&gt;     Win the game, by obtaining your Hero's total required Feats of Bravery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
