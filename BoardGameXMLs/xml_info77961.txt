							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horse and Musket: Volume I</name>
									
			<description>Relive the exciting and trying days of Frederick the Great in Horse and Musket: Volume I, the improved and expanded combination of the previous Prussian War Machine and Prussia&amp;rsquo;s Glory titles. Horse and Musket: Volume I is a reboot of the successful Horse and Musket series, including not only two solid historical titles in one package, but also many new game features, a powerful new editor, and a complete graphics overhaul to an already acclaimed gaming system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the classic turn-based hex system, gamers take command of a wide variety of historical units and leaders as they try to follow in Frederick&amp;rsquo;s footsteps across 10 of his famous battles, making for a whopping 40 scenarios in total. Maneuver your infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons, and artillery batteries to break the enemy lines and claim your own title as a great captain of history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most important feature to celebrate with Horse and Musket: Volume I is the revival of this innovative gaming system!  With many new features and improvements, this latest release still has the same engaging game mechanics that bring to life the battlefields and tactics of the 18th Century!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.matrixgames.com/products/369/info/Horse.and.Musket&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.matrixgames.com/products/369/info/Horse.and.Muske...&lt;/a&gt;:.Volume.I&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
