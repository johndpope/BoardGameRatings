			<description>In Manga Kai, players each receive a hand of double-sided cards, then they attempt to trade with one another as quickly as they can in order to claim objective cards on the table. Once you feel that you've traded and scored all that you can, you need to convince others to end the game. Once at least half of the players feel they're finished, everyone else has the length of one 45-second sand timer in which to conclude their trade and score any final points. Whoever scores the most wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
