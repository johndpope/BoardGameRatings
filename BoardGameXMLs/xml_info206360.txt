			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting &amp;ndash; A wild galaxy full of warring empires, tribal primitives, and strange science. Tribal alien warriors meet star mystics and scientists struggling to make sense of a universe on the brink of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protagonists &amp;ndash; Escaped prisoners on the run who must work together to survive but whose drives often conflict. They fail often, make messes, and just barely survive as the universe burns around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peace Force &amp;ndash; A military force trying to bring uniformity and stability to the galaxy by eradicating other cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ship &amp;ndash; The protagonists share their stolen ship and use it to travel from system to system, trying to survive, avoid the authorities, and resolve their hooks. Most sessions start with the entire party on the ship encountering something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
