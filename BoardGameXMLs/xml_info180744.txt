							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sim Hero</name>
									
			<description>Sim Hero is an RPG/Simulation game where you manage groups of adventurers &amp;amp; send them into dungeons. This game can be thought of as a cross between an 8-bit CRPG &amp;amp; a typical sports-sim. Sim Hero is the most feature-rich rpg management sim that exists in the world... no, really! Oh, and it's FREE! - IndieDB&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features at a Glance&lt;br/&gt;- Heroes can be found, made, traded-for &amp;amp; recruited. Teach them skills &amp;amp; change their classes. They also develop organically as they adventure &amp;amp; train!&lt;br/&gt;- Send your heroes off to adventure, promote them to Guard Captains to lead your army, assign them as your Champion to deal with Crises. &lt;br/&gt;- Build your settlement how you want&amp;mdash;branching options! Assign villagers to tasks. Craft items &amp;amp; trade goods. Deal with crises, attacks, trade and many other random events. No two games will play the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
