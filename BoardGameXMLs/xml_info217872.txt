			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chibi Quest! is an exciting semi-cooperative game for 1-6 players, where you play as a Chibi, going on quests to save your lands from monsters! After your Chibi is prepped for battle, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to save your lands from as many monsters as you can! Of course, no quest is complete without an epic boss fight! You must work together to defeat it! By the end of the adventure, one of you will be known throughout the lands as the CHAMPION CHIBI!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play overview :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Equip! You quickly search through the available armor in market, paying for any armor you wish to keep! Some armor will protect you and give you lots of hit points, some will give you better dice to fight with, and others will give you special powers! But you must decide quickly... because you only have 1 minute to equip your Chibi for battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Battle! Then you battle monsters! You do this by collecting all the dice shown on your armor cards. Some monsters are stronger than others and you must meet the sword requirements to beat the monster, otherwise they damage YOU! If you defeat a monster you then follow the actions listed on that monsters card. Sometimes they give you gold, sometimes they cause you to loose armor, and sometimes they become your sidekick and help you fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Shop until you drop! Or in this case, fight until you faint! The first Chibi to cover up all his or her hit points faints! At this point you finish out the round so everyone has an equal number of turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    BOSS FIGHT! Then everyone will have another minute to equip their Chibis with fresh, undamaged armor.  Afterwards, you must fight together to defeat the BOSS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     WIN or LOSE! If you defeat the BOSS you are all winners! But there is only ONE Champion Chibi. You count up all your points, and whoever has the most is known throughout the lands as the Champion Chibi!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
