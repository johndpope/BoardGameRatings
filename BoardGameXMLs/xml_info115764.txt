			<description>Tactyx is played on a 12 x 12 board. There are 4 coloured sections on each edge of the board. Diagonal moves are not allowed. To make this important rule visible all the time, the board is painted with 12 x 12 circles which are connected with vertical and horizontal lines (and no diagonal ones).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 red and 2 black banks on two opposing sides of the board. These bands are used to determine the coordinates of each place in a section on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 6 tokens. At the beginning of the game the board is empty. By throwing the 2 dice, one red, the other black, the players determine the location where their tokens enter the game (in the section corresponding their color).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to move all 6 tokens from the starting section to the diagonally opposing section. The first player who reached this, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
