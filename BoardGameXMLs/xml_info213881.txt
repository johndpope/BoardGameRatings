							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Honey Bees</name>
									
			<description>Description Game Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look around and see the flowers on the field. Little bees are flying from one flower to another. They are very busy with the great job of collecting pollen and nectar. Bees are working hard, humming from dawn till sunset while mixing pollen from various flowers. This is a very important action for plants and is called pollination. Plants would remain fruitless without pollination. In their hairy feet bees are carrying pollen to the beehives, where they continue working to produce sweet honey. It is not an easy job, though! Let's help the bees and fly up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game helps children to develop counting skills up to 10, train attention, fine motory movements and coordination, promotes ecological education, teaches to distinguish colours and sizes of objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game you roll with a die to move your bee from flower to flower. If the color of your bee matches the color of the flower you can take 1 or 2 point chips depending on the size of the flower. The point chips are puzzle pieces you can attach to your hive. As soon as the hive of one of the players is finished the other players get 3 more tries and the game is over. Then turn over your hive and count the points on the back of the point chips. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
