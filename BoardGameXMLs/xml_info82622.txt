			<description>Galaga '88 (ギャラガ'88, Gyaraga Hachigatsu) is a 1987 fixed shooter arcade game by Namco. It is the third sequel of Galaxian (following Galaga and Gaplus). It features significantly improved graphics over the previous games in the series, including detailed backgrounds, larger enemies and more ship details. Although it was well received, fewer units of this game were produced than of Galaga and Gaplus. Galaga '88 runs on Namco System 1 hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galaga '88 was ported to the NEC PC Engine (also known as the TurboGrafx-16), but was released outside of Japan as Galaga '90. It was also ported to the Sega Game Gear as Galaga '91 in Japan and Galaga 2 in Europe. In 2005, the arcade version of Galaga '88 finally arrived on home systems as part of the Namco Museum 50th Anniversary compilation for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube and PC platforms. The arcade version is also on Namco Museum Virtual Arcade for Xbox 360.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC Engine version of Galaga '88 was released on the Wii's Virtual Console service in Japan on March 27, 2007 and later as the game's arcade version on June 23, 2009. In North America, Galaga '90 was released via Virtual Console on August 6, 2007, and in Europe on August 10, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Galaga '88,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
