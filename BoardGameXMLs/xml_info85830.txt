			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The Ice Fiend &amp;amp; Other Tales is a set of four fantastic Hellfrost mini-adventures for seasoned characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Ice Fiend our heroes are asked to hunt a savage wolf that is terrorising a local farmer&amp;rsquo;s sheep stock. Or that is what they think! What the end up hunting is a far greater horror and leads them into great peril.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your heroes want to see battle then A Brief Encounter is for them! Hired as mercenaries, our heroes are ordered to rid the land of some persistent orc raiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are hired to escort some livestock to the local overlord for tribute it seems like an easy way to earn some money. However this is quickly forgotten as at every step along the way the heroes are attacked by a variety of opponents - in Taxation Troubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Haunted Woods harbour trouble for our heroes. After pitching camp near a dark mysterious forest everything seems peaceful until one of the characters spy a strange pale white light approaching their camp. It is a Fey Knight who commands the characters to track and kill a strange creature which is causing much concern to the local inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure contains a range of Figure Flats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hellfrost is an epic fantasy setting for the award winning Savage Worlds roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
