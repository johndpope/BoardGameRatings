			<description>Lead Rome's best gladiators to glory in Lex Arena &amp;ndash; a historic tabletop strategy game with great design, crafted from wood and linen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lex Arena is a tabletop elimination game for 2 to 4 players. You take the role of a Lanista &amp;ndash; an owner and trainer of gladiators. Following a simple set of rules, it is your duty to lead your fighters to glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game each player selects their gladiators (wooden tokens). &lt;br/&gt;The arena is divided into a number of fields on which the gladiators can move. &lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns. Each turn a player can move one of his gladiators or attack his opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to have at least one gladiator as a sole survivor in the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When fighting your opponents the player must move one of his gladiators in the same field as the opponent's gladiator. A player then tries to determine the action by rolling the combat die, which can result in attack, defend or critical miss. The attack action allows the player to roll the attack die and the opponent rolls the defense die. The defend action means that the opponent is now counterattacking and the roles are reversed. Critical miss wastes the turn for the attacker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player draws an event card that can affect the gameplay and lasts for one turn. Even cards can be beneficial or harmful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arena is also a place for NPCs: warriors and animals, when defeated they yield weapons and armor respectively. Players can then use this to equip their gladiators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are other ways to gain the advantage over your opponents. Every gladiator has a unique ability which can have a significant impact if used in the right situation. Gladiators from the same team gain bonus to attack and defense if standing together in the same field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lex Arena provides balanced gameplay so knowing yourself and your opponents is crucial for victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
