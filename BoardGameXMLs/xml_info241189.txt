			<description>Command your ship and crew as a space pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, and more in Star Traders: Frontiers &amp;ndash; an epic space RPG from Trese Brothers Games. Venture forth into a massive open universe, rich with adventure and the lore of the Star Traders. Choose your path by assembling and commanding your custom crew and spaceship in a constantly evolving galaxy torn by internal strife, political intrigue, and alien threats. Will you fly as a pirate terrorizing shipping lanes, join the solar wars as a military captain, or track targets across the stars as a fearsome bounty hunter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source:  Trese Brothers Games - &amp;gt; &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.tresebrothers.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.tresebrothers.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features an open world, space setting with procedurally generated maps. Players can choose from a number of different roles, including bounty hunter, spy, pirate, and many more. There are 21 total jobs, and each role has its own unique abilities and play style.  Player customization is a key part of the game as well. Space ships can be customized in appearance, and throughout the game, ships can be upgraded with a number of features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters met along the way can become members of the player's party, and each character can be outfitted with unique gear and abilities.  Freedom of choice is a key component to the gameplay as well, allowing the player to affect how situations play out. This can result in gaining new allies or enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps most notable is the dedication to old-school, rogue-like RPGs. On higher difficulties, autosaves can be turned off and character permadeath is core to the experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
