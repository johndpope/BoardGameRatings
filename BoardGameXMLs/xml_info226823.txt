							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hybrid Class: The Mountebank</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mountebank is a consummate con artist who has a way with both words and blades. Quick-witted and fast-talking, he prides himself on winning fights before they begin, using his wits, uncanny gaze&amp;hellip; and psychic abilities. His powers of deception and trickery apply equally well in combat. Opponents lose track of him, or follow his hypnotic suggestions, or even attack their own allies in their confusion. The mountebank makes sure that any direct fight he&amp;rsquo;s involved in isn&amp;rsquo;t a fair one, though if possible he&amp;rsquo;d rather manipulate others to get what he wants, then vanish without a trace. Though a mountebank&amp;rsquo;s skills lend themselves well to all sorts of thievery and wrongdoing, there are also mountebanks who use their talents for more altruistic causes, their dashing adventures making them folk heroes in the areas they frequent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
