							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Strange Cypher Deck</name>
									
			<description>Save time at the game table and in prep with these super-handy cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Strange, a cypher is a small device that can create a single, often spectacular effect. A cypher may look ordinary, but each one is something special&amp;mdash;a manifestation of the Strange that we don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand. Players will regularly use cyphers to accomplish their missions. Hoarding cyphers is imprudent and a waste of needed resources; replacement cyphers are always around the next corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This deck of 120 full-color cards allows GMs and players to randomly generate cyphers on the fly. Twenty item cards describe the physical form the cypher takes, depending on the laws of the recursion in which it appears, while each of the 100 power cards offers multiple power options to match the device. Skip rolling on the tables and save time and effort, at the game table and while prepping your game, by simply drawing a card, which you can then hand to your player to keep until the cypher is used!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
