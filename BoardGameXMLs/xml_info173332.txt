			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You never had a chance at a normal life. It was all set from the beginning. It's not that you have a great destiny or anything like that. It's not like your parents were from some cult or something. You didn't make any deals under the moon.You weren't stalked by a werewolf or vampire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, the only problem you had was that you were adopted...and you were never human. You just never knew that until puberty hit and you started changing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't know what you are, but you know it brings trouble. So if trouble is going to find you, you might as well be prepared to put trouble down. And maybe someday you'll find a way to fix yourself and be a normal person again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as the reluctant inhuman suffering from a mystery heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
