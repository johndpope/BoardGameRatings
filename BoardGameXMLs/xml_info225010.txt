							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Divergent Paths:  Fool&#039;s Errand</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I play martial characters, I tend to look for chances to play the extraordinary. A part of my personal fantasy when playing this game is to achieve acts and stunts that are larger than life. To play an action hero, a mythological badass, an improbably-skilled martial arts master, and everything in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divergent Paths: Fool's Errand was written with that in mind. Though was born out of mechanical necessity when working on the errata for Path of War, it's a labor of love like everything else Dreamscarred Press creates. In writing the discipline, we drew inspiration from realworld fighting techniques, wuxia stories, anime, and even videogames to help define its identity. I hope you enjoy the resulting tone and feel as much as I do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Forrest Heck&lt;br/&gt;Creative Director, Dreamscarred Press&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
