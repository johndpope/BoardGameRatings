			<description>The forces of light and dark are running a tournament, with the winner ruling the earth for the next 100 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of cards showing magicians, spells, items and missions. Each player has a magician card with a special ability, and a mission card with another special activity. The active player can play cards with spells or items and use the abilities of his/her magician/mission cards. Other players can interfere with counterspells or special items. The goal is to gain three tokens, either individually (in a 2 or 3 player game) or as a team (in a 4 player game). The first player or team who gets the 3 tokens is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
