			<description>Zone &amp;agrave; D&amp;eacute;fendre is a board game, cooperative, strategic, political (but not boring), from 1 to 6 players, from 14 years, duration of a game from 1h to 1h30.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as occupants of the ZAD of Notre-Dame-des-Landes in fight against a destructive and harmful airport project. To win you will have to build, sow, communicate, while preventing the progress of the police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as a &amp;quot;ZADist&amp;quot; and defend these agricultural and wild lands and, beyond, the ideal of a world of simplicity and sharing. To stop bulldozers ransacking the hedgerows, you will have to acquire many skills: Cultivate your crops, learn the techniques of clown activism or of sabotage...or soir&amp;eacute;es around the fire to sustain the morale of activists! Multiply the building of cabins to slow down the progress of the bulldozers, place barricades to protect you from mobile gendarmes, mobilize external support and do not forget to harass the forces of order to demoralize them as much as possible...but beware the blows of their batons, the repression is ruthless...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
