							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Staff of Suha Cycle</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, this is a series of adventures that I wrote for Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition, mainly for me to run at local conventions. I&amp;rsquo;ve run all of the adventures a bunch of times and made lots of revisions along the way, so they&amp;rsquo;re pretty polished now. Each one is designed to be run in a single session of about four hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In summary, the Stolen Staff is a pretty straightforward dungeon delve. Tallinn&amp;rsquo;s Tower is an adventure through a tricky tower maintained by a powerful illusionist (and it includes poetry!). Descent Into Darkness is exactly what it says on the tin, and it features my favorite puzzle that I&amp;rsquo;ve designed so far (the room of runes) and a really cool final encounter area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
