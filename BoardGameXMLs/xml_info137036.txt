							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wii Mini</name>
									
			<description>The Wii mini was released in Canada on December 7, 2012 with a MSRP of $99.99 CAD. This smaller, redesigned Wii lacks GameCube compatibility, online gaming, the SD card slot and Wi-Fi support. Additionally, the console only supports Composite video output using the included cable, and does not support S-Video or Component video cables despite using the same AV port as the original Wii. The Wii mini also has only one USB port as opposed to the two on the original Wii. The Wii Mini is styled in matte black with a red border, and includes a red Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk with no included pack-in game. A sensor bar, power adapter and composite cable are included. No release dates have been announced for other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wii Mini&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
