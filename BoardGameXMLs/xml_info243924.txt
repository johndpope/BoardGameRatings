							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gundabar</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Most of the thorp is delved into the sides of a rocky hill. From the road the two turrets of the gatehouse are carved from the rocky hillside and rise above it for a 360 degree view all around the area. The gatehouse has a large stout wooden door that appears to be locked and barred. A large iron door knocker hangs from one of the two doors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is governed by an arcane sorcerer, a male dwarf named Gari. Gari leads his small clan of dwarves who followed him back to their ancestral hold in order to recapture it from the Goblins and other evil creatures who over ran their ancestors many decades ago. The reconquest was going well when they ran into something they could not handle. Something was eating their kin deep in the dwarf hold and no dwarf who knows what lurks in the hold has survived to tell the tale of what lies in wait in the deep. Luckily for the dwarves there is an old fortified choke point between the cleared area that they inhabit and the rest of the abandoned hold. They hold the choke point against the occasional goblin incursion but the goblins have unknown numbers and an unknown ally powerful enough to destroy any dwarven incursion without leaving survivors.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
