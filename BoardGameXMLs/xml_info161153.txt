			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the reign of the Mad Emperor, civil upheavals were commonplace in the Caneus Empire. The final line of defense for the Emperor is the High Guard, charged with safeguarding their liege against all threats, foreign or domestic. The Lady-Commander of the High Guard, torn between duty to her monarch and empathy for her persecuted fellow citizens, prayed to the Sanguine Lord and all his Venerates for grace. Her prayers were granted in the form of a weapon, one with which she could continue her duties without shedding the blood of her compatriots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasure of NeoExodus: Gentle Hand of Law is created for use with your NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting home gaming for the Pathfinder RPG. The Treasures of NeoExodus series focus on creating unique and interesting magical and mundane items that you can use in your NeoExodus home games that give you more a personal connection to the item. This PDF comes with a background and history of the Gentle Hand of Law, its special mundane and/or magical qualities plus magic item containing detailed information and blank versions of the cards. Everything you need to incorporate Gentle Hand of Law into your character&amp;rsquo;s background and your gaming sessions is here making them even more appealing, special and personal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
