			<description>&amp;quot;A strange game of Martial Arts and poor dialog dubbing for 2 to 8 players!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel around the board eliminating other players.  Each turn, eight dice are rolled.  The dice have words on their faces, and the player rolling must attempt to concoct a sentence in the style of a bad martial arts movie dub using as many of the words as possible.  The other players award honor points to the sentence as they see fit.  The point values of the words and honor points are totaled, along with any bonuses, and the player uses this total to select an Attack/Defense Mode--which run from purchasing prices of 14 up to 60.  If the A/DM purchased allows movement, the player does so.  Visiting the various shrines on the board will award players with bonuses and weapons, but each shrine may be visited only once per player.  Each player begins the game with 50 life points and 50 spirit points, and is eliminated when either total reaches 0 or lower.  Last player left alive wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
