							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rat Race: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Rat Race is a fun, fast, easy card game for all ages (10+) that combines single-step gameplay with memory and process of elimination to create an experience that everyone can enjoy. Each player is assigned a rat card with a rule on it that you&amp;mdash;and only you&amp;mdash;have to follow. The object is to win either by collecting in your hand all the game cards featuring your rat, lining up 3 of your rat on the board, or eliminating all the other players by correctly guessing which rat card they were dealt&amp;mdash;or getting them to incorrectly guess yours! Pay attention, watch for tells, and don&amp;rsquo;t run out of cards as you work to outlast the others! The action is quick, the cards are plenty, and the race is on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
