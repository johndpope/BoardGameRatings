							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantastic Feats of Leadership</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout history, and fantasy, leaders have come in all shapes and sizes. From Attila the Hun, whose battle prowess and skill with a horse made him lord of the Mongols to Tyrion Lannister, whose cunning and wit inspired others to follow his lead. Even a mythical figure like Odin used his wisdom over his personal magnetism to lead the Asgardian gods down the path he felt was best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pathfinder, the bulk of this is covered simply in the Leadership feat. This feat attracts cohorts and followers under a banner, be it for a holy crusade against evil, the building of a Thief &amp;rsquo;s Guild, or simply a powerfully charismatic adventurer simply inspiring others to follow his lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF is a collection of feats meant to improve and augment the Leadership feat. This includes how it can modify adventuring, fighting monsters, or some of the other sub rules for Pathfinder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
