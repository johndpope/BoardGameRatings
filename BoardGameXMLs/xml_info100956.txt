							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ant Bully (GBA)</name>
									
			<description>The Ant Bully is a video game based on the animated movie of the same name. It was first released on July 24, 2006 alongside the theatrical release of the movie. The story and actions of the game correspond to that of the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control the protagonist, Lucas Nickle, as he is shrunk to a miniature size and forced to work in an ant colony. He goes on many adventures throughout his backyard. From the Cactus Garden, to the Spiders lair, Lucas must overcome the challenges and become an ant. Getting in his way is the local wasp hive and the Exterminator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is broken down into missions, though the game follows a linear design. The game is a traditional action-adventure game, with players able to use different weapons to clear a mission and advance to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Ant Bully (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
