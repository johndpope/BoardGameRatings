							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harley Chase: Supernatural Bounty Hunter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harley is a bounty hunter hired by mages and others in the supernatural community to find and retrieve rogue monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Cache is a collection of characters designed to be used in tabletop RPG gaming, either as character concepts for players or as NPCs/villains by GMs. Artist Matt Morrow illustrates the character pieces, and Encoded Designs writes a system-neutral description, including how to incorporate this character into your campaign. These write-ups also include hooks for encounters and adventure inspiration, plus tags for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the system-neutral write-up are stat blocks for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fate Core&lt;br/&gt;    Savage Worlds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
