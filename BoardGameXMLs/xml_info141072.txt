							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Il gioco dello Zig Zag</name>
									
			<description>An educational game for beginning students of the Italian language.  On their turn, players (or teams if more than two are playing) draw a card which gives them a topic, and must then say as many Italian words as possible related to that topic.  Each word they think of within the time limit permits them to advance one space along the zig-zag track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
