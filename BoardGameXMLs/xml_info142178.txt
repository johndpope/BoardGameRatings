			<description>Quandrum is a game that shifts under your feet like a hundred angry snakes.  Players play cards from their hands to move their tokens around a board.  Cards can also be played to change what each space on the board does, the location of the goal, the fundamental rules of the game, and a multitude of other effects.  With over a hundred unique cards in the deck each game is going to be special.  To win a player simply has to land their token on the same space as the goal.  Assuming the goal stays where it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
