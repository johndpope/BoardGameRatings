							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What Has He Got in His Pockets? 100 Detailed Fantasy Oddities</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defeated enemies have pockets - as well as pouches, backpacks, crates, barrels, sacks and treasure hoards. Most of the items found in these will be treasure, or items of value. Some may simply be pieces of junk. But what about those which are not exactly either?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collection of 100 different things that can be - sparingly, otherwise they are not odd - placed into the loot. They are items which may have no or minimal value, or which do not specifically appear to have use, but which have something odd about them, perhaps making players think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can be used as red herrings designed to make players spend time trying to determine the importance of something that has none, or perhaps as adventure hooks, leading characters elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small drawstring red leather pouch. Inside the pouch are seven irregularly-shaped pebbles. The pebbles look ordinary, except for the fact that they are all of an identical size, shape, colour and weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover and one page the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
