			<description>ESSEN: Live! is one of the ESSEN bonus tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing with the bonus tiles, players have one additional action during the Action phase. By placing their player token next to the bonus tiles, a player is allowed to either place a bonus disc on to a tile, or move one disc from one tile to another. If a disc is moved away away from a track, all progress made on that track is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bonus tiles are all intended for games with at least 3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the players are using one or two bonus tiles, use 1 bonus disc per player.&lt;br/&gt;When the players are using three or four bonus tiles, use 2 bonus discs per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESSEN: Live!&lt;br/&gt;Every year there are hundreds of board game geeks who can&amp;rsquo;t make it to ESSEN. These unfortunate souls watch from their computers while the newest games are presented by their designers via a live feed, right from the fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When placing a disc here, place it on the first numbered space. In each subsequent activation of this tile, the disc advances on a track, which corresponds to 1,1,2,2,4,4,6, or 10 bonus points at the end of the game. If a disc is moved away from this track, all progress is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
