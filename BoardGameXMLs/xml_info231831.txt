							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drunkard&#039;s Grimoire</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drink Deep of the Magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether its drunken monks stumbling into their foes and unleashing fists of fury, alcoholic barbarians swigging down wine as they curse and cut their way to glory, or the charming roguish individual who uses a little alcohol to lower their inhibitions and skate through life, drink has a potent grasp on the imagination when it comes to adventures. This is no surprise, really; alcohol is one of humanity's greatest vices and fondest indulgences, and has been since more or less the dawn of human history. Being such an integral part of the human experience, it should be no wonder that alcohol has so thoroughly permeated our folklore and fantasy for nearly as long as it has been around. From myths and legends to being a driving force behind some of the most cherished characters from more contemporary literature, alcohol holds a very special place in the hearts and minds of a wide array of audiences as something easily relatable and yet mystifying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason why martial characters should have a monopoly on drunken fun. In ancient Greece, the cult of the god Dionysus reveled in the mysteries of wine and drunken debauchery, and this is only one of many examples of the symbiotic relationship that alcohol often has with mysticism. Or, to put it another way: clerics and wizards like to get drunk, too! This book presents 12 new spells that are thematically linked with alcohol, many of which work in conjunction with the existing alcohol-themed feats and class features found in other Pathfinder products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
