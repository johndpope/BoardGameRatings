			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War of 1812 is a tactical/operational level game covering the major battles of the War of 1812 from the pre-war Battle of Tippecanoe to the post-war Battle of New Orleans. The game includes the same detailed tactical game engine as the earlier game Campaign 1776 and a higher level campaign game so that a player can fight individual battles or campaigns. Over 100 historical and what-if battles are included in the game together with a full-feature scenario editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Modes include play against the computer (A/I mode), two-player hot-seat at the same computer, two-player Play-By-E-Mail (PBEM), and multi-player network play (over the Internet, LAN, modem dialup, or direct cable connections).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes Main Program, Scenario Editor, Campaign Front-End, and Campaign Editor. The Campaign Editor allows the player to construct their own campaign games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supports both 2D and 3D graphical views. In 3D view, units are shown in detail with uniforms matching the historical situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete on-line documentation help files together with printable versions of the documentation files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
