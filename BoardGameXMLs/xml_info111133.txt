							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ironclaw: Squaring the Circle - Host&#039;s Book</name>
									
			<description>from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for the bold new adventure in fantasy role-play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience the rich and detailed world of Calabria, where dozens of species live together in sprawling cities and war-torn countryside. Kings broker for power with clergy, wizards, and merchants, each one struggling to conquer all they survey. Meanwhile, beneath the notice of the squabbling powers, lurk greedy robbers, cruel slavers, and dark necromancers who prey on the weak, the helpless, and the forgotten. It is a time for mighty warriors, for quick rogues, for clever wizards - a time for heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IRONCLAW's unique system of dynamic combat allows players to work together to defeat enemies. Enjoy action sequences as fast-paced and exciting as any book or movie, where how the battle is fought is just as important as why it was fought in the first place. From the star chambers of political conspirators, who plot steal the kingdom... to dark and haunted places, where supernatural peril threatens the mortal world... or even to the humble streets, where an urchin picks the wrong pocket - adventure is everywhere, limited only by the player's imaginations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may choose from dozens of species, careers, and special abilities. If you've never played a role-playing game before, you can make a few simple choices and play in minutes. Veteran gamers can delve deep into strange and powerful combinations, customizing every detail. You and your fellow players will create a party of adventurers, each with unique strengths to cover your friends' weaknesses, as you sally forth into a glorious new world of bold adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is not a stand-alone game. The pages in this book start from where the IRONCLAW Player's Book ended - you will need the Player's Book or Omnibus to play. You will also need polyhedral dice (four-sided, six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided, and twelve-sided).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
