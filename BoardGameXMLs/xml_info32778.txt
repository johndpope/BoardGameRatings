			<description>From the game's designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'While I enjoy Star Fleet Battles, it seems that there has been so much added to it since I first played that it is not the game that I first played. I wanted a simple, flexible game - and I wanted to add in Construction - something never in SFB. So here we are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'I thought about several ways to add realism to the game, and while that goal is laudable, it does not always render a usable game. While some things are in the game for realism, others are in it just for fun. One goal was realistic movement of some sort. I have tried to give a CONSISTENT movement system, at least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'I would like to have fighters as much as the next guy, but my sense of reality would not allow them to dominate Space Warfare as much as some would prefer.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
