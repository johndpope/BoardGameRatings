			<description>Have young children? Grandchildren? Make their first game APBA SuperStars. Share your passion for sports with your desire to spend quality time with those you love most. Give SuperStars to your little All-Star!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APBA's SuperStars line, is the perfect gift for younger kids who already love board games and sports or who are just learning about both. With photos of real baseball stars on the playing cards and game pieces, a game board designed like a baseball stadium, and moves that send players around the bases in a joyful race to reach home plate (with stops for hot dogs, bats and autographs), APBA SuperStars Baseball will lead young kids right into the ballpark and right into APBA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colorful and easy to learn, SuperStars is designed for kids Ages 4 - 7. Have your whole family join in the fun with APBA Andy and the SuperStars. And when the kids are ready to move on to more serious baseball fun, we'll be ready for them with APBA All-Star Edition and APBA Pro-Baseball!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
