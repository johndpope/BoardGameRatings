							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prose With Bros</name>
									
			<description>This is Prose with Bros, the first ever multiplayer competitive poetry game. Probably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prose with Bros is sort of like those fridge magnets you use to leave dirty sentences for your roommates. If only your fridge could talk and was connected to the internet so you could play against people around the world (side note: that fridge would be awesome).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can challenge your friends (or enemies) to a game, or just hop in with a random opponent. You both get the same 50 words to make a sentence. Who wins? Let the mob decide! 24 hours of online voting by the rest of the world will determine if you&amp;rsquo;re totally more awesome than your friend (like you keep telling them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 1100 words in the game, all with built-in voice playback! Feeling poetic? Funny? Dirty? Random? Offensive? (please don&amp;rsquo;t be offensive)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not feeling poetic? Wittle away the day voting on hilarious sentences from other players. You can even send them kudos for making you snort, chortle or guffaw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
