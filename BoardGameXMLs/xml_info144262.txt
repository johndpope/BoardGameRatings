							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cursed Knight: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe it was an accident, maybe it was a choice. Maybe it was destiny. For whatever reason, you were gifted with a dark power. Will you bend its strength towards good, revel in your power and bring the world to its knees, or be consumed utterly by the monster that lurks within you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cursed knight is a brand new base class for the Dungeon World system. The cursed knight walks a perpetual tightrope, gaining both greater power and greater risk of losing control as it unleashes its dark powers. Customize the nature and origin of your affliction, and choose whether to resist or embrace the corruption with 22 possible advanced moves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
