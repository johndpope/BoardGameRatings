			<description>Loosely translated from a French Game Site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alcazar is an abstract strategy game for two players that can be played in as little as 15 - 30 minutes. The object of Alcazar is to either immobilize your opponent's pawn by enclosing it within four walls or to occupy his/her starting square.  The game comes with a red and a green pawn, 8 walls, and a board with a 4x4 grid of what appear to be castles.  Walls can be placed between any two adjacent castles forming a border.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two pieces begin on their respective starting squares, which are located diagonally across the board from each other. Each piece begins surrounded by 4 walls. The object is to move one of the walls on each turn in order to either move your piece to your opponent's starting square or to enclose your opponent's piece so that it can no longer move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
