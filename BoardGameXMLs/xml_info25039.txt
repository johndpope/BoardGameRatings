			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENVIRONMENT is a game of skill and fun with the accent on learning and awareness of the World around you.  It will leave you thinking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game involves spinning the Dolphin to select a colour destination and question.  Questions are based on the World's environment as well as Geographical and Historical subjects testing your General Knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By moving the counters (carriers) clockwise on the Latitudes you make your way to the top of the World to collect a subject, returning anti-clockwise with it to  home base. During play there is a tactical element along with a lighter side of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENVIRONMENT is played by 2 to 6 players individually or as teams with as many as you wish on each side aged from 15 to adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
