							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Racial Wars: Flight over the desert</name>
									
			<description>Racial Wars is the first Polish fantasy card game, designed by Łukasz Kozak. Currently, the game is designed for 2-4 players. However, in the second edition the rules and game sets for 1 player will be presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War of Races takes place in Ithilion world and 12 different races and 1 neutral race take part in it. The goal is to conquer the opponent&amp;rsquo;s residence or to eliminate his leader from the battlefield. The game also becomes more strategic as you play on two fronts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racial Wars in not a collectible card game but thanks to random additions, the player can make his own, exclusive card deck. Each card has its own unique abilities and unrepeatable pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with only leader in front of them and build plateau of cards in front of them - some cards generate resources - different for different races - which are then used to put more powerful creatures into the table. Then, each turn the battle takes place - player who is currently attacking chooses units to attack and defending blocks their attacks with his own to protect his leader. The purpose of the game is to kill enemy leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on a fantasy world of Ithilion, which arose in author&amp;rsquo;s and his coworkers&amp;rsquo; minds. If you want to know the new world and characters living in it, or make a new era in Ithilion world and fight at one of the races&amp;rsquo; side, join the Racial Wars community and create with us new days of Ithilion world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Flight over the desert&amp;quot; is a battle set for Racial Wars game, in which there are two 55-card decks of Savands and Dragons races. This kit is a full self-contained game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box content&lt;br/&gt;An expanded version of the manual&lt;br/&gt;Two game mats&lt;br/&gt;Two posters&lt;br/&gt;Two 55-card decks of leaders: Or'grakrun (Dragons) and Petronus (Savands)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
