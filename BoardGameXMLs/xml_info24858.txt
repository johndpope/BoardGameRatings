							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grimoire des Illusions</name>
									
			<description>To represent the people of the Men or the people of the imps and to mark more points than its adversary. To obtain these points one looks at the end of each part what one recovered in his folds (folds makes during the part).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Black book of the Illusions is recovered, 12 points are marked. If one recovers more books than his adversary, one marks 9 points to have constituted the largest library. Are also marked points if the couple of his people is recovered, to have the largest population, if places are invested!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make folds (even raised that in Scopa or Escoba), it is enough to pose a chart of its play on one or two charts of the same value on the table of play. For example one 8 of my play can take a chart 8 on the table of play some is the color. Or, one 8 of my play can take a chart of 6 and one of 2 on the table (6+2=8).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the charts in hand were played, each camp counts the points contained in the folds carried out, and then one sets out again for another game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
