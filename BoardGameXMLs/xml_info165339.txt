							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Daashionoâ€™s Garden</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big. What is that thing? A petrified corpse? A fallen down statue?  Must be 60 feet or more. Don&amp;rsquo;t touch those rocks piling up where it&amp;rsquo;s crumbling away. They&amp;rsquo;re chaos rocks, for sure. They&amp;rsquo;ll fuel somebody&amp;rsquo;s dark magic, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want &amp;lsquo;em. If you&amp;rsquo;ve even sucked in their floating excrescence, head for the Daashiono&amp;rsquo;s garden - it&amp;rsquo;s right nearby. The plants there play the Song of Creation, so breathe deep. Expose your skin and face to it. The song healed the Daashiono of the raging in his skull and will pump your strengths as well. But, wait. It&amp;rsquo;s not about you. The seeds are the thing. The music locked in them will save the world. First? The Daashiono. Strain the song through all of them. Keep their power. Wash out the evil. Lucky you. You got the seeds. You get to save the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
