							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bump N Run the Stock Car Racing Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Bump N Run is a roll and move style game played on an oval race track/game board with 3 racing lanes. each player rolls the dice to determine the starting order. Highest roller is 1st, next highest 2nd, and so on up to 8 players. Each player starts the game with 10 fuel tokens, 4 tire tokens,and 4 Bump n Run cards. Then you decided on how many laps to run(5,10,20,etc). &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Each player, in turn rolls the dice and moves there car/pawn around the board space by space, lane to lane wherever they choose. Every time you roll the dice it cost you 1 fuel token, every time you change lanes it cost you 1 tire token. when you come up on another car/player you have the choice to race around him, or race to through him by playing a Bump R Run card, which knocks him back to where your turn started.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;When you get low on fuel or tires you race in to the pits to spin the pit wheel to earn money to buy more fuel, tires, and Bump N Run cards.  You spin the wheel once per turn and stay as many turns as you need to. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Every time you complete a lap of the track/board you collect a lap counter card to keep score.  The first player to complete a pre-determined number of laps is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
