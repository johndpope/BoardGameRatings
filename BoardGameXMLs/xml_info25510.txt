			<description>Players are leading an Enterprise. However they are not in good condition. They produce products for which there is not great demand and they have to stock those products in their warehouses. If they can't sell the products they have to dispose them if players do not set up their Enterprises &amp;quot;on demand&amp;quot; and do orientate their production on actual trends at the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a sponsored game. IBM (Switzerland) wants to show with this game how a &amp;quot;on demand&amp;quot; business works nowadays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
