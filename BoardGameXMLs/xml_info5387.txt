							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shakin&#039; Sorry</name>
									
			<description>Shakin' Sorry is a game for 2 to 4 players ages 6 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a fast-paced, easy-to-learn, dice version of Sorry!.  The game comes with 17 dice.  16 have the standard Sorry! colors - blue, yellow, red, and green - on 1 side each, with the other 2 sides remaining blank.  The last die is blue.  One side says Slide, another says Sorry, and the remaining sides are blank.  Each player starts with four dice in the Start section of their game board.  On their turn, a player puts all of the dice in their start section, along with the Sorry die, into the die cup and rolls.  Any dice that land with their color face up they put into their Home section.  Dice that land with the color of other players face up get put into their Start sections.  Blank dice return to the roller's Start section.  If the player rolls &amp;quot;Sorry&amp;quot; on the Sorry die, they steal a die from someone else's Home and put it in their own Start.  If they roll Slide, they have to take a die from their own Home and put it in the Start of the player to their left.  Lots of fun, no matter how old you are!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
