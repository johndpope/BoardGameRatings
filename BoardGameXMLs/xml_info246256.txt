			<description>Magik Realm is a game designed to recreate the experience of the AH classic Magic Realm with newer and simpler game mechanics.  It is a completely separate game with its own rules and components.  The biggest differences are not needing to choose goals (Victory points are scored) and not needing to record a plan for each day&amp;rsquo;s actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose one or more characters to play and move those characters through the game area of clearings on a 4 x 4 grid of tiles.  They will fight and avoid monsters that appear on the map, look for treasure sites and the treasures therein, meet with natives to buy and sell, hire muscle, and take on quests.  They gain Victory Points by discovering treasure sits, treasure, killing monsters, fulfilling quests, and learning new spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts thirty days.  Characters can perform a certain number of actions each day based on their current health.  The actions include: Move, Sneak, Search, Parlay, Rest, Magic, and Combat.  Every two days, an Occurrence chart is used to randomly determine which monsters and natives appear on the map and which once leave.  At the end of the thirty days, characters add up the Victory Points they scored and a winner is determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
