			<description>From the Instructions for Play:&lt;br/&gt;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To construct a global communications network ... ... A Superhighway of the Future&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players answer questions on world communications collecting nodes and points to build a worldwide network. In the course of the Game, Players will use communications technologies to build their global networks of the future.&lt;br/&gt;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This trivia game appears to have been designed for Alcatel, which logo appears on the box and the board. The game is of the simple 'draw-a-card-answer-a-question' variety. Getting answers right allows one to draw lines connecting 'nodes' on the curious seven-sided folding board that depicts a map of the world. The first player to connect sufficient nodes in all the different regions wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with the unusual board, a deck of General Knowledge/Expert question cards (General Knowledge on one side, Expert on the other), a deck of Operations cards (like chance cards) and 4 erasable marker pens in different colors. The pens are used to mark the lines in one's network on the board, and also to write down your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is on telecommunications networks and this is reflected in the questions asked. There are also options to use Submarine Cable and Satellite Systems on the board to help complete your network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
