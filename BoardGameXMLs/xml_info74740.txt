			<description>Subtitle: How to run a Play-By-E-Mail Role-Playing Game Campaigns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a great new way to enjoy your favourite Role-playing game. Whether your taste is for Fantasy, Science Fiction, Gothic Horror or Superheroic games- or one of the many other genres available- you will find it full of useful and thought provoking advice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this book you will discover how many Referees and Players have been able to have even more exciting and enjoyable adventures together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You see, the great majority of role-playing games are &amp;quot;tabletop&amp;quot; games. Unlike- for example- computer role-playing games, it is played by a group of players sitting around a table with a Referee controlling the action. Campaign activity is acted out through verbal interactions and any conflict is usually resolved by using figures and some sort of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But if you&amp;rsquo;ve bought this book, you already know that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, sometimes it is not possible for players to meet together on a regular basis. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that the fun has to stop, however, there are loads of ways that you can keep having fun with the game- especially in the virtual worlds of the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
