							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ACE - Assault, Control, Espionage</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACE is an international agency that operates in environments both openly hostile and clandestine. ACE is a third party spy network with elite operatives and a web of connections spanning the entire world. Basically if a problem is large enough to force the inclusion of ACE, it is on an apocalyptic scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACE Agents are international players in the field of espionage. Allied with no country, their work benefits the entire world rather than a single nation. Acting as allies with other intelligence agencies, ACE agents focus on areas that require the help of a third party rather than problems that can be solved internally. However the case for new and young recruits is often different, with them being tossed into less world-shattering problems so that they may become more venerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps due to their status as non-government and non-affiliated making ACE Agents seem expendable to outside agencies, or perhaps because of the reputation of ACE Agents capabilities, agencies that work with ACE have a tendency to put any ACE Agents into the worst situations. Generally this equals a very low survivability rate. This has cultivated a &amp;ldquo;golden rule&amp;rdquo; among ACE Agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
