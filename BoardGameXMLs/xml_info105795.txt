			<description>Ninjawaz can be classified as a showdown of Naruto vs. Bleach. Players should prepare for pulsating action and a unique &amp;amp; non-rigid approach to character progression.&lt;br/&gt;Ninjawaz offers you the chance to explore hundreds of paths. Combining various classes can create a volatile and powerful combination for your character; add to that the different armour and weapon options. There are practically innumerable sets of armour and weapons for you to equip onto your character, making them even more powerful. A wide and varied Multiple Synthesis system, which players can use to combine &amp;amp; enhance their items for an awesome result.  A unique Pet System, where an excellent pet can offer multiple roles of assistance to players, and each pet offers a unique benefit to its owner in terms of aid and skill advantage.&lt;br/&gt;Ninjawaz is a colorful landscape and fun environment that allows you to interact with the game instead of just passing through it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
