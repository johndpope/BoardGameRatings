			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are all newspaper editors.  They have Attributes, though they vary during play and are somewhat like Traits in more traditional games.  Attributes include Standing, Honor, and Ideal/Agenda.  Each editor has a newspaper which also has Attributes, including Circulation, Quality, and Popularity, which also vary during play.  Characters pursue stories and headlines to boost the circulation and popularity of their newspaper.  The game uses a somewhat math-heavy approach to determine outcomes.  Playability is hampered by poor organization of the materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
