							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Two Tribes</name>
									
			<description>Based on the BBC TV games show that ran from 2014-2015 hosted by Richard Osman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players are split into two tribes (teams), a Yes tribe and a No tribe, based on their answer to a question (for example &amp;quot;I prefer dogs to cats&amp;quot;). Each tribe then answers trivial questions trying to win as many points as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a full round the two players with the most individual points compete head to head in a buzzer round, the first to answer 3 questions correctly wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
