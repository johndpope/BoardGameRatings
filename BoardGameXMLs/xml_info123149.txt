							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Telepathy</name>
									
			<description>Looks like it might be an abstract game but turns out to be only luck-based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to travel from your outer star to the inner one. To do this a player must try to communicate with the other players telepathically. This is attempted by another player drawing a card from the deck and you have to identify it by only the power of the mind. Five such attempts (i.e. guesses) are allowed and the fewer used mean that you move further along the board in your journey to the centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
