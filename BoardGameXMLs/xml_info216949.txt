							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return to Coppernight Hold</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the release of Essentials for D&amp;amp;D 4e, there has never been a better opportunity to look anew at some of the early releases. One of the very first books was Dungeon Delve. Even then, it was obvious that the delves were pretty basic encounters, enough to get a solid gaming session done and dusted with no fuss. They  were straightforward, easy to prepare and run, they were fun. However, now that the game has evolved, I think it is worth  looking at what the same delves would look like now, with the benefit of Monster Vault, skill challenges and new tiles. The first delve I want to cover is inspired by Coppernight Hold by Shawn Merwin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of dwarven prospectors, led by Corven Coppernight, have staked a claim on an abandoned minehead nearby. That&amp;rsquo;s their story anyway. In fact, Corven is a novice adventurer, and has managed to acquire an old map, one that shows an ancient temple &amp;lsquo;dedicated to the elemental eye&amp;rsquo;, and hints at treasure within. He has convinced some of his clan into accompanying him on this delve, and to keep avaricious competition in the dark, they&amp;rsquo;ve concocted the mining cover story. They&amp;rsquo;ve been bringing back small finds to town for the past few months, in order to keep up&lt;br/&gt;appearances, but two weeks ago, the visits ceased. Unfortunately for the &amp;lsquo;miners&amp;rsquo;, a young white dragon has decided to use their excavations for her new lair. She has devoured most of the clan, and the rest are frozen by her icy breath, awaiting their certain doom. Sated for now, the dragon has pushed through to the temple and now rests, dreaming of more easy meals and hoards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
