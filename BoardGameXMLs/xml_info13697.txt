							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Huckleberry Hound</name>
									
			<description>Players must race around the board to pick up and deliver a telegram while avoiding a nasty bulldog.  On their turn, players move their Huckleberry Hound counter (in either direction along the path) and the Bulldog (presumably toward their opponents) according to the spin of a spinner.  If the mean dog lands on you, you are sent back several spaces unless you have a bone or steak card.  First to complete the circuit is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
