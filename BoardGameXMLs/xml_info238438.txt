							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Juiced: Eliminator</name>
									
			<description>Juiced: Eliminator is the sequel to Juiced. This version takes many elements from the console counterpart. It was released exclusively for the PlayStation Portable handheld system and released on mobile as Juiced 3D. It features a new mode where the player must try not to be eliminated, hence the title of the game. The plot itself is a reboot from the original Juiced, where players start out his/her racing career in Angel City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;The plot starts off with the start of the player's racing career in Angel City. The player starts racing a new crew leader called Nina (Crew name: Total Power Junkies), who doesn't respect the player and thinks that the player does not have what it takes to beat her in a race. She lets the player use one of her cars and wagers a bet with the player (the same with TK in the original Juiced). After the player beats her in the race, she gives the player more respect, and apologizes for being pushy before the race, as well as giving the player her cell phone number. This is where the career starts, giving the player a wider choice of race events and allowing the player to collect cars and get more respect from Nina and other crew leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juiced Eliminator features a new mode called Career Challenge. It's an extra career that is set by the crew leaders, where the player has to do a number of races in a limited amount of days (and months) to complete the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Juiced: Eliminator&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
