							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Latrunculi XXI</name>
									
			<description>Classical Latrunculi (Ludus latrunculorum or the Game of Little Soldiers) was an ancient strategy game played throughout the Roman Empire (27 BC - 1453 AD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latrunculi XXI is a variation of the ancient Roman game, expanding on the classical rules and adding new tactics which allow a modern 'XXI' (a.k.a. 21st) century player to force a win on his/her opponent, while minimizing the number of draws or blocked positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latrunculi XXI is played with light and dark pieces, checkers or stones to represent the soldiers, and a 2nd piece to identify the Dux (Leader or King). It can be played in various size boards: 8x8, 10x8 or 12x8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to immobilize the opponent's Dux, to stalemate him, or to annihilate his army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classical captures (custodial and corner) apply to Latrunculi XXI in addition to the following capturing tactics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Push and Crush Attack&lt;br/&gt;     Flank Attack&lt;br/&gt;     Phalanx Attack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latrunculi XXI has rules that limit the Duxes' mobility when they are in combat, as well as locked soldiers (similar to blocked pawns in Chess) which strategically limit the pieces mobility to increase capture opportunities, and to minimize the chances of draws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/latrunculi-petteia-xxi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/latrunculi-petteia-xx...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
