			<description>From Peter Funk, the writer of the &amp;quot;It Pays To Increase Your Word Power&amp;quot; column from the American magazine _Reader's Digest_, comes this game, a Trivial-Pursuit-style affair that tests players' knowledge of words and their meanings.  At the beginning of the game, players select a category of vocabulary, and for the remainder of the game they will be asked to define words from that subject.  The six categories are &amp;quot;Romantic Souls&amp;quot; (words from the arts and humanities), &amp;quot;Sports Nuts&amp;quot; (sports, recreation, and the outdoors), &amp;quot;Mad Scientists&amp;quot; (physical and social sciences), &amp;quot;Big Bosses&amp;quot; (business, commerce and government), &amp;quot;Globe Trotters&amp;quot; (geography, history, and culture), and &amp;quot;Know It All&amp;quot; (general and miscellaneous).  The game itself is a race around a track; players move their pawns around the board by correctly answering questions, with more difficult questions allowing faster progress.  The rules also include many game variants, from solitaire to group play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
