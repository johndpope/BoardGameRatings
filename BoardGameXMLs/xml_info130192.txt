							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyramid (Volume 3, Issue 40 - Feb 2012)</name>
									
			<description>Driven to Excellence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anchors aweigh away and full throttle! This month's Pyramid -- the PDF magazine for roleplayers -- takes a look at all things related to vehicles. The realistic and impossible from past, present, and future are pulling into your driveway now. This issue includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Mecha Operations,&amp;quot; which expands and tweaks the GURPS Spaceships rules to better facilitate robotic romps. Written by GURPS Ultra-Tech co-author Kenneth Peters, this article includes Spaceships stats for three brilliant bots.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Arsenal of Mageocracy,&amp;quot; a port of fantastic creations (complete with map). Scribed by the sage Matt Riggsby (GURPS Fantasy-Tech 1: The Edge of Reality), this feature includes GURPS info for 10 of its creations.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Hot Rides!&amp;quot; -- this month's Eidetic Memory offering from GURPS Fourth Edition co-author David Pulver. Get there in style with GURPS vehicle stats for eight of the most amazing (and expensive) modern sports cars.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Things Fall Apart,&amp;quot; offering guidelines for how to incorporate transportation trouble into any era. Whether your gaming table likes puzzle-solving or tactical troubleshooting, you're sure to find tips here to make them fear the &amp;quot;check engine&amp;quot; light.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Spirited Rides,&amp;quot; which gives adventure possibilities for three haunted vehicles (with GURPS stats). What was the ghost-ship's bargain? Can the heroes keep the trouble-solving truck appeased?&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Between-Space,&amp;quot; an impossible systemless &amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot; for any era, to serve as transport, destination, and plot point. When we say &amp;quot;it's a bargain,&amp;quot; that's more threat than exclamation . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pyramid also includes the latest Random Thought Table delivered from Steven Marsh's garage, a Murphy's Rules that loads up the trunk, and more. With this month's Pyramid, getting there is all the fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
