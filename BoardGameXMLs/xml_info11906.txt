			<description>Expansion for the Discovery Games edition of &amp;quot;Source of the Nile&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement clarifies many rules from Source of the Nile, and introduces many new and optional rules including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    customizing not only the explorer but EVERY guide, bearer and askari with individual skills, stregnths, and weaknesses&lt;br/&gt;    rules for lady explorers&lt;br/&gt;    rules for developments in weapon technology, to even up the odds against the heathen savages&lt;br/&gt;    rules for the slave trade, and encounters with slave raiders&lt;br/&gt;    cape colony and the Boers&lt;br/&gt;    rules for shooting the rapids and going over cataracts&lt;br/&gt;    a name generator for tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this supplement was intended for the discovery games edition, with a little tweaking, it is serviceable for use with the Avalon Hill edition, particularly if you use the &amp;quot;game 2&amp;quot; ruleset. Using all of these rules will greatly increase the complexity of the game, but if you can handle it all, it is a very rewarding and involved simulation of an African adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
