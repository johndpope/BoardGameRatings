							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barrow Hill Curse of the Ancient Circle</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere deep within the woods a timeless force is stirring. Beneath the ancient burial mound, known locally as Barrow Hill, a forgotten myth awakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the adventure, and uncover the secrets of the past. The legends of the Ancient world will live again; renewed, refreshed and hungry. Time has no meaning, as the sun sets low across the landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come to Barrow Hill and solve the mystery of the Druid's Circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stranded on the lonely road, which leads up to the Barrow, you must make your way through the trees, and darkening landscape, and out onto the Barrow itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in the footsteps of the well-known archaeologist, Conrad Morse, you will discover that the barrow is more than just a mound of earth and a collection of forgotten standing stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, not all archaeology is constructive, for some things should be left buried and undisturbed. Perhaps it is too late for that&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comments A old-style point-and-click mystery game with richly illustrated (although not quite photo-realistic) pre-rendered backgrounds and a strongly thematic (creepy...) soundtrack. Movement is orthogonal from one screen to another (you can move forward, or turn left &amp;amp; right, or zoom in/out on hotspots) The setting is the current day - or at least begins that way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
