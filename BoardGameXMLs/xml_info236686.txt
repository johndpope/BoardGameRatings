			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sun has yet to reach high noon, and already you have had two grand adventures. The first adventure was a common dream in which you lived as members of a slave tribe south of your real home., the city of Raam. At the time you had no memory of who you really were, so when you saw Raam explode into violence and blood you were immediately concerned. Later, when soldiers streamed out of Raam heading you way, your tribe became fearful. Your chief sent you on a quest to determine what was happening, and what you discovered made you even more fearful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
