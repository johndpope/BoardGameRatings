			<description>Despotic is a fantasy themed 2 player spatial-tactical strategy board and card game. In Despotic, players assume the role of gladiator-like parties sent to battle one another for the Emperor's pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the abstract game of Chess, Despotic plays fast, adds some luck, probability management, decision limitation, and equalization(handicapping of Chess-Masters). In Despotic, the goal is to destroy your opponent's &amp;quot;King&amp;quot; or to run your opponent out of their 20 Power cards.  Losing a Unit requires the removal of Power Cards equal to the Unit's Value.  Also, Players remaining in Check must remove 2 Power Cards from their deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial set-up is like standard Chess, however each Player has 2 decks of cards (20 Movement Cards and 20 Power Cards).  Each Player starts with 3 Movement Cards.  During a turn, the player can (a) Play 1 card from their hand and resolve its effect, (b) Discard any number of cards from their hand and draw back up to 3 cards (Power and/or Movement Cards), -OR- (c) May remove any number of Dead Cards in their hand from the game, and then may draw and play 1 Power Card for each Dead Card removed.  At the end of a turn, the Player draws back up to their hand limit size of 3 cards (from either Power and/or Movement Cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement Cards allow a corresponding Unit to move as indicated (standard Chess patterns).  Power Cards allow non-traditional movement and/or create special effects/abilities in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
