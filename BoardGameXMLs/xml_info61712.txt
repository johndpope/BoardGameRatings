			<description>Up to four wooden hedgehogs (without any spines at the beginning) are running around a circular track. The movement is determined by dice (1-3 squares onwards), which could also show a color symbol. In that case, a spine in that color can be added to the hedgehog; the same happens when a hedgehog reaches a color square. When hedgehogs meet or a hedgehog symbol is rolled, the active player can exchange a spine with another hedgehog (some limitations apply). When a hedgehog has been filled up with all spines in its color and reaches a square in that color, the player who owns it is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
