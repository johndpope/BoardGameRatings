							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kobe Mini-Yard</name>
									
			<description>A table game with a circular board that has four pockets. The board is made of wood and has a circumference of 85 cm. It revolves like a lazy Susan so players need not stand up. The games have elements of Carrom and Billiards (The name is a contraction of 'mini-billiards').&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand held spring-loaded cue with which they try to hit various colored wooden pucks into the pockets.&lt;br/&gt;There are at least three different games that can be played. For example, Direct Pocket, where points are scored for knocking the pucks into the pockets (eg a red puck is worth 5 points, a green is worth one point). There is Battle Game, where you try to pocket your opponents' pucks by striking them with your own.&lt;br/&gt;There is also a game set called Octo Mini-yard which has an octagonal board.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
