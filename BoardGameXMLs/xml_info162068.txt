			<description>In Arkhangelsk you play a team of soldiers sent to Arkhangelsk to find out why it is no longer responding to communications.  At the beginning of the game you just arrived in the camp. You need to get the power on, radio working, and call for evacuation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn you will draw cards from your deck to gain time to take actions like moving, firing, repairing and searching. You can also use the time to refine your tactics by purchasing cards. The cards in your hand  give you both time to take actions and better or more efficient actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses your deck will become stronger, but the storm will increase in intensity, the sun will set, and stronger creatures will venture forth from the surrounding Siberian wastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to balance all your actions carefully to survive the elements, repair the prison, kill the winter creatures and finally make a dash for the airstrip when the plane lands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
