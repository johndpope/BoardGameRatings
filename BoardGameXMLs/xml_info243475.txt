							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wreckside District: A Post Apocalypse Setting</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A City Of Wasted Potential&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aria stood at the edge of the wasted city and peered off towards its most functioning, but violent, part... Wreckside. The crumbling district was given its name years ago for the salvage yard and multiple garages and towing services that sprung up in the area. Now its name is more fitting for the condition of the district and its desperate inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So why are we are going back to that place again?&amp;quot; Aria questioned her companion, Darius, as she stared at the dimly glowing lights of the distant buildings, proof that at least some of Wreckside's inhabitants enjoyed the rare treat of functioning electricity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darius took a swig from a metal flask as he walked away from the acrid smolder of the dying barrel fire. &amp;quot;Supplies. Some special stuff. Electronics and some old notes on building things. I'll know it when I see it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aria hated it when Darius wouldn't tell her exactly what they were looking for. Still, though, Darius was renowned by the outskirt settlers as a master scavenger and for keeping his mouth shut about what his employers wanted him to recover. The young woman has learned a lot since Darius took her under his wing a year ago, and the scavenger has always managed to keep her alive in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So its another one of those jobs, eh? Typical orders from Garrett, don't let the new kid in on the details...&amp;quot;, Aria remarked with an obvious bit of disgust in her voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, don't be knocking on Garrett,&amp;quot; Darius replied as he checked the contents of his backpack and finished loading rounds into his pistol clip. &amp;quot;The old man is a bit of a creeper, yeah, but he pays well. Plus, we're going to get a pretty big bonus this time if we get back with exactly what he's hoping we'll find.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Big bonus? What he hopes we'll find?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You'll see. Now follow me... quietly. I've been told there's a safer route into the district.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wreckside District is an urban, post apocalyptic setting designed for role playing games set after the collapse of civilization. The district's map contains over two hundred numbered locations which are each provided individual descriptions and details. In addition the Game Master (GM) will find a small assortment of random charts that aid in rolling up scavenged items and loot. There's also a wealth of information concerning the urban area's inhabitants, including the various rival gangs that compete to control Wreckside District.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
