			<description>This is a twist on the classic game Othello/Reversi. The player playing the black pieces (that is the black side of the pieces) is called Black. The other player plays the white pieces and is called White. In Reviser the players play different roles. One player will play the 'Setter,' the other will play the 'Jumper.' Setter and Jumper keep their role during the whole game. At his turn, the Setter places one of his pieces on the board. That piece must be in line with one of his pieces so that one or more opponents pieces are between them (without any empty fields between them). These opponents pieces are flipped. This is the same mechanism as in Reversi. At his turn the Jumper must jump with one of his pieces (on the board) over any number of his opponents pieces in a straight line. The opponents pieces he jumped over are flipped. He may continue to jump with that piece if possible. He must not jump over his own pieces or over empty fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends if one player is unable to make a legal move. The player with the greater number of his pieces on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An entry into the About.com: 2002 Unequal Forces Game Design Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
