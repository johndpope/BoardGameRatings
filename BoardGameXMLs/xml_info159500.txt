			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many will enter, some will win. All will laugh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are back with more random! And you like random. Or you will, soon!&lt;br/&gt;A full new set of cards that can be played with the original game, or on their own. Be sure to watch out for sharks! And cake. Especially the cake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Summary (from We Didn't Playtest This At All)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone starts with 2 cards. On your turn, draw one card from the deck, and then play one from your hand following the instructions on the card. There are many hazards to avoid, including: bombs, dragons, arrows, laser pointers, arrows, black holes, Rock Paper Scissors battles, number battles, zombies, etc. Luckily items abound that can save you, too: spaceships, science, shields, dinosaurs and a kitten ambush!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standalone game that may be integrated with We Didn't Playtest This At All.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
