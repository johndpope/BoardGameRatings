							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buccaneers</name>
									
			<description>Armed sailing ships are a-cruising on the oceans o' a world in which waters dominate on the dry land, and in which ye will live piratical adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world has almost entirely been submerged by the oceans. Only a few islands and archipelagos are left. Technologies have almost been reset by the oceanic disasters. &amp;gt;From the far and forgotten age o' the pirates profecies and spells come back, and in these years, the beginnings of the XXII century, they find their place, leaving the planet in the hand of a buccaneers government!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buccaneers is a diceless role-play game, and it uses a simple game system based on the management o' the resources given tae the character. The setting is post-apocalyptic (our world after natural disasters), an' the action takes place after 2112. Few technologies are left an' they come out in a world where the best mean o' transport is the sail again. Ruined skyscrapers rise 'mong the trees, livin' on the few dry lands left, armed galleon ships fight on the seas, while in the officers cabin the buccaneers o' the Empire communicate by MV transmitters, and on the quarter-deck the mage buccaneers call the elemental powers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
