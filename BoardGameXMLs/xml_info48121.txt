			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Merc: Campaign Book One: Rhodesia will give players all the pertinent information they will need to historically run their respective campaigns within Rhodesia. Because of the locale, we have added a new Specialist classification with it's appropriate Skill Test. Also, The Rhodesian Campaign has some unique units which we will discuss and show players how their characters will be able to fit within the Security Forces. It is also important that the Terrs are discussed and analyzed. We also give them basic stats for the Corporation's use.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
