							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hostile Realms Fantasy Battle Rules</name>
									
			<description>Hostile Realms uses Piquet games concepts including the Sequence Deck, impetus, opposed polyhedral die rolls and morale chips to bring a new style of warfare to Fantasy miniature tabletop wargaming. This game stands alone and does not require the Piquet Core Rules to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special sections or rules on:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Magic This is important but not dominating. More than 40 different spells in 4 levels of difficulty are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Heroes and Champions (who may also be Wizards). These characters command subsections of the army, and may fight on their own as well. Their varying capabilities determine how they impact the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Relics These magical items alter how units and/or heroes perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Fantastic Creatures The Bestiary covers 25 types, from swarms of bats to Wyverns. Many have special abilities such as poison, regeneration, causing disease, and/or use of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Flight Some heroes may be mounted on flying steeds, and many creatures and even some units of troops may fly above the fantasy battlefield, raining missiles down upon their land bound foes, and/or swooping down from above to wreak destruction with weapons, teeth, and/or claws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Starter Army Lists (18) These include many popular armies from other fantasy miniatures wargames and common fantasy tropes to help novice players get started immediately. The introductory scenario &amp;quot;The Battle of the Black Valley,&amp;quot; features an Orc army opposed by a High Elven army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
