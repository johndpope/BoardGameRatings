							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise of the Aeronauts</name>
									
			<description>Rise of the Aeronauts is a steampunk-themed game that lets players take control of a unique faction, such as the Machinists or Steamgunners, and fight against opponents to build the world's first airship. Players must secure rights to resources by conquering opponent's territories and defending their own. Structures can be built that grant players both victory points and various offensive, defensive, or luck benefits. The game runs less than 90 minutes, is quick to pick up, and it has the depth to keep heavy gamers interested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
