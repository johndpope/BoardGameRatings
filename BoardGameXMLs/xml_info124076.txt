							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Economy of Force</name>
									
			<description>Economy of Force is a fast-playing, boardless, luckless, tactical skirmish game.  Players build their own armies by mixing and matching units from four distinct factions, and battle in a contest reminiscent of Hive mixed with Heroclix.  And best of all, it's currently a free print-and-play game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With only one neutral tile and a dozen or so hex tiles per army, the game is extremely portable.  There are no miniatures to paint, and no sprawling maps to eat up table space.  A game can be played in fifteen minutes, and on a surface as small as an airplane tray table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Economy of Force, mobility is as important as might, and players must maneuver their units around the periphery of the battlefield, trapping or attacking their enemy, while being careful not to get their own forces pinned or destroyed.  If a Commander is destroyed, or an army is unable to use all four of its action points in a turn, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you play as the heavily armored Crusaders, relying on coordination between multiple units for success?  Or possibly the mobile and deadly Saracens?  Don't forget the devious Pirates, able to manipulate units in strange ways, or the brutish Natives, who can deal nearly limitless damage.  Or create your own motley bunch by choosing from any or all factions you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
