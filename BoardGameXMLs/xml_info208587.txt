			<description>Every legend has a beginning and every famous skeleton like Johnny the Skull had to start somewhere. Where would that be if not at the graveyard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this game the first thing you should do is find a place with dim light. We suggest going to the nearest graveyard at night to play, but we feel that might be too creepy! A darkened location is best because the skeleton bones glow in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the count of three, both players should start excavating to become the fastest digger on earth. One player is collecting green bones and the other player orange bones. Use the shovel to move the dirt and uncover the elusive parts of our friend, Johnny. When you find a bone of your color, seize it with the eerie tweezers and put it next to the other pieces you have found on the glow in the dark diagram.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of this unusual game of digging out a skeleton from a graveyard is not the one who finds all the bones first, but the one who can put all the pieces where they belong. The first player to build Johnny's skeleton will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
