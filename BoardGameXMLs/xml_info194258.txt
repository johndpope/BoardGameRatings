							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer</name>
									
			<description>Turtles travel freely (the number rolled on the die, in any direction) around the game board fighting Shredder's henchmen.  The goal is to try to win enough battles, collect enough cards, and beat Shredder first.  Each board space has one of a handful of actions associated with landing there.  Sewers are used as portals to jump across the board and manhole covers can be used to block those portals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game rules borrow heavily from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Pizza Power Game (1987).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
