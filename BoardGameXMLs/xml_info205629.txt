			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diss Jockey is a party game where cards are drawn to set the theme of the round, and players take turns playing a song on their mobile device that is judged by one player, the Diss Jockey. At the end of the round, the Diss Jockey awards the best choice a &amp;quot;Hit&amp;quot; Card worth 1 point, and the worst choice a &amp;quot;Diss&amp;quot; Card worth -1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Diss Jockey has the option to stop the song at any point and move on to the next one by holding up the &amp;quot;Skip&amp;quot; Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hit and Diss Cards are drawn to set the theme of the round, as well as serving as each player's score. The Diss Cards follow this format: &amp;quot;This _____ Song&amp;quot; and the Hit cards follow this format: &amp;quot;That _______&amp;quot;. So the theme is set by drawing 3 of each, selecting the Hit and Diss cards to use, and returning the unused cards to the bottom of their respective decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample Themes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 90's song that reminds you of your ex.&lt;br/&gt;This Pop song that you wouldn't want to hear right before your colonoscopy&lt;br/&gt;This Sentimental song that sucks and everyone is too stupid to realize it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
