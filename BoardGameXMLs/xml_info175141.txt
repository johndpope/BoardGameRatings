			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Man's Hand is a role playing game set in the American Old West, also known as the Wild West. The Wild West comprises the history, geography, people, lore, and cultural expression of life in the Western United States, most often referring to the period of the later half of the 19th century, between the American Civil War and the end of the century. After the 18th century and the push beyond the Appalachian Mountains, the term is generally applied to anywhere west of the Mississippi River in earlier periods and westward from the frontier strip toward the later part of the 19th century. More broadly, the period stretches from the early 19th century to the end of the Mexican Revolution in 1920.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Old West passed into history, facts became myths. Myths that still get told today and that are stuck in the imagination of people, when they tell stories about the Wild West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Man's Hand takes place in this mythological Wild West, where fierce bountyhunters roam the West to hunt down wanted robbers, robbers that blow the railways up to rob the travelling commoners, commoners that pick up their gun to defend their claims from baddies and beasts alike, where there are saloons in every town with piano players in the corner and a gambler at a table, that cheats from time to time and gets tared and feathered if he wins too much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the roles of characters that are trying to make their living in one way or the other, while the game master, who will be reffered to as &amp;bdquo;Sherrif&amp;ldquo; in the following rules, directs them along a storyline he made up before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is entirely diceless and uses pokercards as well as jetons instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you'll need one deck with 54 cards (4 suits &amp;agrave; 13 cards + 1 red joker + 1 black joker) and one deck without jokers. Keep those decks apart and make sure that you are always able to tell them apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally you will need jetons with (at least) the values 1, 5 and 10. Other values like 25, 50, 100 or more might become useful, but are not necessarily required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
