							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nighthawks (Version 1.2)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elevator Pitch:&lt;br/&gt;This is a low-powered Superheroes setting that strives to emulate the gritty, street-level heroics of comics like Batman, Punisher, Daredevil, Hawkeye, The Shadow and Watchmen (sans Dr. Manhattan).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting &amp;amp; Flavor:&lt;br/&gt;This campaign is set in a fictitious metropolis called King City. The world is an alternate reality facsimile of Earth and the timeline is equivalent to the current millennium. Crime has gone out of control all over the world and costumed vigilantes have emerged as an augmentation of beleaguered law enforcement agencies everywhere. The popular media has taken to calling these vigilantes &amp;quot;Nighthawks&amp;quot; because they typically prey on crooks under the cover of darkness. In spite of the shared moniker, most Nighthawks work independently so that their secret identities won't be discovered, but a few small teams and duos have formed over the years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very few people possess anything in the way of real super powers. Most Nighthawks are simply people of extraordinary fitness, training and wealth who have chosen to answer the call to protect the general peace. Experimentation into super science and occult mysticism has, in isolated cases, produced individuals with truly supernormal abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In response to this new class of law enforcement that is not bound by due process, the criminal underworld has also started to bankroll &amp;quot;Nighthawks&amp;quot; of their own. In many ways this has made the streets more dangerous than they ever were, but there is no shortage of would-be heroes who are willing to don the mask and dispense street justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
