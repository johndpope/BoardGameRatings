			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Body Is Not Your Own&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Claustrophobia and paranoia started to set in for everyone about the same time. This did not make things easier. However, it feels like the walls are closing in when you don&amp;rsquo;t know who to trust and something is hunting you to become you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stimulants Anastasia had been taking were certainly keeping her awake, but at the price of making her paranoia worse. She was a mess &amp;ndash; wild-eyed, tangled haired, and twitchy.  It was not her best look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this led to the moment in which Anastasia was holding a live incendiary grenade and screaming at everyone to get back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Void is an original Lovecraftian hard sci-fi horror setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrors of the Void I: Body Horror:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Presents four monsters in detail, including both how to effectively use them as a GM and how to combat them as a player &amp;ndash; 6 to 8 pages each.&lt;br/&gt;     Themed around Body Horror &amp;ndash; the degeneration or appropriation of one&amp;rsquo;s own body.&lt;br/&gt;     Explore the shapeshifting metamorphasite, the microscopic myriad, the terrifying seethari, and the infectious shambler.&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded information for monsters appearing previously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
