			<description>The theme of the game is the story of Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf; the game consists of four player tokens, the board and a die. The players draw lots over who is the Wolf.&lt;br/&gt;The players roll the die and move their tokens according to the roll. The player who reaches the goal first is the winner. However, the Wolf must capture all three Pigs in order to win. In case he is ahead of all three Pigs, the Wolf, and he alone, may move backwards.&lt;br/&gt;If the Wolf arrives at a circle where a Pig is resting, he has captured the Pig and that player must remain there. If another Pig arrives at this circle, the captured Pig is released. He may also gain his own freedom by rolling a six.&lt;br/&gt;If a Pig arrives at a circle where the Wolf is resting, the latter must remain there for two turns.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to these basic rules, there are several special event circles that have their own rules for the Pigs and the Wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
