							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Time Soccer</name>
									
			<description>Soccer (or &amp;ldquo;non-American football&amp;rdquo;) is easily the most popular sport in the world, with an estimated fan base of 3.5 billion. 'Big Time Soccer' is a card-driven game based on the most comprehensive statistics available, and will delight players with an accurate number of shots at net, goals scored, etc., and features fast, streamlined play. All the elements of pro soccer are here, including corner kicks, fouls, free kicks, goal kicks, penalty kicks, dribbling, passing, tackles and intercepted passes. Soccer wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be complete without yellow (and red) cards, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find them in the game, too, assessed with realistic frequency. So put on your jersey and shin guards, and get ready for some soccer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 72-card Action Deck    &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  1 20-Sided Die    &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  1 Ball Marker    &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  1 Soccer Field (the &amp;ldquo;Pitch&amp;rdquo;)    &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  1 Chart Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 12 Yellow-Card Chits&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;  1 Rules Booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll need to print all the files (except the Info Sheet) in the section below to play the Print &amp;amp; Play version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: I only rate my own games so they'll appear in user searches.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
