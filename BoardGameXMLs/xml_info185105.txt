			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Urban Thievery, an HTML Adventure by Fatal Games.  Although we hope you enjoy this adventure, it also serves as a tutorial to playing a pick pocket in F.A.T.A.L.  Knowledge of F.A.T.A.L. is not required, but recommended.  To participate in this adventure, you need a set of role-playing dice, most importantly three 10-sided dice.  Scratch paper and a pen or pencil are also necessary, for example, so you can keep track your character&amp;rsquo;s money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To participate in this adventure, read the text until you are prompted either to make a decision or roll dice.  When you make a decision, click on the hyperlink that corresponds best with your decision.  This adventure does not attempt to list all possible decisions, or places where decisions may be made, but offers decisions important to the adventure.  When prompted to roll dice, roll the appropriate dice on a hard surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When prompted to make a skill check, you will be asked to roll 3d10.  This means that you must roll three 10-sided dice.  Sum the results.  Next, a modifier may be listed on the screen.  Apply the modifier to your sum.  Consider your result and report it by clicking on the appropriate hyperlink.  Higher results are better for your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An online, HTML-only, &amp;quot;choose your own adventure&amp;quot; type scenario.  Generally, each page ends with two options.  Occasional dice rolls are required.  Various endings are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
