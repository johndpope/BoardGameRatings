			<description>Discover clock and time. What&amp;rsquo;s the cuckoo doing inside of the clock? Why are the days longer in summer? What&amp;rsquo;s a second? With that tiptoi game children learn easily how to read the clock. The tiptoi pen is used to explain topics on cardboards which show daily events of Anna and her family. The main element of the game is the big adjustable clock. Depending on the difficulty children choose the front or back side. Children have to set the clock on several times to show which family event happens at which time. The tiptoi pen always supports the players doing that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
