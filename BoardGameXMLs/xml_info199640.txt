							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WÃ¼rfel-Tennis/Pfui Spinne</name>
									
			<description>W&amp;uuml;rfel-Tennis (2 players)&lt;br/&gt;This game simulates a tennis match by spinning a top (or rolling a die) and moving the ball (game piece) accordingly. The ball moves from one half of the game board to the other and back. Generally two sets with up to 10 fault points are played. Only if the two sets are a draw, a third set is played to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pfui Spinne (backside of the board, 2-4 players)&lt;br/&gt;The players start at space 1. Movement is determined by the spinning top (or a die). If the players get on space 21 (the spider) they lose the game. The last player in the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
