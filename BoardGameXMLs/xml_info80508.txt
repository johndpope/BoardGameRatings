			<description>Zero Zap is a pinball-like game where players position an arrow and launch it into the playing area. The arrow then bounces around hitting point targets, ranging from 0-9 points, and deflecting off of walls. Each time a point target is hit, it changes into an X, which then becomes a point target again, of a random value, when hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to get as high of a score as possible with a limited number of times in which the arrow can be launched. If a player lands back onto the starting area, they launch again. If a player hits a point target of 0, the arrow falls back to the starting area, ready to be launched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game featured a mode for customizing the play area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
