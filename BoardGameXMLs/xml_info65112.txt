			<description>&amp;quot;Laterali&amp;quot; is a mental game for 3 - 12 players, challenging their lateral thinking skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player is reading the topic of a Laterali card and is betting a number of requested answers, which all other players together are not able to find. The more answers the player is asking for (the more difficult it is for the others) the less improvement he can make on the board - the easier he is challenging the others, the further he can move forward on the board, when the team can't reach the demanded number of answers.&lt;br/&gt;All other players (the team) are now challenged to find as many possible answers within 1 minute and try to fulfill his presettings. If they can do so, the team has won this round and each team member can move forward and also has the chance to &amp;quot;beat&amp;quot; the questioner and send him back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the next players turn to pull a Laterali card and challenging the others by betting a requested number of answers...&lt;br/&gt;As soon a player has reached the finish line he has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are very difficult, although there are always many answers possible - it is not a trivial quiz game &amp;quot;one question - one answer&amp;quot; and matching answers can only be found by extraordinary methods of resulution. Therefor Laterali can be used as training-tool for lateral thinking methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laterali is available in 2 different game versions, Laterali Light with 432 question-cards or Laterali DeLuxe with 648 Laterali-cards. Both versions include a game board and 12 3D-figurines and a timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laterali is available in German and will be presented at the Nuernberg Toy Fair 2010 the first time.&lt;br/&gt;For 2011/2012 an English Version will be available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
