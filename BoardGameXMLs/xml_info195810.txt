He could have been born a hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few notable features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;checkmark Recruit minions&lt;br/&gt;checkmark Collect magical cheekis&lt;br/&gt;checkmark Take part in a night watch&lt;br/&gt;checkmark Join a coven&lt;br/&gt;checkmark Transform friends into creatures&lt;br/&gt;checkmark Discover mist portals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
