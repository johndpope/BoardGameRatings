			<description>What could be more fun then Trading good in the Mediterranean? It happens when you combine LCR components to create YADE (Yet Another Dry Euro). Move you ship from port to port and discover the shipping needs. Do the best job of matching the needs to win with the most Victory Points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: To have your sea ports end the game with the most total value in goods Shipped to it, and insuring that your home port has more value then your sister ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-Play: Players will take turns Useing dice to Launch/Land from port to port. While there they peak at the requested good and attempt to marry the right goods card in following turns. After the first chip is revealed take ownership of the port and begin to fill orders. Look out for other players that chose to mess with your effort at the port. They can improve the value of a sister port or try and ruin your home port value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
