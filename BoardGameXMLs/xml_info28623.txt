			<description>In Rekkakuskit (the truck drivers) each player tries to make their living by running a transportation company. They get paid for delivering consignments but must cover their expenses. The winner is the player that has gained most capital at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning the players get the starting capital, the operation permit cards and place their pawns in Helsinki also taking the initial freight card. Each freight card shows a destination and a table of fees. The actual fee depends on the zone one's pawn is located and the type of the operation permit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a map of Finland divided in three zones: southern, middle and northern Finland. The map shows the largest cities and a set of roads (tracks of squares) between them. There are two types of operation permits and you may buy an extended permit to operate with improved rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving your truck (pawn) happens by roll-and-move and should one land on a given square an event card is drawn. The major part of events consist of maintenance costs. Once the destination city is reached a new freight card is drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
