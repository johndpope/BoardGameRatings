			<description>Game Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROCLAMATION&lt;br/&gt;In the name of phantasmal powers that guard the gates of time, I, the good magician and mage of the seven provinces, do hereby make known and publicly proclaim the need for a champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All ye who are skilled in battle and horrible of mein and great of cunning, ye who are familiars of the supernatural and initiates to the ways of spell-casting&amp;mdash;come ye forth and declare yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great are the rewards to him who rescues the Seven Provinces from the curse of the Dragon's Eye. But great also are the perils. Treasures of true potency will be found by those who seek out the Eye&amp;mdash;treasures that are guarded by foul dragons, golems, ghosts, and a variety of beasties and beings that go bump in the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He who accepts the challenge will behold the full graphic splendors of spell-casting and serpent slashing. His magic glass will reveal to him, as never before it could, in chillingly animated detail, the gory destiny that awaits his readied blade. Hidden treasures will be found that bedazzle the eye. Magic effects will confound the senses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To him who finds the Dragon's Eye, know ye that your great prowess will have banished forever the curse of the Evil Necromancer. Your name will be garbed in glory, and you will receive the worthiest of rankings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apply within.&lt;br/&gt;The Good Magician&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon's Eye, an overland adventure invites the player into a completely detailed world of fantasy involvement. Though the game is relatively easy to learn, the subtle interplay among magic effects, monsters, weapons, and treasures retrieved makes this a challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
