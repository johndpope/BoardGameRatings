							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Indiana Jones and the Dragon of Vengeance</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time for you and Indiana Jones to find THE DRAGON OF VENGEANCE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indiana Jones is about to embark on his most dangerous adventure yet. To your great surprise, you realize that you are going with him to China to search for an ancient jade dragon with diamond eyes. You will be opposed by a violent secret society called The Golden Lotus, which wants the power of this precious relic for itself. You'll have other problems, too: hungry tigers, strange blood rituals, a gang of vicious thugs, even an earthquake! And remember: YOU are responsible for whatever happens, because YOU are going to make all the decisions-where to go, what to do, and how to handle it - as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
