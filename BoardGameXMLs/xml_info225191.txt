			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Commodore 64 remake of &amp;quot;Metal Warrior: Hessian Adventure in Dismal Future&amp;quot; - with an altered plot and different gameplay - and the first in the Metal Warrior series. Players take control of a young metal guitarist named Ian, as he tries to investigate the death of his best friend and uncover a conspiracy targeting metal guitarists. NPCs can be interacted with to gain new clues and advance the story. An inventory bar allows the player to carry various items, including a variety of weapons and consumables. Items can be purchased from shops within the city or collected from defeated enemies. The game's story is divided into episodes, with cutscenes in between each episode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although technically a C64 game, the game has always been a download, no physical copies exist. The game is meant to be downloaded from the Internet to be run on an emulator, the files are in the format of a C64 diskette so probably could also be transferred onto a real physical C64... somehow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
