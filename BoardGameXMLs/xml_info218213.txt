							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ewsdek&#039;s Regret</name>
									
			<description>Always tidy up after yourself&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ewsdek's Regret is an adventure designed for four 1st-level or 2nd-level player characters. It is set in the world of Greyhawk in particular the land of Onwal. It could quite easily be based in any campaign world in a region of forested hills.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;A generation or so ago, a dwarven generation that is, the area around Trebourne was the site of a mini gold rush. Dwarves from The Iron Hills came in search of wealth, digging mazes of tunnels in the soft limestone to reach the veins in the underlying granite. Few found anything but poverty and disappointment as there was only one lode of any value and that was swiftly worked out. Most of the dwarves filled in the workings carefully before returning to their homes. The mine known as Ewsdek's Regret was one of the last of these and no one was there to notice that Ewsdek did not return with the other dwarves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed with a GIF map file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
