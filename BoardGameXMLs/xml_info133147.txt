			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a hot day when Roberta drove to the store. Her shift started in an hour. Instead of the usual parking lot full of customers, she saw two lone pick-up trucks. As she got out of her car, her Greene's apron on and badge ready, she met the two drivers. They were both standing by the closed front door.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What's going on,&amp;rdquo; one of the men asked, sincerely. &amp;ldquo;Jim and Betty okay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What,&amp;rdquo; Roberta replied? The man pointed to the sign in the window: Closed indefinitely.&lt;br/&gt;Roberta was shocked. She had tried to keep out of Jim and Betty's business too much, with Jim's health fading and all, but she knew she couldn't afford to now. The ArchAngel Gabriel told her she would know when she was to help them. It was now.&lt;br/&gt;Roberta excused herself from the gentlemen and got back in her car. A few dirt roads later, she was at Jim and Betty's house. Standing outside was Mitz. He lowered his sunglasses a little and lit up his cigarette.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Get the Hell away from here, Mitz,&amp;rdquo; Roberta said loudly as she stepped out of the car.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Relax, Ro. We had a deal. I'm not gonna hurt 'em directly. You'd kill me.&amp;rdquo; Mitz puffed up his cigarette. &amp;ldquo;I will however take it all and run it to the ground. If he makes the night you'll be lucky. But I told you when you got here, little Angel. This is my town, like it or not.&amp;rdquo; And with that, Mitz disappeared into thin air and Roberta just hoped he went back to Hell. She slammed her car door shut and said a prayer as she went inside. Maybe Gabriel would send a little help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
