			<description>Back of box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are summoned again, Brave Warrior,&lt;br/&gt;THE GEMSTONE SAGA CONTINUES...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the dawn of time, the Creators of Heaven, Earth, and the Netherworld made mankind the keeper of the wondrous Gemstone. Using the Gemstone to focus the Earth's natural magical powers, Man was able to create a veritable Paradise.  Then the unthinkable happened.  Goaded by envy and avarice, the Demons of the Netherworld plundered the Holy Temple and seized the Gemstone in a perverse attempt to make its magic serve their vile purposes. But the Gemstone was created to be an instrument of Goodness only and proved useless to the servants of Evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their frustration and rage, the Demons destroyed this Gift of the Gods by splitting it into five pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a previous adventure known as GEMSTONE WARRIOR, you braved the horrors of the Netherworld dungeons, recovered the Pieces and restored the Gemstone to its rightful place in the Temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But to your dismay, the Gemstone has lost its powers because the Pieces have been damaged.  According to the Keeper of the Gemstone, you must return to the Demons&amp;rsquo; lair, locate the Healing Tools and heal each part.  Only then can you fuse the Pieces into a complete, working Gemstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exercise the greatest of caution in performing this delicate task, because one wrong move in healing the Gemstone can have catastrophic consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, you must prepare to face the nightmare that is the Netherworld.  Mankind still has need of your skills and courage, good warrior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
