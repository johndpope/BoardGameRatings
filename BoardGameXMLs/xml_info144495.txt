							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">5150: Fighter Command</name>
									
			<description>In 5150 - Fighter Command you can command a flight of combat spacecraft fighters. You're the eyes and ears of the fleet and lives depend on you doing your job. Your job is simple: sweep the stars of the enemy. For you it's not who the enemies are but where they are. Your missions will range from patrolling in front of the fleet, to attacking the enemy when you find them, to defending the fleet. You'll be fighting a variety of Races and Factions who want nothing more than to take you out. In 5150 - Fighter Command you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for squadron level fighter and spaceship combat. Dynamic mission, combat and dogfighting rules let you play head-to-head, co-op and solo. Take the helm as any of the primary Factions and Races in the 5150 Universe. Pre-generated scenarios and missions for quick-start battles. Complete campaign rules let you run your Fighter pilot or Ship's captain through an entire story line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5150 - Fighter Command can be played solo, same side with everyone against the game, and of course head-to-head against your friends. Playable with any ship models, in any scale, this easy to learn yet tough to master game is perfect for the casual or battle hardened space gamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
