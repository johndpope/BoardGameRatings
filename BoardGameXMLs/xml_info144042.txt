			<description>&amp;quot;This is the sequel to 'Picross e' with a navigation feature to make gameplay even smoother. Like the previous game, this game has 150 new puzzles, plus an all new gameplay element known as 'Micross.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Picross' is a 'Picture Crossword Puzzle Game' in which you use numbers as hints to complete illustrations. The rules are simple and easy to understand. Anyone can do it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Navigation feature is a new feature that was first used in Picross e. It's a useful feature that uses blue numbers to show you the next square to color and columns with squares to mark with an x. By narrowing the field down to the columns you need to pay attention to, you can now solve puzzles at a much smoother pace. There are 150 puzzles that can be enjoyed by novices and experts alike. There is even a completely new &amp;quot;Micross&amp;quot; mode for hours and hours of puzzling fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micross puzzles are made up of 1 overall puzzle (8x8) and several detail puzzles (10x10). Once you have completed the overall puzzle (8x8), you will be able to enter the colored squares to solve the detail puzzles (10x10) inside, in order to create a more detailed picture. Once you've solved all the colored squares, you will have a large illustration of 80x80.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The micross puzzles in this game are themed after world-famous paintings. We carefully selected 5 famous works by Da Vinci, Van Gogh, Millet, Rembrandt and Velazquez. Enjoy the world of art, Picross-style!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
