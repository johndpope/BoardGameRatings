			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do You Believe in Magic?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Arcana series has quickly developed a reputation for excellence, not just because the individual spells contained within these books are of the highest caliber, but because each book explores a theme, pushing the boundaries of what spells are capable of doing in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game with innovative and groundbreaking new mechanics. This tradition is nowhere more evident than in this volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are just a few of the things you can expect to find in this tome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 100 new spells, with support for characters of all classes!&lt;br/&gt;     Powerful and versatile ascension spells, which have great effects when cast at higher spell levels, and are like several spells in one!&lt;br/&gt;     Handy arcane well spells, which allow limitless access to a lesser spell-like ability&amp;hellip;until you actually cast the spell, that is!&lt;br/&gt;     Several metamagic spells, which enhance other spells you cast, allowing you to create incredible effects on the fly!&lt;br/&gt;     A variety of opportune spells, which can be cast as a swift or even immediate action if the right circumstances arise, allowing you to make the most of clever planning!&lt;br/&gt;     Fifteen alternate potions, wands, and scrolls, which allow these purely utilitarian magic items to be exciting again!&lt;br/&gt;     Five new sorcerer bloodlines that not only come with new sets of powers, but also have information on an actual family bloodline, giving them more depth and roleplaying opportunities than &amp;ldquo;draconic&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;abyssal&amp;rdquo; ever could!&lt;br/&gt;     Five very special witch patrons, which re-imagine the class feature as a whole lot more than a simple list of spells!&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed background information and stat-blocks for over half a dozen influential spellcasters ready for use in your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what are you waiting for? You won&amp;rsquo;t find another book as action-packed with magical might as this&amp;hellip;at least, not until the next Advanced Arcana. Knowledge is power. Why not get some?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
