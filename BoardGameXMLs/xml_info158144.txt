			<description>subtitle&lt;br/&gt;A Dark Urban Campaign Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;fromInspiration for this Campaign Setting:&lt;br/&gt;The Neverwhere campaign setting is inspired in its entirety by the novel Neverwhere. The novel, in turn, was written as a follow-up to the amazing though horribly filmed BBC series of the same name. Both the novel and the BBC series are the brainchildren of acclaimed English author Neil Gaiman. Reading the novel and/or watching the series is not necessary for Neverwhere players, as this campaign setting supplement includes all the information gleaned from those sources. However, to internalize and understand the atmosphere that this campaign setting strives for, familiarizing oneself with the source material can be most helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who are already well-versed in the novel or series will recognize a great deal of information herein. The discerning reader will also note that much of the information within this supplement is either extrapolated from the source material or it is entirely original. Neil Gaiman hinted at a world of rich mythos in creating Neverwhere, and it would be a shame not to expand upon his initial framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
