			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UFOs have started appearing with disturbing regularity in the night skies. Reports of violent human abductions and horrific experimentation struck terror into the hearts of millions. The mass public hysteria has only served to expose Earth&amp;rsquo;s impotence against a vastly superior technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representatives from the worlds most economically powerful countries gathered secretly in Geneva. After much debate, the decision was made to establish a covert independent body to combat, investigate and defeat the alien threat. This organization would be equipped with the world&amp;rsquo;s finest pilots, soldiers, scientists and engineers, working together as one multi-national force. This organization was named the Extraterrestrial Combat Unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
