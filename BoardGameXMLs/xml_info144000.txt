							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oriental Elemental Foci</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drunk one night in his study, master wizard Archibald, much like Cher in the way he has only one name thanks to his notoriety, mused about his compatriots, those who utilize elemental magic, burning and freezing creatures when simply controlling the battlefield is more the way of a true master wizard. The next morning, he woke up with a terrible hangover, Constitution having never been a strong point. To his surprise, his body was covered in sheaves of paper musing about he could make these lesser magical allies more effective through the creation of elemental foci. In typical Archibald form, his musings were backed up by highly technical documents detailing exactly how to make those musings a reality. With a shrug, Archibald collected his drunken ravings. This bears some investigation, he thought, right after I prepare and cast that hangover spell...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because martial classes suddenly hit harder in the Pathfinder RPG, there is a little something called hit point bloat. As such, compared to 3.5, trying to actually deal spell damage to win a fight is something that is typically frowned upon by the powergamers out there. That being said, fireballs are fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the more interesting notions brought about by Ultimate Magic was the advent of elemental descriptors for those with more an eastern persuasion. These are metal, wood, and void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains 15 magic items that trigger whenever a spell of the proper oriental elemental descriptor is cast. Most effects persist for a single round, slowly build up charges, or have one use that is held for up to 1 minute. Also featured in this supplement are a small subset of items that act like metamagic, allowing the wearer to up the spell level of a spell with the proper descriptor in order to get some additional effects in a single action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
