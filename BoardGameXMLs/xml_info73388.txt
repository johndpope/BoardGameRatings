			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jagged Alliance 2 is a mix of strategy game (with a world map to move armies around), turn-based tactical game (individual soldiers fighting on a battle map) and RPG (each NPC has attributes that can be improved and a distinctive personality).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the struggle of a mercenary (the player), hired by the exiled leader of Arulco, a small south-american country to overthrow the dictatorial regime of Queen Deidranna. To succeed, the player must hire and manage a team of mercenaries, recapture strategic locations (towns, mines, SAM sites...) to earn money and weaken the opposition, train militia to defend the liberated areas, and right a few wrongs along the way in optional sub quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategic view, with a map of Arulco showing objectives, militia training levels, income sources and equipment allows the players to manage their campaign. Mercenaries on the map can be ordered to train, build or repair equipment, train other mercenaries or militia, heal their wounds or move to an objective. Players can use a laptop to surf mercenary website to hire or dismiss personnel, order weapons and gear and read their mail and intelligence reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a team of mercenaries enters an enemy-occupied zone, the game switch to an isometric view of the battlefield. Battles are turn-based and take into account a lot of parameters (weather conditions, character status, vegetation, equipment...). Once the enemy has been eliminated, players can explore the area and encounter its inhabitants (a good source of intel and optional quests).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends with the conquest of the capital of Arulco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
