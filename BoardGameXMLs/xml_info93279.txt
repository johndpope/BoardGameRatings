			<description>Tru$t, an exciting new board game for two to six players.  Buy an entire island!  Invest your way to billions!  Gain controlling interest in your corporation!  Force your partner to sell you out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tru$t is a game based on the ownership of corporations.  There are 11 corporations in the game, each of which is made up of two to five divisions.  A player may own part of all of a corporation.  Ownership of all the divisions in a corporation is known as a &amp;quot;trust.&amp;quot;  In Tru$t, ownership of a corporation is shared when two or more players own division of the same corporation.  The owners of such corporations are at the same time both partners and opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tru$t is played by moving your token around the board from island to island, buying and developing divisions of the corporations, collecting payments and dividends, and paying debts.  The game ends when only one player remains who had ownership in any corporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
