							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pompeii XV</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of a circular board with the numbers 1 to 12 in compartments and 15 numbered disks.  The disks are tossed into he middle of the board and those that land face up can be placed in the numbered compartments as long as some simply rules are followed.  Points are scored for every disk used and deducted for those face up disks that couldn't be used.  The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on components excavated at Pompeii, although I doubt that a copy of the original rules survived the hot lava death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
