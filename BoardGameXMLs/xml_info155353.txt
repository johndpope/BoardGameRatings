			<description>AstroSmashers: A lite-medium competitive 2+ player game that combines elements of a space 4X with token flicking and the classic Atari &amp;quot;Asteroids&amp;quot; video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah... Asteroids! The bounty of the solar system. Centuries after Google, SpaceX, and other bored billionaire geeks established a virtual cosmic goldrush, unionized labor continues to break apart these potatohead gems for ore and valuable minerals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command a crack team of mining professionals as you navigate the spoils of ore, searching for the newest and greatest claims. Break apart old hulks and upgrade your own spacewreck with the finest components salvage can offer. Deep-mine the biggest and best rocks to build better space stations for your faction, and continue the lucrative payout round after round after round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out - those asteroids are dangerous business, what with all the smashing and bashing. And with all players controlling the chaos of the asteroid field, that union medical plan is looking all the shinier...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete against your opponents to mine a constantly moving asteroid field for resources and ship salvage. The winner is determined as the player with the most credits in hand when the last resource has been exploited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is composed of alternating turns of &amp;quot;Ship&amp;quot; actions and &amp;quot;Drift&amp;quot; actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ship&amp;quot; actions - Explore the asteroid field, mine/exchange resources, build bases, and upgrade/repair ships and bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Drift&amp;quot; actions - Flick asteroids or debris to confound other players, damage bases, and change the geography of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AstroSmashers is uniquely structured to support both a &amp;quot;dexterity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;strategic thinker&amp;quot; style of play under the same roof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
