							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aberrations</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: Aberrations brings you a dozen and one misshapen mutants, from old-school monsters like the hideous otyugh, the brilliant but brutal tentacular roper, the clever cloaker, and the treasure-trap mimic, to newer hunters like the swift and sneaky choker. You'll find adaptational evolutions like the veiled master and the vampiric mist alongside the fondly remembered relics of long-ago genre-straddling mash-ups like the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing or the fabulous froghemoth!  A few aberrations have folkloric roots like the deadly ettercap, while others are stitched together out of nightmarish pieces like the vemerak, or had their birth on a toy shore shelf like the legendary rust monster! To this august assemblage, of aberrations CR 3 to 17, we present a brand-new beast, the zyoselak, a floating multi-segmented swarm of gelatinous horror that is quite literally brain-meltingly deadly! As if this were not enough, we also bring you 9 mythic spells for making mythic mutants of your very own! &lt;br/&gt; On top of these extraterrestrial enemies, Mythic Monsters: Aberrations also brings you a set of magical mutations of mythic magnificence, as well as an ode to disturbia in the strangeling journal detailing the descent into madness of one left too long alone with an alien zyoselak. The 13 aberrant creatures contained herein, ranging in CR from 1 to 17, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one of these massive menaces has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic ettercap's razor web to the tentacle toss and sloshing gullet of a mythic froghemoth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
