			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victorian England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your party are hired by a young man looking for his missing finance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their investigation leads them to a bizarre traveling art gallery full of grotesque antique paintings of what seems like missing people being chased, captured, and killed by a variety of monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party find themselves plunged into a range of horrific situations as they have to fight their way free from a house besieged by zombies, escape from being sacrificed by an unholy death cult, and fight toe-to-toe with a demonic pig-ogre in its blackened forest lair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the party come face-to-face with the mastermind of the scheme that is creating these situations and must find a way to stop their vile plans from coming to fruition - otherwise a powerful, ancient evil will be unleashed upon the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Savage Worlds adventure for 3-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
