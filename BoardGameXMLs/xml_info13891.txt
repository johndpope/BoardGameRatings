							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Domino Derby</name>
									
			<description>This game uses an existing set of dominoes, where players race around a track, attempting to be the first across the finish line, while trying to prevent others from being the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the web site:&lt;br/&gt;A  quirky little racing game similar to games like &amp;quot;Sorry&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Pachisi&amp;quot;. The use of a standard set of Dominoes for movement lends to some interesting and &amp;quot;nasty&amp;quot; variations.  Players try to be the first to move their pieces around the board, all the while trying to keep their opponents from doing the same! Game includes a board and all the rules you need to get started!  It's a lot of fun ... just don't play it with my mom (she's really mean when she wants to be!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the game at: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
