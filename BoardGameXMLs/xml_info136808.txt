			<description>Come discover Kotanook forest during deer migration, when predators and prey take on a gruesome battle to survive. One by one, become each of the wild's most legendary animals, such as a grizzly bear, a wolf or a cougar. The &amp;quot;Kotanook&amp;quot; board game is a unique reproduction of a wild environment, where  two opponents take turns combining attacks and evasions. Each player leads a small group of animals, each of them with its own specific qualities (speed, strength and dexterity) in order to collect the highest number of points and become master of their territory. A stimulating board game where chance and strategy meet the instincts of the most ferocious beasts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
