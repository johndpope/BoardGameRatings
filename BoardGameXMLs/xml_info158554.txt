			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this game is a side-scrolling platformer, its wild visuals of hand-drawn ink set it apart from other games, winning visuality awards and helping the developer to win indie awards.  Think of an ink based Yellow Submarine or a doodly Phantom Tollbooth or maybe even an acidlike take on Tenniel's Alice in Wonderland.   Looking at screenshots below will explain better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This art style permeates the gameplay as ink is used to fund your ship and also as 'points' through the game.  The characters speak with emotional mood swings or absurdist military phrasing as you travel down one bridge or another to another realm or go off in a space 'ink' ship mini-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
