							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">McDonaldland Match-Up Game</name>
									
			<description>This game, based on McDonalds restaurant characters, is actually 3 games-in-one. In the first game, 5 cards depicting shadows of the characters are placed in the center of the table. The regular cards are then dealt out evenly among the players. On your turn, you turn over your top card so that all players may see it. The first player to slap the matching shadow card wins the character card. The winner is the first player to collect one each of all 5 McDonaldland characters. In the second game, players try to match cards in their hands to the top card on the center stack by using colors or numbers (shadow cards are wild). The third game is played solitaire. You draw a card and try to match it to the face up card on the table. If you can, you play it on top; if you can't, you start a new pile. If the top card of a pile matches another pile card, the 2 piles may be merged. You win if you have 2 piles or less after you've gone through the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
