							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sorry!  Card Game</name>
									
			<description>In this adaptation of the children's board game, players begin with two to four START cards (depending on the number of players), and they play cards from their hands in an attempt to flip all of their START cards over to the HOME side.  They do this by laying down playing cards in rows in front of the START cards and when the values total exactly 15, they reach HOME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also play many cards that allow them to affect the cards played by other players in order to keep them from reaching home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
