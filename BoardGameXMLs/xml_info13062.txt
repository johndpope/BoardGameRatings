			<description>This game is similar to the kids game Jumbolino. Players roll a die and add pieces to their plastic scarecrows based on the number rolled. The first player to assemble a complete scarecrow wins. Game comes with 4 plastic Scarecrows and 1 die. This is a very simple game. On your turn you roll the die. If you roll a 1 you put a head on the scarecrow. Then if you roll a 2 you put the body, 3 the right arm, 4 the left arm, 5 the right leg and 6 the left leg. These pieces must be put on in exact order so if you are up to needing a 4 and you don't roll it your opponent gets a turn. etc. until someone puts the scarecrow together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar to Dunce, except that in that game players lose when they finish their figure.  That game also features a teetotum instead of a die, and one of the faces allows a player to skip a turn while compelling other players to add a part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
