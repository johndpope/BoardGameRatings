			<description>Ashes of Empire was a 1992 strategy video game released for the Amiga and MS-DOS systems. It was a follow-on, although not a sequel, to the earlier games Midwinter and Flames of Freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay involved working as a member of a fictional UN/NATO-type organization to recruit followers across various CIS-inspired republics being threatened by a powerful neighbor. The mechanics of the game were very similar to the earlier Midwinter game, although the player was now able to use a selection of land and air vehicles to travel around. Combat was handled in real-time, with the player maneuvering to engage enemy vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was reasonably well-received but not commercially successful, mainly due to the dry nature of the subject matter and the level of detail included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ashes of Empire&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a modern world, what happens when empires fall... Inspired by the tumultuous events in Eastern Europe, Mike Singleton and his team have created Ashes Of Empire, their biggest game to date. Ashes is a complex fusion of adventure and strategy which places demands on all your powers of diplomacy and intelligence. As you enter the heartland of your one-time great adversary, you must select a tactic to bring order to chaos, while at the same time avoiding the initiation of a nuclear conflict with an embittered and desperate people, mistrustful of your intentions in this New World Order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Free instructional videotape&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Reference card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 6,000 unique characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Full free movement in a 3-D environment of 2.8 million sq. miles and 9,000 locations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
