							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit</name>
									
			<description>Hell Yeah! is a crazy action-adventure platformer. In Hell. You are Ash, a devil rabbit and the prince of Hell. When some jerk finds it funny to post your secret intimate photos all over the Hell-ternet, you get VERY angry. Time to seek him out and destroy him once and for all. While you&amp;rsquo;re at it, why not use this incredible journey to kill everybody else? It&amp;rsquo;s you against all Hell. It&amp;rsquo;s Hell Yeah!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kick-ass features this game definitely has:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Tension-relieving faux-gore action &amp;ndash; Hell Yeah! helps you clear your mind after a bad/frustrating/boring day at work. Achieve this by exploring the four corners of Hell and exterminating monsters in a cheerful yet challenging atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Drill to kill &amp;ndash; shooting is fun but shooting from a super sawing jetpack that can drill through walls and squash monsters into chunks is better. Hell Yeah! gives you full frontal violence in your face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; This game is too BIG for you &amp;ndash; 10 huge game worlds with secret areas and side quests, hundreds of objects, weapons and monsters to collect. If you&amp;rsquo;re a completionist, you&amp;rsquo;re screwed man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Help us make Hell a cleaner place &amp;ndash; there are 100 unique monsters to exterminate in Hell Yeah! Some are rude, others are really ugly but they all equally deserve to DIE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;ldquo;Finish him&amp;rdquo; moves that will make your mama cry &amp;ndash; inflict ultimate humiliation on the monsters of Hell using over 25 deadly &amp;ldquo;Finish him!&amp;rdquo; mini-games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Pimp my drill &amp;ndash; collect loot and spend your cash in big shops where you can buy bigger guns and awesome upgrades for your ride. The donut driller skin and the &amp;lsquo;Sploding Carrot Missile Launcher make a lovely combo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
