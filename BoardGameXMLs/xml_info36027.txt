			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game for 2 players. WWI Aerial Dogfight Simulation. One player is the Germans, the other is the Allies. Victory: The first player to shoot down 4 enemy machines wins the battle. Use coins to keep track of &amp;lsquo;Kills.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom card deck comprised of six suits made up of twelve cards numbered 1 to 12. These suits are Pilots, Allied Planes, German Planes, Tactics, Shooting, and Flying. All of the cards are usable by either player except for the Plane Cards - Allied Planes may only be used by the Allied player and German Planes may only be used by the German player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the players are dealt hands of five cards. They may discard and redraw up to three cards. Each player then plays an Attack which must include a Pilot card and a Plane card. An attack may also include one card from each of the other three suits (Shooting, Tactics, and Flying.) A kill is scored when the total value of the cards played in an Attack is equal to or greater than the Attack played by the opposing player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
