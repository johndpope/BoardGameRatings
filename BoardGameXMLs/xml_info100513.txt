			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The included software is for the Apple II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planet is Mertactor/District 268 of the Spinward Marches, located at the fringe of the Imperium. The assignment is simple and profitable - recover a flashy artifact recently taken from a representative of DerBonne Merchants, L.I.C., and return it to Baron Edkos Volentine, a corporate director. You've got two days before your passage home, the Far Trader &amp;quot;Arax House&amp;quot;, is loaded with cargo and ready to leave. There's not really enough time, but it couldn't hurt to look around - the Mertactor outback is supposed to be fairly scenic, and you might get lucky. Baron Volentine could be a useful man to make happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Gambit&amp;quot; is a term from chess, an ancient Solomani pastime, describing the early sacrifice of a pawn in exchange for a long-term positional advantage. Baron Edkos Volentine had many pawns on Mertactor to choose from, but guess who got the job?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Mertactor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StarCrystal is a solitaire text adventure series based on the Traveller science fiction role-playing game system.
