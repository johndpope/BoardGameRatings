							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Events: Screeside â€“ The Gloaming</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shudders wrack the mountainous shore of dead, dread Screeside. Ashes rise over shimmering peaks, the evergreen slopes slipping in slides of mud. Dusk falls in day. The rains begin...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events: Screeside - The Gloaming is a tool designed to support the development of narratives set in Screeside - a weird, ostensibly fantasy shore alongside a sea or great lake - as well as similar locations in other worlds. On just one page it provides 66 seed sentences, lined up with a simple map of the shore, and a table for finding the next seed sentence in a sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is compatible with various genres and systems and suitable for use in roleplaying and beyond. It can be used as a source of events and rumours for the location, as well as to inspire encounters and scenarios, even at the table in the course of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two pages are arranged for ease of use on screen or printed, the key features occupying a single page. The tool includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     66 seed sentences arranged in six columns of 11, all on one page&lt;br/&gt;     a simple map with six numbered stretches and 12 marked regions&lt;br/&gt;     a table for finding the next seed sentence in a sequence randomly&lt;br/&gt;     a compact diceless number generator for the two ranges used&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tool can be used with Narrative: Abandoned Space, which uses Screeside as a setting for one of the example narratives, as well as with Landscape: The Manse, the map elements of which may be suitable for the manses mentioned in one of the sentences, and Elaboration: Structure &amp; Surface, which provides 540 descriptive terms for adding detail to locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
