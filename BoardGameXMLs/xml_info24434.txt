			<description>&amp;quot;the every which way word game&amp;quot; (tm)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to score the most points by forming interlocking words in all directions, using square letter tiles, most of which can be used in more than one direction or as more than one letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIM consists of 96 letter tiles, tile racks, and a letter bag. There is no board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 19 distinct tiles which make the 26 letters plus the blank tile. Eight of the tiles are ambiguous and can be read as two different letters, depending on orientation. For example, an upside-down A is a V, and a sideways N is a Z. Three of the tiles may be used as the same letter in more than one orientation (O, S, and X). A tile may be used as different letters in different words at the same time, even in the same play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each letter has a different value and scores are calculated according to the letter played. Players receive bonuses for using a previously-played tile as a letter it wasn't used as previously, for changing the orientation of a word, or for using all seven tiles on their rack in a single play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.puzzazz.com/wim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.puzzazz.com/wim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
