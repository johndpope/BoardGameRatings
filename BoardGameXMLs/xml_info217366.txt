			<description>Flip over your first card to show what dice combination you are trying to match. Each card has two identical dice combinations, one for burgundy dice and one for ivory dice. Roll your set of dice, then set aside those that match the card and continue rolling the rest. But if none of them match what is needed, you &amp;quot;Farkle&amp;quot; and play passes to the next player. When someone matches the card, they earn the points on the card. The game continues with new cards until someone reaches 10,000 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
