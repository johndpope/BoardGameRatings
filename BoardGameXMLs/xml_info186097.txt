			<description>Squish is a fun, family friendly, dexterity game for 1 to 6 players in which you drop player order cards (also referred to as boot cards) in an attempt to squish bug cards that are on the ground. You try to be the player with 10+ points at the end of a round. The bug cards are thrown into the air at the beginning of the game and fall where they may. After, you are ready to get Squishing!  You go in number order according to your player order cards. You drop your player order cards from shoulder height, number side up, in an attempt to completely cover a bug. Bugs range in size and value. The bigger the bug, the more points it is worth. Beware though, because if your player order card lands boot side up someone can cover your number and take one of your squished bugs from you. You squish the bug and your friend steps on your toes and takes it from you. This could turn a win into a loss or a loss into a win.  Getting 10 points is easy, keeping them is tough.  Some dropping techniques can make it so that your card is boot side down and keeps you safe from anyone's nefarious plans of stepping on your toes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variant for younger crowds makes the game a bit easier by the requirement to cover a bug goes from, covering the entire bug, to covering just the head or body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squish: The Dexterity Card Game of Bug Squishery is a fun and easy game for kids of all ages and plays in only 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
