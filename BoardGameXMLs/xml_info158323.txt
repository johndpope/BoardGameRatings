							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SciFi Weapons Volume 1: SciFi Weapon Cards</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;49 new SciFi Weapons for your Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Surviving combat is half keeping to cover and keeping your head down and half having better equipment than the guy trying to kill you. Weapons that either blow him up or knock him out faster than he can do the same to you, equipment that interferes with his ability to sense you whether biological or mechanical so that he cannot target you to kill you, or the best communication equipment you can afford to coordinate tactics with your squad by receiving and relaying orders from your CO or to call in air support. Its top of the line or six feet under, your choice. So what are you buying today?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Worlds Equipment Cards were created for use in near and far future science fiction Savage Worlds settings. The front of each card has the equipment&amp;rsquo;s image and Savage Worlds basic weapon statistics in order of range, cost, damage, weight, rate of fire, and clip size if applicable to the equipment. The back of each card has the equipment&amp;rsquo;s notes and allowed weapon options on the guns. The equipment varies with melee weapons from chainsaw gauntlets to beam glaives, ranged weapons from rocket pistols to particle rifles, special weapons like grenades, optional weapon add ons, communication equipment, a powered rig, and a stationary battle platform. The cards are available in PDF and on print on demand through DriveThruCards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards can be used in several ways. The basic way to use them is for a visual reference for equipment for both Game Masters and Player Characters in front of them. The cards can be used as an equipment treasure deck. When the Player Characters loot an area, they find the listed weapon on the card. The Game Master could also use the deck as a way to randomize the equipment of extras or wild cards giving them the equipment drawn and the player characters can pick up any of equipment that survives the combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
