			<description>Science Horizons Survival is an educational game in which the player takes on the role of one of a series of animals, and had to find food to survive while avoiding predators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survival was developed as part of a series of educational software aimed at children aged between 5 and 12. This &amp;quot;Science Horizons&amp;quot; series was instigated by Sir Clive Sinclair and ex-prime minister Harold Macmillan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim was to teach users about food chains; as an insect life is short, with the constant danger of being eaten by a bird - but as an eagle the player is at the top of the food chain with mankind or starvation as the only dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation allows the player to be one of six animals: a hawk, a robin , a lion, a mouse, a fly or a butterfly. The world appears in scrolling grid form, with ice caps to the north and south. The player moves one square at a time, with visibility depending on the chosen animal, avoiding predators and find food and water. The game ends when the animal dies, either through starvation, dehydration, being killed by a predator, or old age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Science Horizons Survival&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
