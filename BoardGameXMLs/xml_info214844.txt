			<description>This 1930s Canadian baseball game may be the only existing baseball title that actually features a Canadian maple leaf on the chest of a player on the box top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While undated, it was probably issued around 1936-7, when a foundering Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team was rescued from a buyout and transfer to Albany, NY, by a group of local investors headed by former Ontario Lieutenant-Governor William Donald Ross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is rather basic. It has a folding thin cardboard field and 18 small wooden player disks (9 blue, 9 red). While there are circles on the field and bench for these pieces, their only real function is to mark baserunners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To bat, players simply roll 2D6, and read the resulting play off a 2-12 table in the rules. The odds are not realistic: the most likely result (7) produces a double, and a batter will get on base almost half the time (17/36). Normal baseball rules apply, with the player scoring the most runs after nine innings winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
