			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Fantasy Legend II, originally released in Japan as Sa・Ga2: Hihō Densetsu​ (Sa・Ga2: 秘宝伝説 Sa・Ga2 ~ The Treasure Legend), is a role-playing video game developed by Square Co. for the Game Boy handheld console as the second game of their SaGa series. Initially released in December 1990 for Japanese audiences, the game was translated and released in North America in November 1991 by Square America Co, and again in 1998 by Sunsoft. Like its predecessor, the English version was re-branded as a Final Fantasy title due to the series' popularity in the Western world. The game's development was headed by lead designer Akitoshi Kawazu, who had worked on the previous title, with a music staff consisting of Kenji Ito and Nobuo Uematsu. In 2009, an enhanced remake of the game was announced for the Nintendo DS titled SaGa 2: Hihō Densetsu Goddess of Destiny, featuring three-dimensional graphics, new story elements, and an arranged soundtrack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a fantasy world where the player assumes the role of one of eight different characters of varying race and gender who leaves on a journey to find their lost father and discover the secret of &amp;quot;Magi&amp;quot;, a substance created by the gods that holds powerful magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Final Fantasy Legend II, the player navigates a character throughout the game world with a party of up to four characters, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of the game occurs in towns, castles, caves, and similar areas. To aid exploration on the field screen, Final Fantasy Legend II makes use of various signs within towns. Initially, the player is limited to the First World to explore, and given access to later worlds as they progress through the game. Players can save their game anytime and anywhere when not in combat to the selected save slot for later playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can journey between field screen locations via the world map, a downsized representation of Final Fantasy Legend II's various worlds. Players can freely navigate around the world map screen unless restricted by terrain, such as water or mountains. The goal in each world is to obtain enough &amp;quot;MAGI&amp;quot; to progress to the next world. Like other Final Fantasy related games, travel across the world map screen and hostile areas is occasionally interrupted by random enemy encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
