			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Stories System is a very rules-lite set of guidelines for  playing story-based role-playing games. It is intended to  be fast-paced and unobtrusive, while still providing an  exciting level of uncertainty and simulation. It is intended  for games in which the exact nature of the rules is really  secondary to telling a good story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the open nature of Stories System was  specifically designed to accommodate rules and  characters taken directly from other (less cool) role- playing games, using the other games' stats exactly as  written or even using no specific stats at all. That way,  a character pulled from, say, a numbers oriented, rules- heavy fantasy game system could stand side by side with  characters from esoteric science fiction settings or story- oriented gothic horror games, and all of these disparate  characters would be able to interact seamlessly within the  Stories System framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stories System is also intended to be flexible and  customizable, allowing it to be adapted for use with a  variety of games and styles. Specific rules and stats can  be added and modified as needed to match Stories System  to any tone and genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
