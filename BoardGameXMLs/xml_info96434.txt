			<description>Making city committee meetings fun&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt; Public Transit is a light strategy game for 3-6 players, ages 12 and up. Each player is a member of the city committee responsible for planning new routes for the public transporation system. Of course, you have different priorities than the other members of the committee &amp;mdash; wanting to make sure the route goes to certain destinations while avoiding the other member&amp;rsquo;s pet projects. You&amp;rsquo;ll lay new route markers or adjust the route on your turn, all trying to make sure each color route goes to the destinations in your hand. You might even run two routes together, to make a junction and score extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
