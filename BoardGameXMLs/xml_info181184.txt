			<description>In Nusantara, players try to build the largest archipelago. On each turn matching tiles are placed to build up their island chains to get the most poin (points) and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of possibly placing a tile and moving their kano (canoe). Tiles can only be placed on areas where an island has been started or where a players kano is currently exploring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poin are tallied by completing islands. The Larger the island the more points its worth. After all tiles are laid, poin are added up and the player with the most poin becomes the Batara and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
