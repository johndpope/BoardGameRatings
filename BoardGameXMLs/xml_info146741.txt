			<description>&amp;quot;Korsun 1944&amp;quot; is another game of &amp;quot;Great Battles&amp;quot; system (WB-95). It is operation-level game presenting clash of arms that started just after new 1944 year came. Game scenario allows 2-5 Players to play all battle or its variants with 5 available scenarios. Battle involved all German mobile reserves on Eastern front which was exhausted and the losses were hardly recovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle started on January 24th. Red Army&amp;rsquo;s target was very simple: surround and destroy as many as possible German units in Korsuń pocket. 2 Fronts were to assault concurrently in order to definitely cut off the pocket. It was done after 4 days but it didn&amp;rsquo;t mean the end of the operation.&lt;br/&gt;On January 28th German forces begin to counterattack which grew in strength every day. Battle of Korsuń pocket was very dynamic, neither side managed to entrench therefore almost every position was advanced and attacked immediately. Every German attack was answered with Soviet counter.&lt;br/&gt;Hitler&amp;rsquo;s orders denied retreat and shortening the front line so Germans attack constantly, supported by forces in the pocket vitally interested in the success of relief offensive. Russians who had all the aces at the beginning run out of all the reserves and had to switch into defensive positions. Only when reinforcements of 2nd Armored Army arrived the offensive was resumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
