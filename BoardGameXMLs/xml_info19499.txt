							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ice Market</name>
									
			<description>A real-time trading game for three or more players and an Icehouse set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Deep under the frigid crust of the ice-moon Europa, a new fad has emerged. All of the truly fashionable Jovain dolphins are wearing exotic crystals from the underside of the frozen crust of the outer oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Equipped with the latest tips and rumors about what's cool and what's not, you've brought your refrigerated collection of ice crystals to the EIEIO (Eurpoa Ice Exchange Independent Organization). You've managed to finagle your way into a five-minute trade session with a few other hobbyist traders. Competition is fierce, and there's a lot about the market that you're not sure of, but with your bartering skills and Luck willing, you hope to come out on top.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To end the game with the most valuable collection of ice crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A poker deck&lt;br/&gt;    * An Icehouse set&lt;br/&gt;    * Paper and pencil for each player, or an Ice Market trader's tally sheet&lt;br/&gt;    * A 5-minute timer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in Ice Market do not take turns. Once the 5-minute timer starts, swap and trade for all you're worth until the timer stops. You may swap anything that you possess: cards, pieces, information, etc. Your goal is to end the game with the pieces worth the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie for points, the player with the most pieces wins. Further ties are shared victories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the rules here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/95/ice-market&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/95/ice-market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
