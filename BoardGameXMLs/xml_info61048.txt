							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manitou</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manitou is an Algonquin word referring to the &amp;quot;Great Spirit&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Great Spirit&amp;quot; rewards those with real, dedicated passion. The Manitou is a spiritual warrior. Much like the fantasy paladin, and fights for an ideal. Unlike the paladin, this ideal isn't always good, nor is it inherently evil. What fuels the Manitou is passion. That passion is rewarded by the spirit that grants them their power. This new ten-level Advanced Class for the D20 Modern game details almost twenty spirit-forms that embody the dedication of each animal or elemental spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal Spirit-Forms to choose from include the Bear, Cheetah, Hawk, Hyena and Wolf. Dragon Spirit-Forms include the Chromatic (Black, Blue, Green, Red and White) as well as the Metallic (Brass, Bronze,Copper, Gold and Silver). Also included are the four Elemental Spirit-Forms of Air, Earth, Fire and Water. Each of these Spirit-Forms has unique abilites derrived from the essence of the base animal or element. With so many Spirit-Forms to choose from, your character can weild the power of his passion and dedication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
