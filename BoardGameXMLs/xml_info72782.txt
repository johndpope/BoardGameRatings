			<description>[User Summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silver Surfer is a horizontal schmup featuring the eponymous Marvel Comics superhero. It is infamous for its extreme difficulty, and is regarded by some as an extremely low quality game. The main sources of its difficulty are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Silver Surfer can only take one hit before dying&lt;br/&gt;-Touching any obstruction will kill Silver Surfer instantly&lt;br/&gt;-It is often very difficult to tell what is an obstruction and what isn't&lt;br/&gt;-The levels feature many narrow passages which are difficult to navigate without touching the floors or ceilings (which will result in death)&lt;br/&gt;-Silver Surfer only has one weapon, which is often inadequate&lt;br/&gt;-The enemies move in seemingly random patterns, attack in large numbers from both the back and front of the screen, and sometimes shoot projectiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
