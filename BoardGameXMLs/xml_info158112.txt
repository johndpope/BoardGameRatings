			<description>Mutology is a brand new strategy card game that transforms players into Mutologists, bioengineers obsessed with creating extraordinary creatures in their laboratories. Players will fire Radiation cards at their Specimens, and depending on what combinations of Radiation they're exposed to, Specimens will turn into one of two unique Mutants. Some Mutants are hyper aggressive, others have defense mechanisms, and some manipulate the way you or your opponent can play the game! You collect Research Points at the start of each turn for every Mutant you have in play, and the first player to 5 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players mutate their Specimens by firing one of three kinds of Radiation, (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Rays) at their Specimen cards. Each Specimen card comes with a unique ingredient list called &amp;quot;mutation requirements.&amp;quot; Alone, Radiation cards give perks to the Specimen such as boosting their Power or Stability. Whenever a Specimen has met one of its mutation requirements, they would mutate into the corresponding Mutant card, which would wait outside of play until this moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from Specimens and Mutants, player can build Devices like the Electric Coil and the Transmogrifier, or use Procedures like Brainstorm and Devolution. Lab Assistants like the Medic, Technician, and Researcher can lend their talents to you throughout the game as well. There are two zones of play in which cards can be placed: the Field Zone and the Lab Zone. These cards behave differently in each zone, so Mutology games always have a bit of tactical placement strategy involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
