			<description>Juke Joint is a turn-based scramble whose objective is for players to pay off their &amp;quot;bar tab&amp;quot; first.  Players accomplish this by accumulating money by performing success rolls in eight different areas of the board (the Pool Room, Stage, Horsehose Pit, Jukebox, BBQ Pit, Store Room and the Crossroads) which pay money, then transporting that money back to the Bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw &amp;quot;Club&amp;quot; cards each turn which may result in immediate actions, people encounters, or items that players can accumulate and use to increase their chances of succeeding at gigs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may choose to play as one of five different classes of characters: Musician, Hustler, Driver, Drifter or Cook.  Each class has its share of natural and item-related benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way other non-player characters may appear - &amp;quot;Legends&amp;quot; - which, should players encounter them, affect play.  Legends come into play when the board's &amp;quot;Hot Action&amp;quot; counter is raised by various activities.  Legends include Howlin' Wolf and Ol' Scratch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is in reprints from an initial independent run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
