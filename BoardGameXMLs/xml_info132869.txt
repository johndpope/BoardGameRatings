							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hope Prep #0: Orientation (ICONS)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As new students to Hope Preparatory School, your characters get to tour the facility, meet your classmates, and save the planet. All that before class even starts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orientation is the first scenario in the Freshman Year story arc. It may be played as a standalone, or it may be used to introduce players and their starting characters to the Hope Preparatory School setting. Maps of the school, player handouts, and a range of NPCs provide everything a gamemaster needs to run the scenario and learn more about the school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario also provides background and game information on the dreaded Alchemical Cabal. This organization is dedicated to transdimensional domination. Their boundless amoral actions have depopulated countless worlds and devastated others so that they might further their own schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The [Hope Prep School Freshman Handbook] provides additional details about the HPS setting used in this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
