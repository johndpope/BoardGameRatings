			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire ProWrestling Iron Slam '96 was the first Fire Pro Wrestling game released for the PlayStation, and the first 3D Fire Pro Wrestling game released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike previous Fire Pro Wrestling games, Iron Slam '96 was a stripped down, arcade style wrestling game and contained no Edit mode. Additionally, the game only had a roster of 10 wrestlers to choose from (all Japanese), and a lot of the appearances were changed, so it is hard to tell who is who.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game retains the timing based grappling system, and contained two modes: Circuit Mode and Exhibition Mode. In Circuit Mode the player selects a character and fights the other 9 characters in the game, plus a boss character. Exhibition Mode is a 1-on-1 mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
