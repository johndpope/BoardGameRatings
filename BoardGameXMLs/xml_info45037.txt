			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ancient people living in the Dim Forest area told about the Demon&amp;rsquo;s Head. The Demon&amp;rsquo;s Head was a high rock jutting from the ground in the very center of a star-shaped crevice. The rock is said to contain a demon from hell. It is also said the demon was first dormant, at least until the Black Mage entered the Demon&amp;rsquo;s Head. An obscure pact was forged, and the Black Mage left the rock leaving a giant warding sigil engraved on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From that moment Evil forces gathered and six evil lords built a windowless fortress all around the Demon&amp;rsquo;s Head they called Hell Gate Keep. The six evil lords are a death knight, a lich, a fire giant, a half-orc, a vampire and a half-fiend. It is said the other evil lords recently murdered the half fiend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legions of orcs, goblins and bugbears live in the fortress and raid the countryside in the name of their evil lords, bringing thousands of slaves in the keep.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
