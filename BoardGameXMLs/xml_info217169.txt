			<description>A Two-Round Living Greyhawk Gran March Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cavalry,&amp;quot; Knight Colonel Jabbar began, &amp;quot;is a  force that can disrupt communication, supply and reinforcement should it be allowed to wander unscathed behind the lines  We won&amp;rsquo;t be unscathed for long, but disruption is the goal.  We will fill the GMS Lortenford with so many fighting men and woman that there will be barely room for a few rats and weasels. Then we will stealthily make our way near the first target.  Small teams will be unloaded along a fighting front.  The teams will make their way a shore and push past any resistance on the bank.  They will march to a logistics base where they will take their mounts and then the disruption and havoc can truly begin...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Gran March Interactive Missions adventure for APLs 2-8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive Missions events may be run as an Interactive, or by individual tables like a regular event.  In the non-interactive versions the table will stick to a particular APL and will not affect other tables at the same time.  How it is run is decided by the convention coordinator(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This adventure will be of particular interest to Gran March military and veteran characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that small characters may have difficulties in some portions of this event.  The Knight Colonel has made arrangements for all standard sizes of Centaurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game should be played before GRM7-IN6: Hammerfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
