							<name  sortindex="1">Flipsiders: Alien Assault</name>
									
			<description>One in a series of sixteen Flipsiders games designed to resemble pastel colored audio cassettes. The game contained a metal gameboard that would flip out with the snap of the wrist. A storage compartment at the top of the game would hold the magnetic pawns. A spring-loaded switch would spin the wheels of the cassette to generate random numbers and events during play. The game would hang from a blister pack on display at the store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must advance toward and defeat in battle the boss alien on three levels to win. Defeat means starting a level all over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
