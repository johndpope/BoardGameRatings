			<description>This game consists of 3 more or less localized sub games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The predominant game is economic. The player moves around the board and if possible tries to buy the companies landed on. If another player already owns it, an industrial spy fine must be payed instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game is a localized trivia game which kicks in at different events. Corrects answers give economic advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third there is a voting process about which player should be the next mayor. The mayor has some advantages and disadvantages in the economic game. Each owned company corresponds to a number of votes. The results of each voting are kept and the final winner is the player who reaches the target number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
