							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Side Quests Volume 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Side Quests are short side trek excursions for your PCs which can be played in a single sitting. There are four such adventures contained within this single volume, the first of many to come from AdventureAWeek.com / AAW Games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contagion A Pathfinder Side Quest by Will Myers for four PCs of levels 5-6&lt;br/&gt;Elves have appeared in Rybalka and are on the search for something ancient. Will the PCs uncover their plot, try to stop them, or join them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giant's Cavern A Pathfinder Side Quest by Stephen Yeardley for four to six PCs of levels 8-11.&lt;br/&gt;A distraught but angry and determined cleric is looking for a group to work with her to recover the bodies of her former allies and a specific weapon which was the cause of their deaths. However, she needs reassurances that she won't be cheated and demands a heavy deposit for her information, which will lead to greater rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serpens Sanguis A Pathfinder Side Quest by Jonathan G. Nelson for four PCs of levels 9-11.&lt;br/&gt;An ancient cult of maniacal dragon worshipers known as Serpens Sanguis once dwelled deep within a hidden sanctuary buried beneath a tall mountain peak but in recent years the cult has grown deathly silent, all that is left are rumors of powerful magicks and a great treasure hoard which awaits those brave enough to enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn again, Turn again A Pathfinder Side Quest by Stephen Yeardley for four to six PCs of levels 8-12.&lt;br/&gt;When the gods and demi-gods were young, fresh and inexperienced, they were often taken in by the duplicitous nature of some of their &amp;quot;worshipers&amp;quot;, falling for flattery and deception from those who were a little more &amp;quot;worldly-wise&amp;quot;. So some of the newer demi-gods devised a series of chests that responded to the actual nature of the person opening it, thus revealing their true selves. These chests were filled, placed in a hidden and challenging spot and watched by two of these deities - to ensure fair play - for when experienced followers, who a particular deity wanted to help develop further, came along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
