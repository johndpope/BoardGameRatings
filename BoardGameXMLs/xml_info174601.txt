			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So issue number 5 is finally online! This was a very cool month here in Brazil with a lot of different discussions. We had presidential elections and most people were really into discuss almost about anything! On top of that many talks about how our market is going. Our economy still favor the internal market what makes international shipping almost impossible for us, and that shouldn't change anytime soon since our last president got re-elected. So the best I can do for now is keep working on digital content!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Analog XP you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    GAMES AS ART? The old discussion about games as a new art form gains a new perspective through story games&lt;br/&gt;    STORY VS CHALLENGE Should this be something to discuss at all? &lt;br/&gt;    DESIGN MATTERS A look on how Brazilian games really care for their looks and how could that affect gameplay&lt;br/&gt;    Full Game: LOOKING FOR HOME A profound solo game focused at the search for things to really care for&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
