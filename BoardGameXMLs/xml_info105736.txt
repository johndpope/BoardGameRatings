			<description>Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure is a video game released in 1990 by Electro Brain for the NES. There was a Japan only prequel called Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Isshū 80 Nichi Dai Bōken (長靴をはいた猫 世界一周８０日大冒険). It was loosely based on Jules Verne's book, Around the World in Eighty Days. Pero's name is also &amp;quot;Perrault&amp;quot; in the Japanese game. The character Pero, who is Toei Animation's mascot, is based on the cat from the folktale entitled Puss in Boots, by Charles Perrault. The game's title comes from that story as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The objective of each stage is to simply reach the end and defeat the boss (where applicable). There are quite a few enemies along the way, but Pero has three weapons to choose from. A weapon may be selected by pausing the game and moving the control pad to the right or left until the player finds the desired weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gun: Fires a gun which fires shots forward&lt;br/&gt;    Bomb: Throws a bomb forward which quickly descends.&lt;br/&gt;    Boomerang: Throws a boomerang upward. Useful for enemies above Pero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All vehicles in the stages that use them have weapons Pero may use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pero has 3 lives, and the game allows three continues until forcing you to start at the first level. The game consists of 7 stages, taking place in various locations in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
