			<description>ego: emotions is a physically slightly smaller game in the EGO game series. It is a more compact and travel-friendly version that is ideal for taking on the move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features 200 brand new cards with people, things or events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a set of playing pieces (smiley pieces). You have 3 smiley pieces (one positive, one neutral and one negative smiley). In addition, you get 10 chips that you will need to bet on the answers to the question cards. Depending on the number of participants involved in the game there will be 10 chips per player in one pile (the bank).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The youngest participant starts by dragging a card and then going on. The text on the card is read aloud to the other participants. The card is placed face up on the table so everyone can see it. The player who has drawn the card must now consider the card and evaluate if he or she is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Positively voted for what's on the card (happy smiley)&lt;br/&gt;Neutrally / Indifferent / Do not know (Neutral smiley)&lt;br/&gt;Negative vote against what appears on the card (negative smiley)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the player who has drawn the card has decided, he or she places the selected smiley face down on the table with the back up so the others can not see what the person thinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players place their smiley piece face down which they believe that player has selected. In addition, they must now bet between 1 or 3 chips on their guess. Smiley are then revaled.  Correct answer doubles your bid, wrong loses it. The active player receives as many chips as there are correct guesses from the bank&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns continue in this manner. The game ends when the bank breaks. Goal is to get most chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
