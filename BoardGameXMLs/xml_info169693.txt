			<description>A Fight or Flight game where you fight to survive, build an SOS sign and try to live till rescue. Be careful, night brings Cannibals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect food, resources, weapons and tools while you fight (or flee) for your life in the Cooperative (or Solo) Survival Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this epic survival game you play the role of a crash survivor who washed up on a beautiful island. Without food or water you need to collect food, build tools, craft weapons and gather stones for an SOS sign. I mean, how else is rescue going to find you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While wondering the island you learn a few things, food is scarce, resources and equipment are hard to come by and nothing is what it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As night falls and a breathtaking sunset fills the sky, a weird mist seems to roll in off the coast. From the mist you see these things emerge. Human like figures stagger, crawl and sprint towards you. You don't know what you are about to face, do you fight or flee?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving their pawns around the island and using action points. They use these points to collect food and resources. Using a crafting system you can make weapons and tools to help you survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over the course of a Day and Night rounds. In the day rounds, You can wonder freely, but when night comes around, your actions are limited as well as your movement. With the setting sun, you will also start spawning numerous Cannibals around the island on specifically designated spawning locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can either fight Cannibals by rolling die, or run around them. By day break, cannibals will disappear into the forests until next night fall. As you finish your SOS sign, the island and cannibals will become more aggressive. Get off the island quick, but don't leave yourself vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get off the island alive and with as many people as possible. It is possible to be left behind, but the game is easier if you work together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
