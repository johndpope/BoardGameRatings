							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mystery Case Files: Prime Suspects</name>
									
			<description>Mystery Case Files: Prime Suspects is the second instalment in the Mystery Case Files franchise and was released in April 2006. The player is tasked with investigating the disappearance of the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Hope Diamond in Capital City. Mystery Case Files: Prime Suspects added items that players have to discover to unlock later levels (such as finding a battery to power a flashlight). Characters also became a more prominent part of the series with the investigation revolving around multiple characters with different personality &amp;lsquo;quirks&amp;rsquo;. Every time the game is played, the suspects and culprit are different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mystery case files&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
