			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insert cover says Jeff Wayne's Video Game Version Of The War Of The Worlds. It's a simple adventure derived from the popular 70s musical version of the HG Wells story. Musical cues in the game are intended to help you as you progress around for 6 days, trying to get to the right locations in the right order. The game was too frustrating for most players and the game got a bad reputation as being too slow and boring. Dull graphics didn't help either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programming was by Nigel Taylor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
