							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Protector of the Empire</name>
									
			<description>Protector of the Empire is a strategy game of conquest, diplomacy, civilization building, and treachery. It portrays historical events in Japan, Korea, and China from the collapse of the Han Dynasty shortly before 200 until around 1500. It is designed for 3 to 5 players. Regional powers like the Mongol empire, the Three Kingdoms of Korea, Nippon, Annam, Nanchao, and several Chinese dynasties can be depicted in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses plastic playing pieces to represent armies, fleets, temples, monuments, cities, independent kingdoms, and tribute collected from a conquered province. The map uses area movement with terrain features including the Great Wall, forests, and mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protector of the Empire is not intended to be a strict simulation of history but it attempts to capture the flavor of this fascinating period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains familiar concepts common to many strategy games and is slightly more complex than Risk or Axis &amp;amp; Allies. However, rules which might seem quite simple can often present subtle challenges to even the most experienced wargame players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
