			<description>There wouldn't be much point in having this amazing library if nobody ever read anything in it, right? Includes Forbidden Book Cards which are hazardous to read at best, and at worst, outright maddening to try to understand. If you do understand them, though, you just might get access to the new selection of Spell Cards. The Forbidden Books are the Book of Eibon, De Vermis Mysteriis, Unaussprechlichen Kulten, and Cultes des Ghoules, as well as an alternate version of the Necronomicon. Also contains 13 Spell Cards and rules governing how to use them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
