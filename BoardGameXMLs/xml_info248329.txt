			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations on attaining sentience, posi! In Fragment, you roleplay a sentient robot, known as a posi. During your time as an artificial-turned-real intelligence, you are part character, part storyteller, and part improvisational actor/actress. Not only will you play in a story lovingly crafted by your friends, but you will help to forge and tell that story of action, suspense, drama, and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fragment, your character is an AI that has recently achieved sentience, in a time with much of the world at odds. You and your friends will adventure across the globe fighting villains and corruption, or joining in it with them. To play the game, you will need your imagination, this book, devices capable of note taking and character recording, some dice, and several players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
