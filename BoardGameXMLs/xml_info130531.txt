			<description>A CCG of Disney released for the super market companies Louis Delhaize, Match and Smatch in Belgium. Each package includes 4 cards with the entire collection existing out of 216 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for the game are simple: Every player takes at least 5 cards face down. Now the first player takes the first card from his deck and chooses one of the 5 characteristics (cheerful, romantic, clumsy, playful or relaxed) which all have a specific score. After choosing the category the player places the card on the table so that everybody can see it. Now the other players take the first card from their own deck and compare the score of the choosen characteristic. Each card only has three characteristics, so only players who have a card with the choosen characteristic can play along that round. The player with the highest score on that characteristic wins the round. The game goes on until one person has won all the cards in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For collecting purposes people have made their own interpretation of the game or let the winner choose a card from one of the losers decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
