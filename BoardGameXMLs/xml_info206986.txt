			<description>New inhabitants have been spotted in the jungles on Leonera: the Amazons! Dangerous warriors who were born for jungle combat and who sneak up on their enemies quietly only to suddenly pounce on them. Gather a pride of Amazons and go hunting for clothskins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also reinforcements for the existing crews, however. Hot-blooded female pirates, Fate&amp;rsquo;s gift to women, smoke-bomb throwers, barrel wearers, barricade builders, failed circus acrobats and trained rat swarms are among the new characters for pirates, Brotherhood, Armada and goblins. Expand your existing crews and go out to show the uppity feathered females who really owns the jungle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is enough opportunity, because new scenarios have been added as well. And so you don&amp;rsquo;t lose track of things, the book also contains an index for both of the volumes published so far. So what are you waiting for? The jungle is calling you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book includes on 80 richly illustrated pages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     the new Amazons crew with 10 charakters&lt;br/&gt;     rules for a total of 17 new characters for the crews Pirates, Goblin Pirates, Imperial Armada and Brotherhood, as well as a new female animal handler Mercenary&lt;br/&gt;     expanded terrain rules, new traits and actions&lt;br/&gt;     5 new Jungle-scenarios like Hunt the Dodo or Man Raid&lt;br/&gt;     The Treasure of the Amayalli - mini camapaign with 3 more scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
