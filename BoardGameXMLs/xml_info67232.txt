							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunters&#039; Lodge</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the woods rises the Hunters' Lodge, a place where the hunters and rangers meet and share facilities and information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hunters&amp;rsquo; Lodge was built upon the ashes of an ancient orc outpost, after a fierce battle which involved a group of determined rangers and hunters led by a man named Garmas Woodstone. The outpost was totally destroyed during the battle thus Garmas decided to build a new structure helping the forces of good to maintain peace in the surrounding wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time passed and the Hunters&amp;rsquo; Lodge became a reference point for all the travelers and rangers of the woods. Garmas added facilities to his home such as a smith laboratory, a bowyer workroom, a tanning room and a trapmaker laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hunters' Lodge can be easily placed in your campaign world and can provide to the adventurers a good place to rest, share information and have some adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
