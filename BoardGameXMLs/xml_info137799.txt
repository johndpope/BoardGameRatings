							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Guide Booklet</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This is a nicely formatted booklet for recording city information in a fantasy game.  Each booklet is laid out to accomodate a single city.  Record pages are included for a city map (nogrid/hexes) with key and information, 24 building pages with a grid map area and an information sections, and a regional map page with hex map area and information section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;City Guide Booklet&lt;br/&gt;The new city guides are created to help with sandbox campaign note taking and planning of various towns and cities that the characters may explore. As I've mentioned before, my sandbox is just a very broad-stroke which I fill in as the players explore. Thus, notes were beginning to pile up all over the place and on all sorts of notebooks and scraps of paper. Cities were a special case as residents may come and go, items sold or traded from previous adventures would now be a part of this shops inventory. This booklet will help keep that organized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a 16 page booklet with room for 20 building maps and descriptions, a page for the general city map and city notes such as government, trade, laws, etc and finally a numbered hex map of the general region around the city or settlement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This accessory is available as a free download from the designer's blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
