							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drama Club</name>
									
			<description>Drama Club is about broken promises, revenge, and awkward teenage kisses. Somewhere in all of that, your characters will audition for a play by William Shakespeare, rehearse it, and then perform it in front of your fellow students.&lt;br/&gt;You will all be playing teenagers who have volunteered for the play. Dr. Washer is your director, and he is just crazy about &amp;ldquo;Billy the Bard&amp;rdquo;. Everyone will get a part, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be allowed to audition and then vote for two characters to play the Leads. Dr. Washer won&amp;rsquo;t vote during casting, but he&amp;rsquo;ll be there to break ties.&lt;br/&gt;After the Leads are chosen, rehearsals will begin. This period can either be highly productive practice sessions or personal Rivalries can result in self-confidence shattering gossip. Which do you think is more fun?&lt;br/&gt;After the auditions, rehearsals and rumors, the play will be performed. No matter how spiteful the actors become, the show must go on. After the performance, you&amp;rsquo;ll add up scores for individual performances and the group&amp;rsquo;s success as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submission for Game Chef 2011. Theme: Shakespeare. Ingredients: Forsworn, Nature, and Daughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
