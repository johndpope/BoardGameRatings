			<description>By placing their tiles and moving tiles opposing players together form a square of 5x5 (2 or 3 players) or 7x7 (4 players). Within this square that moved over the part at the option of poses and movements of tiles, each aims to create rows of his color (an alignment with at least three tiles) and antagonize those of its opponents. But the player who occupies one of the tiles with the center of the square at the end of the game double its alignment points (2 players, it double its strongest alignment).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
