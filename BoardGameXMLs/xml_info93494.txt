			<description>This is supposedly a traditional Swedish game, although no information is given about its age or origin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two players begin with six pawns each arranged around a grid of squares. A player takes their turn by rolling a die and moving a pawn that many squares in a straight line. Landing on a pawn of your own colour knocks it back to a starting position. Landing on a pawn of your opponent's colour captures it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player has captured all the opposing pawns, they receive points equal to their own number of remaining pawns, and the board is set up for another round. The winner of the game is the first to reach 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
