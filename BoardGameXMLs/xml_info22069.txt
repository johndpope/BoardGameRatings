			<description>&amp;quot;Het grote Pluk van de Petteflet spel&amp;quot; is a Dutch children's game. It derives its theme from the well-known (for Dutch and Flemish at least) children's book &amp;quot;Pluk van de Petteflet&amp;quot;, also known as &amp;quot;Towtruck Pluck&amp;quot; in English, by Dutch children's book writer Annie M.G. Schmidt. The players relive Pluk's adventures during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In essence it is a roll and move game: each in turn rolls a die and advances his pawn on the track. The winner is the first one to reach the finish. But to be allowed to finish, you must have the game token (Pluk's pigeon friend Dollie). That token is acquired by landing on spaces marked with a pigeon, or by landing next to the owner of the token.&lt;br/&gt;A few spaces on the board allow you to take another player's pawn and put it next to yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is lavishly illustrated with scenes from the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
