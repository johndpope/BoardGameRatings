			<description>Published by 505 games, Big Word Puzzle Book is a game designed to appeal to a broad audience, the same composite audience that surged on the video game market scene following titles such as Brain Training and 42 All-Time Classics. Big Word Puzzle Book builds from that experience by getting people's pre-existing shared knowledge and skills into play. In this case, it's all about language skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Word Puzzle Book is in fact an interactive word puzzle book that comprises both original and classic games, and further improves player's experience by combining the games into a structure that adapts to its users&amp;rsquo; playing patterns. Also, Big Word Puzzle Book makes the most out of the natural interface offered by Nintendo DS and offers a staggering amount of content for long-term enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
