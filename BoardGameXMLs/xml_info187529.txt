							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A Samurai push-your-luck, set collection game for 2-6 players. Take to the Dojo and Roll dice, allocating them to the available Virtues. Learn enough Virtues of the Bushido Code to impress one of the Daimyo in order to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For twelve years the Province&amp;nbsp;of Tosa&amp;nbsp;has been blessed with peace and prosperity. Peace and prosperity that has been won through valiant battle and sacrifice that has left Tosa with little army yet&amp;nbsp;still what remains defends the earned prosperity. Until sea faring invades lay siege to Kochi, a capital port for Tosa and threatens this lasting peace. With the invaders&amp;nbsp;not willing to negotiate; the Shogun orders his many Daimyo to travel Tosa&amp;nbsp;in search for recruits to train in order to bolster the dwindling&amp;nbsp;ranks of Samurai for the inevitable military confrontation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bushido, The Card Game is an interesting blend of push your luck and strategy. Each roll of the die will leave you with a decision, collect virtues which are needed to win, or activate Daimyo abilities to alter the game in your advantage. Either decision, however small, will ultimately lead to your victory or demise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bushido, The Card Game doesn't lack in &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; gameplay. Many of the Virtue cards dynamically alter the game when collected. Focus tokens can force a player to reroll any die result at any time - and each of the Daimyo have a special ability to help or hinder training!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete as samurai potentials to be the first player recruited!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
