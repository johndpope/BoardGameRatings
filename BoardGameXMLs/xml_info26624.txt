			<description>Zards puts a twist on the trick-taking card game.   When a player takes the trick, he is allowed to cast a spell to manipulate the rules governing the rest of the round (when possible). The further the game progresses, the more spells become available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played from a unique deck of 84 cards ordered by three characteristics: rank, set, and suit. The rank corresponds with the card's spell level. As players increase their score and achieve new levels, more spells open up to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each round, players split the 13 cards dealt to them into a wand of 10 cards and a bag of 3 cards. The wand determines which cards are played during the round, while the bag is a selection of pre-determined spells to cast during the round. Spells are only cast by a player taking the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zards is unique to other trick-taking games:&lt;br/&gt;    * Zards is adjustable to play 3 to 6 players without the need to add or remove cards from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;    * By not dealing out the entire deck, the ability to accurately count cards is reduced, providing more comfort for novices playing against experts.&lt;br/&gt;    * Players can manipulate the rules for the round with a selection of over 20 spells.&lt;br/&gt;    * Each round allows the player in last place the advantage of playing first. Though, maintaining the lead depends on how cards are played and spells are cast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
