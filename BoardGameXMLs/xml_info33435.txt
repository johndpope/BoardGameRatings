			<description>Hungry Hank!&amp;trade; is a laugh out loud fun game for the entire family.  It promotes healthy eating and exercise for young children.  They don't actually know this, they're just having lots of fun!  Here's how you play...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One trip around the board is one day in Hungry Hank&amp;rsquo;s life.  As you make your way through Hungry Hank&amp;rsquo;s day, he will have breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and maybe even dessert.  He'll also get plenty of exercise (and so will you)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time you land on a food space, pump Hungry Hank the number of times indicated by pressing the big green button by Hungry Hank's feet.  For example, landing on a bowl of cereal and a banana for breakfast is 1 pump.  Two donuts and chocolate milk for breakfast - that's 3 pumps!  All food spaces require at least 1 pump, but you will see some require a lot more!  Every time Hungry Hank eats, his arms flap, he burps or grunts and his belly grows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you land on an exercise space, you must get up and do exactly what Hungry Hank is doing the number of times indicated (for example, Jumping Jacks 8 times)!  All exercises can be done right next to the game.  When kids play the game with their parents or other adults, it's great for them to see adults exercising!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who lands on a food space and causes Hungry Hank to pop ends the game.  You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be the one to make Hungry Hank pop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 - 4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
