			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures 2 is the widely anticipated sequel to the artificial life game Creatures, developed by Creature Labs and published by Mindscape Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays several years after Creatures and the world of Albia has changed dramatically after a volcanic eruption. New areas have opened for your Norns to explore and the new Ettin race is around stealing nearly everything that isn't bolted down. Your Norns also have more complex genomes and biochemistry, compared to Creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
