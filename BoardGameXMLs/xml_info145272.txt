			<description>New WWE 13 or WWE 2013 game for the PS3. It has many unlockable items and a stroy line mode. You can also creat your own show right down to the ramp color. The game seems like a good one. You have many super stars to unlock. They give you some really good ones like Triple H and The Undertaker but then fill it out with the basic names. I belive you have to unlock most of the old names and im sure you can go online to buy some of the guys. {This is my description of the game after looking it over and playing it for a few hours}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following is from the back of the game case.  &lt;br/&gt;LIVE THE REVOLUTION&lt;br/&gt;WWE UNIVERSE &lt;br/&gt;YOUR ACTIONS SHAPE YOUR UNIVERSE WITH DYNAMIC MATCHS, STORYLINE TWISTS AND UNPREDICTABE MOMENTS FORM THE CREATIVE DIRECTION OF THE MASTERMIND PUAL HEYMAN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BIGGEST WWE ROSTER EVER&lt;br/&gt;CHOOSE FROM NEARLY 100 SUPERSTARS, LEGENDS AND DIVAS FROM TODAY AND FROM THE &amp;quot;ATTITUDE ERA&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WWE '13 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and published by 2K Sports (originally published by THQ) for the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360. It is the second game in the WWE (Now WWE 2K) series and the fourteenth overall in the combined series. It is the sequel to WWE '12 and succeeded by WWE 2K14. It was released on October 30, 2012 in North America and November 2, 2012 in United Kingdom.[1] It is also the final WWE game to be published by THQ before the company's demise in January 2013, thus ending the WWE/THQ relationship after thirteen years.&lt;br/&gt; The game focuses on the Attitude Era of WWE, replacing its Road to WrestleMania Mode with an Attitude Era Mode where the player plays through the Attitude Era in 6 different storylines. The game also brings back its Predator Technology engine, adding in a new audio system called WWE Live. The game is said to be the second phase of a &amp;quot;Revolution&amp;quot; in WWE video games,[2] with cover athlete CM Punk taking charge. Following release and positive reception, the game would be nominated for the Spike VGA for Best Individual Sports Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWE '13&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
