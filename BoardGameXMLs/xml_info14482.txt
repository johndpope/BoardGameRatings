			<description>One of 9 games released by Helen of Toy that graced many a comic book from the late 50's into the early 80's.  Each game was usually shipped in a non-descript cardboard box. The Woods Edge G.I. Battle Game from Helen of Toy featured 88 3D G.I. figures by GIANT (evidently in two colors - Green/Olive &amp;amp; Gray), a Playmat,  &amp;quot;2 Die Calculators&amp;quot; which were evidently Spinners of some sort according to the directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
