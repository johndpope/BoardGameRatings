							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Landmaus &amp; Stadtmaus: Sherlock Maus</name>
									
			<description>A roll-and-move game based on the cartoon series &amp;quot;The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this cooperative children's game is to lead all 4 pawns through the story of the stolen diamond and to solve the case together with Emily, Alexander and Sherlock Mouse before Notail Nogoodnik, the thief, is seen five times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a track consisting of lots of coloured spaces and pictures from the cartoon series. There are four pawns. Players take turns rolling the colour die. The active player moves a pawn of his/her choice to the next space of the colour on the die roll (all players can move all pawns). If a pawn lands on a yellow space, one of the twenty, randomly distributed face-down tiles has to be turned over. If it shows a picture from the board, the pawn is moved to the corresponding space. If the tile shows Notail Nogoodnik, it stays face-up and the player's turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;To get a pawn to the finish line, the spaces has to be reached exactly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all four player pawns reach the finish line, all players win together. If five tiles showing Notail Nogoodnik are turned over, they all lose together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
