							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Assassin: A Dungeon World Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They say your trade is the second oldest there is. You can't be sure, but you see no reason to doubt them: in your experience, there are always people willing to exchange money for murder. Power, conviction, cruelty, wealth&amp;mdash;all end equally at the point of a knife. All it takes is a simple transaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, inevitably, the knife is in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know weakness by instinct, weapons by weight, shadows by sound and the dying curses of your victims by heart. You wield the magic of the streets, of shadows and of blood. You do your job with professional dispassion and expect to be paid in full for services rendered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contracts are always plentiful. Time to get to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Assassin is a new class for use with Dungeon World - a lethal killer with a mastery of shadow magic, partly inspired by the video game Dishonored. It also includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City Thief, a variant of Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel's Thief class from the Dungeon World core book, which loses the poison moves for some more stealth- and agility-oriented moves and is inspired by the Thief video game series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And new items like the water arrow or flash bombs, also inspired by Thief!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
