							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Watchtower Pagoda</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally a much smaller temple was built at this site, but as the surrounding lands prospered it has been replaced by a grand pagoda with gilded shingles on its roof. The building can be seen far and wide, from almost any place within a day's walk. The same is true in reverse. From the pagoda's topmost floor you have a splendid view of all the surrounding land. This probably is what prompted a local warlord to re purpose the structure as a watchtower garrisoned by a small platoon of his soldiers in recent times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hall making up the pagoda's ground floor remains mostly empty, except for soldiers that might have guard duty there. The second floor on the other hand has been turned into an armoury of sorts and the two floors above it serve as the soldiers quarters. At the very top floor sentries keep careful watch of the surrounding land. Ready to ring the heavy brass bell hung from the rafters to alarm every soldier and citizen within miles of approaching danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
