			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Black-ops, Aliens &amp;amp; Monsters, character abilities are defined by Skills, and every Skill has a numeric rating called a Skill#.  New characters typically have a numeric rating of 15 in each Skill#, though they can buy up the score by using Background Points, which allow several types of character customization during generation.  Characters have eight Broad Skills and seven Combat Skills.  Characters also have Body Points and ERG, both of which start at 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eight Broad Skills include Athletics, Intellect, Interpersonal, Naturalist, Overall Competence (the &amp;quot;catch all&amp;quot; skill), Shifty, Technical, and Trades.  The seven Combat Skills include four Melee Skills and two Ranged Skills. The Melee Skills are:  Melee Attack, Sinews (extra damage), Multiple Attacks, and Two Weapons.  The Ranged Skills are Marksmanship and Shooting with the Off-Hand.  Finally, characters have one Defensive Skill: Defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters do not have &amp;quot;classes&amp;quot; but the rules do provide character templates which allow for rapid character builds along a concept.  The included scenario finds the characters investigating around a newly active volcano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
