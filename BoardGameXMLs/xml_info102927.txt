			<description>DragonMage Warfare is a fantasy themed strategy game in which 2-4 players build armies of creatures and cast spells in battle to gain experience and defeat their opponents to rule the Council. The player who achieves a preset amount of experience wins the game. Experience is gained by summoning creatures and casting spells in battle. Battle takes place on a map that is prebuilt each time the game is played. Players must defend their lands and take over other lands with their army of creatures. Because the map can be changed every game, players have an unlimited amount of maps to play on. Six decks representing six elements (Light, Dark, Fire, Water, Earth &amp;amp; Wind) contain the creatures and spells a player uses to defend or attack. Card combinations can be explosive or deceitful depending upon what other players hold in their hands. This game allows for exciting and varied game play. On each players turn they will perform one of five actions (Move, Play a mage, Play a card, Replenish spell book or Attack. A semi-simultaneous attack sequence allows all players to be involved during battles and possibly sway the outcome during three and four player games.  Will you fulfill the ancient prophesy for told by the mighty DragonMage Arcturius and become the next Mage to rule the DragonMage Council?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
