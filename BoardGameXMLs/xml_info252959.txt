			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Fragged Aeternum Adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their travels the Tethered have begun to regularly see flyers advertising a small bounty for anyone who can find a missing set of twins. Normally, the Tethered would not get involved with something as common as this, but a brief interaction with the person posting up these flyers will change their minds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albrecht is the one nailing up the flyers, and will quickly notice one of the well-armed PCs looking at his bounty. He will quickly introduce himself as the father of the twins and implore them to listen to his story over a drink. People have been going missing around the area for decades; their bodies never recovered. This sounds like the work of a dark cult or a Fiend...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Balanced for Level 1-4 PCs.&lt;br/&gt;    Expected duration; 2-4 sessions.&lt;br/&gt;    Will included; Investigation, exploration and combat.&lt;br/&gt;    Ideal for Players and Game Masters who are new to Aeternum system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
