			<description>A two player trick taking game in which the objective is to go out first with a two- or one-suited hand of nine cards. Players start with nine randomly dealt cards and two face down &amp;quot;shed&amp;quot; cards between them. Standard no-trump trick-taking rules apply (with aces high) and the loser of the trick exchanges two of his cards (without revealing them) for the two face down cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
