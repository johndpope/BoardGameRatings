			<description>The boards shows a tangle of streets and 40 specially marked points on these streets, which correspond to the 40-card order deck that is used for play. Besides that order deck, there is also a 12-card deck with 4 different penalty cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has drawn an order, he must try to reach the end point within a certain number a turns, which is determined by the throw of a die. The shortest distance to the end point is the amount of chips that can be won, but failing to succeed results in loosing further turns as well as loosing chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before throwing the die, each player must choose among 4 risk levels: the higher the level, the farther can his move go, but the higher is also the risk to be punished with a penalty card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a previously fixed amount of time and the player with the most chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
