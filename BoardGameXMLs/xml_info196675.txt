			<description>Thanks so much for coming to learn more about our game 'The Incredible Journey of You and I'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are aiming to creating an adorable and crazy two player couch co-op. &lt;br/&gt;Both players have control of opposite halves of a ship and will swap roles as they dart in and out of the sky and sea.&lt;br/&gt;Players must figure out how to work together to save their home from those dang monsters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the game works:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the ship is made from two different elements, it will react differently to the surrounding environment. When you are in the air, the Air half of the ship (pink player) will control where the ship will fly, the Water half of the ship (blue player) will take control over the shooting and other interactive elements. When you fly into water, the controls swap and the blue player takes control over flight and the pink player takes control over shooting and other interactive elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have the basic controls figured out, you will then have to destroy the mysterious creatures that have invaded your world. Some will be chilling around the landscape waiting to spit deadly poison at you as you fly past, others will be messing with the poor friendly creatures of the world causing them to block your path, and even turn them bad! To destroy the enemies, you will have to pay attention to the colour of their eyes. They will either be pink or blue or both!. You may have noticed by this point that you each have different coloured bullets, pink and blue. This directly relates to who can shoot the enemy to destroy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the foundations on which we are going to build this game on. We hope that this will be a game that will make players communicate with each other, to work together, and have fun doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are working our darnedest to release 'The Incredible Journey of You and I' in 2016/17. Stop by our dev blog over the coming months to see how the game is shaping up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
