			<description>A number of fake dog poops (molded compound) are placed on a plastic mat. Players take turns to walk across the mat while blindfolded. A spinner determines how many steps they take and if other players should add, remove or reposition the poop before the blindfolded person starts walking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each person has taken a turn, the winner is the player who has stepped in the least poop. There are no ties, keep playing until there's a clear poop-dodging champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
