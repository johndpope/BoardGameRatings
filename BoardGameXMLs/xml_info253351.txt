			<description>A game for 2-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've been just lying around for as long as you can remember.  BORING.  It's time to do something.  It's time to have a party.  All you've got to do now is find enough people in your situation to be able to have a good party.  Why says just because you're dead, you can't have any fun?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, probably those guys with the pitchforks, so stay out of their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the game box (envelope)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
