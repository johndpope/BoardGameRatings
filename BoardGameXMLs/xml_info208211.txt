			<description>A Short Adventure for a Small Party&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a Little Help From My Friends is a short adventure designed for a small party of adventures. A magic user will be useful, as will at least one rogue type character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The encounter locations use Middenheim as an example, though any medium or largesized city in the Old World will do just as well. You could also insert the adventure as part of the Paths of the Damned series, in Middenheim itself, Altdorf or Nuln, but be careful of giving the adventures too much to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The encounter is designed to give players a chance to think before they bash. There&amp;rsquo;s been a kidnapping, and the adventures are hired to rescue the hostage. The characters should consider their rescue carefully, but may have to improvise quickly if things don&amp;rsquo;t go quite according to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the PDF is formatted &amp;quot;two-up&amp;quot; for booklet printing.  The PDF has 12 pages; a printed and folded booklet would have 24 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
