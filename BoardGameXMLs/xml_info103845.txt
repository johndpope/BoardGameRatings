			<description>This is a simulation of a soccer game played on a 41 by 52 square board.&lt;br/&gt; Possession and movement are controlled by dice (one d20, two d6) and cards. The cards come in 4 types: Direction cards (60), Action cards (60), Referee's Decision cards (30) and Situation cards (30) which are drawn under defined circumstances.&lt;br/&gt; The rules cover situations such as kick off, own goal, corner kicks, throw ins, free kicks, penalties and scoring chances.&lt;br/&gt; The winner is the one to score most goals in two 45 minute halves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
