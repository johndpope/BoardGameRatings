			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curses have long played a pivotal role in narratives and popular culture from the stories of the ancient world to the Curse of the Bambino. A curse is retributive evil or misfortune: bad things happening to those who commit some grave sin or crime. Some would call it bad karma, while others attribute it to the prayers or invoked curses of those seeking to harm transgressors. It is this sense of &amp;ldquo;just desserts&amp;rdquo; that keeps people believing in them. People want to believe that the bad guy always gets what is coming to him. Anyone who suffers a disproportionate amount of bad luck when compared to the rest of the populace is commonly believed to be cursed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Odysseus was cursed in Odyssey by Poseidon for tormenting Poseidon&amp;rsquo;s son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, and did not make it home for ten years. Many myths and ancient stories revolved around curses, blaming any and all misfortune on the gods. Modern and ancient literature is rife with curses, from the Curse of Ham in the bible (Genesis 9: 18-29) to the Unforgivable Curses of Harry Potter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book you will find twelve unique monsters all having to do with curses.This book also contains cursed creatures, monsters that are utilized in a curse or those who use curses to target their foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
