							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar – Treasure Trove</name>
									
			<description>This expansion to Fireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar is a collection of cards unlocked via stretch goals during the Kickstarter campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure Trove includes more souvenir cards to shuffle into the souvenir deck, legendary artifact cards for you to discover, and injury cards which give you a choice to take a random disadvantage rather than give up a treasure when hit by a fireball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards won't be in the retail game which is what is being shipped to backers so they will come as an extra package. The publisher has said that they will be selling it only through their web store, conventions, and maybe the BGG store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
