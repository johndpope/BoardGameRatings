			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talislanta Generic Character Generator/System presents a system to create &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; characters for use in the Talislanta setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have four Physical Statistics (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Speed), four Mental Statistics (Charisma, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower), and four Derived Statistics (Combat Rating, Magic Rating, Hit Points, Stress Points).  Statistic Levels are purchased from a point pool; an average human is assumed to have a zero stat in every category.  Characters gain experience points and can spend them to improve Statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters may be human or belong to one of five non-human races:  elf, dwarf, halfling, lizard man, or cat man.  Finally, Skills, Advantages, and Disadvantages are purchased from lists and equipment is purchased.  The system presents a generic methodology for resolving Skill use and combat and for handling wounds and distress.  The Mental Statistic &amp;quot;Stress&amp;quot; is meant to mimic a mental breakdown process common to horror gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Talislanta Character Sheet for the system is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
