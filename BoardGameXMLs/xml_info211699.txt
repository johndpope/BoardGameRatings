			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Gran March Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year during Needfest, the militia companies of Gran March come together outside Hookhill to practice their martial skills and test their battle readiness. Recently, the Militia Council has agreed to open up the Games to outside participants, though some veterans might not take kindly to outsiders in their Games. During the celebration and mock violence, observant contestants might catch wind of murder in the air. Let the Games Begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Militia Games is a series of mock battles and contests of martial skill. Players are strongly encouraged to create Gran March veteran PCs who are interested in learning about the various Militia Groups (meta-organizations) available. PCs who would be unwilling to participate in mock combats are strongly discouraged. This is an introductory Living Greyhawk module set in the Gran March and is intended for 1st level PC&amp;rsquo;s only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
