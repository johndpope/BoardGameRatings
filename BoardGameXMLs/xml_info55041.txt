			<description>FTLS is a game for two players, but you may also play it solitaire, if you add the special rules that moves the game toward the simulation replay market.&lt;br/&gt;It is based simply on the average goals for and against of each team, but it adds several features that makes strategy really important (in particular the comparison of the tacticts used by the opponents).&lt;br/&gt;With the advanced rules it adds features like top scorers, assistmen and the great importance of disciplinary sanctions (red cards and yellow cards) on the overall performance of each team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
