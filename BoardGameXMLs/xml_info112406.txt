							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gopher</name>
									
			<description>Box Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gopher is a one or two player, full color game designed to be played on the Atari Video Computer System or the Sears Video Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gophers have launched a merciless assault on your carrot patch. Grab your shovel and fill those holes before they tunnel out and eat your choice carrots. With no time to run back to the barn for more seeds to plant, it's a good thing that crazy duck keeps flying by and dropping them. But it's awfully tricky to catch a seed, plant it, and still keep those persistent Gophers away. Just when you think everything's under control, they get faster and hungrier! Take a deep breath, and let the battle begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
