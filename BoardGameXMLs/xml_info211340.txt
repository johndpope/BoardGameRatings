			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Ordnance II! Our second Ordnance set features a number of new Japanese and British ordnance for use with Global War.  Ordnance weapons are developed through technology research and expended during play to improve combat options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The British player will enjoy the 20,000lb Grand Slam earthquake bomb &amp;ndash; an excellent weapon for taking out German factories, shipyards and airfields.  British ships will can arm themselves with Fairey-Stooge anti-kamikaze missiles and &amp;ldquo;Unrotated Projectile&amp;rdquo; anti-aircraft weapons.  The homeland&amp;rsquo;s factories and bases will enjoy increased protection from the Z-Battery AA rocket system.  British aircraft will find targets easier using RP-3 air-ground rockets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan will find itself with new kamikaze weapons: the Ohka &amp;ldquo;Cherry Blossum&amp;rdquo; jet, Shinyo Suicide Boat and Kaiten Human Torpedo are powerful weapons for Japan to increase its kamikaze capacity and defend its shores.   The A-11 ICBM and Fu-Go incendiary balloon bomb (designed to float across Pacific air currents) can both strike America from Tokyo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dizzying array of new weapons for Britain and Japan will add untold new strategy options and realism to Global War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
