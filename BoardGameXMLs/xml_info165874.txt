							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloody Red Flag</name>
									
			<description>Bloody Red Flag provides advanced &amp;amp; supplemental rules for the Close Action naval wargame. The supplemental rules are an integrated set designed to simulate tactical naval warfare in the late sail era in a more realistic manner than Close Action permits, but at the cost of some additional complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary change in Bloody Red Flag is the implementation of a 12-point movement system to replace the regular 6-point hex system. Ships may now turn 30 degrees to point toward a hex corner instead of just hex sides.  Additional rules are included to address topics impacted by this modification in the movement system, including Collisions, Line of Sight, Firing Arcs &amp;amp; Range, Rakes, Marine Fire, Drifting, Anchoring, and Land terrain effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional rules include Impulse movement, Smoke effects, and Optional rules for Towing, Anchoring, Tacking, and Signaling.  There are also optional rules for Pre-1794 Signaling limitations and a Signal Book for Pre-1794 scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
