							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">QUERP Modern Supplement: The Wild West</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to QUERP Modern role playing, Wild West-style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook details the Wild West history of the United States from 1840 through to the early 1900s. All of the information found within this book is based on factual research; from the American civil war outlaw and lawmen personalities to the infamous red Indian tribes and warriors.&lt;br/&gt; You can rob a train with Robert Leroy Parker (otherwise known as Butch Cassidy) and the Wild Bunch or be the one of the Pinkerton's National Detective Agency posse who hunts them down. In this source book is everything that you need to run a 'rootin-tootin' gun slinging games evening.&lt;br/&gt; As with all of our source books, we include: new special skills, character types, adversaries, new gambling rules for poker and roulette (QUERP-style) and an adventure to get you started.&lt;br/&gt; This is not a stand-alone product. This source book requires the QUERP Modern Core Rule Book to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
