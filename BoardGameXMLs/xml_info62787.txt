			<description>Dice Shift is a simple pub-oriented dice game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You just need 6 normal D6 dices to play Dice Shift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 Players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player throws 3 dice. If most of them are odd this player would be the EVEN player, otherwise he would be the ODD player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the ODD player is to get a    or a    or a   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the EVEN player is, as you can imagine, to get a    or a    or a   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with the player who has thrown the first 3 dice (which form the starting position). At every turn the other 3 dice are thrown and the player has to do from 0 to 3 DiceShifts (as many as he want) which consist in exchange one of the throwed die for another one previously played which has the same punctuation &amp;plusmn;1 (understanding that 6+1=1 and 1-1=6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if the current position is    (the order doesn't matter) and the throwed dice show    you can play like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;rarr;  &amp;raquo; &lt;br/&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;br/&gt; &amp;rarr;  &amp;raquo;  &amp;raquo; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And obtain the final position   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you make 3 DiceShifts in your turn (as in the example above) you have another turn. If you can't (or just don't want) make 3 DiceShifts the next turn is played by your adversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you reach one of the objectives of your opponent in your turn you have lost. Even if you still can make another DiceShift in this turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just play like both players trying to finish the game as soon as possible (you score 1 negative point for every turn until the end of the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find here the original (Spanish) rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
