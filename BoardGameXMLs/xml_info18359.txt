			<description>Based on the Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot;. Reading the book may be of some assistance in playing the game but is not necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to Identify a Nightmare Workplace&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to combat Eye Strain from Fluorescent Lights&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to Survive if you're caught surfing the web instead of working&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to stop an overflowing toilet in the executive washroom&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May be used as a travel game or as a supplement to other games in the series like the original or Travel version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each one of the cards has a question and 3 alternative answers printed on front and back, 108 questions in all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  current player has the question and all answers read to them. They then choose which of the answers is *most* appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to get 5 questions correct is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are printed different colours blue/white on their opposite faces which makes it easy to tell when you have gone through the first half of questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
