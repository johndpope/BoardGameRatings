			<description>This 1935 title uses dice to determine the results of plays. The board has two folds, with the field in the center section and the list of plays and results, and dials for downs, quarters and yards to go on both side panels, one facing each end of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kickoff, return, reverse, lateral, line buck, off tackle, end run, pass, punt and spinner plays are resolved with two dice which are read lowest digit first, for 21 possible outcomes. Results of punts, field goals, try for point, free kick after safety, fumbles, blocked kicks and interference penalties are determined by a single die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no defensive play choice. Instead, the defensive player is responsible for looking up the results and keeping tabs of yardage and downs while the offensive player considers his next play. The offensive player must choose his next play within 10 seconds or is hit with a five-yard delay of game penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
