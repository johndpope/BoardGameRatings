			<description>Every government needs a secret team for spying, hacking and destruction&lt;br/&gt;A.I.M:- Agents for Infiltration and Mayhem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agents for Infiltration and Mayhem are a team of special agents with a variety of skills and talents. Different combinations of the A.I.M. team are deployed for different mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission, should you decide to accept it, will be to defeat all the challenges thrown at you and save the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In A.I.M. you play a secret &amp;ldquo;off the books&amp;rdquo; government agency who are given deniable missions to achieve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think A-Team meets Mission: Impossible meets Charlie&amp;rsquo;s Angels meets Man from Uncle. Here is your chance to re-create those great TV and film shows for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;A.I.M. is a deck builder game. You select one or more roles and mission scenarios and a small starting deck. As the game progresses you develop your deck of talents, weapons and equipment. You will face increasingly stronger challenges: locks, thugs &amp;amp; military teams, computers to hack, people to charm and confuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you overcome challenges you earn the ability to collect additional cards from the Quarter-Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you must beware of other agents hidden agendas and possible plot-twists that will really test your abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every agent has their own agenda, it may be to protect the other agents, to make more money, to progress further &amp;ndash; or maybe they will have to betray the team&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
