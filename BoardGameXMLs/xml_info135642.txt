			<description>&amp;quot;Lines of Fire: The Boardgame&amp;quot; brings the classic board game wargame experience to tablets. It takes advantage of the tablet's features to streamline the setup and gameplay but retains the old-school feeling of playing an actual board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a fresh design reflecting the tactical WW2 combat in Western Front. The typical scenario-based approach has been replaced by a RTS-style gameplay: Players begin the battle on an empty map and race to take control over majority of strategic locations. Their main concern is to outsmart the opponent in finding an effective balance between spending resources on maneuvering the forces in play or bringing new units into battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Lines of Fire: The Boardgame&amp;quot; is build on simple, accessible ruleset, which provides a thematic feel to the firefights. An innovative Fog of War option, utilizes tablets features to enrich the board game experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Lines of Fire: The Boardgame&amp;quot; is available for iPads, providing the classic 2-player hotseat game. The first release will be followed shortly by free updates bringing additional gameplay options, Game Centre support and an AI opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developer's (20 Fingers Productions) future plans relating to &amp;quot;Lines of Fire&amp;quot; include:&lt;br/&gt;- releasing a hardcopy board game version in late 2013&lt;br/&gt;- adding new Theaters of War (Eastern Front, Pacific) to the application&lt;br/&gt;- releasing the application to other mobile platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
