			<description>Last Mission is a top-down multidirectional shooter developed by Data East and distributed in world wide release for the arcades in 1986. The game was similar to Time Pilot as players had full movement control over their ship and could move it in all eight directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players assume the role of an alien-humanoid space pilot who has been exiled from their home galaxy for committing an unlearned crime. The only way the player character can return is to restore their honor; the only way to do so is to invade and defeat the alien invaders who have been known to frequently attack the player character's people using a ship called the Main Fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Last Mission (arcade game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
