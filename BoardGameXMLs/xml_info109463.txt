			<description>Cricket game.&lt;br/&gt;The board has 25 boxes, each marked with a number (runs) or an 'out' decision (Bowled, Stumped, etc.). A match consists of one innings by each player (longer games can be agreed at the start).&lt;br/&gt;The first player to bat flips his 11 counters on to the board. If a counter is in a box with a number, it counts that many runs.  If a counter lands in an 'out' box, then that counter is lost. After scoring runs, the same player flips again and the same procedure is followed. As wickets are taken, less and less counters are used, until you have no counters at all and the innings is over. Then the second player has his innings.&lt;br/&gt;The player who scores the most runs, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
