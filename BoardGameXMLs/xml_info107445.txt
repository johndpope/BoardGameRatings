							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To kill a monster</name>
									
			<description>from the author's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a complete one-session scenario. Depending on player activity and GM style, run time should range from three to six hours. Seven pre-generated characters have been included, but original characters may be used to replace any or all pre-generates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To Kill A Monster&amp;quot; is an introduction to RuneQuest and Glorantha, with a focus on roleplaying, PC cleverness, and intuition. Simplified RQIII rules are recommended&amp;mdash;the players should not have to struggle with the system. The GM is urged to use only as many rules as s/he is comfortable inflicting on the players. Of course, the scenario can also be run for experienced RuneQuest players. This is not an exercise in Gloranthan scholarship; it is an introduction to some Gloranthan elements only. The intention is to avoid frightening off players with a world that can be dauntingly complicated for the uninitiated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
