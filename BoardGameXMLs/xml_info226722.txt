			<description>Publisher summary&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been alive for millennia. You can&amp;rsquo;t be sure exactly how long, because memories fade along the way. A handful of others like you have found each over the years. Mostly, you keep to yourselves. Every 100 years, you return to this beach, and discuss the tectonic shifts of the human world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge Comments&lt;br/&gt;Stones as a mechanic for bidding and memories isn&amp;rsquo;t more unique than tokens, but I do like that this game includes the characters walking away after discussing a world crisis to recall new memories by picking up more stones. Unlike a lot of other games about &amp;ldquo;gods&amp;rdquo; this isn&amp;rsquo;t about what they&amp;rsquo;ve created or destroyed, it&amp;rsquo;s just recollection and discussing of crises, and the fact that they continually lose memory as they age. It&amp;rsquo;s quietly reminiscent of an aging population discussing the world as they see it change and shift. And the ability of people to endure tragedy, with memories beng how those stories are lost. - Kate Bullock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
