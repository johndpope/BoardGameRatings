			<description>Travel World is a board game, in which players visit major cities and countries around the world.  Players select different reasons for travelling - business, pleasure, adventure, or education, and, leaving from Tokyo, check in at 10 places that correspond to their reasons for travelling.  The first player to call in at all such places, and return to Tokyo, wins.  Players of all ages can enjoy this game of world travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a spin and move game in which players have to visit each city in their color and return to the start space.  Players can choose to travel in many directions around the world but have to follow predetermined paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travelling from North America to Europe can be done via two &amp;quot;lay-over&amp;quot; spaces in which the player must stop and spend a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
