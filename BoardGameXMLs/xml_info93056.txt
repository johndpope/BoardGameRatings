			<description>The Great Escape is a game based on the 1963 movie The Great Escape. It was developed by UK-based developer Pivotal Games and published in 2003 by SCi Games, which had purchased the rights for the game from MGM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four playable characters in the game each with a special ability. They include Macdonald, who can speak German to pass himself off as a guard; Hendley, who can pick pockets to get papers, keys, etc.; Hilts, who can pick locks to get into buildings; and Sedgwick, who can fix mechanical devices. Captain &amp;quot;Vergil&amp;quot; Hilts is American with a attitude, Hendley is an American who joined the RAF eagle squad before the US joined the war. While the other characters are citizens of Great Britain or the British Commonwealth: Macdonald is Scottish and Sedgwick is Australian. There are 18 levels in the game, most of which have fictional tasks and attacks most of which did not happen in the movie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Great Escape (2003 video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
