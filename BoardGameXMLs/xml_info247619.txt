			<description>From the developers of Age of Empires II: The Forgotten and Age of Mythology Extended Edition, SkyBox Labs presents TASTEE: Lethal Tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is TASTEE: we do take out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the director, you will coordinate a master plan using every tool at your disposal. Off the books, unsanctioned and highly illegal, you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing the dirty work the government can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are elite, elusive, and deliciously dangerous. Independents and rogues, these mercs do not play well with others and we&amp;rsquo;re going to cram them all into your rundown diner: TASTEE. They&amp;rsquo;re an unruly powder keg waiting for a spark&amp;hellip;but fortunately most of these guys like explosions. This is your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your job is to recruit these hired guns and form the TASTEE team; use them to orchestrate missions to take down the Cartel. Misfits and outcasts, each merc has refined their own personal MO when it comes to death and destruction. Their unique set of skills is exactly what you&amp;rsquo;ll need to steal guns, interrupt supply lines, save hostages, formulate traps, and execute epic gunfights on your mission to take down The Cowboy &amp;ndash; the big boss responsible for a global crime epidemic. Lethal tactics have been authorized&amp;hellip; Good luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;source &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://tasteegame.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://tasteegame.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
