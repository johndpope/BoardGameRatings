			<description>Downeast Dealer is a fast-paced card game of strategy for 3 to 5 players based on the old Yankee obsession with finding a bargain. Players run auctions, make bids on collectable items, and challenge other players to deals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone begins with cash and a few bad checks. Play begins with the auction of an item you might find in a classified section of the newspaper, on Craigslist, or in the uniquely Maine publication, &amp;ldquo;Uncle Henry&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo; Players take turns auctioning these Classified Items to each other and bidding on items to add to their own collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Classified Item has a point value. The most sought after Classified Item, the Moose Trophy, is worth 100 points. Lesser items, like the Blueberry Rake, are worth as little as 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;A player only earns the points indicated on a Classified Item when they collect the complete set of four cards. When two players each hold the same Classified Item card, one player may &amp;ldquo;Downeast Deal&amp;rdquo; to try to capture the set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downeast Deals are when bluffing becomes a major element of the game. Players might offer large sums of cash in a Downeast Deal, or they might just throw down a bunch of bad checks. There&amp;rsquo;s no telling until the deal is done &amp;ndash; and the savviest dealer takes the collection (or perhaps a large pile of cash!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues with auctions and deals until all of the sets are complete. The final scoring depends on the point value of the cards a player has &amp;ndash; and the number of sets the player has. Having a moose trophy to hang on the wall is cool &amp;ndash; but having a fly-fishing rod in your hall AND a lobster trap in your living room AND an anchor in your cellar is even cooler. Right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, collectors always run the risk of crossing paths with the village ne&amp;rsquo;er-do-well, and Downeast Dealer is no different. Keep your collection safe from the Thief. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, he may run off with your prized heirloom chest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
