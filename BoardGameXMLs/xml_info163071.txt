			<description>A mix of Backgammon and Quoridor, with very high production values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a square lattice, with pieces on the squares and &amp;quot;walls&amp;quot; in the ridges. &lt;br/&gt;The two player sit at a 90&amp;deg; angle, rather than facing each other, i.e. one player moves left-to-right, while the other bottom-to-top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to move the pieces on the other side of the board while blocking the opponent with the walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both pieces and walls are moved according to the throw of a 4-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
