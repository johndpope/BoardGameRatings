			<description>Variable Initiative Point Role Playing System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VIP stands for Variable Initiative Point. The system gets its name because in the VIP System all actions have an initiative point cost. And how you spend these points will directly affect your play order in future rounds. Spend 5 Inititive to swing that warhammer around, and the rogue with the dagger is probably going to be acting before you next round, of course if you hit him with that bad boy... well, he's much less likely to be fighting back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflicts are resolved in Initiative Rounds that last approximately 10 seconds in game time. Each Initiative Round could be made up of any number of Combat Rounds. A combat round is a cycle through every character involved in a given conflict, with each acting in some manner. They may do as much as they want and spend as much of there initiative as they choose but, they must stop as soon as they have to make a roll, or cause damage to any Player or NPC. The next round there initiative order will be determined by their actions this round. This continues until all players and NPC's are reduced to zero or less Initiative. Then everyone rolls initiative again. If you had a negative initiative at the end of the last Initiative Round, the penalty carries over to the new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are made up of several factors; Attributes, Skills, Traits, and Effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
