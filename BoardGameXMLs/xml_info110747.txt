			<description>The Sproutz: Race to the Stage is an education board game that teaches children about nutrition, exercise and growth hormone deficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is simple: draw a card, answer a question and if you are correct, move that many spaces. Players collect tokens as they land on specific spaces that can be used as a tiebreaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first person to make it to the stage while making sure you have more tokens than anyone else who might also make it to the stage on their last turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
