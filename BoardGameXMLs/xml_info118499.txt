Each side of the duet has pictures and words that go with the other half, and each duet is numbered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards are dealt out.  On your turn, you pull a card from the hand of the player on your left.  After this, if you have a completed duet of 2 cards, you can lay down one duet per turn.
