							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crazy Queens</name>
									
			<description>Classic card game fun for the whole family!&lt;br/&gt;Outwit your opponents and attempt to score the most points possible in this family friendly game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Queen of Spades is worth 10 times what the other queens are worth, and with only three available to collect it's a crazy fight to the finish. Play every person for themselves, or divide into two even teams. To play cards into your/your team's bank that aren't already in play, you need to have a minimum of three of a kind or two with one wild card. Once a collection is started for a number in the bank, each player of your team that follows can add as many cards to the bank as they may have in their hand. For example, if your team could not yet collect queens because no one had laid any in the bank, and on your turn, you put three queens in the bank, the next player in your team to play, can add a single queen on top of that pile. Every card laid in your team's bank counts as points for your team, while every card remaining in your hand counts against your team at the end of the hand. The goal is to be the first team to get to 1600 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's your playing style? Do you hold on to those high scoring cards, never discarding them? Do you play with risky strategy, only banking three of a kind when you actually have five? Will you end the round and catch the other team with handfuls of cards to count against them? This game can get as crazy and entertaining as you make it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This deck of 162 cards (three unique and custom designed decks of 54 playing cards including Jokers) will allow play for 2-8 players. The instructive rule book is user friendly and easy to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, you can split the cards into three standards playing decks to use playing your other favorite card games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
