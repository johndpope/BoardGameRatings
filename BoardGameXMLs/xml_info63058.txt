							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horror Rules: Character Power Cards</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Cards Could Save Your Life...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Admit it -- it's happened to you too. You're right in the thick of the Horror Rules action: the 8ft tall nightmare just jumped out of the woods, people are screaming, bullets flying, claws slicing, someone pees their pants and passes out... and then BAM! It happens -- the Bad Guy rolls a 1 (or heck, with this thing even a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7), you miss a dodge and you're dead. As you tear up your character sheet and reach for another one, you suddenly remember your Character Power. D'oh! It could've saved your life! Well, don't fret -- your days of forgetfulness are over. With the Horror Rules Character Power Cards, forgetting your Character Power is a thing of the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
