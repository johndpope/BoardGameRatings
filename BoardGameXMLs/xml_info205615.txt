			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly five years have passed since your crew led a mutiny against you, Captain Oscar Locke. After surviving the island and the unfortunate souls who landed there to bury their treasure, you have set sail back to your old pillaging grounds, the West Indies. A little birdy has informed you that your former crew has split up and now five of them are leading their own vessels. It&amp;rsquo;s time to take back what&amp;rsquo;s yours by any means possible. Whether you steal their treasure without them knowing and sail away or decide to send them to Davy Jones&amp;rsquo; locker afterwards, your goal is to collect all five treasures and return safely to the open water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SNM: CR is a free Print and Play solitaire game that relies on dice rolling to move both the player's ship, 5 other NPC ships, and to decide all combat. The goal of the game is collect all of the treasure held by the NPC ships without being sunk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
