			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game. Games are meant to be fun. This is a game about life. Lives are not necessarily fun. The fun of games about un-fun events often comes from the fact that these are not our lives. What If those truly are our lives? It sometimes helps to still play those games, for through playing those games we can tell ourselves our lives are nothing like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rules-light storytelling game focuses on developing a shared narrative among friends.  While its sister game The Friendship Game focuses on the good, happy portions of life, this game explores the other corners of relationships and life.  The games offer slightly different implementation details of the mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
