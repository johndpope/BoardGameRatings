			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;What you hold in your hand is a lot of love. Traveller is the great science-fiction role-playing game, and this document is part of that. What you are reading is part of the largest shared continuity in literature that was designed strictly for role-playing.  But due to the wide and disparate sources, it is very difficult for a new person to get their hands around what is Traveller. Even worse, some of us disagree as to what those elements are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By reading this timeline, you have become part of that unique group of people who have shared in the Traveller experience. It is my hope that this document helps you remain and participate, and contribute to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the way, my most enjoyable fan moment with Traveller: shortly after I did the very first version of this, I discovered a large package in my box. Much to my shock and amazement, it was addressed from Marc W. Miller, and contained notes on things I was missing. I&amp;rsquo;ve played many games, but Traveller still excites the fan boy in me. And that&amp;rsquo;s why I have continued working on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;This book contains only setting material, a timeline of Traveller history (prior to the Shattered Imperium) integrated from various editions of Traveller material.  There are no game mechanics or statistics in the book, so it can be used with any ruleset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
