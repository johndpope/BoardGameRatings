			<description>I-GR-Making is a dodgy trick-taking game with an idol group theme. From a deck of 24 cards, players draw 1-5 cards each to use for the trick-taking. The cards that remain in the deck decide how many rounds the game will last, and what rule each round will follow: highest wins, lowest wins, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the deck is finished, the game ends. Each player scores as many points as the cards of the color he has the most of, minus the value of the rest of his cards. This method of scoring, combined with the fact that having a small hand gives the player advantages, makes for a pretty weird game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
