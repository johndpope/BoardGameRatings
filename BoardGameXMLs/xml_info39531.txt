			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare yourselves! An exciting contect is about to begin, and the arena is yours.  The challenge?  FOLLOW THAT!, a pastime almost as amusing for spectators as it is the players in the fray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A word game which tests your reflexes and your memory, FOLLOW THAT! contains 600 categories covering just about every subject under the sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXAMPLE: The subject is Popular Movie Quotes.  Someone calls out &amp;quot;Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn&amp;quot; - if you follow up with &amp;quot;probably the best lager in the world&amp;quot; - you'll get the thumbs down for using a non sequitur, (something that simply doesn't follow).&lt;br/&gt;If you'd said &amp;quot;Make my day&amp;quot; you'd be laughing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A truly democratic game for three or more players (the more the merrier), the idea of FOLLOW THAT! is to stay in the fray and score more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3 or more players Age 7 to adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
