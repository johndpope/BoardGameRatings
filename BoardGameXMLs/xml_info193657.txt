							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sandwich Mix-Up</name>
									
			<description>Chef Dog is proud of his fabulous sandwiches that will have everyone drooling with hunger, but before he can deliver them, the monkeys have torn them apart and scattered them across the table. Who can reassemble and deliver more sandwiches?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandwich Mix-Up consists of forty &amp;quot;bread slices&amp;quot;, with twenty of these slices having raised areas that represent the sandwich fillings: cars, rubber ducks, butterflies &amp;mdash; you know, the types of things that dogs would use in sandwiches. The other twenty slices have indentations that match the shape of the fillings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, lay out all the bread slices with the filling sides face up and the indentations face down. At the same time, players start taking the face down slices and feeling the indentations to try to identify which fillings belong to this slice. If they think they know, they can grab that filling slice to try to complete the sandwich. If correct, they keep it; if not, they return the filling to the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever finishes the most sandwiches wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
