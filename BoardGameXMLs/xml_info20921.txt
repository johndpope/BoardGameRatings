			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turncoats is a game of espionage where allegiances can shift at any time during conflict. Players must outsmart their opponent and manipulate the neutral force (which both players have control over) to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fast-paced game combines strategy, luck and ingenuity to create a game that is fun and intriguing for people of all ages. The games concept is roughly based on the idea of a military conflict where two warring factions must manage the effect of a third force which can be influenced by either side. The French and Indian war is an example of a conflict similar to what players will encounter in Turncoats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
