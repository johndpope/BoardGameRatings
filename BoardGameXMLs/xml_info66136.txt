			<description>After playing the Recycle card game three or more times, players will be able to name all the recyclable items used in the Recycle card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players ask each other for cards that they need to make 3, or 4 of a kind. If the other players do not have the card in question, they must draw card from the remaining undealt cards in the middle of the table. Once three or four of the same value cards with same recyclable are obtained, the cards can be claimed by laying them down face up on the table. The first person to get rid of all their cards wins that hand and scores points for 3 and 4 of a kinds.&lt;br/&gt;The first person to reach 500 or more points is the winner. If more than one person reaches or goes over 500 points, the person with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;52 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
