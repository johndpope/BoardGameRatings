			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cozy nook of Lincoln, New Hampshire seems a safe place to live, nestled amidst beautiful and scenic lush mountainous landscapes, splashed with the green, yellow and red colors of late Fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the surrounding forests a dark secret beyond the comprehension and understanding of mere humanity waits patiently. And childhood innocence will be taken as its horrors are unleashed upon unsuspecting victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will they survive that which stalks the Clubhouse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Haunted Clubhouse is a lethal and harrowing Call of Cthulhu Role Playing adventure intended for two to four players over one or more gaming sessions. Players may utilize the supplied Pre-Generated characters or create their own characters to tackle the horrors that wait within these pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is written for a Modern Day setting but details are included allowing it to be easily adapted to the 1920s era. It can be utilized as a stand-alone adventure or inserted as a branch to an ongoing campaign. Caution, courage and quick thinking will be necessary to ensure survival is achieved in this deadly and dread inducing scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
