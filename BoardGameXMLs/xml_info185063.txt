							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">M.R.E. Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The M.R.E. Core Rules detail the generic, universal processes utilized in the MRE - Microcosm Roleplaying Engine game system.  Character creation is free-from, with characters having 2-12 Attributes; all characters have the same Attributes, so the decision of which to use is left to the GM.  Examples include:  Two Attributes (Body, Mind); Three Attributes (Body, Mind, Spirit); Four Attributes (Talent, Perceptiveness, Might, Sociability) and so forth.  Attributes are assigned an Attribute Magnitude, or performance level, ranging from 0 to 4, with 2 being typical.  Characters also have an assigned Role which is somewhat analogous to the more-traditional Class but functions primarily as a narrative tag denoting presumed ability.  Examples include:  &amp;quot;Agent ('Mulder' Style)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Agent ('007' Style)&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Mage ('Necromancer')&amp;quot;.  Roles are assigned a Role Magnitude to denote how adept the character is within the Role; ranks range from 1-3.  Characters may select 2-4 Roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One atypical aspect of the game focuses on Resources, and Detailed Tracking is suggested.  In this system every Attribute or Role use (except the very trivial) is assumed to dissipate some amount of applicable Resource.  Usually, Characters may expend additional Resource to gain a performance advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions are referred to as Tasks, and Task Resolution follows a similar pattern of base score plus 1d6 compared to a target difficulty.  Any Task may use a suitable Tool (if such is at hand) to give a performance bonus.  Characters gain Experience Points and spend them to increase Attribute Ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
