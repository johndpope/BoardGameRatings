							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Evolution of the Ebon Fur</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His Name is Nrak, But You Can Call Him...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...the Ebon Fur!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As evil endures, it grows and changes. So it is the case with the Ebon Fur - no longer truly Furry, not really a Slimey, but a new and horrible thing all of his own, dedicated to fear and pain in a way that nothing before him has ever been.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the fate of his victims and see what has become of Nrak since we last saw him... learn of his new and terrible powers, and see what lengths the Furries are prepared to go to in order to see that his threat is removed from the face of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game. It is a sequel to the supplement Rampage of the Ebon Fur, and like the original, draws heavily on material from Yiffy, Yaoi, and Yahooey! and Inner Darkness, as well as referencing Inner Darkness 2: The Depravity War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
