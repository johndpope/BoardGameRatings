			<description>Dark Ages skirmish rules for armies of up to around 30 figures, intended for Vikings, Saxons, Normans, Picts, Welsh, and Irish armies. Figures move and fight individually, but must remain within a command radius of their leader. Initiative is decided by drawing playing cards (one side plays red, the other black, with some cards triggering special events).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six sided and average dice are required, and each army figures are classified as one of the following: Lord, Warrior, Freeman, Armed peasant, Non-combatant. Heroes and berserkers can also appear when certain cards are turned over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Practical Wargamer magazine, May/June 1993 issue. The author acknowledges Howard Whitehouse's Long Serpent rules for sea battles as an inspiration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
