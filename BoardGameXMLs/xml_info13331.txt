			<description>The game box include : a totally black 3d 9x9 board , 18 red dice, 18 black dice and a manual.The dice have the French card symbols on their sides (hearts , diamonds , clubs  and spades) and are called knights. If the symbol is surrounded by a square it is called &amp;quot;prince&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar to chess in general concepts. To win you have to &amp;quot;catch the king&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;princes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;knights&amp;quot; represented by dice.&lt;br/&gt;You move &amp;quot;knights&amp;quot; by one space at a time, rolling them on the board. &amp;quot;Princes&amp;quot; can move, rolling or not, by any space number.&lt;br/&gt;You may capture an opponent piece when your dice shows the same symbol of the opponent's one on his top and when they are in line.&lt;br/&gt;In Italy the game was published in 80' by Mondadori Giochi  but it was probably distributed in all Europe as on the back of the game box there is a short description in many languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
