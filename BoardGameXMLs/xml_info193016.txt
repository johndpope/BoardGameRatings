			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game track a few scores during play, including Social Competence and Intoxication Level, though all characters start equally in scores.  Players also draw a few cards that represent &amp;quot;Powers&amp;quot; that can be played during the game.  Powers vary widely in effect.  The game takes place as a series of conversations about insects, held among the characters who are notable intellectuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be noted the game is published in an awkward format as a series of posts to an online forum.  Posts are not made in sequential reading order, however, and additionally include several references to external sites for background and setting information.  The various posts can be located by searching on the game's name as a post tag.  Interested players should look for these principle game posts (in approximate reading order):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Morpho Londinium (includes internal links)&lt;br/&gt;     Morpho Londinium: Overview&lt;br/&gt;     Morpho Londinium: Rules&lt;br/&gt;     Cast of Characters&lt;br/&gt;     Morpho Londinium: Powers&lt;br/&gt;     London of 1699 (includes internal and external links)&lt;br/&gt;     Designer&amp;rsquo;s Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
