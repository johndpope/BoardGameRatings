			<description>A spectacularly mysterious murder mystery in a literal and figurative underground circus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cirque Noir is a narrative game about circus performers solving a crime in their enclosed circus arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes control of a circus performer of the name-sake Cirque Noir, an underground circus in your country after it has been normalized. The performers are some of the few people left that are unregistered and do not follow the grey-samish lifestyle of the norms. Each performer has a few Feats, an Acquaintance, a Grudge and their own Drive for being in the Cirque.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the last show, someone was murdered. At least for one player-controlled character, there is no way that this was an accident. They lock down the facility and no-one may leave. There are a few primes present and a whole crowd of grey, nameless norms. They cannot call the Normalizers, of course, so the performers have to investigate the murder themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the investigation, performers will find clues to what happened and why and whodunnit. There will also be action sequences and of course questioning of suspects. Possibly, there will also be quarrels between the performers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, there is no game master or similar facilitator. Instead, the actions of the players will determine which of the suspects is the murderer. The game resolves when the murderer is found and either is held accountable for their crime(s) or makes their escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will (probably) need at least three players, as many sheets of paper, a pen and a stack of index cards to play this game properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
