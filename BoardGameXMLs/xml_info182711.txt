			<description>Welcome Minions! is a game of friendly bickering, plotting, and planning. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen henchmen and mooks argue with one another while bumbling the simplest missions, then you&amp;rsquo;ll know how to play this game. Please your master and earn his favor while you sabotage and plot against your fellow minions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play is a deck of cards, and 3-10 people who don&amp;rsquo;t mind plotting against one another! A great party game for all ages! Games can last 20 minutes, or go on all night. Let your creativity and fiendishness combine to create a fun and whacky night of crazy adventures! Welcome Minions! is very simple, and easy to play! For ages 7 to 97. Note: This game is unfit for human consumption, and should only be played by Minions, Mooks, or Henchmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the perfect game to introduce someone to storytelling, or to play while you're waiting for the other players to arrive to the table. A nice change of pace from Apples to Apples, and offers more structure than a game of &amp;quot;Everyone Is John&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
