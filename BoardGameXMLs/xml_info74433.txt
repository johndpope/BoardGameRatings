			<description>&amp;quot;Darkmere: The Nightmare's Begun is an action adventure computer game developed by Zero Hour Software and published by Core Design Ltd. in 1993. It is Zero Hour's only title to date. Core Design went on to publish a less-well received pseudo-sequel to Darkmere in 1994 called Dragonstone, on Amiga  and Amiga CD32. (...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of Prince Ebryn, son of King Gildorn, as he attempts to solve the mystery of the &amp;quot;Darkmere&amp;quot;, a literal darkness that has descended on the kingdom bringing with it monsters such as orcs and dragons, who slew or took away many villagers. The quest begins in &amp;quot;the village&amp;quot; (which is never named), and requires the player to perform quests in order to escape its walls. Later levels see Ebryn travelling through forests and the lair of the orcs on his way to find Malthar the Mage, whom he hopes will help banish the Darkmere.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Darkmere,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
