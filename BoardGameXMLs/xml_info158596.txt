			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight a dragon. Steal treasure. Don&amp;rsquo;t get eaten. The dragon hunter&amp;rsquo;s creed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes have tracked a dragon back to its lair. Now they battle the beast while snatching up treasures. They can steal the good stuff from one another while the fight goes on. All the while the dragon fights back swallowing heroes and treasures that slowly move towards the beast&amp;rsquo;s fiery stomach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hungry Dragon is a 54 card deck fighting/stealing game that includes character, weapon, treasure, and dragon part cards. Players control the dragon or a team of four heroes. The heroes move in close to fight, hang back a little to snatch treasure, or stay safe out of range of the dragon&amp;rsquo;s claws. Each turn players get a free move and may make one action. Their chance of success is based on how much noise they make. Make a roar and the roll is okay. Brag about how well you do and the chance of succeeding is great. Prepare to make some noise, this is a boisterous game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the dragon is dead (or escapes) the player with the most valuable treasure wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Amazon and Pirate versions of the game add together to form a single bigger game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
