							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Portes, Monstres &amp; Tr√©sors (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Translated Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an incurable nostalgic that keeps their relic like the precious &amp;quot;red box&amp;quot;, a young gamer curious to know what the elders played, or just someone who wants a simple but complete medieval fantasy role playing games? Portes, Monstres &amp;amp; Tr&amp;eacute;sors (Doors, Monsters &amp;amp; Treasures) is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free and complete game published as a PDF is a translation and adaptation of the Open Gaming Licensed Labyrinth Lord, written by Daniel Proctor and published by Goblinoid Games. As a model, PMT emulates the mechanisms of the B/X version of D&amp;amp;D (the one published in 1981). Connoisseurs will notice that we have added two optional rules: the unique saving throw and increasing armor class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why not make an official French version of Labyrinth Lord?&lt;br/&gt;Just because negotiations with Daniel Proctor on the Labyrinth Lord license have failed. While most of Labyrinth Lord (text and maps) is Open Gaming Licensed, the brand &amp;quot;Labyrinth Lord&amp;quot; and the layout are not, which is why we have adopted a new layout and found a new name for this version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This second edition enhances the layout to be closer to the B/X version, add a revised introduction, and more and better illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
