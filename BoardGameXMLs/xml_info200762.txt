							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Castle of Blackwood Moors</name>
									
			<description>From the Kickstarter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In the City States of Middenlund, lies the small hamlet of Argax. A very nondescript place that most people would have forgotten about completely if not for one thing; it is the closest pocket of civilization to a castle of a bygone age. Now lost deep within the tangle of the Blackwood Moors, adventurers come from far and wide to delve into its secrets. None have returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a youth of Argax, you recently trounced some local bullies and with more than a little false bravado, the idea gets stuck in your head that you will able to defeat the castle when so many others have been engulfed by it. When the castle is finally reached, you discover that it is already occupied, but not in the way that you thought...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
