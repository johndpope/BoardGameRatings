			<description>From the document's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The man known as Frankie &amp;lsquo;Twice Pipe&amp;rsquo; Whitaker waited in a run down section of the Persephone spaceport silent as a ghost. His hand rested on the butt of the cut-down shotgun that was the source of his nickname as he watched a young man approach. The new arrival looked around, oblivious to Frankie&amp;rsquo;s presence, trying to keep up a brave front despite not seeing his contact anywhere. He took up a reasonably defensible position near some solidly built crates and waited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Good spot young &amp;lsquo;un,&amp;quot; Frankie said aloud. &amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;d say you&amp;rsquo;ve got a future in the business, but that might make ya&amp;rsquo;ll&amp;rsquo;s head bigger than it needs ta be.&amp;quot; The young man smiled; if he was surprised, Frankie was impressed by how well he hid his reaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook.&lt;br/&gt;third in the Word on the Street series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was available as a download, (free bonus content), from the publisher website. The document, when downloaded, came with the odd gray shade and unaligned cuts seen in the representative image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
