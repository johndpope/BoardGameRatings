			<description>Authors description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Acrobats vs Mobsters&amp;quot; is a micro RPG, that fits in your pocket and allows you to take on the Mob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010 the FBI had found itself penetrated by criminal organizations with more money than most governments. The result was an FBI unable to cope with the mob. By presidential order the FBI secretly established the &amp;quot;Black Squads&amp;quot;, secret independent groups of undercover cops who only took orders from the top FBI officials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such squad was the &amp;quot;Calloni Troupe&amp;quot;. Travelling the country as an acrobatic circus troupe, these third generation Italians are the most dedicated, close-knit, group of anti-corruption, anti-organised-crime operatives. Performing for crowds in the evenings, and fighting crime by day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acrobats vs Mobsters is a micro RPG that prints on a single sheet of paper and folds into a little booklet using the &amp;quot;PocketMod&amp;quot; system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
