			<description>From website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes on my Call of Cthulhu WWI game, the Crackpot Index and a new PA game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry, folks, for the lateness of the issue. As I've mentioned before, I work full time and attend graduate school for a Masters Degree in Engineering. Spring quarter, my class really poured it on for the last few weeks. I just received my grade: an A (GPA 3.8)! Go me! And the professor said that I had the highest grade in the class for people taking the class for credit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
