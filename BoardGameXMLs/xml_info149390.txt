			<description>Step into the combat-boots of the eponymous Chainsaw Warrior &amp;ndash; a former special-forces solider who has been cybernetically modified by the military to undertake the most dangerous covert missions. Having quit black-ops missions some time ago he has now received emergency call-up request as the last hope for a city on the brink of destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New York has only an hour left to live! A rare and strange phenomena known as &amp;lsquo;spatial warping&amp;rsquo; has resulted in a dimensional breach from our world into a nightmare space beyond, though which have poured legions of zombies and mutants. This particular spatial warp is believed to be controlled by a singular power, known as Darkness. Experts believe that the creatures may be defending the dimensional breach whilst Darkness completes its plans to pull the city though into the beyond. What options remain? Air strikes have failed, incursions by troops have failed, nerve gas bombs have failed. All that is left is one man, enhanced to survive in extreme conditions, yet facing almost overwhelming odds&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
