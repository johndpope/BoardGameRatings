			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What is TRILOGY like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three groups square off on a triangular battlefield. Your goal is to eliminate your opponents' warriors by strategically attacking them with your men. To accomplish this, you must engage the services of the neutral team (also called the Robot Team). Beware! Because your opponent gains control of the neutral robots on his turn. Both opponents move toward the center power source. Here they many choose to regenerate their forces or decide upon a strategic super attack. Look out! The unseen move can propel you or destroy you. Never give up... comebacks are always possible. Maybe you will be the next TRILOGY master.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a team of six markers, and there is a third &amp;quot;team,&amp;quot; that is the neutral robot. Each turn, players can move one of their pieces and one of the robot pieces. Pieces can move or jump other pieces. Jumping an opponents' piece or a robot piece eliminates that piece. Moving to the center dot on the board allows a player to generate another piece or take an extra turn. The first player to eliminate the opponent's team wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published by &amp;quot;Ellis and Frazier Games&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
