							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reign of Evil</name>
									
			<description>It is the year 2025 and the entire world has fallen under the reign of a group of super villains known only as &amp;quot;The Collective&amp;quot;. People are oppressed and the world has fallen deep into darkness with little hope of even a glimpse of light. In this dark world, a group of superheroes has risen to combat the villains and retake the world from their grasp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each mission is deadly, as both villains and superheroes must enter combat, defend themselves, and collect the previous element &amp;quot;levinium&amp;quot; or face destruction. Levinium is the heroes's hope of taking down the villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reign of Evil is a print-and-play game in the genre of superheroes and supervillians. The game uses a card mechanic, and no dice, in order to perform combat. It plays quickly with minimal down time for players. Players move figures around the board to collect levinium until all wound markers are exhausted, until the deck runs out, or all levinium pieces are gone. Alternatively, players can play timed games. On their turns, players draw a hand of cards that contain a mix of Move and Action cards. Using these cards, players move around the board and take various actions, such as combat or collecting levinium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
