			<description>3D-print-and-play your own set on Sourceforge: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/woodwars3d/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/woodwars3d/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wood Wars 3D is a highly accessible table top strategy game for all developed by Joe Larson. In Wood Wars 3D, players build armies by taking race heads and putting them on class bodies to mix-and-match pawns. Then players take turns moving herds of pawns using measured distances, and attacking each other, simulating artillery attacks with marble rolls. It extends the rules of the original Wood Wars with detailed 3D printed modular minis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wood Wars 3D is an open sourced, light, strategy game, rooted in classic strategy game and manufacture by the future with 3D printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the dawn of time in an enchanted woods where no man lives there was a spring of sweet water. The animals that drank from that spring found themselves possessed of intelligence. But an evil saw this and tainted the water so that the creatures would also gain pride, greed, and form similar to man. And by so doing, soon the woods knew war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
