							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rifinti Cliff Dwelling</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure Site Web Enhancement for Races of the Wild&lt;br/&gt; As noted in Races of the Wild, the Rifinti are fairly typical as raptorans go. To uninitiated visitors, however, they may seem decidedly odd-sleeping during the day, staying up all night, holding endless debates about seemingly trivial matters, and disdaining wealth and personal ornament. In addition, their communal living and working arrangements are practically unknown in other cultures. Odder still, the Rifinti seem distrustful of strangers, yet unstintingly kind to beings in need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rifinti Cliff Dwelling is an adventure site that can be dropped into any area that has a mountain valley, alpine lakes, and considerable forest cover. Though the Rifinti tend to shun strangers, those who seek out this area can find a variety of adventures here. As always, feel free to adapt the material presented here as you see fit to make it work with your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
