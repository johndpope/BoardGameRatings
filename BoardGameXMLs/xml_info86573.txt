			<description>All Time 9 is a baseball board game that includes 160 of some of the all time great players in baseball history.  &lt;br/&gt;The statistical accuracy of the game lets players play out games using these all time greats from every era, up to the modern age of baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanic that sets it apart is the initial rolling of dice by the player controlling the pitcher, with a follow-up dice roll by the batter, in response to what the pitcher did.  This accurately recreates the pitcher/batter duel, as opposed to other baseball boardgames that resolves all action in a single dice roll, with no input from one or the other of the 2 players involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
