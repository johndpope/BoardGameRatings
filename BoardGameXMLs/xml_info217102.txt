			<description>Heard the News is a money market simulation (corporate stocks and currency exchanges in each of five countries). Game play consists of 10 rounds, each of which includes four phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Read the news (from one of six pre-arranged sets of cards).  This news tells global facts as well as specific information about each region of the world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Each player moves around up to two of their stock tokens (they have 4)--selling and buying.  Their actions alter the prices of the stocks and/or currencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Do step 2 again&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Turn over the news card to see how each of the five corporate stocks changed (up a little, down a little, or stays put).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's it.  Play 10 rounds, liquidate stocks and money holdings, and see who has the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
