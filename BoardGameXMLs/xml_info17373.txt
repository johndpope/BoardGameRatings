			<description>From the Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These rules link together my already published rules for the early Middle Ages God's Acre and for the 16th and 17th centuries Musketeer. All three sets are mutually compatible as far as layout and systems are concerned and base sizes are standardized throughout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wargames in the Hundred Years War period and the War of the Roses have been marginally popular for some years and my hope in publishing these rules is that this interest can be widened to the more general European and indeed British wars of the period. Wargames armies of Hussites and Burgundians etc. would be welcome newcomers to the wargames tables and the rules readily accommodate the armies of Samurai and Chinese, Russians and Mongols already being built up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules cover only field battles, as sieges during this period were very complex affairs and demand a set of rules all to themselves. However there is no reason why the rules cannot be used to fight actions resulting from sallies or relief attempts or indeed assaults on wagon forts or barricaded towns. They are ideally fitted into a campaign.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
