			<description>Easy, fast and very funny mini-game board brilliant for whole family. It is dedicated for one person and more - limited only by the place on the board. You have to play against the game's mechanism holding very simple rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the box - you will find a simple colored board with drawing looped route.&lt;br/&gt;Throw a dice and use cars (represented by pawns) to move them as long/far as you can. At the beginning yours cars have a pool of point, but the longer you go, yours cars wears out itself (losing points).&lt;br/&gt; Every lap, you get extra points for necessary repairing. When you lose all your points, it means for you - game over. So, you have to care about your car. &lt;br/&gt;There are a few fields with surprises on the route. Good and bad for your own or your opponent's cars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, the question is: how far you will drive? Have a fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
