							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Loot</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are about to enter the biggest castle of the most terrifying dragon. Only the fastest but the most vigilant hero will know fame and glory. Others will probably never leave the castle alive&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle Loot is a competitive game in which players rely on their reflexes and some judgment to win. One of the four characters, who is greatly inspired by RPG video games, is placed in the middle of the table with all his four equipment tiles surrounding him. The torch will light his path (and allow you to steal a gem from the bag of another player), his sword will be necessary to defend himself against the dragon, his bag will store the gems found and finally, his key will open all the treasure chests that you will find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, each round, a card is revealed by placing it facing up in the middle of the four equipment tiles. Then, players rush to grab the corresponding equipment of that card.&lt;br/&gt;A dragon? Grab the sword!&lt;br/&gt;A treasure chest? Grab the key!&lt;br/&gt;Gems? Grab the bag!&lt;br/&gt;Stairs? Grab the torch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each equipment tile has its own specific effect when it is grabbed at the right moment. But, be careful! Some cards are disguised and contain traps or spiders on them&amp;hellip;be quick, but stay vigilant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
