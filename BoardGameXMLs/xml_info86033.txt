			<description>From publisher website: Several success-oriented would-be entrepreneurs argue, suck up and lie for the highest position in the company. The 83 old boss is searching for a successor with voting majority in the supervisory board and good references. He who plays skillful and with diplomacy can prevent the other players to get the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player tries to get influence on the supervisory board by playing up to 2 lobby-cards per turn to secure their support. Who has the highest lobby value at the supervisory board will get their vote. Other lobby cards can be used to strengthen one's references or ruin the references of the oponents.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game there is a final valuation on both reference and influence on the supervisory board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
