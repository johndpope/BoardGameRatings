			<description>This expansion allows you to reach the Drop Zone by landing on the beach with the rest of the boys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It allows the players to play a mini-game, before the regular game, to simulate the beach landings. All players have a set of Events and place their figurine on the special &amp;quot;Beach&amp;quot; Location. They start when their feet touch the cold water, then they must decide when to advance to the bluffs and reach the (relative) safety of the Drop Zone. All this time, they will be exposed to enemy fire and shelling. Who said landing was going to be easy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains 40 &amp;ldquo;Beach Event&amp;rdquo; cards (enough for 4 players), 1 Special Operative (The Hero), and 1 big location (The Beach).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
