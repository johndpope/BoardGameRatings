							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stupid Fantasy Laws, Vol. 5</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on both the superstitions of the past and the inactive laws still written on the books throughout the real world comes Stupid Fantasy Laws, Volume 5. In this role playing product you will find a dozen different laws that are based on the erratic judgment of rulers, the irrational fears of villagers, oppressive social customs, and the unusual outcomes of very seldom occurring situations. From requiring every family living in the village to own a raft or a boat to the punishments of being caught carrying around a patched bag or sack there are a dozen laws in this volume of Stupid Fantasy Laws designed to cause local villagers and adventuring characters alike a considerable amount of trouble, grief, and hardship. So much trouble, grief, and hardship, in fact, that it is liable to keep the adventurers from wandering into a nearby village or town for weeks to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
