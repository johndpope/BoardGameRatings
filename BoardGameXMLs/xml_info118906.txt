			<description>The Jackie Chan Adventures video game is based upon the Jackie Chan Adventures cartoon.

The eight demons were banished to the Demon Netherworld by eight Chinese immortals using the magic of the Pan Ku Box. In present times, the Dark Hand, led by Valmont, are using the Pan Ku Box to unleash the demons upon the world. However, Jackie Chan, his niece Jade Chan, and their Uncle are willing to stop the evil demons from returning to the planet.
