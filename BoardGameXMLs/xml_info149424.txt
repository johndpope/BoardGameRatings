			<description>In the action-adventure Horn, immerse yourself in an intricate world filled with entertaining characters, thought provoking puzzles, exciting combat, and extraordinary situations, all controllable by touch gestures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based loosely on the Old English tales of King Horn, you play as a young blacksmith's apprentice named Horn who wakes up to finds your village and lands over run by large fantastic, and sometimes humorous, monsters. It is revealed these creatures are actually the people and animals from your village transformed by a curse, and you alone have the power to free them. On your incredible adventure you carry the loud-mouthed head of one such fantastic creature with you - a somewhat uncooperative and ill-tempered but grudgingly helpful sidekick. Along with this new companion you must use your sword, crossbow, trusty musical horn, and wits to explore the lands, defeat the enemies, and solve puzzles in your quest to undo the curse that engulfs your homeland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: IGN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
