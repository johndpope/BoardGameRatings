			<description>The flat magnetic marbles game. Set includes instructions for 10 different games. Contains: 1 Rat Fink magnetic board, 2 Thwacks for tossing the marbles and 12 flat magnetic marbles called Thwarbles. Instructions for assorted target games are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tourni Thwarbles - Toss the thwarbles. The object of the game is to collect the most Thwarbles&amp;trade; by touching or landing on previously tossed pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick off ThWack! - Players place nine Thwarbles onto the board with one in the center and eight along the edges on small ThWack! dots. The Thwacks! on the edge can be placed in a position where they extend partially over the edge to increase difficulty. Players toss their ThWack! attempting to land it on a Thwarble. If successful, the player removes that Thwarble from the board. Play continues until all pieces have been removed. The player with the most Thwarbles at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ThWack! ThWarbles - Players pitch and stick their ThWarbles to the board attempting to hit target areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RatFink Fly Swat - Players toss ThWarbles to tag ten fly images on the board. Whichever player manages to cover the most flies with his or her ThWarble wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rotation - Players lay out four to six ThWarbles in a clock-like pattern or &amp;quot;rack&amp;quot; around the edges of the board. Players then call which ThWarble they will hit. If they miss, it's the other player's turn. If they hit, they call another ThWarble, continuing until they miss. Winner completes the pattern first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chip Shot - One player begins by tossing a ThWarble onto the board, which represents a golf hole. The players attempt to tag that piece in the fewest number of shots. The player who takes the fewest number of throws or &amp;quot;strokes&amp;quot; to hit either 9 or 18 &amp;quot;holes&amp;quot;, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thwack 'Em - Four Thwarbles are placed on the board. Players pitch a thwarble trying to cover one on the board with his own thwarble. (If so he removes both thwarbles.) Player with the most thwarbles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ThWack! ThWarbles 2 - Players determine how many rounds they will play, how many ThWarbles each player will toss out to start each round, and the distance that each player must toss from. Players see who can toss their Thwarbles closest to the edge without them falling off. Player who lands the most thwarbles closest to the edge wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
