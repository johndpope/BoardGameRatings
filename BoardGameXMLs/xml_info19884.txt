			<description>A card game designed by German Free Jazz musician and graphic artist Peter Brotzmann.  Set contains rules and 23 cards with original abstract images by the artist.  Can be played as a card game, but when this was originally released at a gallery performance hands of cards were dealt out to the musicians in Brotzmann's Chicago Tentet to perform music based on what they saw on the cards.  First released in a signed and numbered edition of 200, there is a subsequent non-limited release.  Cards can be combined with Peter Brotzmann's other card game called &amp;quot;Images&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrates with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Images&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
