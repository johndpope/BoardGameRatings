							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">How Game Are You? Adult Couples Intimacy Edition</name>
									
			<description>How Game Are You is a series of games designed to broach difficult conversations but in a fun and inclusive way. Players learn, have fun, converse and connect with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first game is targeted at Couples seeking more emotional and physical intimacy. It is tasteful, above the line and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are categorised as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Q and A (Question and you Answer)&lt;br/&gt;     Would You Rather? (Answer or act out, or lose places)&lt;br/&gt;     True or False? (Trivia style)&lt;br/&gt;     Trust And Touch (Blindfold guessing)&lt;br/&gt;     Name If Game (Picture cards to name what it is)&lt;br/&gt;     Double or Dance (Double points for next card)&lt;br/&gt;     Do Or Dote (Personal Challenge cards selected at the end of the game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards 1 - 5 are also ranked 1, 2 or 3 chili's to identify the difficulty and lower or higher points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can be one couple or two couples playing against each other. The 200 card deck is split into two, allowing people to choose which card to play and the likely difficulty (chili rank) . Once played you move your marker the respective moves on the board to be first to the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The finisher then selects a 'Do or Dote' card for themself, and they also choose a card for the losing player. Each card has an activity they must complete within 14 days OR they have to give extra special attention to the other person, in whatever reasonable way they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game is designed to last 30 - 60 minutes depending on how much extra conversation ensues about the cards. The 200 cards should give about 5 - 7 unique games, but it can be played multiple times the way many of the questions are written, and still be interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game content has been professionally reviewed by a psychologist for suitability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
