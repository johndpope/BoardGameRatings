							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Occultism</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Shadows of Esteren add-on, intended for Game Leaders, focuses on occultism. Who are the representatives of this strange science? How are they organized? What do they seek? Beside the mystical powers of the Demorth&amp;egrave;n and of the priests of the Temple, is there another source of supernatural power? In exploring these questions, the Characters will face mysteries that may shake their innermost convictions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Occultism in Tri-Kazel&lt;br/&gt;This introductory chapter is a complete overview of occultism in Tri-Kazel. Leaders will find many details about the skills of occultists, the forbidden arts of sorcerers, or the mysterious visionary powers of mediums. New Disciplines are introduced, as well as additional rules on sanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Circle of Emergence&lt;br/&gt;The second chapter describes a characteristic occult organization: its modes of operation, its objectives, and its core members. Whether the Circle of Emergence is intended to become the PC's patron or their mortal enemy, this game aid is certain to be valuable for Leaders who wish to bring occultism to the forefront of their campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A Tidy Room&lt;br/&gt;When a young girl from a low-class district, enchanting and beloved by all, disappears, the locals are in a commotion. Searches are quickly organized: people comb through vacant lots, back streets and dumping grounds. Even the sewers and canals are explored over the course of several days... to no avail. &amp;quot;A Tidy Room&amp;quot; is a large scenario written by Iris that will confront the Player Characters with occult and supernatural dangers. It comes with many game aids, including a comprehensive description of the scenario's locale: the Weavers' Disctrict, a perfect setting for any game in an urban environment. Finally two new creatures are included: the Bogeyman and the Diwelank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
