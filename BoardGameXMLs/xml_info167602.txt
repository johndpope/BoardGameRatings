			<description>Three Kingdoms is a turn-based, strategy card game in which players - playing as one of the major kingdoms/factions - compete to control the most spaces on the board.  Using elements of both Hand Management and Area Control, players are rewarded for both their ability to optimize actions and by strategically placing Unit Cards to gain points.  Some luck is involved through both drawing cards and unit placement, but players who can master their decks can dominate the battlefield..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each kingdom/faction contains a set of 18 cards.  Unit Cards are placed on the Board and determine the end of game (once all of the spaces are occupied, the game is over) and the scoring (capturing other units or occupying spaces.  Strategy Cards allow for creating combinations and rule bending.  The 'Board' is made up of Terrain Cards and can be configured to any shape or design - presenting a new set of challenges, potential strategies, and time limit for each new game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are limited to 1 action per turn: Draw 1 Card or Play 1 Card. But, certain cards allow for the creation of combinations and special rule bending - creating a lot of nuance and strategy as the game progresses.  TK is based on the Three Kingdoms period of China and the historical-fiction book, 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms,' by Luo Guanzhong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
