			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this installment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A MYSTERIOUS ARISTOCRAT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A MERCENARY LEGION!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AN ARMY OF AUTOMATONS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A DEVIOUS LORD OF ASSASSINS... ON A MISSION OF CONQUEST!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;THE ORB OF HYPERBOREA! For millennia it has been the plaything of cultists and kings. It has shaped the course of empires greater than modern man has ever seen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Generations of wise men and would-be conquerors have tried to puzzle out its secrets. Adventurers such as yourself have ventured to the darkest corners of the Earth for fragments&amp;mdash;fragments&amp;mdash;of the Priest-Kings&amp;rsquo; forgotten lore. They could sense the power slumbering within the Orb, but no matter what they tried, no matter how much blood they spilled, it refused to obey them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you know why they failed? Because the Orb was waiting for the right person to unlock it. It is a relic of an age that respected no laws, a time when men of courage and ruthless spirit could shape the world to suit their desires. A world where a man could spill so much blood that he was no different from a god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;That world will soon be reborn. I will wake the power of the Orb and use it to unleash a legion of steel and fire that will crush the petty empires of the world! I will grind the great nations of Earth beneath my heel, and mankind will bow before the might of Korga!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A new age is dawning, my friend. A pity you will not live to see it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sinister aristocrat with a shadowy past and bent on conquest and destruction! From his secret fortress on a tiny Greek isle, he recruits&amp;mdash;or presses into service&amp;mdash;the brave and the ruthless. He commands the Fekete Sereg, a deadly band of mercenaries. His allies include a pirate queen and smuggler. Armed with a mystic Hyperborean artifact, he strikes forth from the bridge of THE KRAKEN, a skyscraper-sized submersible that can also walk on land! Among his weapons: The Iron Hussars, ancient war machines that obey his every command!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
