			<description>Subtitle: Roleplaying of fabulous - even bestial - nature&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be an animal. To howl at the moon as a wolf, to roam the woods as a bear, to scale the trees as a squirrel, or even to cut through the waves as an otter. And not any ordinary animal either, but one from the beloved fables of the Grimm brothers, for example. Although you retain a normal animal appearance, you can be smart, conniving, just, ruthless, resourceful, and whatever the animals were portrayed as in these tales. You can also use tools if you are dexterous enough, move with not only four but with two legs also, and perform feats usually associated with humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is inspired by and designed to make use of the enchanting world of fables. Therefore, it can be quite far from reality. Although the animals' physical qualities have been made to reflect those of their real-life counterparts as well as possible, some liberties have been taken to serve the fact that this is a game. All animals in this game's world are roughly as intelligent as humans would be. They can also use tools to some extent, while still having arms useable for walking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on the assumption of &amp;quot;why not&amp;quot;, so strictly following the rules of realism is not a concern. More important is to attain the atmosphere of fables and be able to produce sessions and campaigns that reflect their world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
