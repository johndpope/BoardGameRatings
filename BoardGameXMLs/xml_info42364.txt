							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of the Sixes</name>
									
			<description>Each player gets six dice and begins each round by rolling all of them and matching any sixes with his opponent's sixes. Each player then has the option either to match any of his dice that total six with any of his opponent's dice or to re-roll his unmatched dice. The re-rolling continues until one player has played all his dice, at which point his opponent gets one more roll, and the round ends. Score zero, one, or two points for each match, depending upon the combinations used. Play until one player reaches either sixty or a number whose digits add up to six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
