			<description>From the Invisible City Productions website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remembering those matches rewards you with some strategy for two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To end the game with more tokens than everyone else. You do this by turning cards of the same rank face-up during your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A poker deck (with the Jokers removed).&lt;br/&gt;    * About 30 tokens for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, select two cards and look at them. If the two cards are the same rank (like two Fives) and are both Black, show the cards to the other players and choose a player to return that many tokens to the Bank. If the two cards are the same rank and are both Red, show the cards to the other players and choose a player (including yourself) to gain that many tokens from the Bank. If the two cards are the same rank and are different colors, show the cards to the other players and refer to the Mixed Chart [which is included in the rules.] Once the effect has resolved, set the cards aside in the discard pile and end your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the two cards do not match, put them back in their original spots, face-up. You can choose to put one or both of them back face-down, but you must give one token to the Bank for each card that you don't reveal. Once you've made your decision and shown (or not shown) your cards, your turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you run out of tokens, you're out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game emds when only one player has tokens left, or when all possible matches have been made. If you have the most tokens at the end of the game, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
