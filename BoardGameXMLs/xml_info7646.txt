							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Credibility Gap</name>
									
			<description>In 1967, Amherst Game Company prefaced this game with the phrase: &amp;quot;The CREDIBILITY GAP game is intended purely for the entertainment of its players.  It is not intended to have any special reference to the present Administration in Washington whose concern for the truth is well known. Ideally the players should regard the game as set in some distant future time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this &amp;quot;Tranquilizing Myth&amp;quot;, 2-4 players are invited to partake in Credibility Gap, a political satire game published during the time when the term &amp;quot;credibility gap&amp;quot; was in greatest vogue. It remains equally timely today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players ferret out the Truths of the Administration from the Big Wheel, recognizing Brittle Analogies, Solemn Platitudes, and other variants while avoiding the dreaded Snow Job. They are aided by cards which, in proper combination, will permit them to give opponents Good or Bad advice, make Demands, gain access by phone or mail to the Big Wheel, or seek for the Big Wheel's Truth Vault itself to attain the elusive Truths. The first player to accumulate 20 Truth markers is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4 wooden Liberty Bell movers,&lt;br/&gt;     80+ wooden Truth markers,&lt;br/&gt;     a four piece puzzle board,&lt;br/&gt;     36 &amp;quot;Administrative Pack&amp;quot; cards, and&lt;br/&gt;     58 &amp;quot;Citizens' Deck&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
