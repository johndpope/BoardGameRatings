			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nev-Harborton is a small, dreary town populated by stoic, tradition-bound men and women whose primary source of livelihood has been, is now, and always will be the sea.  Located on the eastern coast of a northern province, the fisherfolk of Nev-Harborton even brave the icy waters during autumn and winter, their hardy, thick-hulled boats ranging for miles out to sea.  When the dead cold weeks of mid-winter set in, and the harbor freezes, the fisherfolk turn to trapping and seal-hunting to make ends meet.  All in all, Nev-Harborton is a not a place where one expects to find much trouble.  Even the small fort built by duke's grandfather has been allowed to fall into ruin, for what is the point in defending a small fishing village that not even bandits bother to bother?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An underwater adventure for 5th - 8th level characters.  Distributed as an RTF scenario and three JPG image files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
