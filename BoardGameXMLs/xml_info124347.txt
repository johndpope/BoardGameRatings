							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brian&#039;s Wing</name>
									
			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having spent several days here in Brian&amp;rsquo;s Wing, I feel that maybe I should pen a few details about this amazing little city and it&amp;rsquo;s people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a distance, it could pass for an American Fort, with thick walls of earth, wood and stone stretching thirty or so feet into the air. There are four primary walls, that wrap around it to the shallow sea. At the three points where the walls meet, a tower of about fifty feet has been built, with a gate below it. Along the walls, coils of copper have been strung. I am told that any tower can throw a switch and direct electricity to a section of those copper coils, sufficient to repel even a Tyrannosaur. A few cannon are also positioned along the wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
