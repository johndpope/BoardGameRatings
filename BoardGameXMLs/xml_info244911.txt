							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brain To Go: Der lila Wal</name>
									
			<description>Brain To Go is a series of games developed by game designers and neuroscientists in which players challenge their episodic memory, that is, their memory of recent personal events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Der lila Wal, players lay nine cards showing different colorful sea creatures face down after trying to memorize which creatures are on which cards. On a player's turn, they reveal a new card from the deck, then must reveal a card that matches either the creature or the color on this new card. If they do, they claim this card, then lay out a new card face down in its place. Whoever collects the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
