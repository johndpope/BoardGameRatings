							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cirque De Zale</name>
									
			<description>Cirque de Zale is Rebecca's homage to the favourite adventure games of her youth, as well as a sort of philosophical statement. It was made with -- of course -- Adventure Game Studio by Chris Jones. It got all sorts of praise from the internet, mostly for being funny, which makes sense, because it is funny! Really, there is a lot of Becca's voice in Cirque, which is why it succeeds as personal expression despite the Monkey-Island-and-friends template.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Gameplay is overrated, folks. I'm not even kidding.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cirque de Zale stars a young fellow of moderately brusque demeanour called Alexander Zale, who works as a dung-shoveller until one day, he gets sucked into another dimension! This can happen if you're not careful! Anyway, once there, he does things. In order to find out what things, please download and play this short, entertaining game at your leisure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
