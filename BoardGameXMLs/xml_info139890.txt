							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Vampire Hunt</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something Has Arisen...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Last Ghost Hunt, a group of ghosts were encountered that were so evil, so malign, and so powerful that if they were to be released, they might change the balance of power in the battle for the future and destiny of mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient and powerful ghosts are posessed of tremendous psionic power and terrible purpose, but they're not the most careful beings, not by a long shot.  When one of them has a chance to jump into what looks like a powerful body, it does so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The horrific &amp;quot;vampiric&amp;quot; menace that is created is more than a simple blood-thirsty predator... it's a walking test-tube of extraterrestrial diseases, now equipped with world-bending psionic power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh yes, it's time for a good-old-fashioned Vampire Hunt, but beware.  It will probably be your last...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The RPG. You will need the core rulebook to play. As it contains strong sexual material and very disturbing content, you may also need a copy of our dark erotica supplement, Inner Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
