							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fool&#039;s Joust</name>
									
			<description>Old King Fafnir has no heir to his kingdom, a problem he means to solve by marrying off his daughter Princess Jezabelelle. Only there is one problem with this plan: the princess  that being that the princess is such a spoiled rotten, cold hearted, ill tempered, foul mouthed, back stabbing wretch of a woman that no good, respectable knight or noble in his right mind would ever consider such a horrible fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then he was struck with a flash of inspiration; he declared a that joust tournament be held for all eligible bachelors of certain royal status to participate, the prize for the victor being the Princess Jezabelle's hand in marriage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one signed up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desperate, the king hastily opened the enrollment wide open so that any man in the kingdom may participate in the tournament. The applicants began flowing in. Unfortunately for the king, those who did sign up are not so good, respectable, or in their right mind (or even human for that matter.) But it is too late for the king to do anything about it now, the joust must go on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fool's Joust is a card based system where players randomly draw their character and the opponents whom they will face in combat. Each turn the player use dice to engage in three rounds of combat, the character who scores the most hits or remains in their saddle wins. Players win a reward card for each successful combat; the first player to collect a predetermined number of reward cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
