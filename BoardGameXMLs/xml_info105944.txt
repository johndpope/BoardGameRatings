							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lemonade Tycoon</name>
									
			<description>Lemonade Tycoon, first released as Lemonade Inc., is a Shockwave-based game. A free, limited version is available for online play at many sites or the full version with no time restrictions can be purchased online. The goal of Lemonade Tycoon is to sell lemonade for profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While selling lemonade, players must look over many aspects of their business. Players decide on a recipe, set prices, and sell lemonade in a variety of locations. The game includes changing weather and news, which the player must compensate for. To overcome some factors, such as long lines and stock, players can buy upgrades. The packaged version included versions for PC, Mobile Phones, Windows Mobile Professional devices, and Palm devices. Lemonade Tycoon employs an innovative &amp;quot;Game-On&amp;quot; concept which allows users to transfer game saves from a Windows PC to a Palm handheld or Windows Mobile Professional device and back again to continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Lemonade Tycoon is compatible with multiple platforms, the game differs slightly on each. The Windows version allows more details and info because of a larger screen. Locations had a much bigger view and other versions had to deal with a smaller screen. They did not include as much information as the PC. Areas would be cut down so only a portion could be seen. Each platform, however, is not limited in usability and functionality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lemonade Tycoon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
