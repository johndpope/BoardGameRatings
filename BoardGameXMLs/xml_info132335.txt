			<description>This game basically has graphics like those found in an anime. While only six teams exist in this game, the player must win the championship by defeating the other five teams that he didn't choose to play as. Once the player has completed the final match against an all-star team, the game is truly won. Only a minor fraction of the playing field is shown at all times and the goals are positioned from the top of the playing field to the bottom of the playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Soccer Mania&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
