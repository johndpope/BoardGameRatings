							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zotty: Gute Nacht</name>
									
			<description>A children's game about matching shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a number of picture cards. Players take turns rolling the colour die and move the Zotty pawn to a space of their choice in that colour. If the player has the card that matches the shadow image on that space, they get to place their card on the shadow space. If the player doesn't have the matching card, nothing happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
