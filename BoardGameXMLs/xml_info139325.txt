			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons of Dread is a hardcover collection of four classic, stand-alone Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure modules -- S1: Tomb of Horrors, S2: White Plume Mountain, S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, and S4: The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth -- complete with original black-and-white interior art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S1: Tomb of Horrors: In the far reaches of the world, under a lost and lonely hill, lies the sinister Tomb of Horrors. This labyrinthine crypt is filled with terrible traps, strange and ferocious monsters, rich and magical treasures, and somewhere within rest the evil Demi-Lich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S2: White Plume Mountain: It has always been a subject of superstitious awe to the neighboring villagers. People still travel many miles to gaze upon this natural wonder, though few will approach it closely, as it is reputed to be the haunt of various demons and devils. The occasional disappearance of those who stray too close to the Plume reinforces this belief. Now, the former owners of Wave, Whelm and Blackrazor are outfitting a group of intrepid heroes to take up the challenge of recovering these magical weapons from White Plume Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks: From the preface by Gary Gygax: &amp;quot;This module was begun early in 1976 when TSR was contemplating publication of a science fantasy role playing game. Jim Ward had already shown us some rough notes on Metamorphosis Alpha I thought it would be a splendid idea to introduce Jim&amp;rsquo;s game at Origins II, and introduce the concept to D&amp;amp;DO players by means of the tournament scenario. I laid out the tournament from old &amp;ldquo;Greyhawk Castle&amp;rdquo; campaign material involving a spaceship, and Rob Kuntz helped me to populate the ruined vessel.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S4: The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth: In the Yatil Mountains south of Perrenland there is rumored to be a magical hoard of unsurpassed value, a treasure of such fame that scores of adventurers have perished in search of it. Find the perilous Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth and you may gain the hidden wealth of the long-dead arch-mage&amp;mdash;if you live!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
