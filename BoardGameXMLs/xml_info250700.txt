			<description>Kickstarter backers of Get Off My Land! received 4 copies each of 2 different Kickstarter exclusive cards, the Farmhand and Crop Rotation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 8 cards were not included inside the shrinkwrapped base game box, but accompanied the base game in a separate ziploc baggie. This promo was also sent to individuals who pre-ordered the game if they signed up to receive the promo cards from First Fish Games at a convention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Farmhand cards provide 2 fences OR allow a player to pay $2 to the bank and then choose and perform 2 of the listed actions: log, go to market, and harvest. It also has either 1 or 2 bullet holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crop Rotation provides 2 fences OR lets a player place their farmer on any market card in play or replace another farmer with their own. Then in addition, swap the position of any 2 market cards they control. The card also has either 1 or 2 bullet holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use these promo cards simply shuffle into the deck of fence cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
