							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of the Jade Oath (3.5 / Arcana Evolved)</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as an exotic, plant-like mandragoran, a mischievous bakemono, an otherworldly shenxue, or maybe as a member of some other exotic race.  Use alchemical acumen, diagnostic skill, auspicious feng shui, or some other formidable and esoteric secrets that only an enlightened scholar can know in search of immortality.  Master the magnificent skill of a kensai to the point of being able to wield even a broken weapon with deadly efficiency.  Become a great demon-hunting hero full of bravado and rebellious arrogance.  Move like a shadowy kusa in the night as your blade whispers its next dirge.  Gain the white hair of the deadly lotus, master your unbound nature to free you from the karmic wheel of reality, or learn the powerful secrets of ch'i.  Regardless of how you play, you will find yourself immersed in an evocative setting with an exotic character of your own making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first installment in the Lands of the Jade Oath series is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the setting and help you create and run a character in the Lands of the Jade Oath.  This guide includes a map of the region and serves as an introduction to its various exotic and enigmatic lands, cultures, organizations, and religions.  Within you will discover new and revisited races, new and variant classes, well over 100 feats, an introduction to ch'i magic and sutra magic, exotic equipment, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of the Jade Oath is designed for use with Monte Cook's Arcana Evolved and the 3.0 and 3.5 versions of the world's most popular role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
