			<description>A Three-Round AD&amp;amp;D Game Tournament&lt;br/&gt;The 1998 AD&amp;amp;D Game Open Tournament&lt;br/&gt;Final&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of the world. Been there. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s all too true. And the end of the world is not a happy place to be. You have been trying to avert the catastrophe, to save your world one last time. In this pursuit, you have traveled into the past and discovered that the knowledge of time travel was given into the world by the god of Entropy, part of that god&amp;rsquo;s plan to bring entropy to the world. The plan worked all too well, as the time stream of Alenkirth is knotted beyond any possibility of repair. To save the world, you have to destroy the god of Entropy, because if the god remains then the knowledge of time travel will eventually be introduced into the world. You cannot fight a war of defense forever. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple, though it does not sound at all simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
