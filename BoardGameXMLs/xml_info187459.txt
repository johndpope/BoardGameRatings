			<description>Zogar's Gaze (2nd Edition) takes what worked well in the original version and adds new mechanics to improve the gaming experience for all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns going to the market to buy items to equip their heroes with. Then they delve into dungeon one card at a time. Death is around every corner, but so is fame and fortune. How deep will you go on your turn? Will you risk it all for a possible pile of gold? Zogar, the evil wizard, is also watching over your every move. Attract too much attention and he will reveal himself, ending your turn, and possibly the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
