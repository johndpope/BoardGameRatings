			<description>We are partners in the TK&amp;amp;RL Transport Business, with our own lines of trains and trucks for collecting and delivering various goods to Mr. Big's coastal warehouses. Mr. Big pays us well for everything we bring in plus bonuses for filling each warehouse. The risks are great, what with the roads and rails getting wiped out by snow storms and rock slides, not to mention government cutbacks leaving the infrastructure in dangerous shape. Only partners with nerves of steel and alert brains need apply for the job. If you have what it takes, join us in a railway and trucking adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
