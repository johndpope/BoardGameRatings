							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Intriguing Crimes Volume I:Forgery</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Whole New Class of Crime&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it comes to forgery, the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game really only provides players with rules for a small portion of what the crime can truly encompass. If the thing you want to forge is documents, the Linguistics skill has you covered. But what if you want to forge evidence for a trial, or you want to forge a painting or a sculpture? For that matter, how do you even determine the value of a painting or sculpture to be forged? This book answers these questions, with new rules that support a wider definition of forgery, enabling intrigue-based plots centered around forgeries and fakes. The book also includes a small collection of achievement feats relating to forgery and art dealing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
