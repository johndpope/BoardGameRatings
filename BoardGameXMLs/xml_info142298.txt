			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player manipulates a large grid of square, coloured gems in order to arrange the gems into various similarly coloured shapes, matching shapes given by the game.  Using touch controls, the player only has the power to shift either columns or rows of gems.  The game is timed and when the time runs out, the game ends.  As the player successfully makes matches, the difficulty of the shapes the player has to make increases.  By successfully creating matches quickly, the player scores combo points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
