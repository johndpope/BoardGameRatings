			<description>Beatmania IIDX 15: DJ Troopers is the 15th game in the beatmania IIDX series of music video games.  The game features over 50 new songs, some of which are unlocked over Konami's e-Amusement platform. The overall motif of DJ Troopers is a military themed style, containing rustic greens, grays, and camouflage patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core gameplay remains the same on DJ Troopers. A new hidden modifier called &amp;quot;ALL-SCRATCH&amp;quot; changes most of the notes to scratches. In addition, a new tutorial mode has been added featuring interactive tutorials on basic gameplay elements, which is presented by Michael a la Mode, the vocalist from GOLD RUSH from the previous style (who is visually portrayed as a young short-haired man with sunglasses and a &amp;quot;Beatnation Records&amp;quot; t-shirt). In addition, tweaks to 5-key mode have been made, using the right-side of the keyboard on the 2P side instead of the first 5 keys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New cabinets produced after the launch of DJ Troopers also feature slight changes, such as a LCD monitor rather than a CRT monitor, and new artwork on the transducer platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player gets three AA's on two songs rated 8 and a song rated 9 (without use of the Random or Mirror modifiers) for Hyper or the total difficulties of the 3 AA'd songs adding up to 31 for Another, the player gets to play the Extra Stage, Time to Air by 青龍 (Seiryu). The stage is played on Hard mode, which removes the 80% groove gauge requirement, but will fail the player if it drops down to 0%. If the stage is cleared with an AAA and the player is playing on Another, the player gets to play One More Extra Stage, PARANOiA ~HADES~ by &amp;alpha;TYPE-300, a crossover from the recently released Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional extra stage system used on DJ Troopers for e-Amusement users is Military Splash, an extension of the VIP Room concept from Gold. The system is divided into 2 tiers, one containing 3 songs and a One More Extra Stage, and the other containing 4 plus another One More Extra Stage, aptly titled Military Splash #02. The songs contained on the first tier are Mirage Residence by Jimmy Weckl, &amp;Uuml;bertreffen by dj TAKA, TRIP MACHINE PhoeniX by DE-SIRE alterative, and the One More Extra Stage, TROOPERS by Des-TRACT. When Military Splash is unlocked, an option appears when an Extra Stage is unlocked in Standard mode, allowing access to it instead of a regular Extra Stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To unlock Military Splash, the player must meet the criteria for any one of the 3 songs. The first tier of songs are based on the BEMANI series, with contributions from GuitarFreaks/DrumMania, Pop'n Music, And DanceDanceRevolution, respectively. To unlock Mirage Residence the player must get a Border Bonus (a pass with exactly 80% on the Groove Gauge) or Perfect Bonus (getting all Greats and Flashing Greats). To unlock &amp;Uuml;bertreffen, one must play a specific number of new songs. To unlock TRIP MACHINE PhoeniX, the player must play 2 songs from every song folder with an A or higher without using 5-key or Autoscratch. To access TROOPERS, the player must AA all the previous songs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second tier of songs, &amp;quot;Military Splash #02&amp;quot; in a similar fashion to the Cardinal Gate songs on Distorted, are under pseudonyms of major IIDX artists. These 4 songs are Do it!! Do it!! by Kraken (Ryu☆), Steel Needle by Scorpion (L.E.D.), four pieces of heaven by Lion (dj TAKA), and ICARUS by Eagle (kors k). The OMES for #02 is MENDES by Humanoid (DJ Yoshitaka). The background animations for these songs are similar to final bosses in arcade shooting games - there is an &amp;quot;HP bar&amp;quot; at the top that represents the number of notes left in the song in Another mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayStation 2 version of DJ Troopers was released in Japan on December 18, 2008. New songs include collaborations, smooooch ・&amp;forall;・ from the recently released Beatmania IIDX 16: Empress as a preview song, along with revivals from past styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Beatmania IIDX 15: DJ Troopers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
