							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Med</name>
									
			<description>(from the introduction:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Med is a simulation of the campaign in the Eastern Mediterranean during the years between 1940 and 1943. It is a complex simulation of the same order as FITE/SE. But with experience, an extensive Europa library and this package, you can simulate the strategic alternatives open to the Italian Commando Supremo from the entry of Italy into the war through the three years to the point at which the Allies were poised to invade. As might be expected, initiative rests largely with the Axis. The British/Allied side remains on the strategic defensive until late in the game. While it can be played two-player, a better game ensues with multiple players on each side with different players for ground/air and naval commands. Operational commands, such as the Balkans, Levant, Iraq and East Africa, provide opportunities for temporary commanders to participate within the larger campaign. [...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most components used in The Med are available in the published GDW aka GR/D games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A.
