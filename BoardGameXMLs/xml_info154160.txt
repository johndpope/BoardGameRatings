			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END! WHY NOT GO OUT GAMING?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reportedly, ancient Mayans predicted the world is going to at some point during 2012. Since ancient peoples were never wrong about anything, we here at NUELOW Games are releasing a &amp;quot;Final Battle&amp;quot; every month this year until the end comes. This is The Final Battle #7. So far, so good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another thing ancient peoples got right was the fact that dragons hate tigers--a fact we learn from the Chinese Zodiac. Professional golfer Tiger Woods and his friends discover this the hard way when a Chinese dragon attacks with the intent of spilling Tiger Blood on the green and thus ending their ancient rivalry forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon vs. Tiger features ROLF! stats for Tiger Woods, Michelle Yeoh, Jackie Chan, and a Chinese Dragon, as well as all the Combat Maneuvers and Traits used that aren't found in the main ROLF! rulebook. Also making a repeat appearance is President Barack Obama, as he and Tiger join forces to battle terrorists. (Obama is making his second ROLF! appearance, the first being in The Breast Hope for Peace.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DRAGON vs. TIGER... ONLY ONE WILL WALK AWAY FROM THE FINAL BATTLE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
