			<description>This game is a simulation of American football which is played over 40 plays split in four quarters. A play is registered after each down or when a team scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From scrimmage, players line up their formations. The offensive team lines up first and the ball is placed on top of the Center. The first down marker is placed 10 yards forward. On his turn, the offensive player gets three moves with which he can move one man three spaces, one man two spaces and another one space or three men one space each. The defensive player makes his three moves after the offensive player. Once the defensive player has made his three moves, the offensive player moves once again. Play continues until the ball carrier is tackled, a team scores or an incomplete pass is thrown. In order to tackle the ball carrier, the defensive player must land one of his men on the square occupied by the ball carrier. Dice rolls are used to resolve passing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from rulebook&lt;br/&gt;The N.F.L. ALL PRO FOOTBALL GAME is the closest thing to real football ever devised! Every play possible on the real gridiron can occur in N.F.L. ALL PRO FOOTBALL! Now, for the first time, you control your entire team . . . not with cards, dice or spinners&amp;mdash;but by actually moving the players. You see every play unfold in front of you and victory or defeat is determined entirely by your skill as offensive quarterback or defensive captain. Since this is the first time you will be moving an entire team on the playing field, study the layout of the playing field and the way each man moves. Run through a few practice scrimmages before starting the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
