			<description>Titanium Age is new, fast paced sci-fi strategy game for two players that is based on hit RTS video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the 23rd century.  Mankind has finally united under the Terran Star Empire, and has taken fledgling steps to colonize the solar system.  However, another power has similar plans.  The scions of the first attempt to colonize mars, the Hegemony of Ares has risen to form a military super power that rival the Terran forces.  Now the two Empire's must fight for the future of the human race with new, terrible weapons and vehicles. Now begins the Titanium Age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Titanium Age is a hex based game that combines city building, civilization syle research, and mass strategic warfare into one epic light-wargame.  There are even some very light deck-building elements, allowing you to customize your play style with artillery attacks and buffs for your army, which can contain over 100 units at once!  All these elements are combined under a single, simple dice based ruleset that has two modes of play; Skirmish , which is a streamlined version  for beginers and nonwargamers, and Warzone, which adds tactical depth by adding cards, an upgrade tree for your units, and a terifying unit called the ultra mech.  The objective of the game is to destroy your enemies HQ structure, winning a battle in the war for the red planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
