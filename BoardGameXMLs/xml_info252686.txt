							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darling er død</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've always loved Darling. I have never had sex with her, I have never kissed her - and hardly ever wanted to. But I've always loved her. In a different way than the girls I've shared my life with. And in a way that is neither about gender nor age. Perhaps it is because, in a moment, she closed me in. Right in where I saw her soul. It was black and gray and angry as hell. But I saw it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
