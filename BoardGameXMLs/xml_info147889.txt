			<description>#Captains Log, Entry 37&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we set out, I thought this mission is a wild goose chase but now, when we are so close I think this actually might be worth all the effort the Corporation has made. I have been looking over the photos the probe sent and I must admit, there definitely is something buried under the surface. I am glad the Corporation trusted me with this endeavor. The crew is a bit on the edge, but it is understandable, this has never been done before. We should be landing in a few days, and I cant wait for the digging to begin. Sadly other corps have also found the resources to make the mission a reality so this will be kind of a race. I am certain we will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#End of entry 37&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dig Mars, players perform different actions to dig out discovery tiles. Discovery tiles are worth varying numbers of fortune points, but fortune points can also be used to upgrade a player's equipment. When to do what? Timing is key. The different actions are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Move &amp;ndash; move one of your tokens to an adjacent stack in a horizontal or vertical direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dig - reveal the top tile of the stack with at least one of your tokens on it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Carry out &amp;ndash; choose any revealed tile with at least one of your tokens on it and take it into your possession, giving you fortune points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Upgrade &amp;ndash; pay the corresponding number of fortune points (by discarding tiles) to boost your equipment tile to the next level (e.g., from 2 to 3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has collected a certain amount of fortune points, depending on number of players, the game ends and he wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
