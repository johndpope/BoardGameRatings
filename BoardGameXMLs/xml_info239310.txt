			<description>Home Designers is a competitive game that trains memory, insight and imagination. Experience the role of designers who build dream houses for demanding clients. The one who is best able to meet their wishes and at the same time meet the general requirements for the quality of housing will become the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives their land on which they try to build the best house. The first phase of the game consists in drafting (selecting) rooms (1 room = 1 building). The second phase in assembling the rooms together. Everything is shown in a top view, as a ground plan. The client is always a family member common to all players. 1 family member = 1 card. Each member of the family has three different requirements that players will earn points for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Designers is a family game of medium difficulty. Rules are not complicated, but building a good living can be challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
