							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Basileus</name>
									
			<description>Basileus is the classical logical game created by Marek Łukaszewicz in November 2010. This strategic game for two players is played on the board 8x9 squares. A king (called basileus) making a capturing move must leap over one or several of the opponent's chessmen but cannot jump over the opponent's king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to eliminate the king (basileus) from the board.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 4 pawns, 4 pieces and a king at the beginning of the game&lt;br/&gt;The capturing is obligatory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. A chessman making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square in all allowed directions.&lt;br/&gt;2. A chessman making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's chessman. Only one chessman may be captured in a single jump; however, when possible the player must perform multiple jumps in one move in all allowed directions.&lt;br/&gt;Pawns&lt;br/&gt;1. The pawns can only move diagonally, one square at a time.&lt;br/&gt;2. The pawns capture the opposing chessman by jumping over it to the nearest square of the same colour. To do this they can move to the left or to the right, forwards or backwards, but not diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;3. Pawns can only move on squares of one colour, so if they start on a white square they must always stay on white squares.&lt;br/&gt;4. Pawns may only capture the Basileus or other pawns, they may not capture other pieces.&lt;br/&gt;5. The game ends when one player captures the opponent&amp;rsquo;s Basileus by jumping over it to the next empty square.&lt;br/&gt;Pieces&lt;br/&gt;1. The pieces can only move diagonally, one square at a time.&lt;br/&gt;2. The pieces capture opposing chessman by jumping over it to the nearest square of the same colour, diagonally in  four directions, not to the left or to the right, forwards or backwards, Pieces can only move on squares of one colour, so if they start on a black square they must always stay on black squares.&lt;br/&gt;3. Pieces may only capture the opponent&amp;rsquo;s pawns or Basileus, they may not capture other pieces.&lt;br/&gt;4. The game ends when one player captures the opponent&amp;rsquo;s Basileus by jumping over it to the next empty square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basileus&lt;br/&gt;1. The Basileus can move one square at a time in all directions, also diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;2. The Basileus can capture opposing chessman by jumping over it to the nearest square of the same colour. To do this they can move to the left or to the right, forwards or backwards, or diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Basileus cannot jump over the opponent&amp;rsquo;s Basileus, so if it finally stops on a square next to the opponent&amp;rsquo;s Basileus, the opponent can replace it with his own Basileus, thus winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
