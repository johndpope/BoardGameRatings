			<description>&amp;quot;Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, sometimes shortened to Operation Flashpoint, and abbreviated OFP, is a tactical shooter and battlefield simulator video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set on a group of fictitious islands in 1985, Operation Flashpoint  puts the player on one of three sides in a hypothetical conflict between American and Soviet forces. The Resistance is the third playable faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Flashpoint was praised for its attention to realistic combat.&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay varies significantly depending on the player's role, but the game is best described as a tactical shooter with significant vehicle elements and minor real-time tactics elements. OFP is largely team oriented and the player spends much of the game with a squad of up to 11 AI controlled members, either as a member of the squad or as its leader.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Operation_Flashpoint,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
