							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Franklin</name>
									
			<description>Campaign Franklin depicts General Hood's desperate attempt to reach the Ohio River in Tennessee and thwart General Sherman's advance in Georgia. But stubborn Union defenses along with his own mistakes will foil his plans.&lt;br/&gt; Campaign Franklin contains 64 scenarios, including the historical battles of Spring Hill, Columbia, Franklin, and Overall's Creek. Many &amp;quot;what-if&amp;quot; variants of the historical battles allow the players to explore the various possibilities of the campaign. Though every scenario may be played as a stand-alone, the bulk of the scenarios are integrated into the operational/tactical campaign, providing a high degree of replay value. &lt;br/&gt; The heart of the game is the campaign. At each stage, players choose from 2-4 operational decisions that will result in a tactical battle to be played out on an expansive map, providing room for maneuver. The campaign is non-linear, with both offensive and defensive operational options available to each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
