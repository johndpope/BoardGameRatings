							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Game of Deth</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year 2360, a mysterious Trancer Boss has figured out a new way to trance squids: through a game called Hero Dungeon. The Trancer Boss has his Trancer gang bring in squids from all over Angel City to play in Hero Dungeon tournaments, with a promise of big cash payouts to the winner. However, there are no winners because everyone who plays either gets tranced or singed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Council has found out about this new threat and has decided to send in some undercover Trancer Hunters to infiltrate the tournament. Can they stop the Trancer Boss in time, or will they get tranced along with all the others in this game of death?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
