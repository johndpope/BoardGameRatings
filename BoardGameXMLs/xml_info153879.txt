			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure for the RPG Operation: Fallen Reich, for 4 players and it is a direct sequel to&lt;br/&gt;episode #2 - A Merry Christmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short adventure suitable for about a 2 hours game, starting in London, January 3, 1938.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot Excerpt:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In the early 1930s in Montpelier, France, the eccentric professor in parapsychology Claude Bousquet, was expelled from the university&amp;rsquo;s research department after a tragic accident involving several students who was either killed or severely injured. The professor never explained what went wrong but claimed than one of the dead student went mad and tried to kill the other students. He carefully hid the fact that he had got his hands on one of the most feared and mythical creatures from deep in the jungles of the Amazon, the Amazon gorilla. These gorillas live near an old volcano and they are deeply feared by the tribes in the Amazon rain forests. The story about King-Kong has evolved from stories about those great gorillas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth behind those gorillas are that they are bodies used by Fallens that are not fully evolved. They arrive to the earth through a portal within the volcano that is only open when the volcano is showing activity, and they only arrive one or two at a time. They are very difficult to catch, and when caught they are kept in special steel cages built to hold their great weight and strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What one of Professor Bousquet&amp;rsquo;s students did was to accidentally freed the gorilla during parapsychological experiment. The student was a very weak minded person and let himself be controlled. He died first. Professor Bousquet did finally kill the gorilla, but with seven dead and 19 wounded students he was sacked the very next day. --&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
