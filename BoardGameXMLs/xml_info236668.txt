			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the traveling entertainment troupe known as Shelston and Company. Your group is well known throughout the Realm of Calanon, particularly along the western seaboard, where you have just completed a tour of the western seaboard. From there you were to go to Dostev for the Bard&amp;rsquo;s Festival, a competition held every five years for troupes from all over Calanon and the world. However, just as you were about to make the trip, you received a message from Morris Dunlike, a friend of the Shelston family. It was dated a month ago and it informed you that Jonathan&amp;rsquo;s father, Samuel, has died in Yorinda. You must hurry there as quickly as possible to resolve some unfinished business as well as attend his funeral. The message said that the nature of the business would be elaborated upon when the group arrived there, as Morris said it was very private and could not be written down. Gathering your belongings together, you left quickly for Yorinda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario was provided in two file formats - a &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; single-file Word (DOC) format, and an obsolescent four-part Word 2 Binary (AOS/OSC/OSP) format.  The length disparity is due to formatting only (margins, paginaton, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
