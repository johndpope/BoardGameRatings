			<description>This was published by McGartlin in a DTP form only with limited copies.  It is basically their stock car game adapted to Formula One racing.  The difference is that instead of making a lap count you must change gears.  As track deck cards are flipped, the section of track has a gear that you must shift to.  If you are in 1st gear and the track is a long straight (6th gear) you must play gear change card(s) totaling 5, shifting from 1st to 6th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
