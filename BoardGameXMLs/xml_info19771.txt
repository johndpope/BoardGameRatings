			<description>This is a standard roll-and-move (in this case spin-and-move) children's game.  A unique feature is that the board consists of two sections - butting the board up against the box bottom makes a larger board that includes the box insert.  The insert has a groove for storing parts that also contains the game's goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to four players move around the track and by landing on special squares collect two types of cards.  The cards allow them to move to the &amp;quot;upper&amp;quot; board (the insert) and eventually get to the &amp;quot;Hidden Treasure Cave&amp;quot; in the insert groove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just for kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
