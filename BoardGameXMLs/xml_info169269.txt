			<description>Psychedelic Quilt is a solitaire game that merely requires a single set of A-Type Nestortiles. Build a quilt (of any flat shape) according to the Quilting Rules, so that every swatch is part of the quilt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle all 60 swatches face-down. Draw 1 tile of each color and place them face-up in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;Stitch (attach) one of your 10 face-up swatches to the quilt on the table according to the Quilting Rules below (obviously, the first swatch attaches to nothing, and ignores the Quilting Rules). If there are any remaining face-down swatches of the color you just attached, draw a replacement of that color; otherwise, you get no replacement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quilting Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A swatch can only be stitched to a swatch of a different color.&lt;br/&gt;     A swatch can only be stitched to a swatch with one more or one fewer pip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End&lt;br/&gt;If you stitch all 60 swatches into the quilt, you win; otherwise, you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
