			<description>A game of full scale war on the planet Mongo. Set in the Flash Gordon universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One side controls the forces of Human Hero Flash and his allies, Hawkman Chieftain Voltan and Forest Chieftain Baron. The other player controls the forces of Evil Emperor Ming. Each unit is rated for the following statistics: type, move, initiative, attack, defense, cost, and area of recruitment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a map depicting a major continent on the planet Mongo. There are five regions in the continent. At the start of the game, the Central and Southern regions are under Ming's control while the North, East, and West regions are controlled by the forces of Flash. The regions are further divided into territories, some of which represent Major Cities and some of which are impassable mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flash player wins if Ming is killed. Ming wins by killing all of the Rebel Leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
