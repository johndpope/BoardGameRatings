							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Space</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A perfect formula: The Game of SPACE + family, friends, or classmates = fun and excitement! The toss of a die determines whether you'll be quizzed about Stars, Planets, Astronomy, Constellations, or Exploration. Four challenging levels permit players of like and different ages and abilities to join together in unraveling many puzzling mysteries of the universe. Be first to correctly answer one question in each of the five categories, and win!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also contain well-considered instructions for &amp;quot;Game Show&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Spelling Bee&amp;quot; variants.  Excellent questions, nicely sorted by ability, and lots of them.  This would be a good classroom distraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
