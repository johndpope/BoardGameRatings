			<description>The Movie Murder Mystery Party is murder mystery game where guests take the roles of various cast and crew members celebrating the completion of filming of their movie. At the start of the game, each player is given a character and a personality trait sheet from a set of 20 options. With the couples' rules, two players may share the same character. Players get to know each other in a party setting until the director, the game's host, suddenly dies at the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the players arrived, the game's host hid clues about the murderer's personality. When the director dies, the party turns into a scavenger hunt. Players use the clues and deduction to deduce who killed the director to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
