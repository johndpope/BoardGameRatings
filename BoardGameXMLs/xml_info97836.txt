			<description>Board game in which each player has three tanks which attempt to get to the opponent's home base.  Movement is by dice, but in order to be permitted to move or to make an attack, a nifty resolution mechanism is used.  2 batteries power a bulb and this is reflected by turning knobs controlled by the players. Essentially the two players each secretly pick one of red, green or yellow (colours which are also marked on the tanks), and then a fire button is pressed to illuminate the lights.  Whether the action succeeds or not depends on whether the lights match or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
