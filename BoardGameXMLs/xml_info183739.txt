			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Drow?&lt;br/&gt;Since &amp;ldquo;ancient times&amp;rdquo; when a dark subterranean race incited giants to attack the lands of men, the evil breed of elves known as drow has been a favorite adversary of tabletop adventurers, seen with a mix of fear at their eldritch power and the temptation of their myriad treasures and magical secrets. One is always seen as virtuous against the drow, and the necessity of opposing them gives a sense of heroism to many stalwart players. The scale of their society and machinations ensures that they will be a solid challenge that will never lack for twists and turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Porphyra&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;The drow are as much a Landed (not native to Porphyra) race as dwarves or m&amp;acirc;lites. The restrictions of past scenarios do not apply, and each sect of drow, though somewhat physically and psychologically similar, come with different loyalties and raisons d&amp;rsquo;etre, unchained to one another. Drow serve many, wildly different masters on the Patchwork Planet of Porphyra, and struggle to survive after being dragged from their worlds of origin- anything goes now, with the drow&amp;hellip; so make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t miss out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume focuses on the subset of drow known as the Nalbrezu, who serve devils and are known for their subterfuge and information extraction techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
