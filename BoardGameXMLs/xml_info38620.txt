							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Siege of Tenochtitlan (1521 AD)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;In 1519 Hernando Cortes landed in Mexico with a small army of Spanish conquistadors. They marched to Tenochtitlan, the fabulous Aztec capitol city built in the middle of a lake. Emperor Montezuma welcomed them to the city.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cortes promptly made the Emperor his hostage and used him as a puppet ruler to gather the Aztec's gold. The mood in the capitol quickly soured and, after Montezuma was killed, the Spanish had to fight their way out of the city, suffering heavy losses.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When Cortes was ready he surrounded the capitol city and used ships armed with cannons to take control of the lake, cutting off the supply of food and water. The final assault on Tenochtitlan was long and difficult. The desperate Aztecs fought ferociously, street by street, until the last hold outs, starving and dying of thirst, were killed or captured. It was the end of the mighty Aztec Empire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per stand.
