			<description>Being a Short Treatise on the Cursed Swords of the Rawenfeuer Family&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a warrior his sword is his life. Often one can hear many fencing instructors and sword masters go as far as to claim that a sword is the warrior&amp;rsquo;s soul; a swordsman&amp;rsquo;s ability and character are reflected in his sword. A shiny and well-kept blade with a sharp cutting edge that is wielded against the servants of the Ruinous Powers speaks volumes of its wielder&amp;rsquo;s integrity, character and disposition. A warrior with a noble character wielding a sword forged by a master craftsman is truly a champion of the Empire and guardian of its citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
