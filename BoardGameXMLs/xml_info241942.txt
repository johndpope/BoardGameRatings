							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Manor (Issue 9 - Dec 2017)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Manor is an OSR zine that's been around since 2012. Dedicated to keeping it fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue was created from my sandbox campaign called The Komor Forest. The articles found within helped develop my campaign find its own voice and uniqueness. A peek behind my DM screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue #9 starts off with four varations of the cleric class. Each god values a set of principles and their clerics should reflect those principles. Sarrath,a God of War, demands his disiples adhere to a strict code of obedience. Delaquain, Goddess of Battle, values individual thought, a person willing to stand up again many. Lavinia, is the Goddess of Life, her faithful care for ally and enemy alike. Possimium, a God of Nocturnal Creatures, who is always planning and gathering supplies for the next war against evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've used to Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Continual Light ruleset, monsters have special traits they use in combat or just in general. When creating my own creature I expended the traits to suit some of my creations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An encounter table using 3d6 to create common, rare and unique encounters. He encounter is detailed. A few of the encounters are set up to become adventures on their own. The list not only features critters they party will have to contend with, but also landmarks and ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, The Crooked Man Tavern. It can be found in a local dungeon near you. A place where silver is secondary to information. What's on tap is what was stolen recently. Skullduggery is found everywhere, even at the bottom of the tankards. Not to mention the demon in the closet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
