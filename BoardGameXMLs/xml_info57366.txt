							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Singapore Sling</name>
									
			<description>From publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this introductory adventure for Transhuman Space, the players must dig through a mountain of disinformation to find out which of Singapore's elite is ready to sell out his country to the Transpacific Socialist Alliance. But in an era where the truth can be manipulated as easily as pixels on a computer screen, who can you trust?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introductory paragraphs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Singapore Sling is an adventure for the Transhuman Space setting in the year 2100. It is a suitable introductory adventure for players new to the setting, and is also easy to insert into established campaigns that fit the general themes of investigation, political intrigue, industrial espionage, or memetic warfare. This adventure requires access to the GURPS Basic Set, Third Edition, GURPS Compendium I, the Transhuman Space core book, and Fifth Wave. Fifth Wave is necessary because the adventure uses NPCs, a major location, and some organizations detailed in that book.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;ADVENTURE STYLE AND SUITABLE CHARACTERS&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As written, Singapore Sling is more focused on roleplaying than action-oriented skill resolution. The players will need to piece together the plot as they investigate, deciding which leads to follow up and with whom they should talk next. With the latter half of the adventure set in Singapore, a state with a very strict weapon control policy, gung-ho weapon-toting adventurers may feel somewhat&lt;br/&gt;out of place. Martial artists will be much more at home, but combat skills will not necessarily be needed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
