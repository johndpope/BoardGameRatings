			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA (Electronic Roleplaying Assistant) is the ultimate companion for Rolemaster campaigns. Using ERA players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ERA you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. But no adventure is complete without some gritty combat. Blows must be dealt, and damage resolved. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample weapons and 3 critical tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RMFRP Channeling Companion package for ERA includes 3 professions, 14 talent descriptions, 2 critical tables and 48 spell lists with every spell ready to be cast.&lt;br/&gt;Get all your friends in one place with the Summoner specialized spells. Create a legend of terror with a devious Warlock. Or hunt the enemies of your religion from within with a Mythic.&lt;br/&gt;Believers of all creeds will benefit from the new talents available. You can now get a Dark Aura Sense, increase the power of your destiny with Fortunate Fate, and determine your position with Champion, Chancellor or Invested Follower.&lt;br/&gt;Apart from 6 the base lists for each of the 3 new professions, all priests spells are included. Land and water hold no barrier with Land Forms and Aquatic Forms. You can sling all the raw power of your deity using Holy Wrath, Holy Element, Holy Wind, Holy Weapon, and others. Any number of specific priests can be built using specialist spell lists such as Horse Mastery, Insect Mastery, Serpent Law and Voodoo Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA is compatible with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
