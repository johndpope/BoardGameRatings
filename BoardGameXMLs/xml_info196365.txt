			<description>Disney Fairies: Lost &amp;amp; Found is a hidden object game set in the world of Disney Fairies. Designed to both promote the movie and deepen brand engagement, the game provides an exciting new way for the young audience to interact with the Fairies they know and love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially focused on the movie&amp;rsquo;s Winter season, the game encourages the player to explore a series of scenes inspired by the Secret of the Wings movie, and help Tinker Bell, Rosetta, Periwinkle, Vidia, Silvermist, Fawn and Iridessa find their mysteriously lost items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of the games is an innovative game view which allows the player to explore Pixie Hollow in immersive pseudo-3D. The &amp;lsquo;best of breed&amp;rsquo; approach is furthered through an emphasis on replayability, with the hidden objects randomised to create a new experience every time a scene is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accompanying the core game is a journal providing a set of unlockable fairy facts for audience to get closer to their favourite Fairies and the world they inhabit. Additionally, a slowly growing interactive storybook delivers the movie plot through a series of beautiful illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
