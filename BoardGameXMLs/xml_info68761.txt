			<description>&amp;quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 (often shortened to WWE SvR 2006 and known as Exciting Pro Wrestling 7: SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 in Japan), is a professional wrestling video game released on the PlayStation 2 console and the PlayStation Portable handheld console by THQ and developed by Yuke's. It is part of the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw video game series based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It is the sequel to 2004's WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW and was succeeded by WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 in 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of the game is to bring more realistic and authentic to the series with many new features, breaking away from the arcade-like gameplay that earlier games in the SmackDown! series possessed. As well as the addition of the new Buried Alive and Fulfill Your Fantasy matches, the game also included two new modes: General Manager and Create-An-Entrance. This also marked the first time a game in the SmackDown! series was published for a handheld console, as it was released on the PlayStation Portable.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWE_SmackDown!_vs._Raw_2006,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
