			<description>From the author:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You can have it good, fast or cheap &amp;ndash; pick two.&amp;quot; That&amp;rsquo;s a game mechanic right there. Heck, it&amp;rsquo;s not just a mechanic. That&amp;rsquo;s a whole fricking game! [...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a pass-the-stick kind of story game. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with that style of game but it&amp;rsquo;s not what we&amp;rsquo;re doing here. Everyone at the table, including the GM, is beholden to the dice to some extent because the dice tell you how much it&amp;rsquo;s going to cost. This means no one&amp;rsquo;s ever exactly going to know what happens next ahead of time &amp;ndash; not even the GM. Everyone gets to be surprised. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry though &amp;ndash; you have a hand in it as well. &amp;ldquo;Good, Fast, Cheap&amp;rdquo; is all about making decisions that matter. Second, don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be the invincible epic hero because you won&amp;rsquo;t. It can always go wrong, no matter how powerful you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
