							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War in Midwinter</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In War in Midwinter, the characters find themselves embroiled in the climactic part of the struggle for the future of the remote town of Midwinter. The party find themselves forced to marshal the town&amp;rsquo;s scanty defenses against an almost overwhelming force of bandits, who lust after the town&amp;rsquo;s riches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the party have played through the first part of the story (Critical Hits Vol. 8 No. 3: Fear in Midwinter), there is little required for the set-up of the adventure, otherwise you will need to establish how the characters arrive at the little town high in the snowy mountains. However they find themselves in Midwinter, the weather in the mountain town has closed in and the party, temporarily fulfilling the duties of the sheriff is trapped in the town until the weather clears and the sheriff and militia return. The first part of the story saw the party apprehend four villainous spell casters who hoped to take advantage of the wealthy townsfolk by masquerading as fortunetellers and plaguing the town with their devilry. Any of these miscreants still alive should be languishing in the town jail. However, players being what they are, it is quite possible that they slaughtered the Red Talons in a bloody showdown in the gang&amp;rsquo;s cave outside the town limits. If this is the case (or if you have not played the first part of the story), the party has a tough time ahead of them with none but the townsfolk to aid in the defense of the isolated settlement. Perhaps this harsh lesson will teach them to be merciful in future&amp;hellip; perhaps not!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
