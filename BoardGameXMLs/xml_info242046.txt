							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chrononauts: German Cake Promo Card</name>
									
			<description>This special Artifact card was designed to work in original Chrononauts, but you can use it in EAC by house rule agreement before the games starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When used with EAC, since the TimeLine is totally different, it is freely playable, and also counts as a dessert food item for 4 Missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Text says:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cannot be played or stolen if [Hitler is alive]. Once in play, it can be discarded at any time and used as a Memo. Cannot be used to stop theft of cake with Get There First.&amp;quot; (I.e. it can't be used up to prevent itself from being stolen)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card debuted as a promo card at Dragon*Con 2002, but was added to the original game during the 3rd printing.&lt;br/&gt;It was also available for purchase by itself from the Looney Labs webstore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
