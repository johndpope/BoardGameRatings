							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elementalis: Guardians and Luminaries</name>
									
			<description>The world lies in ruin. Chaotica reins and all the other Elemental sects fight over scraps of power like ravenous beasts over a bit of rotten meat. Once great cities have been razed and people of good measure have been reduced to all sorts of foul activities. Hope has left, and the Flux is in tatters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, like the phoenix from the ashes comes a new order. As all Elements have their opposite, so has the Sun. Awoken from her long slumber by the past events, the Moon has summoned her most loyal subjects, the Lunar Guardians and Luminaries. These servants have the power to stop Chaotica and help the people of the world rebuild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only question now is that are they too late? Has the world fallen so far that it is unable to be saved?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guardians and Luminaries is a free expansion for Elementalis. This expansion allows the game to handle up to 5 players with two new Mage types to diversify game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guardians gain their power through pattern, and harness the luminous power of the Moon.  Luminaries earn their power similarly, but Ether is more potent to them and their lunar magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
