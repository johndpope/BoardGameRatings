			<description>Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventuresome space pioneer, you have been selected to participate in the 1st Intergalactic &amp;quot;Space Rush.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newly discovered territory is yours for the taking! All that you have to do is stake it out as fast as possible. Sounds easy? Well, there are these defender-droids who will block your moves and team up to get you. Also, staking out hyperspace is not so easy. Its value decreases with each additional moment you take to capture it. Are you ready for battle with the defender-droids and incredible space wealth? Take the challenge! Race for it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
