							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Character Races for Savage Species</name>
									
			<description>From PDF Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Savage Species Web Enhancement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Savage Species book offers new templates, prestige classes, spells, and feats. In addition, it contains a wealth of information about how to build and advance monster characters, and even how to transform a standard-race character into a monster character. As if that weren&amp;rsquo;t enough to make it cool, it even presents entirely new player character races-anthropomorphic animals and half-ogres. But those races have level adjustments and starting Effective Character Levels (ECLs), so they aren&amp;rsquo;t appropriate for creating 1st-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This web enhancement presents two new character races, one of which has a +0 level adjustment, so it can be used to build a 1st-level character. The notes about how these races were built provides a great demonstration of how to evaluate and tinker with level adjustments. That information will prove invaluable when&lt;br/&gt;you design new races for your own campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
