			<description>Recall: A Challenging Game of Observation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game: Arrange a few simple picture cards in a tray. Show them to the player for several seconds. Then ask them to reconstruct the same design with their cards. That&amp;rsquo;s the basic idea behind Recall. An endless variety of designs can be made to challenge the ability of the players. Both young and old can compete on an equal basis, making Recall a good game for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
