			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A witch and hero were sent to destroy the evil Medusa, but failed in their task. The witch was turned to stone and the hero barely escaped with the witch in tow. The hero must now protect the witch from Medusa's minions. By fighting monsters and collecting their blood, the hero can temporarily revive the witch who can use her magic to decimate the monsters. The witch will return to her stone state before long, however, so the hero must continue fighting to defend her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witch &amp;amp; Hero is an 8-bit styled action RPG. It features 20 stages and two difficulty levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
