			<description>This is a playing card game developed for italian band BIZARRO WELT. It is based on their Song &amp;quot;Bizarro-Planet der Affen&amp;quot;. A limited amount of decks printed in professional-grade quality was sold on Christmas 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to draw cards from a pile and avoid cards labeled with an evil, mutant ape by neutralizing them with a &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot; card. If an ape card cannot be neutralized, the player looses. The number of battle cards in the game decreases over time. The last player still standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional action cards can give an individual player and advantage over others, for example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The &amp;quot;future zombie&amp;quot; card allows a player to look at and reshuffle the top three cards of the drawing pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The &amp;quot;fight&amp;quot; card allows a player to challenge an other player to a side competition (e.g. arm wrestling, throwing darts, drinking etc.). The winner may then take one of the loosers' cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The &amp;quot;downfall&amp;quot; card moves all &amp;quot;ape&amp;quot; cards in the game to the top of the drawing pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by two to five players, but is most fun with four or five players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
