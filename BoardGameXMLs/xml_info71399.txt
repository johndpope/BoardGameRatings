			<description>&amp;quot;Blake Stone: Planet Strike is the sequel to the computer game Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, made by JAM Productions and released on October 28, 1994, by Apogee Software. It featured new enemies, and the original six bosses that serve as normal enemies), new weapons and levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following Pyrus Goldfire's escape at the end of Aliens of Gold, British Intelligence initiated a large-scale search to capture him. For many years, no trace of the arch-villain could be found. In 2149, Dr. Goldfire is spotted in an abandoned training facility near the former STAR Institute. He is building an army stronger than anything witnessed before, in a second attempt to enslave humanity. Blake Stone is once again sent to stop the villain, with a direct order to find and terminate Dr. Goldfire, so that he would never threaten civilization again.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Blake_Stone:_Planet_Strike,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
