			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qix-like arcade game in which the player uses nets to try to rope off a large portion of the screen in order to advance to the next level.  Four sharks patrol the area and will attack/kill the player if the player gets too close to them.  The sharks can be roped off into smaller areas of the screen, but if the player is not quick about finishing the level they will break free and destroy the player's nets.  Two octopi are dropped in on some levels to add additional difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
