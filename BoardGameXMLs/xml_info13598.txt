							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campbell Kids Shopping Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on a visit to the shopping center. Using a spinner for movement, players drive their cars into the parking lot. After parking your car, you take the Kid pawn of your color and move along the sidewalk. The spinner has an inner track of colors, and if another player spins your color, you and that player both move the number shown. If you land on a space marked BUY in front of a store you take one of the items from the store shelves. The first player to purchase an item from all four stores and drive their car back to the space marked FINISH, wins the game. Advanced rules require players to use a shopping list, and you must buy all the items on the list before driving to the FINISH space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
