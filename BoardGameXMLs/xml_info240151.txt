							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Face to Fist Style: Tanks volume 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Everything has a role, and these ones are tanks. But your role doesn't define you any more than the name of your class does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this you will find 3 characters with backstories full of fluff and build guides to help you create them at any level from 1 to 20 as a character or NPC in your game. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Grendari, a former druid who now works as an enforcer for an alliance of merchant guilds.&lt;br/&gt;    Aerethis, a mad warrior alchemist who wishes only to find a cure for his mentor after an accident in the lab.&lt;br/&gt;    Shannon, an kineticist who is trying to find her way home... to an entirely different world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end is an new class to use, the Nihilistic Champion, a broken soul that witnessed the horror of the dark tapestry and rather than crumbling, decided to stand and hold the line against the otherworldly doom. Based on the Paladin and Antipaladin classes, I hope the Nihilistic Champion can bring something new to your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
