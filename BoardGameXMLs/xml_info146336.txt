			<description>Based on the introduction from the rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A skirmish level miniatures game designed to be played by four to six players in about an hour and a half. Each player will control a competing faction with personal victory conditions to achieve based on the scenario chosen. Not all victory conditions are mutually exclusive so alliances and diplomacy have their place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is ostensibly set in a fictional present day but this is not a requirement. Many of the factions are drawn from popular culture and new factions can be added very easily simply by quantifying a small number of variables. The game requires minimal measuring, no charts and a lot of six sided dice. The rules will be memorised by a player by their second action and everyone can then oncentrate on having&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factions included in the rules are; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    UNIT&lt;br/&gt;    The Doctor&lt;br/&gt;    Daleks&lt;br/&gt;    Men in Black&lt;br/&gt;    Spugs &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Factions are avaliable on auther website, including;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Cybermen&lt;br/&gt;    Invaders from Mars&lt;br/&gt;    Shado (UFO)&lt;br/&gt;    Shadow Men&lt;br/&gt;    Non Combatants&lt;br/&gt;    Gangstaz&lt;br/&gt;    Grell&lt;br/&gt;    Zombies&lt;br/&gt;    Alien Zombies&lt;br/&gt;    Little Green Men&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are avaliable for free from authers website'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
