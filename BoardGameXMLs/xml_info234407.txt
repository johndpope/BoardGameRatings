			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colours of Magic: Yellow Fifth Edition Update&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Spectrum Shift: Chromatic Arcana Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yellow is the colour of health, vivacity and passion. It represents the power of life to survive, thrive and increase. Those with mastery over Yellow magic are powerful healers, easily the match of clerics, but using study, reason and arcane magic to evoke their effects instead of faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those that focus on healing mind and body, studying how to best blend practical doctoring with arcane magic might become Physicians. These specialists in yellow magic learn to heal wounds, cure diseases, even raise the dead, with only arcane power and their bare hands. Note that this blending of cleric and wizard roles is a little tangental to classic classification, and should be approached with some fore-thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Class options, one for each of Cleric (Totemist), Sorcerer (Fountain of Life) and Wizard (Physician)&lt;br/&gt;    a reclassification of one eleventh of the spells of the players handbook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
