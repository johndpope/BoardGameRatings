			<description>A tile-laying game where the players must work  cooperatively to save as many citizens as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Pompeii!  simulates the sudden and catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius on August 24-25, 79 C.E. The ensuing rain of volcanic ash obliterated the city of Pompeii, as well as its sister city of Herculaneum. Nobody knows the total killed, but there were perhaps 30,000 people living at the foot of Vesuvius at the time of the eruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Roman leaders, can you shepherd citizens to safety? Use your skills well, work as a team, and you will be rewarded with everlasting honor, glory, and pride. Fail, and join Pompeii itself, doomed to be buried in history forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently in the playtesting stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
