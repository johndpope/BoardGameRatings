							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3-D Dragon Tiles featuring The Revenge of Rusak</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Princess Arelina rushes from the tent as total disorder breaks out across the camp. She descends on your party as you struggle to secure your weapons . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wonderfully descriptive, isn't it? Well, now you can see it for yourself with the 3-D DRAGON&amp;trade; tiles. Use the DRAGON&amp;trade; Tiles to bring your DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS&amp;reg; and ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS&amp;reg; adventures to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This package includes 3-D figures featuring tents, trees, carts, a waterfall, and characters. A sheet of 2-sided tiles include trails, streams, creatures, and other wilderness features. A wilderness mapping grid is included to help you lay out wilderness encounters quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3-D DRAGON&amp;trade; Tiles also comes with a special D&amp;amp;D&amp;reg; adventure, &amp;quot;The Revenge of Rusak.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure included is for four to six players of levels 7 to 9 and is designed for use with the Expert Set. It is a sequel to the adventure in AC3: 3-D Dragon Tiles featuring The Kidnapping of Princess Arelina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial printings incorrectly listed this item as series code AC3; this was later &amp;quot;corrected&amp;quot; with a sticker to AC5. Both these codes had already been used prior to this product being released. Later TSR products and catalogs refer to this item as AC8 despite this designation never actually appearing on the item itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
