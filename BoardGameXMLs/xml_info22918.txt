			<description>The Idea with &amp;quot;Vinspillet&amp;quot; is that the players in a fun and entertaining way get knowledge about French wine. Players role a die and move on a map of France. The players can buy chateaus when landing on one, if you land on another players chateau you have to pay him/her money buying a cask of wine. Players may trade with each other during the game. At some spots you have to pick up a special event card and do as the card tells you. If you land on a a spot with a question mark you get a question form the pile of question marked cards. If your answer is right you win a number of casks equal to a die roll. The game ends when all chateaus are sold. The winner is the one who has the most capital when having counted money and the value of his/her properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
