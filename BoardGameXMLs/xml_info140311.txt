							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Questor Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The Questor Expansion adds components for a fifth player, as well as a compass token to Questor.  The fifth player will play as the Psionic Prisoner, whose goal and ability are just as unique as the other characters':  The Psionic Prisoner merely must escape the dungeon through one of the four exits.  The challenge is that the way the Psionic Prisoner deals with monsters is by retreating from them, and when he is in the game, he starts in the middle space, with monsters guaranteed in the surrounding four spaces.  So, he can't move until another character liberates him.  Fortunately, the Psionic Prisoner has the option to rotate any revealed room 90&amp;deg;, rather than move or dig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the Psionic prisoner is one more character the Healer must heal, this expansion includes a white disc.  The compass token included with the expansion is a fancy-looking way to track one of the losing conditions of the cooperative / solitaire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
