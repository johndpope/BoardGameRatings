							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Luxor: Queenie 4 – The Treasure Chamber</name>
									
			<description>The treasure chamber is, like the name implies, filled with treasures that award many points. There are four entrances to the chamber around the game board. To open an entrance the treasure tile that is placed over the entrance has to be collected by a player. After that, every adventurer can enter the treasure chamber when he lands on one of the entrances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There you can find valuable treasures, but only if your quicker than the other players. Once a treasure is collected, it is gone. While it is lucrative to go through the treasure chamber, only when you get to the end, you will be back on the game board appearing on the last discovered entrance. Adventurers inside the treasure chamber at game end will award no points for the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go grab that treasure, but be sure to be back in time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 12 sarcophagi, 4 entrance tiles, 6 chamber tiles, and 1 treasure chamber board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
