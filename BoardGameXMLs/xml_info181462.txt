							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyramid (Volume 3, Issue 81 - Jul 2015)</name>
									
			<description>Creepy Creations for Countless Campaigns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghoulish things come in small packages. They can also emerge from vats . . . or lurk at crossroads, awaiting the curious. This month's Pyramid - the PDF magazine for roleplayers - checks out the tangibly terrifying, for a suitably scary assortment of situations. Its frightening features include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Iraqi Irruptor Blues,&amp;quot; an adventure for GURPS Horror: The Madness Dossier, as told by GURPS guru Jason &amp;quot;PK&amp;quot; Levine. Try to find teammates who have been erased from existence, while fighting against monsters setting loose deadly memes, all in pursuit of a boxful of something . . .&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Too Similar, Too Different,&amp;quot; an in-depth examination of human hybrids from GURPS Locations: St. George's Cathedral author Michele Armellini. Learn how to create these walking (or oozing) nightmares, what GURPS characteristics are most appropriate, and four templates of possible monstrosities.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Hellblade,&amp;quot; this month's Eidetic Memory offering from GURPS Banestorm: Abydos author David L. Pulver. Discover a tempting weapon that can trap the souls of those it slays . . . but where it puts those spirits is an adventure unto itself. Get GURPS stats for the demonic warders, a map of the Hell-Within-the-Blade, and full details to incorporate this subplot into your fantasy or modern campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Anatomy of a Crossroads Bargain,&amp;quot; a look at the history and roleplaying aspects of selling your soul for fun and profit. You'll also gain an understanding of appropriate GURPS traits to represent a bargain, and even &amp;quot;escape clauses&amp;quot; to come back from the brink!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Bell, Book, and Candle,&amp;quot; a systemless presentation of three flavorful items that can help call upon the dead - each with their own drawbacks. Incorporate them into a modern occult or monster-hunting campaign, or let them be a perilous part of any fantasy world.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Altus Brat,&amp;quot; a wafer that can bring someone from the dead . . . but at a terrible cost. Discover GURPS stats and rules for the results of using this strange item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue also provides a Random Thought Table that explores how to make your own horrific creations. No matter whether you seek a taste of terror to add to an otherwise normal campaign, or you're running a full-fledged fright-fest, you'll get more than you bargained for with this Pyramid!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
