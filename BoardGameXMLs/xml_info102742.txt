			<description>From the Publisher's Website,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Written by Warwick Kinrade, Kampfgruppe Normandy is a huge 348 page, full colour hardback book containing rules for playing miniature wargames set in Normandy during the summer of 1944.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kampfgruppe Normandy is a completely new games system that includes detailed rules for such aspects of warfare as: command and control, suppressing fire with small arms and high-explosives, direct and indirect fire, aircraft attacks and anti-aircraft fire. It also includes a unique battle group morale system to determine the victor in each battle. The rules can be played using any 1/72 scale (20mm) WWII plastic, metal and resin infantry, vehicles and terrain kits.&lt;br/&gt;You can view some page spreads from this book by clicking here&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kampfgruppe Normandy includes over 100 photographs taken during the war by those who were there, many rarely seen before. The book contains eight army lists from which players can build combined-arms battle groups: four Allied lists, for both British and American Armoured and Infantry divisions and four German lists, covering both SS and Wehrmacht Panzer divisions, and Werhmacht Infantry and Fallschirmj&amp;auml;ger divisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also contains two mini-campaigns set in the British and American sectors of Normandy which provide extensive background information, scenarios and equipment data as well as full-colour uniform guides for German, American and British forces.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
