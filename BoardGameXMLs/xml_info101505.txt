							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbarians Attack!</name>
									
			<description>A horde of angry barbarians has landed on a remote island inhabited by peaceful villagers! Eager to please their capricious king, the barbarians have organized the conquest into a contest, with each faction vying to send home the best selection of captives. And so the warriors ravage the island in search of specimens from the strongest tribe to send back to the mainland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barbarians Attack is a strategy game that encourages players to craft the deadliest barbarian army. A player may acquire his choice of leadership traits and special powers during the game until his barbarian warriors are pillaging experts. The game rewards both sound tactics and clever power combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players use their allotted action points to acquire captives though battle and other means. Players earn fame in battle which they can spend on a selection of additional powers. When the island has been drained of captives, the player who has the most captives from the strongest tribe (the tribe with the most villagers remaining on the island) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
