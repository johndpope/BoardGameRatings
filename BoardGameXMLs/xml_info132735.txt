							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Silent One</name>
									
			<description>This expansion for Malifaux includes 1 Silent One ,Arcanist Minion specifically designed to work with Rasputina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silent Ones are the priestesses of the Cult of December. Upon learning that the Vessel of December was to be a woman the male priests (December Acolytes) turned on the priestesses, cut out and ate their tongues to prevent them speaking for December. Upon the arrival of Rasputina the Silent Ones attend her loyally and lend devastating magical assistance on the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Silent Ones are designed to work with Rasputina primarily, but may have some limited synergy with other Masters, they run 6 Soulstone cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rasputina should not go to war without a Silent One, two are useful if you have the stones as they can buff each other. Rasputina will naturally benefit from the range boost in the initial turns off the game, but as the enemy gets closer the Silent One can offer a plethora of support abilities; healing, offensive casting and slowing the enemy down. All this and Rasputina can cast through them from a safe distance and with less of a Ca detriment than through, say, a Gamin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silent Ones have been described as mini-Raspys and should be treated as such. They are very good casters, but with low Df and Wd they can be defeated in melee in short order. Ranged strikes will have to contend with Bulletproof and ranged or melee Spells can be ignored with Counterspell. Remember that a lone Silent One can freeze your minion's heart, turn them into a statue and walk out of combat so if you go after them make sure that either they have already activated or that you can dispose of them in one activation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
