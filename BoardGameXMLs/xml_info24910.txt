			<description>You are about to enter a world of romance and intrigue, of high society and scandal. Many surprises lie ahead...and the party you are about to throw will be remembered and talked about for months to come!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Partyzone Game is a complete mystery party in a box. It is a party game for you and your guests. It provides a theme for your party. It is an icebreaker to help get your party started. You don't sit down and play; instead, you and your guests move around and socialize with each other. Just what you would want at any good party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Knave of Hearts Scenario, your guests are given roles as socialites at a fancy party on the French Riviera in 1948. Each guest has a mysterious past and some secrets to protect, and each has one or more missions that involve the other guests at the party. Many of these missions conflict with one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Partyzone game of intrigue and deception for adults includes instructions and party planning booklet, 12 invitations and envelopes, 20 identification badges, decorations, and much more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
