			<description>Kierto (Cycle) is an educational game about recycling, designed by a group of Finnish junior high students and their teachers. The prototype won first prize in the Economic Information Office's recycling competition and was then published by EIO in cooperation with the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has several recycling facilities for different types of waste; each player is dealt five waste cards which they then have to deliver to the correct facilities. First one to get rid of all 5 cards is the winner. There are also event cards, which may help or hinder the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The die and playing pieces are wooden; the rest of the game is made of recycled paper and cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
