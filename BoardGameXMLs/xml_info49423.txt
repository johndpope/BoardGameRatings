			<description>Woosh! is the first game made by Giorgio Vezzini and World oF Twilights Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a fast and lighthearted game that deals with parachuting (even if in a funny way).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to jump from the airplane and do more points than the others by floating over high-point landing zones, or by making acrobatics, or by pushing other parachutists against each other to entangle them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the board (the landing zone) is made by 9 cards face down, placed in a 3x3 table.&lt;br/&gt;the back of the cards has a number. at the end of every round, you take as many points as the zone you are &amp;quot;floating&amp;quot; upon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the cards of the game are used to move yourself, to move other players (for example the &amp;quot;Woosh!&amp;quot; card), to move everyone in the same turn, to attack other parachutists (like with the Condor card or the Tornado!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flight last 10 rounds and the last turn everyone draws 2 more cards. Some cards have a parachute symbol and other don't. the more parachute you get, the more you multiply the value of the points you take in the last turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you can draw a card or play a card (not both) and you can have a maximum of 3 cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If two parachutists are on the same zone, they entangle each other and they start &amp;quot;fighting&amp;quot;, they both throw the dice and the winner pushes the other in another free landing zone, but the looser won't take any points at the end of the round. in case of draw, the one that has been moved, return wherever it was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast, easy, funny with high interactivity with other players and lots of laughs with the illustrations of Angelo Porazzi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;check it out at&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.worldoftwilights.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.worldoftwilights.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woosh and Giorgio Vezzini will be present at Essen Fair 2009 Angelo Porazzi Games booth 30 Hall 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
