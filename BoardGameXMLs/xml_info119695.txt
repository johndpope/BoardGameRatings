							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pine Cone Wars</name>
									
			<description>This is a light war game based on two teams of kids facing off in a game of capture the flag.  Their weapon of choice: Pine Cones.  In this simultaneous action selection game, out think your opponents by choosing the best strategy.  Each turn, you get to choose two actions in secret and then they are resolved in player order. You can move, gather pine cones, throw pine cones, or rest to recover damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you rush for the flag, or gather an armful of pine cones before you advance?  Do you attack from a safe distance or close in for the knockout blow?  There is no player elimination, but any player taking too much damage misses turns until he's rested enough to return to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
