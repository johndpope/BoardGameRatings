			<description>The Object of the game is to build high scoring words crossword fashion with as many cubes as possible before the timer runs out.  This is done by using higher value dice letters to form words which cross bonus squares.  The player who exercises the greatest skill and strategy will attain the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plays like Scrabble, but each person takes their own turn having the board to themselves and see how much they can score before time runs out.  Then the board is clear an the other player gets his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
