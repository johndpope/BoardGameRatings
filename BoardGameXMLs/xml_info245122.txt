							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Breakaway Football: Expansion Teams</name>
									
			<description>Experience new teams for greater play variety with your core Breakaway Football set. In addition, a solo variant is now included in the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boneyard: College-style Triple Option attack, the strongest and most diverse running attack in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eclipse: Exceptional scrambling QB with wide range of strong running and passing plays. Streaky QB who can get hot and take over a game single-handedly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maulers: Power run team with a strong Offensive line and quick, powerful running backs, perfect for ball control Offense. Strong Defense providing excellent run support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pharaohs: Run and Shoot passing attack. The most powerful Offense in the game saddled with a weak but opportunistic defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stallions: Elite QB play with a special ability to force defenses to reveal their play pre-audible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vultures: The elite defense in the game. The Vultures Offense is one-dimensional and does some things well, especially Power running, but the challenge to find variety in the passing game tends to make their Offense weaker than average overall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
