			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ritual Magic Skill and the seven different Artifice Skills are advanced paths which allow highly experienced characters to continue to develop new abilities long into their adventuring career. While Artifice and Ritual Magic are vastly different in many ways, they share a fundamental set of rules for how these new abilities are learned. The Ritual Magic Skill allows a character to become proficient in the casting of truly awe-inspiring magic, known as Ritual Spells. The seven different Artifice Skills allow a character to craft advanced equipment by learning new Formulas, and also allow a character to perform Infusions, harnessing and shaping the power of catalyst ingredients within consumable production items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
