			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Groups called Merus started to appear. It&amp;acute;s a play word, or so I was told. The name stuck, and what it really means is a group of people so close together that they help each other to keep it manageable. You don&amp;acute;t remember any of this because you just lost it, but we are part of one. Everyone is, really, but we are in the same Merus, and that&amp;acute;s why I am explaining everything. You probably did the same for me a couple of times before. And you are welcome.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play requires a large collection of random items, used to drive narrative creation as the items are &amp;quot;remembered&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
