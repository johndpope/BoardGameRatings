			<description>Subtitled with: &amp;quot;5 Games of Words and Letters&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS: The square 'box' that is ONE-inch deep by 7-inches along each side; 374 letters; and &amp;quot;Instructions&amp;quot; sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5 Games, as detailed from the &amp;quot;Instructions&amp;quot;, consist of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Anagrams&amp;quot;: for 2 to 6 Players with the LETTERS face down, or unseen, when chosen from the pile and used to form 'words' of 3 or more from this. Before PLAY commences, then an agreed upon TOTAL of 'words' needed to Win is determined, and this continues until that amount were accomplished by someone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Letter Mix-up&amp;quot;: for 2 or more players with all of the LETTERS shown face-up within easy reach for everyone during this, where an agreed upon number to form 'words' is determined before commencing PLAY, are selected by everyone, of which they must try to form a 'word' from those they've chosen. Play continues until ONLY (1) Player can form any 'word' from theirs, while the others are already having had to drop OUT from being unable to do this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Anagram Sentences&amp;quot;: for 2 to 6 Players and based upon the previous &amp;quot;Anagrams&amp;quot; GAME, with forming sentences for this, and having the same 'Victory' conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Game ADD or O-U-T&amp;quot;: for 2 to 6 Players with the 1st Player having to select a 'word' of not less than 4 LETTERS while also NOT disclosing what that were, and ONLY placing the first LETTER beginning for their 'word' with what they've chosen. This goes on with the others putting theirs to make or add on to continue a 'word' until someone no longer can, and then they are forced out, with the LAST player remaining becoming the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Crossword Anagrams&amp;quot;: for 2 to 6 Players with being very similar to &amp;quot;Scrabble&amp;quot; for the overall layout, while also for in this game, then all of the LETTERS are kept face-down when being selected from the pile. Everyone then chooses 15 LETTERS unseen to start off with, yet they can look at those in order to make some 'word' for placement, using portions of others already formed, or as for the entire 1st 'word' to begin the GAME with. Once they've done that, or conducted a &amp;quot;Discard&amp;quot;, the Player has to &amp;quot;Draw&amp;quot; a single LETTER from either the face-up &amp;quot;Discard&amp;quot; pile (when that is created), or the others of the face-down ones, while PLAY continues until (1) Player uses all of theirs up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
