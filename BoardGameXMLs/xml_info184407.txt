			<description>Frogs are very hungry, and a whole menu of insects is within reach. With Frog Menu, you should eat as many insects as possible, and to do this you must jump from insect to insect, eating non-stop. Be sure not to get isolated while doing so!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, shuffle 2-4 starting tiles with a bunch of insect tiles, then lay out the tiles face up in a 6x6, 7x7, or 8x8 square (based on the number of players). Each player starts with two random power tiles (fish, egg, tongue), with each type of tile having a different special action. Each player starts on the board wherever their starting tile turns up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the active player jumps their frog based on the possible move shown on the tile where that frog is currently located; the player can rotate the tile to use the move in one of four directions, claiming this tile and removing it from the board. As tiles are removed, the board gets holes in it, and players can jump their frogs over these holes. Once a frog is isolated, that player takes no further turns. Once every frog is isolated, players claim the tile under their frog, then tally their points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score based on the types and quantities of insects they've collected, with the game including seven types of insects. A player's starting tile counts as an insect of their choice. The scores for the different groupings of insects are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    5 insects of the same species, 50.&lt;br/&gt;    5 different insects, 40.&lt;br/&gt;    4 insects of the same species, 30.&lt;br/&gt;    3 insects of the same species + 2 insects of the same species, 20.&lt;br/&gt;    3 insects of the same species, 10.&lt;br/&gt;    2 insects of the same species, 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most points wins, with ties being broken by whoever has the combination of insects with the most value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
