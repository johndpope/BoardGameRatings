							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swiss Family Robinson</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Solo Board, Dice, and Card Game. You control the Swiss Family Robinson. A Group of Pirates is attacking your Rocky Redoubt.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a chess board or other 8x8 grid and a set of custom cards. Six pieces are used to represent the family members, classified as three grown men, two women, and a child. Sixteen pawns are used to represent the pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each pirate moves 0-2 spaces toward the family members each turn, as determined by random die roll. The cards are played to cause the family members to attack the pirates.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Victory: Drive off all of the Pirates and keep the Family Members from being captured.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
