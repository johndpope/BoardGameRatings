			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Place and Time for Death is a companion adventure made to go along with the events unfolding in Folio Digital Quarterly #1.  It is designed for 1E &amp;amp; 5E mechanics and is for characters level 1-3.  It contains the information needed to run a side adventure that will help characters establish themselves in the setting before the events that take place in the Folio Digital Quarterly #1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far out in the uncharded territories, the Enlightened still cling to life, but the ever encroaching presense of the xenophobic Samaya threatens the last of their hidden enclaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, a bounty hunter has been dispatched to deal with the supposed Enlightened sympathizers in the border town of Hogan's Hooch, but there is more to the story than meets the eye.  Unbeknownst to the citizens of the town and old relic of the Final War is the price the bounty hunter seeks.  Can the party find a way to thwart the bounty hunter and deal with the relic before it falls into the hands of Samaya willing to use it ot sway the balance of power in the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
