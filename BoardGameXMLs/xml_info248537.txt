			<description>Whether you're salvaging an abandoned starship adrift in space or exploring the ravaged interior of a scuttled wreck, no Game Master wants to spend time drawing every compartment and bulkhead. Fortunately, with Paizo's latest Starfinder Flip-Mat, you don't have to! This line of gaming maps provides ready-to-use science-fantasy set pieces for the busy Game Master. This double-sided map features a deserted tramp freighter on one side and the derelict hulk of a science research vessel on the other. Don't waste time sketching when you could be playing. With Starfinder Flip-Mat: Ghost Ship, you'll always be ready next time your players find a mysterious ship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special coating on each Flip-Mat allows you to use wet erase, dry erase, AND permanent markers with ease! Removing permanent ink is easy&amp;mdash;simply trace over any permanent mark with a dry erase marker, wait 10 seconds, then wipe off both marks with a dry cloth or paper towel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
