			<description>This game was manufactured in Paris, Ontario, Canada by the Walker Press, Ltd. in 1967 as one of the objects made available during the Canadian Centennial Celebration. The instructions and other text appears in both of Canada's official languages - English and French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flap-top box is 8.7cm long x 6cm wide x 1.3cm thick. The box includes the official Centennial Celebration symbol which can be seen in more detail on the back of each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 instruction cards in the deck which offer details for playing four different games with these cards. Each card is 8.5cm long x 5.5cm wide and features a date of note in Canada's history and a sketch of a person who played a role at that time in the history of Canada. Below the sketch are some historic details about the time period and the person's role. The various numbers and symbols on each card relate to playing the games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part of the collection of the Games Museum at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
