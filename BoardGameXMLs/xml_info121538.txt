			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In May 2003, Jonny Nexus embarked on a journey that would take him from the ruins of post-WWIII Poland to the shores of long-gone realms, and from the faded grandeur of 1920s Venice to the twice-sunned deserts of alien worlds. During this journey he would view fabulous sights, witness epoch-shattering events, and meet beings of both might and majesty &amp;ndash; many of whom he then proceeded to kill. He engaged millennia old vampires in hand-to-hand combat armed only with petrol bombs and a ready wit. He uncovered secrets of ages past; he forgot secrets of ages past. He robbed from those that had money, and kept it. Across a score of glittering worlds he entirely failed to write himself into either myth or legend.&lt;br/&gt; But he did have fun.&lt;br/&gt; And somewhere along the way he even found time to die.&lt;br/&gt; Several times.&lt;br/&gt; For thirty months, Jonny Nexus recorded the thoughts aroused by, and the lessons learned from, his twice-weekly roleplaying habit in a column he wrote for Mongoose Publishing's Signs &amp;amp; Portents magazine. Part travelogue, part guide, part manual, and part manifesto, these are those columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
