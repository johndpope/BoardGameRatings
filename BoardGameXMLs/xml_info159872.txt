			<description>Summary written for VGG by Loudscoop (Publ/Dev):&lt;br/&gt;Freeze lava! Dodge falling rocks! Collect gold!! In 3D!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lava Gods are out for revenge! A hapless miner, unaware that the Lava Gods are angry, has been trapped in a mine! In order to get free, the miner has to excavate the mine while collecting tools to stop the lava. When the mine has been mapped, the miner has to navigate through 3D tunnels, dodge falling rocks and hunt for gems that keep the Lava Gods happy - but only for a short while. He still has to collect enough gold to totally escape their wrath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magma Rocks is an adventure game that takes place in a dangerously lava-infested mine. The game switches between 2D and 3D, offering a unique gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be able to solve the 40+ levels? Are you able to collect all the gold? Can you safely get the miner out of the mines? Can you stop the lava - or will you get burned?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
