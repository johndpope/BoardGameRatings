			<description>World Heroes 2 borrows most of the elements of its predecessor, such as the same three out of four button layout, movements and motion commands performed using an 8-way joystick, and the &amp;quot;Normal Game&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Death Match&amp;quot; modes. However, the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; button can either be used to throw when close enough to the opponent, or taunt against the opponent. New additions include some new characters, new and modified moves and fighting statistics added to the original eight playable characters returning from the first World Heroes, projectile-reflecting, counter-grabbing, air-dashing and a faster movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Normal Game&amp;quot; mode, after selecting one of the fourteen playable characters, the object is to first defeat all six playable characters introduced in World Heroes 2, then defeat four of the original eight characters introduced in the original World Heroes chosen by the game randomly. After that, the player must defeat the two bosses, Neo Geegus and Dio to win the game. The rule in each battle against a character, like in most fighting games at the time of its release, requires the players to win two-of three rounds to completely win against the opponent. If the timer runs out before anyone is knocked out, the one with the most health in his or her lifebars wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Death Match&amp;quot; mode, the object of this mode is the same as &amp;quot;Normal Game&amp;quot; mode, but with new stages that feature new environmental hazards and a unique lifebar. Unlike most fighting games at the time, the lifebar in &amp;quot;Death Match&amp;quot; mode has a different rule. If the player hits his or her opponent, the arrow on the lifebar will move toward the opponent's side at a distance depending on certain moves performed against the opponent. If the arrow scrolls at the end of the opponent's side, he or she loses. If the arrow is perfectly in the middle with the time running out, the battle becomes a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;World Heroes 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
