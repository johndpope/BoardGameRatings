			<description>Clubhouse Defense Squad is a 1-6 player cooperative game where you play kids who channel their favorite cartoon heroes and go up against the greatest evil that they can imagine. Clubhouse Defense Squad is a deck building, tower defense and strategy game all mashed up into one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place randomized Gates in each of the 8 areas surrounding the Clubhouse as the first line of defense. These each also have a different game changing effect. Place 6 Bad Guys around the outside of the board, letting the D8 decide the fate of which Gate they will be attacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect your allowance, buy new Arsenal or Equipment cards and then dive into the fight. Each player has their own number of Actions per turn. Your hand allows you to add damage to attacks, gain extra actions and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your turn ends, the Bad Guys assault begins. Roll the D8 once and then go around the board resolving their randomized attacks. Once a Gate falls, the Bad Guys move in and start attacking the Clubhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win when you vanquish all Bad Guys in the draw pile. You lose when the Clubhouse is destroyed, all defenders are kidnapped or the Dusk Clock reaches 6 pm and the kids are called home dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
