							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sea Chess</name>
									
			<description>Sea Chess is a board game, like Chess, or Checkers.  Chess, however, is a game that interprets Medieval land warfare while Sea Chess interprets a modern Naval Battle.  Every Sea Chess game piece represents a warship.  Both players get 24 game pieces representing 3 battleships, 4 cruisers, 8 destroyers and 9 escorts.  Each type of &amp;quot;ship&amp;quot; moves freely about the board with its own characteristic motion, speed and direction.  The &amp;quot;ships&amp;quot; are engaged in dynamic moving action until sunk and you can watch all of the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sea Chess there is a gradual &amp;quot;sinking&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;taking&amp;quot; pieces.  A game piece moves into range and &amp;quot;fires&amp;quot;.  A roll of the dice determines a successful hit.  Each type of &amp;quot;ship&amp;quot; has its own characteristic striking force and range.  Pegs are placed in the pieces to record successful hits.  When the holes are full, the piece has been &amp;quot;sunk&amp;quot;.  Since a peg marks each successful hit, you can keep track of how much damage you are doing to your opponent's ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;READY REFERENCE CARDS included with the game give you a neat summary to keep by your side as you play so you do not have to keep looking into the rule book for speed, direction, striking force, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RANGE GAUGES are provided to help you determine what ships are in range and which are not.  Soon you will be able to tell just by looking which ships are in range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You develop the strategy!  You make the plans!  You decide whether to make the first attack or prepare a devastating counter-attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
