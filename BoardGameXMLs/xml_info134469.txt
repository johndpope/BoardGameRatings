							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Getting There in Time</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, a species of bipedal mammals with some unusual internal anatomy became the first civilization in the universe to discover time travel. With access to as much time as they wanted, they were able to develop their science and technology to a level beyond the comprehension of even advanced star-faring civilizations. These advances have become so fundamental to their society that they now refer to themselves as The Chronomasters. Yet not all Chronomasters have the temperament to sit in quiet contemplation on their homeworld. This game helps you tell the stories of a lone Chronomaster and his human companions as they travel through time and space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
