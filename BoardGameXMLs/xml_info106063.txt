			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WILD WEST is an exciting game of role playing, a game that allows the players to experience the Old West. Each player creates a character that becomes his alter-ego; Gambler, Lawman, Cow Hand, Outlaw, or Snake Oil Salesman. You, the player, have your choice. The character finds himself on the streets of Dodge City, Kansas, unemployed and foot-loose after the Civil War, on a trail drive from Fort Concho on the Goodnight-Loving Trail; a range bred cowboy working on a local spread or presiding at a hot poker game in the Custom House Saloon, complete with diamond stick pin, a cigar, and a hide out Derringer. The possibilities are limited only by the player's imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventures are directed by a player acting as a Game Master, or referee. He creates the basic scenario and plays the part of fate. The other players do not know what lies around the corner or behind the closed door, but they will. As the adventure unfolds, the Game Master reveals the required information to the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WILD WEST incorporates a unique system for advancement in skills and for establishing the outcome of the player's activities. The many charts and tables required for most role playing games are reduced to a minimum while providing accuracy and realism unmatched in games of this type. The important role of the horse in the Old West is not overlooked, and in depth research of the weapons of the time provides the most complete and accurate listing possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only paper, pencil and dice are needed to play WILD WEST. The game may be further enhanced by the use of miniatures representing each character, but such miniatures are not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
