			<description>This is a loose simulation of baseball for two players, designed for the piecepack. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of luck involved, but some of the choices managers face in real life are represented here, such as how to pitch to certain batters, when to change your pitcher, and whether or not to go for that extra base. You&amp;rsquo;ll need a basic familiarity with the sport to play this game, as baseball rules are not outlined much here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is five innings, though extra innings may be necessary. Optional rules are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
