			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Street is a freemium builder from the developers of iBlast Moki. The gaming press frequently refers to the game to as an iOS cousin to the classic GameCube title &amp;quot;Animal Crossing.&amp;quot; Players develop a small town of houses, businesses, and decorations - all depicted on a 2D, cartoonish street. The more residents a player has, the more money they generate by patronizing businesses. Players also manage three different resource-collection areas: the forest, the mountain, and the cave (producing wood, stone, and iron respectively). The game currently has three different crafting locations that allow the player to make a wide variety of items necessary to upgrade businesses and houses. Like most Freemium games, Happy Street includes a special currency that players must acquire to purchase premium structures and additional space. This currency may be slowly accumulated via normal play, or bought via IAP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
