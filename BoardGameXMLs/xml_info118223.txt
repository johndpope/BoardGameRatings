			<description>Back of the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no better pet than an undead pet! Pet Zombies for Nintendo 3DS lets you reanimate your very own customizable zombies that you can play with, care for, or torment in a variety of environments where they shamble, shuffle and lurch. Bond with your zombie by providing it food, toys and interaction, but be careful; if you neglect your zombie, you may find yourself minus a finger, or...a brain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pet sim spoof with a horrific twist! Raise your own pet zombie, each with its own personality, by managing special diet, bodily maintenance, and morbid activities needed to keep it happily undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See cool, eye-popping, gory effects for things like thrown food, drinks, toys or brains with the stereoscopic 3D screen.&lt;br/&gt;Play with your zombies in various mini-games like &amp;ldquo;Zombie Launch&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Luck of the Dead&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Dumpster Dive&amp;rdquo;, and others.&lt;br/&gt;Choose to play nice with your zombies by petting them or torturing them with pokes, throwing toys at their bodies and even lighting them on fire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interact with your zombies in gruesome 3D locations like creepy cemeteries, evacuated malls and rundown military bases.&lt;br/&gt;Customize your zombies with facial deformations, variable decay, clothing, and unlockable items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mix-and-match objects and themed backdrops to create your very own zombie environments that best fit your zombie&amp;rsquo;s personality and tastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earn currency for use in the Pet Shop and unlockables by completing mini-game and gameplay challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
