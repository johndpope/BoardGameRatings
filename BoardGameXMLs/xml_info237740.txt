			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You had died or so you thought, now you have woken in a nightmare world of Cursed monsters and Daemons. A world where you can only survive by gathering the souls of the monsters that oppose you. You will have to fight if you wish to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mountain exists in many places, and these places often cross over into limbo. So as you journey up the mountain you will pass through deserts, ruins, swamps and forests. You must gather souls to aid you on your way as you strive for a true death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undeath is a Dark Rpg inspired by the Dark Souls computer games created by From Software. For any number of players the game offers 4 professions, a complete Magick system, feats and perks and the ability to make living weapons from the souls of daemons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
