							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hocus Pocus, Mumbo Jumbo</name>
									
			<description>A fan-made magic supplement for the Big Eyes Small Mouth RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:  &amp;quot;The primary goal of &lt;i&gt;Hocus Pocus, Mumbo Jumbo&lt;/i&gt; (a completely unofficial sourcebook for BESM) is to walk a very fine line: provide players and game-masters with a flexible and easily-customized magic and psionics system which can be taken whole, or used piecemeal in whatever setting is desired. At the same time, it must remain true to the simple, non-obtrusive style of the original rules to let the players and GM focus first and foremost on roleplay. With this expansion, your group can add more detailed mechanics to any heavily mystic campaign, ranging from Slayers-like powerhouses, to the subtle arts of the Record of Lodoss War; from the devastating mental powers seen in Akira, to the ever-so-prevalent psionic interaction in Ghost in the Shell.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
