							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ASH Poker (Auction Stud-Hold&#039;em)</name>
									
			<description>ASH Poker, which gets its name from being a fusion of Stud and Hold'em Poker.  It is a game in the poker family, which adds auctioning off draw cards so players may fill and improve their hands.  It borrows the dealer button, and large and small blinds from Texas Hold'em and also each player having their own set of cards from Stud Poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, after the big and small blinds are set, and cards are dealt, there is a round of betting.  After this, draw cards are auctioned off, with money paid to obtain draw cards put in the pot.  After this, another round of betting occurs.  High hand takes the pot, or high hands split the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a number of variants that vary the number of draw cards and rounds of draw cards per hand, and also determine whether or not there are limits on bids and bets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
