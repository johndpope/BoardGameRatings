			<description>Description from the Publisher's website @&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.borderlinegames.com/hopoff.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.borderlinegames.com/hopoff.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's geography hopscotch - hop on and you're off and learning about the geography of the United States!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play with one or more teams!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each player's turn, a team leader draws one state card from the deck. Standing on either the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean side, the player has three chances to toss the bean bag onto that state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the player has succeeded in tossing the beanbag onto his target state, he hops from one ocean, across the map, naming aloud each state he hops on as he &amp;quot;travels&amp;quot; - that way everyone is learning their United States geography! When he reaches a state that borders his target state, he retrieves the beanbag and continues hopping off to the ocean on the other side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team wins when it has &amp;quot;traveled&amp;quot; to all 48 contiguous states!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time your team for even more fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play with the capitals only, or with both the states and the capitals for a real challenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
