			<description>THE ABRAXAS ADVENTURE SERIES No. 1: Assault On The Astral Rift&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure enthusiasts, take heart! The ultimate adventure series has arrived. ASSAULT ON THE ASTRAL RIFT is the first in the new ABRAXAS Adventure Series and you'll not soon tire of its many challenges. It's a multiplayer adventure, also playable by a single player, with graphics and music unlike any seen or heard before. Imagine, really being able to read minds, to think in totally foreign languages, and to work together toward the ultimate goal of saving our universe. Imagine an adventure game different with each play. Isn't this why you bought your computer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a member of a small, select band of people with a crucial secret, charged with the responsibility of maintaining the universe as we know it. One of your group has discovered the existence of alternate universes, populated by creatures known on Earth only by our legends. Far worse was the discovery that some of them have learned to travel between the many universes, and, in doing so, have weakened the fabric of our universe. They must be stopped, and you and your comrades are the only ones who can do it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your quest begins in a huge stone castle recently converted to a hotel. The guests left abruptly when strange occurrences began, but you know the real nature of these strange events. Time is crucial, and you'll have to begin your journey now. The time holes have begun to open, the first sign of the weakening of the fabric or our universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
