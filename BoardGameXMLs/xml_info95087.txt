			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern-ORC is made up of two parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter One is the modern-world skills, careers, equipment, advantages and disadvantages found in In Dark Alleys minus all the supernatural-stuff. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s all the stuff one would need to play a mundane, real-world, modern-day ORC game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter Two is Organic Rule Components, the ruleset found in all Vajra Enterprises Role Playing Games, including Fates Worse Than Death, Tibet: The Roleplaying Game and In Dark Alleys. ORC was designed specifically:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     To have every rule work from the same basic mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;     For dramatic, character-centered, ultra-realistic play.&lt;br/&gt;     To allow character classes that are realistically flexible.&lt;br/&gt;     To allow scaled complexity (so if a PC wants to cook something it takes a simple roll, but if a PC is hacking a computer he or she has several strategies and possible modifiers).&lt;br/&gt;     To have combat be realistically lethal and give players many real-life strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
