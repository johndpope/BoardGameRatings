			<description>User Notes: An adventure for characters level 7-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the elven forest of Myereth, ancient rowan trees spread white boughs above a sacred site. Pillars of stone twist like some strange form of vine, curling among the branches and reflecting the light of a silvery moon. The forest is silent, and beautiful, protected since the dawn of time by a powerful Unicorn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elven forest of Myereth is well known throughout the world as a safe haven of good and peace, a place where evil cannot stand to enter and where the trees weep healing tears upon those injured within its boundaries. Any player character elves know of the forest, its healing properties, and its legendary beauty. They may have heard of it as a legend, or they may have visited its mystic shrine when they were children, brought among on a pilgrimage by other elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But something has gone terribly wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
