			<description>Sushifuda is a sushi-inspired take on the traditional Hanafuda matching card game from Japan. However, instead of featuring plants and flowers like traditional Hanafuda, Sushifuda depicts kawaii-style sushi art! Collect the most points by matching sushi types and use bonus sashimi 3-card combos for extra points to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 12 suits which represent the 12 months, each month containing 4 cards depicting the type of sushi for that month. 2 cards typically are point cards in the suit while the remaining two are normally chaff (no points). There is one wild card called the Gaji or Lightning card which allows you to take non-matching cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games can play with from 2-6 players playing singly or in teams, each round lasting only about 10 minutes. Quick, fast-paced, easy fun from ages 7 and up! You can also play a solo variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are marked for Sakura-style play, with point totals and months designated on the cards for instant recognition. Also included are reference cards containing the sashimi bonus point 3-card combos (also known as Yaku). Reference cards are double-sided standard poker playing card size while the main suits cards, which total 48 in number, are half the size, based on traditional Hanafuda. This allows for great portability and also a smaller footprint on your table while playing. All cards and the tuck box come UV coated and linen finished, made of the same cardstock as Magic: The Gathering. Great art collectible, playable cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
