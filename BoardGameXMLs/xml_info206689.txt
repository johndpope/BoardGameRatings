			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The route to the wintering grounds has been planned. As the adult narwhal(s), lure and shepherd the curious young narwhals along the way in time to get the tastiest fish. These are separate solitaire/co-op rules made to use the same components as Arctic Dash: A Narwhal Race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You (and an optional second player) are trying to get 2 young narwhals from the start tile, across a short two tiles, to the end tile on the other side. Though not far, the child narwhals movement is dice driven, and they will frequently wander towards seaweed and interesting fish along the path, instead of where you may wish. The board grows organically to provide more distractions as the child narwhals roam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a roll of your own movement dice, you (and your optional second player) can pick up fish to lure the children, clear seaweed to remove distractions, and nudge the children along the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With luck, and no small amount of planning, you and the young narwhals will have plenty of tasty fish for the season!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
