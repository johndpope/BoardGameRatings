							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">We Can&#039;t Find Shakespeare&#039;s Head</name>
									
			<description>Author's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funeral is in forty minutes. There's going to be a huge procession and a play at the graveside. Everything's in order, except for one thing: you can't find Shakespeare's head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who could possibly have taken it? What sort of sick, money-grubbing, fame-seeking lowlife would do such a thing? After all, the only people here are actors, fans, and producers... and the&lt;br/&gt;Queen. You have to find the head before the funeral, or the Queen will take yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;Players draw randomly whether they are actor, producer or fan. Everybody draws two accusations and one excuse (they come with the game). Playing time is 40 minutes: You will not find the head, but you'll find out who is the unlucky one who will have to pay for the fact that it is missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
