			<description>Each player has a set of 4 aunts that start in his or her corner of the board. The goal is to move the aunts around the board to the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; section. Movement is determined by a die. All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others aunts. Captured aunts are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over. The green shortcuts may only be used to capture other aunts. If an aunt gets on the same space as another aunt of the same color, they get stacked one on another and form a double-aunt. The double-aunt may move twice the rolled number of spaces. The winner is the first player to move all aunts &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Variant: When an aunt captures another aunt she is stacked on top and the captured aunt has to carry the opponent aunt (mixed double-aunt) and may move only half the rolled numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
