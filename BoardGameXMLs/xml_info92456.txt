			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henry the Fifth, or The Life of King Henry the Fifth as it is officially titled, is one of Shakespeare's histories of the English monarchy. Written and first performed in 1599, during a time of strife and unrest, Henry the Fifth is a classic work of patriotic propaganda. Queen Elizabeth I had ruled for forty years without ever taking a husband or getting an heir, and was well beyond child-bearing years; this led to a sense of uncertainty for the future. A rebellion in Ireland was gaining success against royal forces. Would this inspire the irascible Scots to launch a revolt of their own? And what of the Welsh, who had bent knees to the Norman kings longer than any? The ever-present twin threats of Spain and France loomed large in the minds of all Englishmen and women when set against such circumstances. England needed a hero. Shakespeare gave it one. This RPG sourcebook focus on the history and setting of this well known Shakespeare piece and how to integrate it into your regular local gaming session. This 12 page sourcebook also comes with several adventures seed with different endings to this classic play. You have read the dramatic piece, now play the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
