							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drunk Sloppoly</name>
									
			<description>As opposed to most published &amp;quot;drinking games&amp;quot;, Drunk Sloppoly is a party game created by people who actually party. This is so much more than a drinking version of Monopoly...this game has four categories of cards that include group games, drunken duels, Puzzle bottle caps, alcohol trivia, sobriety tests and much more. The game also comes with four spinable wheels with different themes to flavor your party experience (sweet, sexy, fun, and evil). The game is intended for coed audiences 21+ and is &amp;quot;Not Recommended to be Played with Alcohol&amp;quot;. There are alternate rules included if you're not in the company of people who like to kiss and remove articles of clothing. This game is ridiculous and fun and best with 4-8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes: the board and box, rules, bar deeds, 130+ game cards, 8 game pieces, 4 wheels that attach to the board, 2 dice, and 30 second timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
