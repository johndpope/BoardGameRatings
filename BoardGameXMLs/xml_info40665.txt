			<description>Claude Soucie's minimalist card game of outsmarting the opponent. A small deck of 10 cards is dealt to two players. One card per player is put face down then revealed. The higher card wins, unless the smaller card divides it evenly, or is one less than the higher. After five tricks the hands are swapped and played again. Whoever takes the most tricks wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar to Pico and Pico 2, but predates both by at least 15 years. It was published in Sid Sackson's Card Games Around the World in 1981.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ten card deck consists of 2-10 and 12. A longer version can be played with fourteen cards and seven tricks, using 2-10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18. A normal deck of cards can be used, with one suit for 2-10 and another for 12 and higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
