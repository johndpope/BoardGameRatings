							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Temple of Air</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fantastic building, then called &amp;quot;Shrine of the Wise Forefathers&amp;quot; was created during the last days of the Empire by a powerful shaman using conjured spirits. It was financed by a rich bureaucrat who wanted to dedicate it to his ancestors. In fact, he built a statue for each of his known forefathers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, he was killed during the civil war when a horde of aberrations attacked his home. The temple was infested by the foul creatures of the shadow plane and was considered haunted ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15 years ago, a wandering wu jen - Floating Fox - greatly interested in air magic and allied to several spirits found the temple and when the evil inhabitants attacked her, she decided to clear out every single one of them and take over the place as her new base of operations. After a month of guerilla warfare, she was able to settle here. Awed by the site's properties, she named it the &amp;quot;Temple of Air&amp;quot; and started using it for both research and her raids on the surrounding villages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
