							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guilt and Frustration</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game all male and are defined by Relationships and Characteristics.  Relationships function somewhat like Attributes in other games - each character has four (Mother, Father, Girlfriend, and Boss).  Each Relationship also has an Expectation and a conflicting Desire, both narrative tags.  Every Expectation and Desire has an associated numeric rating, distributed from two points pools.  Characteristics are areas of expertise, and each character may select three.  Conflict resolution uses a modified d20 roll compared to a target difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
