			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue #25: Metamorphosis I&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In poetry, the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly describes how something ugly becomes uniquely beautiful. But in nature metamorphosis is common as living things change forms over their life cycles. And this change is not just traditional fairy tale beauty: maggots become flies, tadpoles become frogs, and chest bursters become alien warriors. The eight creature sets in this issue show how very dissimilar creatures can be the same species, just young or mature forms. Each entry uses either the animate seeds plant mutation; a new version for animals called larval form; or the idea of forced metamorphosis. The last is a version of the mutation modifier environmental dependence, one that permanently changes one creature into another when the original is exposed to certain stimuli. Some of the creature entries also use several new mutations, and these are included at the end of the issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
