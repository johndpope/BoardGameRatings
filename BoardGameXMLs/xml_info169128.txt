			<description>From the first page of the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations! It&amp;rsquo;s a Match! In Group Date, you will play two people going on their first three dates after being matched with one another on a popular dating website. You don&amp;rsquo;t know too much &lt;br/&gt;about each other yet, but the algorithm says you&amp;rsquo;re 98% compatible! What could go wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group Date is a game for 3-9 people, that takes about two hours to play, including time for setting up and a short debrief. It &lt;br/&gt;requires one or two facilitators, depending on if you have an odd- or even-numbered group. The game consists of two warm-up activities, five scenes, and a short debrief afterwards for &lt;br/&gt;players to swap stories, share their reactions, and ease out of character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
