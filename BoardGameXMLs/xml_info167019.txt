							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder Party Ã  Manhattan</name>
									
			<description>Murder Party &amp;agrave; Manhattan is a crime investigation boardgame for 1 to 16 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are plying either alone or in teams. Each team stands for an official police or law enforcement department : NYPD, NY State Police, FBI, NSA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is turn based. It plays on a map of Manhattan. At your turn, chose where you want to move your pawn to, following the subway lines available. Each move costs points. Depending on where you stop, you open the enveloppe related to this point, that is for example the interrogation of a witness or suspect, or other information that you get in order to solve a case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At your turn, you can also stop the game instead of moving. In this case, all teams must write down their conclusions, and then open the &amp;quot;Solution&amp;quot; enveloppe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each good answer, you get points. For each false anwser, you lose points. If you stopped the game, you get a bonus. If you used the most transportation points, you get a malus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player or team with the most points wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
