							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon World Missing Paths: Barbarian</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is best in Life?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Civilization is a lie the weak hide behind. The world honors only strength, be it of blade or will. For you, there is anger, fury from behind your heart. Where you go, blood spills like water, and man and beast alike cower before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world behind the walls, they measure worth not by might, but by metal discs. So be it. These &amp;lsquo;dungeons&amp;rsquo; offer a hunt worthy of you, worthy of your might. To live in the moment, to let red haze overtake you, to laugh at Death and call him friend; to do this is to truly live For you are The Barbarian!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love the old feel, new rules of the award-winning Dungeon World, but reached the end of the book?  Need a break from your long campaign with a one-shot but don&amp;rsquo;t want to give up the themes and character classes you love?  Dungeon World Missing Paths adapts and reimagines your favorite classic and modern fantasy archetypes into the high-speed rules-lite Dungeon World system as a series of playbooks: standalone character classes streamlined enough that the entire class and its progression can fit on the character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
