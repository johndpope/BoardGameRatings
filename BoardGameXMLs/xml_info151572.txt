			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast breeding and adaptable, Goblins are an incredibly diverse species. The little folk have adapted to every known environment, from the arctic tundra to the warrens of the world's largest and most crowded city-states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Got that right. My clan's been in this damn city since they first laid the bricks, and my great to the tenth power grandma stole that fool mason's tools!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get the low-down on all aspects of playing a Goblin in the Pathfinder RPG right from their very own mouth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now the humans say we're dirty minded. Well, they're right. But we got other sides too. Lets see, I really like stealin' almost as much as babymakin'. Not just because I get something new and shiny if'n I steal good, but because me takin' something you was guarding means that you and your big kind can't deny I beat you. I just love out smarting the big folk, and what else...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This nine page PDF gives you all the insight needed to get inside the head of your next Goblin Player Character, or to breath life into the next group of Goblins your players face!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
