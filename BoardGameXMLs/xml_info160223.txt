							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Problem at Formid</name>
									
			<description>From the adventure's background section:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for the ALTERNITY&amp;reg; game and takes place in a futuristic PL 7 space-opera setting.  It can be adapted for the STAR*DRIVE&amp;trade; Campaign Setting with few changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formid Station is a research and observation facility located in orbit around the planet Formid Prime, located in a system several light years from Earth. The station is owned by Vector Developments, a privately owned Earth-based corporation. It was designed to gather information on Formid Prime and monitor the activities of the various indigenous lifeforms to determine whether the world could support human colonies without significantly impacting the global ecology. The station was intended to relay planetary readings back to Earth every 48 hours. However, as might be expected, there is a problem.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;All transmissions from the station ceased two months ago, and attempts to contact the station&amp;rsquo;s research team have failed. The heroes are sent to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
