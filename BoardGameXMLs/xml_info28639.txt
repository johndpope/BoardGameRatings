			<description>Each player starts the game in charge of a small wine trading company with contacts to wineries in three different countries. Your company is represented on the board by a wine merchant and a buyer. These pawns move around the board in hope of buying fine wines and their requisite grapes. A wine and grape combination together form an agency.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has at least six agencies representing at least five different countries. But the winner is the one with the most successful company, i.e. the highest monetary value of combined resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
