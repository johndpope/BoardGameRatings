							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roger Maris Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>The Roger Maris Baseball Game published by Play-Rite Inc. in 1962. This Roger Maris Game has to be one of the best post-war baseball board games in the hobby. This game is different than the Maris game made by Pressman during the same year. This game was issued by Play-Rite Games of Jeffersonville IN. The box cover has two awesome pictures of Maris in his Yankees uniform. The board pictures him twice, too. the best part of the game though, are the cards. Each card has a picture of Maris &amp;amp; his facsimile autograph.   The game includes a fabulous board, a cardboard score board, a ball &amp;amp; strike indicator  and 88 cards to control the action. A better description  will come from:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yahoo Group ---- Baseball Games Group;antique baseball games to modern tabletop sims&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;at the following site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://members.aol.com/Butch7999/BbTitles.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://members.aol.com/Butch7999/BbTitles.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
