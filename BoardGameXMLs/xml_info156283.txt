			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All radio frequency communications have been jammed in the Northern Hemisphere.  Imagine the trouble this is causing: everything from cellular phones to GPS systems to anti-espionage satellite communications&amp;hellip; all silent.  Nobody is claiming responsibility, and nations are starting to suspect one another.  Governments are scrambling to establish land-line communication paths to their armies.  The world is a powder keg just waiting for a spark; things are going to escalate soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operatives are sent to Sisimut, Greenland, to meet up with a local pilot-for-hire.  Tech-Ops suspects the RF jamming might be originating in the Arctic Circle.  They are just supposed to be on a recon mission to gather intel, they aren't supposed to engage the enemy.  Unfortunately, nobody told the bad guys!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Covert Ops assignment for a team of low-rank operatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
