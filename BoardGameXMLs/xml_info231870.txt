			<description>Observation, memory and swiftness are required to build imaginary and colorful lighthouses, over the 5 levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, a &amp;quot;Lighthouse&amp;quot; pattern card is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;Each player try to stack wooden pieces (mainly wooden discs) of the correct shape and color from a common supply. &lt;br/&gt;The fastest player to complete his lighthouse put a stop to the round, and his &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; is verified. Be it correct, the player keeps the Lighthouse card as a reward. Be it incorrect, he has to discard a previously acquired Lighthouse card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player with a certain amount of Lighthouses card wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced levels introduce more variety of colors and wooden discs thickness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
