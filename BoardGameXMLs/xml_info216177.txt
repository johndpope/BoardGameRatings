			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Order of the Goat is an introductory adventure that is 1/3 of a mini campaign designed to take a group of PCs on the road to 6th level. The Kingdom of Neville is an aging monarchy that is currently being attacked from all sides. The current threat that the PCs will be dealing with is a group of brigands known as &amp;ldquo;The Triad&amp;rdquo;. This group is coming out of the wastelands and are attempting to cut the kingdom in half so that they can take it as their own. This adventure offers a wide area to be investigate with multiple encounters of varying difficulty. While best used in conjunction with the other adventures, it can easily be dissected as one-shots or as a quick scenario in your own campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a 4-6 adventurers of 1st level and a DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
