			<description>Does the stupidest farmer have the biggest potatoes? Not in this game! This is because the clever cultivation of beds, which is about the meaningful juxtaposition (mixed culture, plant friendliness) and succession (fruit sequence), leads to a sumptuous harvest and thus to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Players systematically grow vegetables, fruit and herbs. They plant according to the garden calendar and promote the growth of their plants. However, a lot has to be taken into account. Are they low or flat rooted, weak, medium or heavy consuming? Does the plant have a long or short growth period? In addition, weather caprioles, beneficial insects and pests, the neighbor or other imponderables can influence the tranquil gardener life.&lt;br/&gt;Game objective: The players try to &amp;quot;harvest&amp;quot; as many self-planted as also by other players placed plant cards. Whoever has the greatest harvest yields is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
