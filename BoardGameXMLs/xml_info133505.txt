			<description>Based on the Disney TV series, this game has players moving Bonkers and Fall Apart Rabbit around the board collecting different colored footprints. The first person to collect three footprints of the color determined by the magnifying glass is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a basic roll and move game, but you get to choose whether you move Bonkers or Fall Apart who are on two different tracks. Landing on different squares can change the color goal, cause you to trade footprints with other players, reverse direction and other zany trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instructions: Bonkers D. Bobcat and his sidekick, Fall Apart Rabbit, are about to solve another Tinseltown caper! join this wacky duo on their crime-busting adventure as they track suspicious footprints along 2 fun gamepaths. Will you be the one to help them snatch 3 matching &amp;quot;prints&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
