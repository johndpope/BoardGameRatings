							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">March 2014: Sandstorm</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alhameed ran as fast as he could, clawing for leverage up a large sand bank as the manipulative material forced him back down for every foot he gained. He had managed to escape the riots outside of Cairo, it was worse than any political riot he had even seen. It started out that way, another demonstration out in the square. When the screams started, he thought it was just the riot police firing more of the gas canisters they had bombarded them with earlier. Then people started to eat each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now miles out of the city, his camel had been taken down by &amp;lsquo;something&amp;rsquo; that had leapt up from the sand, and now there was several men with rifles and carbines looking for him&amp;hellip; for God Knows What.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As his feet finally got traction on something harder than loose sand. He flung his back against a hard column. He could hear the yells of the men below pointing out his trail going up the slope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Alhameed turned around to noticed the huge gaping hole of the unearthed tomb before him. He froze in indecision. There was excavational materials strewn around, and tape blocking entrance has snapped and was now flapping in the breeze. Was that also smears of blood along the inside wall of the entrance? He had to decide, was his superstition stronger than his desire to be shot?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
