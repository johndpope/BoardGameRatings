			<description>Magical Square is a 'paper and pencil&amp;rsquo; puzzle game started from the 'Match 3' games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a sheet with a 7x7 table and plays the game simultaneously. The game master draws and reveals 3 number cards from the deck, then each player records them in order. After that, players can check 3 or more numbers which are same or continuous in a row horizontally, or vertically, and gain some points according to the quantity of the numbers he/she checked. The player checked numbers take a bonus number, then gets a chance of additional check. When a player checks fixed times, he/she gain some special ability which would be useful for the game. The game ends when every player couldn't record the numbers, then the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
