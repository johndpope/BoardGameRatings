			<description>Conspiracies is the first installment in the Conspiracies series of full motion video adventure games. Conspiracies was developed by Anima Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the 21st century, where the human population suffers from a number of problems, including overpopulation, poverty, organized crime, and depression. Earth has dissolved into a federation of cities. The game is specifically set in Greece, where each city-state has its own governor and local government. However, this is overshadowed by a coalition of political lobbies, the big companies, the organized crime, that imposes their own reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nick Delios, the protagonist, was originally in the academic world, but left it after being kicked out of his team. He eventually becomes a detective, specializing in cases of industrial espionage. When Thanos Pekas, Police Inspector and an old friend, asks him unofficially to help him solve a murder case of a small time crook, Delios accepts. He soon learns that the case is far more complex than he thought, involving multiple conspiracies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Conspiracies (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
