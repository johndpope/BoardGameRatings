							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Umbra &amp; Mirn</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the 12th era of the Cosmic Mirror, a 4 million year old cosmic artifact that has seen 14 unique eras. Here in the 12th era, two worlds thrive on opposite sides of the mirror, intrinsically linked by the movements of the suns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the shadowed and ephemeral world of Umbra, you live in the wilds of the world and interact with the spirit denizens of the natural order. In the mirrored and silvery world of Mirn, you thrive in the several nations among high society, and utilize the natural and lightning fueled technology that your world spawns, called techolony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes this era particularly unique is the intrinsic soul bindings between the denizens of each world. As the green sun sets in Umbra, your adventure there is put on pause, and the story you had set aside in Mirn re-ignites. This soul connection is important to the game, as it allows your two character to share experiences, memories, items, and unique powers! This especially drives home the importance of unique events, characters, and interactions, as those very things are passed back and forth between your characters as they enter their dream cycle. Beyond this, your dreaming character can pass forth their dream logic to grant reality-bending powers to their waking other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play two unique characters across two fascinating worlds, or change it up, play one character who has become unbound and passes between their world and this new and foreign world, where their soul-tethered other once lived. The simple Attribute + Specialties system ensures your game begins quickly, while the unique attributes to each world help solidify the uniqueness of those same worlds. In Umbra, commune and command the spirits, and in Mirn, engage with and manipulate the naturally occuring techolony of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
