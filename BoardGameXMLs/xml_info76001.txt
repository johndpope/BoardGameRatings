			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battletech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception was a turn-based adventure/RPG game released in 1988 by Westwood Studios and based on the BattleTech  franchise.  It was one of the first commercial ports of the licence, and featured some of the franchise's worlds, institutions, political figures, and weapons, particularly the three-story tall Battlemechs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of Jason Youngblood, a young cadet MechWarrior  stationed on Pacifica (also known as Chara III) in the Lyran Commonwealth. Stationed at the Citadel, Jason is learning how to pilot a Battlemech and also to fight with small arms, all the while having to live up to the reputation of his hero father, Jeremiah. During a training session in his 'Mech, the Citadel comes under attack from neighbouring star-empire the Draconis Combine, slaying the Palace guard, Jeremiah apparently among them. Barely escaping, Jason is rescued from arrest by Draconis Police by Rex Pearce, a friend and colleague of Jeremiah's and a member of the Crescent Hawks. Together they must find and join up with fellow members of the Crescent Hawks, a special forces company established by Jeremiah and the Archon Katrina working in conjunction with the mercenary unit, the Kell Hounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
