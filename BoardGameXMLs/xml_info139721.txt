							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wycliffe Game</name>
									
			<description>This game was created by the Wycliffe Bible Translators, an organization with the goal of translating the Bible into every language on earth, to give potential recruits an idea of the hazards, obstacles and rewards of working for Wycliffe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though there is no publication date, the game appears to be from the 1970s or '80s.  It is primarily a roll-and-move game in which players must start on an inner (or Home Country) track and amass items, knowledge, funds and supporters that will allow them to proceed to an outer (or Tribal Work) track, where they must overcome various trials and be the first to finish their translation.  While the mechanic seems to be mainly roll-and-move, there are a few decisions that may add a small element of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game box: &amp;quot;Taste the problems &amp;amp; joys of a Bible Translator--without getting your feet muddy.  First, getting training and support at home.  Then language work and pioneering abroad.  Real-life incidents to help or hinder.  The first to complete St. Mark's Gospel wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
