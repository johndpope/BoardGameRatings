			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Accursed&amp;hellip; Sharing their Doom with a Universe that Rejected Them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And Cain said, Lord, my punishment is more than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Genesis 4: 13-17&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Afflicted, Forsaken, Mindscarred, Spellburned, Witchmarked&amp;hellip; the source of the curse may be different, but all accursed draw power from their individual rejection, and place their ruination upon those who would oppose them.
