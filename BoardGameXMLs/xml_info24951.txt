			<description>The board shows 4 harbors on the corners and the pirate's island in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays the pirate and the other players take the role of normal seamen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The normal players have a home harbor and 5 ships, which are loaded with 5 different goods. When a ship successfully reaches a foreign harbor, the good is sold and the player collects the income. The unloaded ships must all return to their home harbors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pirate had only 1 ship. He tries to capture ships and steal the goods, if they are carrying freight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is very unusual; it is done with the help of wooden sticks of 3 different lengths. How many sticks can be taken is determined with a die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when all ships are either captured or back in their home harbor. The richest player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
