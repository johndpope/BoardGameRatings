Includes classes, monsters, gods, kingdoms of adventure and many, many hand-rendered Very Very Old School style maps. For gaming the way it was! Requires an Old School rule system to play (specifically designed for Castles &amp;amp; Crusades by Troll Lords Publishing but also easily converted for use with OSRIC, Labyrinth Lord, Legends of the Flame Princess, Dark Dungeons, and Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry, among others) &lt;br/&gt;From the overview:&lt;br/&gt; The World of Lingusia is an immense realm, a legendary planet forged at the moment of creation by great, primal beings. Its history is one of perpetual discovery, magic, danger, and conflict. It is, in short, ideally suited for tales of high adventure, intrigue, and exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This setting is based on Tori Bergquist's personal campaign setting and there are support materials (maps and campaign notebooks) available for download.  The setting has developed over thirty years of gaming and has been used with several rules systems during that time: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Dragonquest, Runequest, GURPS, C&amp;C and T&amp;T.  The current, published form of the setting is designed for use with C&amp;C.  There are setting locations suggested for several TSR-era adventure modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting book features a section of house rules that have a distinct old-school flavour, the house rules section (for C&amp;C) is also available separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
