			<description>Christopher Raven as a young Scottish boy boarded a ship with his family bound for the New World to escape the famine of the late 17th century. Near Jamaica their ship was attacked by ruthless pirates and Christopher Raven was left the sole survivor. Having lost his left hand then, Christopher sets off on the road to vengeance to find the scoundrels who murdered his family, a journey that might see him lose his soul too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems for 'Fear' and 'Notoriety' make the world around you react to your actions and choices. Killing enemies makes you accumulate 'Fear' which you can use to scare enemies away or as a super attack. The consequence is that everyone in range becomes hostile if you didn't scare them off. 'Notoriety' is increased as you do your murderous thing and similar to Assassin's Creed II&amp;rsquo;s notoriety system with posters on the wall you can rip off. Opponents bleed and suffer which affects the moral aspects of the game. Pirate charms will let you become invincible, summon ravens to rip enemies to shreds, boost attack speed and damage, and even cast some magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Cry,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Cry,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
