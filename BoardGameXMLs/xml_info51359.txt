			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is two independent 32-page booklets bound into the same cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Swamp Thing Sourcebook&lt;br/&gt;     Swamp Thing in Racing With The Rats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For nearly twenty years, Swamp Thing has been the definitive horror comics series, with its constant innovations and outstanding stories. It has been almost uniquely responsible for the new renaissance in graphic storytelling. Now, this outstanding work is detailed for use with the DC HEROES Role-Playing Game in this Swamp Thing sourcebook and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 32-page Swamp Thing Sourcebook presents the reader with a detailed history of Swamp Thing, with progressive sets of game statistics that reflect his abilities at different stages of his existence. All of Swamp Thing's powers are explained in detail, to allow players to capture the essence of the comic book series in role-playing. Also featured are game statistics and role-playing information on Swamp Thing's supporting cast, including Abby Cable, John Constantine, Anton Arcane, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the full-length solitaire adventure, Racing With the Rats, Swamp Thing is infected by toxic waste, and plunged into a horrific hallucinatory world, where he becomes trapped in a deadly delusion. The player must try to maintain his grip on sanity long enough to reverse the damage and return to reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
