			<description>From the box description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Touching Tunes - Magical Musical Game&lt;br/&gt;Ages: 4 to 8&lt;br/&gt;Number of Players 2 to 4&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Touching Tunes electronic game board, 2 double-sided game board inserts, 4 song cards, 21 chips, a deck of 25 double-sided cards, a deck of 21 double-sided cards, 4 Care Bear movers&lt;br/&gt;Approximate Playing Time: 15 minutes per player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Care Bears are here! And it's no surprise- cause when they're not touching others with happy feelings, they're playing TOUCHING TUNES with special friends like you!&lt;br/&gt;Touching Tunes unique electronic game board is filled with musical fun- all at the touch of a finger.&lt;br/&gt;Just gather 'round the TOUCHING TUNES game board and choose any one of the 6 Care Bears activities. Touch any of the spots on the board. Then ask a friend to lend a helping hand, maybe an ear- even a nose- for you to touch. When your friend touches the TOUCHING TUNES board, one of 4 songs will play. Familiar songs like HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR, and ROCK-A-BYE BABY. If the tune matches your song card, you're on your way to winning the game!&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 fun-filled Care Bear games in all. Some specially designed for the younger player- others for the more advanced. And each one invites players to use elementary skills such as counting, matching, and spelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1: Birthday Bear Buddies. Try to match up, by number or pictures, as many birthday cakes as you can whenever you here the &amp;quot;Happy Birthday&amp;quot; tune.&lt;br/&gt;Game 2: Color Me Care Bear. Make a Care Bear face complete by trying to win the right cards when you here your special song.&lt;br/&gt;Game 3: Care Bear All-Star Spellers. You'll be right in tune with the Care Bears if you can spell C-A-R-E or B-E-A-R before everyone else does.&lt;br/&gt;Game 4: The Care Bear Five. All 5 Bears come into play as you try to win cards of the same color- or a combination of colors- to complete one bear.&lt;br/&gt;Game 5: Race to Care-A-Lot. Here, you're on the road to Care-A-Lot, moving your Care Bear token closer to home every time your song is played. Reach the castle first and you're the winner!&lt;br/&gt;Game 6: Care Bear Collection. This is a special collection for Care Bears ONLY- and that means no Dr. Coldheart! Collect all 5 Bears while keeping the Dr. Coldheart card out in the cold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
