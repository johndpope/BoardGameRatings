							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Your Whispering Homunculus</name>
									
			<description>from the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Whispering Homonculus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A twisted creature hops onto your desk; the homunculi is grotesque, a vile leathery thing of insect and rat and slime topped with a doll's face.  It hops onto your shoulder and whispers in an ear, &amp;quot;But master, what happens if...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello, Game Master!  Ignore the dollar amount printed on this book, for it is literally priceless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For starts, author Richard Pett has made each copy by hand, mixing a paste out of dead flakes of his own skin and the rheum from his watery eyes (betraying his Innsmouth heritage), and pressing it into pages that he then inscribes with a pen made from the quill of the Dire Porcupine and the ink of the Dread Squid.  No two volumes are alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, but the ideas within its pages...that is where this book's true value lies.  Peruse its contents and your players will soon find themselves in a world of whimsy, terror, and madness as they:&lt;br/&gt;   *  Must accept a dare to kiss a diseased cow on its oozing, boil-plagued lips.&lt;br/&gt;   *  Are driven out of town for ordering roast chicken during the feast of the Staggering Crow&lt;br/&gt;   *  Encounter a goblin king who is covered in goose fat, collects cat tails, and rolls around in an imaginary barrel&lt;br/&gt;   *  Choke down a meal of stewed dormice with greengage jam&lt;br/&gt;   *  Recoil at the taint of the Troll-Touched&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intrigued?  Then make your way to the cash register, and demand that the Game Store Knave ring up your purchase.  Soon you shall have your very own Whispering Homunculus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
