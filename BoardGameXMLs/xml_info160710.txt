			<description>From the rear page of the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Effective simulation of a Car Rally....Map Rally is an enjoyable set of programs suitable for children aged between seven and thirteen. There are full instructions which guide the user simply but effectively.&amp;quot; Educational Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the description page inside the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Somewhere on a grid are three hidden checkpoints. The navigator can only give the rough direction in which they lie. The car is moved across the grid by giving instructions as to where it needs to go to. When the checkpoint is found, the player must check in. A player can race against the clock or two cars can race against each other. Children soon become used to using co-ordinates and compass directions to control the cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program records the time and number of moves taken. After the rally, the children can watch the cars drive around each route taken showing how well each car did.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
