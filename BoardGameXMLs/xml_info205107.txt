			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the aching darkness beneath, terrible things await.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disparate and desperate monstrosities smile with human lips, call with human tongues, and weave their spidery webs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They mostly mean no harm, but they are wrong, so very wrong. Their pleasant pleas and plaintive question germinate strange maladies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They only wish you to be happy, like them. Won&amp;rsquo;t you smile with them, friend?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smile with Us, Friend&amp;hellip; is a 22 page weird-sad adventure location written with Lamentations of the Flame Princess in mind. With almost no effort it can be converted to whatever game you prefer, but you probably already knew that. (Note that this adventure assumes a silver standard; convert SP values straight into gold if that's how you roll.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF itself is sized in trade paperback 6x9 format which means it reads excellently on even small tablets. In fact, it is made to be run easily from a tablet. The whole of the adventure is heavily cross-linked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that if one part of the adventure references some other section, a touch or a click on the page brings the GM to what&amp;rsquo;s needed. Additionally, at the bottom of every page, a black box contains links to pages which will be frequently referred to: such as the location map, encounter chart, and table of contents (all of which are also hyperlinked).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, a separate PDF contains printable bits, useful to a GM/DM/Ref. Also included are plain image files of important things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than a dozen described &amp;ldquo;rooms&amp;rdquo;, 9 NPCs, and a great many disconcerting possibilities await intrepid and murdersome vagrants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
