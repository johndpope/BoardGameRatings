			<description>From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You notice one of the built in bookcases against the back wall of your uncle's study sticks out apart from the others. It must be a secret passageway. You pry loose the bookcases away from the wall. Sure enough, there is a dusty, cobweb-lined passageway into the darkness. The footsteps are closer now; you have to do something. Rushing to the window, you look down. There is a six inch ledge and beyond that a twenty foot drop.&lt;br/&gt;Life as an orphan has always been lonely, but your Uncle Morgan  has been able to provide you with many wonderful luxuries- your own motorcycle, trips around the world, and life in a mansion. But you actually know nothing about Morgan, and his secrets make you suspicious. Could he be a spy, or a jewel thief? A brilliant novelist researching a murder mystery? Or has something terrible happened to your only family member left?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
