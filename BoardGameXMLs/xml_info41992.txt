			<description>The Star Gate is a deduction game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and its Nocturne Expansion.  Players take turns being the encoder, who selects a card from her hand for people to guess.  The other players are decoders, and take turns being the lead decoder.  As more people have had a shot at being lead decoder, more clues become available to the decoders who still haven't guessed; however the potential points for guessing the card correctly also decrease.  Additionally, there's a little bluffing in the game, because the encoder may choose not to answer a query.  The encoder scores points for deceiving the decoders; loses points for making an error.  The decoders score points for correctly guessing the card's identity - more for doing it earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Star Gate is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and the Nocturne Expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
