							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fistful of Lead: Horse &amp; Musket</name>
									
			<description>Fistful of Lead: Horse &amp;amp; Musket was designed as a quick set of tabletop wargame rules for skirmishes in the age of Black Powder. The rules can be learned within a couple of turns and still keep the flavor of the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What separates Fistful of Lead from most tabletop miniature games on the market, is the unique card driven turn mechanism. This leads to snap decisions and tense moments where all the players are involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Fistful of Lead, we wanted the play to be fast and furious, with a Hollywood flair to it. For that reason, record keeping is kept to a bare minimum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most games, each player can control up to 5-6 miniatures without much trouble. Games can have up to 8 players without slowing down the game. Now, you can try out different periods within the Horse and Musket era without spending a ton of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experienced wargamers and new players alike will enjoy this game. It's perfect for convention games and just one on one skirmishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Fistful of Lead: Horse &amp;amp; Musket you&amp;rsquo;ll need: this rule book (or, after a few games just the Quick Reference sheet), several 10-sided-dice, an ordinary deck of playing cards, a place to play, a measuring tape, and the miniatures representing your favorite troops. Markers to represent whether your models are Wounded or need to Reload can be found in this rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight-sided and 12-sided dice may also be needed for some of the advanced optional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fistful of Lead: Horse &amp;amp; Musket was written with 28mm figures in mind, but you can easily use models ranging from 15mm to 54mm without any changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
