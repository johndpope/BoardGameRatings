			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Book for Characters and Players&lt;br/&gt;All the flavor text contained in this book is written in with the idea that Fifty New Ways to Turn Things into Other Things is not only available to the players, but also to their characters. A character can buy this book, prepare the spells from it, and gain knowledge of the flavor text. The spellbook is written by Starlanko the Magnificent, a powerful wizard and experienced salesman who lives in a generic fantasy world. Details for the cost of Fifty New Ways to Turn Things into Other Things in your campaign world can be found on another sidebar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flavor text is also designed to spark campaign ideas for adventures and NPCs. The names of kingdoms or historical events can be easily changed to reflect your campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Greetings and thank you for purchasing Fifty New Ways to Turn Things into Other Things: Starlanko the Magnificent&amp;rsquo;s Book of Transmutation. I, of course, am Starlanko the Magnificent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second book in the Fifty New Ways to... series. For years I sold spells one at a time. I dreamed of compiling a collection such as this, but since each wizard&amp;rsquo;s arcane writings are different, such mass production was difficult. Until now. Thanks to a revolutionary spell notation system you can easily prepare spells directly from this book without transferring it to your own book. If you enjoyed this volume, you may wish to pick up a copy of my previous text, Fifty New Ways to Blow Stuff Up, and keep you eyes peeled for future installments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
