			<description>Contents: 4 Puppy Playing Pieces, Spinner, Game Board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To be the first player to return his puppy to his doghouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before Play: Each player selects a spotted puppy playing piece and places it on the matching doghouse. Blue puppy goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: First player spins the spinner and moves his puppy that number of spaces, counterclockwise around the board.  After each player has spun once, the first player then counts the number of spots on the puppy on which his playing piece is resting.  He moves his puppy that number of spaces.  Play continues in this way.  If a player lands on a bone, he then spins the spinner again and moves that number of spaces.  If the arrow points to the puppy's head, he has to return to his doghouse. (The spinner is used only at the start of the game and when a player lands on a bone.) If a player lands on a space occupied by another player, he moves to the next space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win: The winner is the first player to go completely around the path of puppies and land on or pass over his dog house again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
