			<description>Roll into the action in this easy to learn and quick to play dice game for 2 or 4 players. Sports Dice Football includes all the drama of a real game. Go for it on 4th down and reach the end zone to score a touchdown. Then try to stop the opposing team by sacking their quarterback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team that starts on offense starts on their own 25-yard line. They have 4 downs to get to the 50-yard line or beyond. Once they reach (or cross) the 50-yard line, they receive a new set of downs and now have 4 tries to get to the opposing team&amp;rsquo;s end zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both team simultaneously roll all their dice. The symbol that appears the most on each team&amp;rsquo;s set of dice becomes their play. The team that rolled the most dice with the same symbol wins the roll. Apply the outcome of the winning play by moving the Football Token and/or Down Marker Token accordingly. See the Dice chart for a description of each symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one team has scored 21 points or more. That team is victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
