			<description>Object: to make the most money by buying and selling cards with the other players. Cards come in sets, the more cards in a set you have the more valuable they are. Three cards are dealt face down to each player at the start, and each player is given $5000. The starting player draws a fourth card from the top of the deck and $500 from the bank, and  then may attempt to make a deal to sell and unwanted card to another player. Haggling occurs. Each turn a player may only complete ONE deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player has their turn by drawing one card from the top of the deck and taking $500 from the bank and then attempting to make a deal... and so on until there are no cards left in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collecting a set of three cards from the same group doubles the face value of each card. Collecting a set of four cards from the same group triples the face value of each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
