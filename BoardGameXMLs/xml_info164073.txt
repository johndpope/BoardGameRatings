							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Patton&#039;s Third Army</name>
									
			<description>Patton&amp;rsquo;s Third Army is a solitaire game system where the player takes command of General George Patton&amp;rsquo;s Third Army during the campaign across France in 1944. The game begins immediately following the Falaise Battle and continues through to 15 December, at which point Third Army was sent to fight In the Battle of the Bulge. Your goal as a player is to surpass Patton&amp;rsquo;s original record, thereby possibly forestalling Germany&amp;rsquo;s Ardennes Offensive and thereby gaining glory as a great general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, you control US and other Allied units assigned to the Third Army. The game system plays the Germans. You will have to deal with a wide variety of situations, from battling against fierce panzer counterattacks, to figuring out ways to extend your lines of supply. Your objective: Germany!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two levels: the Standard Rules, which gives a quick wargame, and the Optional Rules, which give more realism for more complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Patton&amp;rsquo;s Third Army is a solitaire game, multiple players can play as the US team, making decisions by consensus, or each managing operations along one of the &amp;ldquo;Axes of Advance&amp;rdquo;. However, one player should always be the Commander of Third Army, and his decision is final!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patton's Third Army FAQ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
