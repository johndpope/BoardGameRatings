							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Back to Blacktooth Ridge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blacktooth Ridge lies far to the east and north of New Aenoch and the Crusader States of Ephremere's making. This long, snake like ridge is fabled for its string of abandoned fortresses, treasure houses, temples, cavernous dungeons and underground mansions. It invites many an adventurer seeking fame and fortune. It is an altogether dangerous place tainted with the evil of the Horned One and those who still worship him in hidden caves and temples. The Blacktooth Ridge has claimed many lives, and upon its twisting slopes lie many unmarked graves and the scattered bones of those who were found no refuge after their demise. But where danger lies, treasure abounds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back to Blacktooth Ridge is a dungeon adventure set in the Dungurd caverns and pits the characters against wickedly and clever creatures. But even these raiders don't know what horror lies deep within the caverns! This adventure is designed for 4-6 characters of 3rd-5th level. It can be very deadly for an ill prepared group of adventurers but a fun and exciting challenge for a well prepared party. The adventure is best approached as an aside to other adventures as it begins and ends here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
