			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the December of 2012, on the winter solstice, a date prophesied by the Mayans as the end of evolution, a date prophesied by Nostradamus as World's End, man chose to evolve by the process of natural selection through self extermination from nuclear fallout. The decade long year War on Terror escalated to a series of short events between many warring nations that ravaged the known world on all sides in 24 short hours forcing man into an Exodus that would last 20 years for the chosen survivors, before they could return to the ruins of civilization and start a new era of man. The survivors are the lucky ones, the people that made it to fallout shelters, and those that somehow survived against all odds. This is the beginning of your story, and this Survivor's Guide will help you shape it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Exodus Survivor's Guide, contain the basics of creating a OGC character in the Exodus world, using a fully customizable build class with all of the available options and more from the standard Modern Hero Classes. Besides providing character guidelines, this guide also contains equipment and background material to help shape a character's goals in the post-apocalyptic world of Exodus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
