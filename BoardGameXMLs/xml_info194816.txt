			<description>Create and expand your auto repairs service empire. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 will take you behind the scenes of daily routine in car workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a direct sequel to the successful Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. After the release of the previous edition we got a lot of feedback from players and we felt that we haven't reached the full potential of it yet. Check out the improved Car Mechanic Simulator with new features, cars and parts. There is a lot of new stuff to present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the next generation of Car Mechanic Simulator, one of the best simulation games on Steam in 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Take on the role of the car mechanic and repair cars for your clients. Spend the earned money on expanding your workshop and improving your skills. Buy worn out cars, renovate them and sell with profit or become a famous car collector. If you manage your business well, you will surely succeed in the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Car repairs&lt;br/&gt;The essence of the game. It is your job. It is the way you get cash. It is the way you live... Ok, it is maybe not that important, anyway that is the basic activity in the game. Customer comes in and mysteriously says that his car is broken but he needs it for tomorrow. The clock starts right now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mission system&lt;br/&gt;Unlike in the previous edition, jobs are generated randomly, and the player will need to choose on which car he will work. It seems like there is a group of customers waiting in front of the workshop for the mechanic...&lt;br/&gt;Players can take limited amount of jobs in the same time and every one of them will be time-restricted. There will be different difficulty and complexity levels and of course, different payment levels. Wise management is the key here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop management&lt;br/&gt;After whole day of hard work it is time to count your cash and then look around your business. What should I buy to improve my performance? What would attract more clients? You can always just buy more posters on the wall but it is not something called 'great investment' for such a serious business, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Car auctions&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of investments.There is a chance for making even more money in the car auction house. Choose wisely, buy used or old cars and renovate them to sell with profit... Or, if you are one of those vintage car lovers, you can have your own collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Car models&lt;br/&gt;Cars will be fully dismountable to the car frame, so we are talking about some amazing level of detail here. Every car is made of more than 200 interactive parts, which includes an interior, a car body and the whole engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is the list of features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Car auctions - buy old cars and renovate them. You can then sell them for cash or have your own collection.&lt;br/&gt;    The photo mode - take &amp;quot;before&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; pictures of the renovated cars.&lt;br/&gt;    Visual tuning - replace bumpers, lights, wheels, a bonnet or a steering wheel to adjust the car for the customer's needs.&lt;br/&gt;    Repair cars for your clients - it is your main source of income.&lt;br/&gt;    An infinite number of randomly generated missions.&lt;br/&gt;    Upgrade your workshop - purchase necessary tools and expand your garage with specific equipment such as lacquer spray booth or dyno. Those reasonable investments will allow you to provide greater range of services.&lt;br/&gt;    16 brand new car models. Each one is made of more than 200 parts. Amazing level of detail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
