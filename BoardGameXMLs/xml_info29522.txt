			<description>ZOMBIES, AND GANGSTERS, AND MORE, OH MY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;World War II, &amp;quot;Bug Hunts&amp;quot;, Colonial Wars, Vietnam, &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; movies, and Al Capone. What do all these things have in common? Heavy firepower.&amp;quot; With these words Chain Reaction burst onto the scene. Now two years later we've taken it even farther. It's a whole new ball game as Chain Reaction 2.0 Fully Loaded delivers unparalleled realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you have detailed rules for vehicles from motorcycles to heavy tanks. New weapon systems have been added as well as rules for incorporating aircraft into your games. Where once ten figures could be used now thirty or more can easily be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign system has been enlarged to include character advancement and the addition of Skills to personalize your force. Chain Reaction 2.0 can be played solo or with others and as always WITH ANY FIGURES YOU ALREADY HAVE! So pull out those favorite figures, get ready to have some fun, and ... JUST PLAY THE GAME!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
