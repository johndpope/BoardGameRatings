			<description>5 different 2-player strategy games in one box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the box a 2 sided gaming board: one is a classic checkers 8x8 grid, the other is 9x9 grid with some fields randomly seperated with red lines (which do play a role in the Colix game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The included games are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okta - 8 different pieces numbered from 1 to 8 have to be put together to a tower with the pieces increasing, so the 8 in the bottom and the 1 at the top. Pieces only move vertically or horizontally. 4 of the own pieces (the un-even numbers) start at the opposite side of the gaming board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Okta - The same as Okta, but you play on the 9x9 side of the gaming board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uno - A kind of checkers variant, where the pieces are homogenically placed on the gaming board. Winner is the player who first eliminates his own pieces. Pieces move vertically and horizontally and are taken by moving over the own pieces diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slalom - Small pieces have to be put in a way that they can be taken in 8 strokes by a bigger piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colix - You play on the 9x9 side of the gaming board and the red lines can&amp;acute;t be crossed. Every player controls 3 colors (6 pieces of each color). Aim of the game is to eliminate one color of the 3 colors of the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
