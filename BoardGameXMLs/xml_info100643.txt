			<description>A two-player game for the Decktet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the last battle in the final campaign of a mad but brilliant general. Six companies of tired soldiers are all that stands between him and the advancing enemy. He doesn't realize it yet, but there is no way for him to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, you are not playing the general in this game. Unfortunately, you're not the advancing army either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead, you play a member of the general's staff. You were offered money by captains of a few of the remaining companies. Maneuver them off the field before the inevitable defeat, and they will pay you handsomely. So cue the fifes and drums! Jigger the retreat orders to put your cronies as far from danger as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, everybody else on the general's staff was bribed to put their cronies ahead of yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a track, with the companies represented by six tokens corresponding to each of the Decktet suits. Each player starts with a secret goal card, telling them which units they want to have do well. Each turn, players draft from a pool of cards, moving the units that correspond to their card's suit a total distance corresponding to their card's rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
