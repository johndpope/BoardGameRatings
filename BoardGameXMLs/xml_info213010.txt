							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wildlife Preserve</name>
									
			<description>Africa's animals are endangered. Poachers riddle the land. Nature itself is without mercy. You are one of Africa's daring rangers and you are tasked with keeping the animals that wander onto your preserve from harm. Expand your preserve, herd the carnivores away from the herbivores, and ensure that nothing gets unnecessarily eaten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, nothing in life is free. Expanding requires capital. How will you earn this capital? Do you take the moral path by giving private safari tours or do you take the darker path by allowing hunters to enter and take whatever prize they wish? These are some of the tough choices you must make while managing your wildlife preserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Wildlife Preserve' is a push your luck card drawing and placement game that offers strategic decisions, elements of luck, and negotiation.  Players will draw animals, place them on their preserve, and ensure their safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each animal has a different point value and special ability.  The goal of the game is to accumulate and keep as many points as possible in order to beat your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
