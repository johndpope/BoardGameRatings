			<description>Every year, the tribes get together for a big cookout...&lt;br/&gt; ...and everyone wants the honor of being their tribe's main course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who's for Dinner? is a fast and fun card game for 3-6 players, ages 12 and up. Each player plays a tribe of cannibals trying to put together the perfect combination of fire, pot and spices to score the most points. There's no player elimination as a successful &amp;quot;meal&amp;quot; means another member of that player's tribe will try to outdo their buddy in the cookpot. (In other words, players keep trying to go out and the best total score wins.) Collecting sets of items is the ultimate way to win, but there's a lot of bluffing and misdirection as action cards allow players to steal, swap or otherwise interfere with other people's cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
