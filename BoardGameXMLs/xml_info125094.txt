							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Glory of the Three Kingdoms: Guandu Core Set</name>
									
			<description>Glory of the Three Kingdoms is a living deck-building game (LDBG) in which each player takes a role leading an allegiance in the Three Kingdoms period and battles for total victory or for victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in most deck-building games, player acquire additional cards to add to their decks. In GOTK, player may acquire cards depicting heroes, military, strategy, items, etc., and some cards provide victory points for endgame scoring. Unlike other games of this type, GOTK has a battle phase during which each player secretly deploys military cards (foot soldiers, pikemen, calvary and archers) and battles for Glory. The victor takes a glory token from the defeated player and a free card in the neutral zone. The victor may also capture and recruit the defeated general &amp;ndash; or have him beheaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When two out of four card decks are depleted, the game ends and the player with the most victory points wins. However, if one allegiance acquired six or more Tiger Tally or all of opponent's glory tokens, the game ends immediately and the allegiance wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first battle theme of GOTK is Guandu, the first major battle in the Three Kingdoms period. The Guandu Core Set, a two-player game, comes with Cao Cao and Yuan Shao allegiances. Lu Bu and Liu Bei allegiances will be available in a future three- and four-player expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
