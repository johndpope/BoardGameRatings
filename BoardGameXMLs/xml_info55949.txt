			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the 1950s, DC Comics had an editorial rule governing how many of its books could have a monkey on the cover in the same month; issues with monkeys sold better than a guest appearance by virtually any other superhero. And who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a monkey? Self aware, super strong and amazingly tough great apes have been a staple of comics and cartoons for decades. Want to play one?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here you go. Maybe your ape is a product of super-scientific experiments, has been uplifted by alien intellects, or gained true sentience by strange and ancient magic. No matter their origins, awakened apes blend intellect and savage strength to great effect. Ook-ook-ook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free20: Monkey Business is a free Otherverse Games product, suitable for inclusion in any lighthearted or pulp flavored D20 Modern campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
