							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hollywood Haiku: a Game of Film Trivia and Bad Poetry â€“ Classics</name>
									
			<description>Movie trivia with an element of area control - the sooner you answer the better! Correct answers always rewarded. Clues to over 1,100 films. For 2-6 players/teams. Three different versions geared to film fans of different ages: Classics, Silver Screen, and Millenium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics: Read clues to the other players. Each clue is written as a haiku. Players write answers on white boards &amp;ndash; once the white board is placed on the game board there&amp;rsquo;s no changing your answer.  The quicker you can answer correctly the better off you are. Place markers on one of the seven Hollywood stars on the board, each representing a different film category (each version includes action/adventure, comedy, drama, sci-fi, horror &amp;amp; suspense, fantasy; and one other that differs in each version). Or ,draw Bonus Objective cards for a chance to earn even more points for reaching goals such as having the most markers in a given category or for having markers in all the categories. &lt;br/&gt;Game ends as soon as any player places 17 markers. Players get one point for each marker placed, and additional points for accomplishing Bonus Objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
