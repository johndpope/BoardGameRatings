							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bump in the Night Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time is now. The place is Earth, specifically New York City. They say it's the city that never sleeps, and that's true - though not in the way they mean it. You see, there are two types of people that live in the city. There are the day people who get up in the morning, have their coffee and go to work or to their classes and try to get by. Occasionally they become alarmed by the violence in the local news but when they get home they have their dinner and forget about it. Sometimes, when it gets very bad, they wish to God they had stayed in Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also the night people. They are the homeless, the prostitutes, the criminals. They are junkies too strung out to find a shelter to crash in, or the people who sell to the junkies. And sometimes, they are dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinner to the other night people - the beasts in the shadows, the spirits of violence and blood. The hidden night predators spoken of in myth and legend, hiding in alleys sharpening their claws and flexing their wings. In Bump in the Night RPG, you're one of them. What are you eating tonight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bump in the Night is a pencil and paper role-playing game, much like Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. It is a rules system whose intended audience is people who are already familiar with role-playing. It is not a computer game, nor is it a game I am running by email. If you like the rules and want to play, gather some friends, start playing and (hopefully) enjoy yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
