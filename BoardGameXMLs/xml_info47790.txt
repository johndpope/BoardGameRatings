							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Silver Summoning</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The figure is that of a human male nearly six-and-a-half feet tall, dressed in dark brown travelling robes, a long gnarled staff held in his right hand. He seems old, but strong, with a weathered face that exudes confidence, curiosity, and a piercing inquisitiveness. A great wolf stand beside him, nearly three feet high, its fur a brilliant silver tinge. It eyes you warily but without fear. As the man begins to speak, you feel a brief tingle run up your spine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I am Cuhulain, guardian of The Path and protector of the lands you call the West Wood and beyond. My Order strives to maintain the natural ways, seeking and correcting imbalances in the world before us. The lands to the north have been poisoned for years beyond even my great age, tainted by something that is not part of this world's natural cycle. I have studied this foulness, and its powers are grim indeed. I will not tolerate violations in the natural order!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Silver Summoning is an intermediate fantasy roleplaying adventure for use with the D20 system. Included in this adventure are full color character and monster counters, full color visual aids and handouts, and a battle grid for &amp;quot;out-of-the-box&amp;quot; action! Also featured are special Runes of Passage that allow you to access adventure related material from secure pages on the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
