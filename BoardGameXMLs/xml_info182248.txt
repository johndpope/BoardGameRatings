							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyrringham Village</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting life as a small farmstead by the side of the road, the village of Pyrringham is little more than a hamlet. Those that call it home though would say it was just the right size. With a small village store and houses for the few families that live and work here, Pyrringham seems idyllic. But things are not always as they seem...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 20 x 20 village map depicting an a small village or hamlet. There is a village store selling general goods, and a cluster of houses around the road. The houses are furnished simply - a few beds, tables and chests. There is a little space outside where the villagers are able to grow a few crops to bolster their meagre diet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
