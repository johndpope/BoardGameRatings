			<description>Publisher's Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prog 80 and Softside said this is the best TREK based game that they've seen. High-speed graphics (Machine Language sub-routines). You are the commander of a small mercenary star-cruiser. You have hyperdrive or rockets (reaction drive) to maneuver with, missiles or laser cannon to fight with, shields for defense, a computer for information to aid you, and a loyal crew to keep everything running. You have been hired to destroy a fleet of alien invaders. If you survive, you will be rewarded handsomely; if you lose, you're dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributor's Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assume the role of a Galactic Mercenary in defense of the Empire!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Battles is one of the best space games we've seen in a long time. Features three levels of play, fast, machine language graphics, realtime input, and &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; enemy ships that move and shoot! You'll find that playing the part of a mercenary isn't simple. It's not enough to eliminate the aliens; you must turn a profit, missiles are expensive, the rewards are small, and watch out for the radiation belts!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
