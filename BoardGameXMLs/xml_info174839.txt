			<description>Six Gods have forged a world together from their elemental powers, and now vie to control them. Realms is a bidding and bluffing game for 2-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players bid for control of &amp;quot;Realms,&amp;quot; cards that are selected for auction by the active player. The only currency players have is the cards in their hand (the same cards that represent the Realms for auction), but each of those cards also contains a scoring condition at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How will you use your cards? Will you bid them often and try to control as many realms as possible? Or will you pick your spots and focus on scoring in specific ways?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are pressured keep cards in hard for scoring and later bids, but they have to bid successfully to claim the Realms needed to make the scoring cards as effective as possible - all while setting traps and avoiding the traps of the other Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realms plays in about 10 minutes per player, and will be available in print-and-play soon. For questions, please contact the designer, JR Honeycutt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
