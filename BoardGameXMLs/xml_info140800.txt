			<description>A medium to fast paced casual card combat game for 2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HP! puts you into a 30-40 minute contest of elimination with up to 3 other players. You each have 10 HP and you win by being the last surviving player with HP. During the course of the game, you may take the offensive with Punches, Kicks, Fire Spells, and Ice Spells. Each Attack and Cast card has a counter. You can Defend Punches and Kicks, and you can Ward Spells. You may also use a Buff card to add additional cards to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The loose but consistent fantasy theme gives you a strong setting without forcing you to invest in complicated and intense game lore or character back stories. In other words, it's a very casual setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
