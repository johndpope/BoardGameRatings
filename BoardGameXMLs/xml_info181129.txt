			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking. Ever since you picked up Tephra: the Steampunk RPG, you&amp;rsquo;ve had one aching thought: &amp;ldquo;How can I bio-engineer a flesh-tearing chimpanzee with venomous fangs and ride it into battle?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are proud to announce that your wait is over. This book will provide you the answer to that pressing question and many like it. You will have everything you need to tame the wild lands of Tephra, use science to develop your own animal abomination, or fight off stampedes of raging beasties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes rules for both players and narrators to create animals and use them in their sagas. With dozens of new specialties, new augments, and a huge selection of animal traits, this book is packed to the gills. Narrator&amp;rsquo;s will enjoy the selection of pre-built animals and savage creatures ready to insert right into their epic stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the best part: you can now rely on a pet (and not those pesky fellow adventurers) to help you out when you most need it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
