			<description>In Die, Robot, Die! players command an army of 8 robots, represented by dice.  The game is played on a grid, with each player having a &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; on their side of the grid.  The object of the game is to either destroy the opponent's base, destroy the opponent's entire army, or make it so that none of the opponent's army can move on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, first a player may sabotage the opponent's base (if they have a die alone in the opponent's base), which reduces the health of the base.  If the players destroys the base in this manner, they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player must then move one of their armies according to the pips shown on the dice.  If the player has no legal move, he loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, a player may attack one of the opponent's dice, with the attacker gaining pips, and the defender losing pips according to the pips currently showing on the dice.  If a die is reduced to 0 or less pips in the battle, that army is eliminated from the game.  If a die ends up getting too many pips, that army is &amp;quot;overloaded&amp;quot; and dies as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die, Robot Die! is contained in the centerfold of Spielbox Magazine, Issue #3 of 2012.  You will need to supply your own dice and tokens to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
