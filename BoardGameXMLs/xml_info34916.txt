			<description>Hexors of Might &amp;amp; Magic: A Strategic Hex is a game of tactics, where armies wage continuous battles against each other. It is based on a Heroes of Might &amp;amp; Magic: A Strategic Quest, turn-based computer game, developed and published by New World Computing in 1995. While being familiar with the game is not necessary, the players will find it easier to identify with their armies if they have played the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Might and Magic tells the story of Lord Morglin Ironfist, who is forced to flee his homeland through a magical portal, because his cousin, Ragnar, had usurped the throne after his uncle, Ragnar's father, killed Ironfist's father, the legitimate owner of the throne. He finds himself along with his few followers in a strange and uncharted land, called Enroth. The land is unruled and Ironfist must fight out his way to the throne of new kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
