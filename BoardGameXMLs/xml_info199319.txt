			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 new monstrous races for Fifth Edition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to try your hand at a more exotic option than dwarf or halfling?  Have you ever gotten your wish to play as a monster, only for their society to be lacking interesting cultural details beyond the familiar &amp;ldquo;kill or be killed&amp;rdquo; write-up?  Have you ever worried that a monstrous PC would end up overshadowing the other players with abilities far too powerful for standard adventuring parties?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Playable Monsters is the answer to your prayers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Play as a Giant, a mighty descendant of a fallen empire!&lt;br/&gt;    Be a Medusa, a transformed humanoid whose gaze can cause deadly petrification!&lt;br/&gt;    Try your hand as a Naga, a spirit guardian of ley lines and extraplanar prisons&lt;br/&gt;    Take the role of a Vampire, a powerful yet cursed undead being with peerless predatory abilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've GMed them, you fought them, now it's time to play as them in the Fifth Edition of the world's oldest tabletop role-playing game!
