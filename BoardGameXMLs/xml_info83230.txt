							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mechagenesis: The True20 Robotic Roleplay Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth has been invaded by the Legion, an army of extraterrestrial shape-changing robots bent on galactic domination. They are opposed by the Global Defense Corps, brave humans who sacrifice themselves each and every day to preserve &lt;br/&gt;humanity, but they are not alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a member of the Alliance, a valiant cadre of exiled robots who once fought them and lost. Now, you muST rise up and DO WHAT YOU COULD NOT DO BEFORE- end the scourge of Legion once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time of Mechagenesis is now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are included for making giant robots that can transform into cars, weapons, technological devices, animal shapes, and even buildings. It contains a simple system for designing futuristic weapons, vehicle combat (naturally!), and special powers based on the core True20 powers. It even has rules for combining multiple robots into a larger humanoid robot with even greater strength and power. The rules also allow for a player to run a robot or a human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
