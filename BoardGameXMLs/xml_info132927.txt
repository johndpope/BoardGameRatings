			<description>Mr. Chin's Gourmet Paradise is a platformer video game for the Nintendo Game Boy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point of the game is to feed Mr. Chin some momos, which are turned into peaches via the Demoe beam. Bricks can be broken inside the games levels to obtain power-ups. Points in the game are actually &amp;quot;calories;&amp;quot; which determine how well-fed Mr. Chin is. There are a pre-determined number of enemies that must be defeated before Mr. Chin can move on to the next level. Being invincible automatically turns all opponents into edible peaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Mr. Chin loses all lives, the Game Over screen shows him in prison, suggesting that his deeds throughout the game are not actually appreciated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mr. Chin's Gourmet Paradise&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
