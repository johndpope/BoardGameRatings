							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deuteros: The Next Millennium</name>
									
			<description>Deuteros: The Next Millennium is the sequel to the sci-fi strategy video game Millennium 2.2, published by Activision for the Amiga and Atari ST.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Deuteros is to mine and manage resources, explore the Solar System  and beyond. For this, 3 categories of civilians are trained: Producers, Researchers and Marines, out of a pool of 6000 population. The longer these teams are used, they are advanced in three levels, required for some later action (some inventions can be manufactured only by a producer who is at &amp;quot;Expert&amp;quot; level while Pilots with the rank of &amp;quot;Admiral&amp;quot; will be more effective in battles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New bases built on other planets must be manned with new teams of Producers in order to construct the shuttles and derricks needed for supply. Some of these events are &amp;quot;milestones&amp;quot; which will trigger new technology to be researched by the scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has to take care mostly of the transaction between the planets and the factories and distribute their supply with shuttles and long-range spacecraft. New technology (such as automatisation computers or teleport) will replace some of the player's involvement, as the player must later concentrate on war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Deuteros , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
