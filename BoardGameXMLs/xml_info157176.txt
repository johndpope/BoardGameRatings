			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have found the lost nation of Dwarves deep within their ruined city and defeated many of their enemies in the process. And while you stumbled into their realm as a novice adventurer with only the clothes on your back, you are now a 5th level Hero who has accumulated a small arsenal of enchanted weapons and items.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that your adventure is only half over. The crucial finale of this historic event hangs in the balance, and you are the one to tip the scales in the Dwarves&amp;rsquo; favour. In order to emerge victorious you must delve deeper into the Lost City of the Dwarves where you will find your greatest challenges yet, and even greater treasures. You may even accomplish the feat of becoming a living legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the sequel, solo-adventure that completes Lost City of the Dwarves Part 1: Discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
