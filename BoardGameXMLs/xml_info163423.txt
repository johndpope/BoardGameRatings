							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Princess Ballet</name>
									
			<description>All the most beautiful Princesses have been invited to the Princess School of Ballet to learn how to dance one of the most famous Princess ballets. The Princess to learn and perform her ballet first is crowned the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must find and learn all 5 of their ballet dance poses that are shown &amp;ndash; on the smaller pose cards &amp;ndash; on their ballet card. These poses are found on the giant dance floor playing mat. When a correct matching pose is found, the Princess must perform that pose and then place the card face down on her ballet card. Being able to remember all the poses in the correct order is the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each princesses turn, they must roll the foam dice to see what step they must take, will it be; a Footstep (move either 1, 2 or 3 steps depending on the amount indicated on the dice), a Lesson Symbol (a private dance lesson where you are allowed to peek at either 1 or 2 of the game cards that are laid face down) or the Shuffle Symbol(where you can swap 3 poses on the board to either help you or delay your opponents dance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are the Princess who has collected all 5 of their ballet poses first, then you can perform your dance first to see if you have won. Turn your pose cards over and have a look &amp;ndash; now hand the card to the other Princesses and recite the ballet dance in the order same order that the poses are shown on the card. Got them right? Then you are the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for 2 &amp;ndash; 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
