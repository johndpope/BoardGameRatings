			<description>Stratak Wars Test- und Reiseset / Test and Travel Set is a strategic- and tactical boardgame for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stratak Wars - Test- and Travelset is used for testing the Stratak Wars battle system or for taking it with you during your travels.&lt;br/&gt;It offers rules for beginners and advanced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game-board differs to usual Stratak Wars game-boards as the upper side displays small countries with neutral cities only. The backside displays small neutral islands. So every player starts with one of the small countries instead of a big one and can expand quickly. This will cause heavy attacks at the front line to allow supply setup next to the front line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additonally this board can be used to enlarge the playing field of Stratak Wars: Der Auftakt / The Beginning together with additional boards 5/7 and 6/8 to a playing field with 9 boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So a large continent with a coastal border or a large area with an inland sea can be created. If a playing field with an inland sea is created, the landing ships can use their advantages against tanks because of their speed to build bridgeheads with loaded tanks on opposite countries. Beside tanks, fighters, bombers and ownership counters, infantry units are included as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anything else is similar to Stratak Wars: Der Auftakt / The Beginning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to conquer most of the cities within a playing time as agreed at the beginning of the game. So the playing time is flexible and can be decided by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with his own small state on the edge of the gameboard and expands his influence by conquering cities and other small states on the playing field.  Depending on the units he chooses for combat, he has advantages against the units of other players which are influenced by the landscape as well concerning movement and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supply points are gained for recently conquered cities only. So you have to move forward, if you want to expand your armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include basic rules, advanced rules, alternative rules, a sequence of play description, a display section for the landscapes, cities and a counter description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
