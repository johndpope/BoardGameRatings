			<description>Underwriter, The Names Game, is an insurance game in which 4 players become Names at Lloyd's of London, taking on risks in the Aviation, Marine, Non-Marine and Motor markets. Each player has a Syndicate board and puts tokens into each Market slot. You roll and move round the board, drawing the relevant market card which may show a profit or loss (eg opening of new airport increases premiums for Aviation syndicates, football team trashing hotel costs Non-marine claims damages). You can also gain Stop Loss markers and face a Solvency test. You win by your Syndicate getting 4 tokens in each Market and passing the Solvency test.&lt;br/&gt;A nicely made set with a quarter-board, but, being a British game, there is no more thought than roll &amp;amp; move and draw hazard cards. As boring as it sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
