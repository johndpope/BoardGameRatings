							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elton Asen: A Friend When You Need One</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elton walked out of the wasteland just when you needed him: friendly, seemingly trustworthy, and ready to fill your tank with gas for just a ride to the next struggling settlement. He never takes off his gas mask, claiming a heightened sensitivity to the semi-toxic air, but you heard some faint whirring when he reached across you to grab something. Could he be one of the vicious robots that hunted humans during the war?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Cache is a collection of characters designed to be used in tabletop RPG gaming, either as character concepts for players or as NPCs/villains by GMs. Artist Matt Morrow illustrates the character pieces, and Encoded Designs writes a system-neutral description, including how to incorporate this character into your campaign. These write-ups also include hooks for encounters and adventure inspiration, plus tags for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the system-neutral write-up are stat blocks for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fate Core&lt;br/&gt;    Savage Worlds&lt;br/&gt;    5e&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
