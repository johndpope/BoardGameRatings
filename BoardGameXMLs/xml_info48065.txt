							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Pyramid of Imhotep</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Lost Pyramid of Imhoptep is a 1E module designed for 4-6 adventurers of levels 4-7. Several months back, a small boy from the village of Ab-Amon happened upon a buried column while playing out in the surrounding desert. He reported to the village elders that the column bore strange and frightening symbols that he, in his youthful exuberance, insisted were curses. Being as the boy was known to have a photographic memory, he was able to accurately draw the queer symbols for the village elders when asked. The elders, being somewhat familiar with the ancient history of their region, quickly came to the realization that the symbols must be associated in some way with a pharaoh, for they were enclosed by a lozenge-shaped border. Perhaps, just perhaps, the local wizard reasoned, the pillar could be linked to the tomb of the master architect Imhotep, whose final resting place has never been found.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
