							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pendragon (Microlite d20)</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;It is the mid-5th Century. The Roman Legions left Britain a century before and the land is now divided into a dozen rival kingdoms. From over the sea the refugees of the shattered empire and the waves of westward migrations arrive in ever greater numbers. The old Gods are still dominant, but now there is a new God with ambitious and persuasive missionaries. The last gift of an ungrateful empire - Christianity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amongst this chaos a ruthless man tries to forge a single nation and fails. Uther, called the Pendragon, dies with unity within his grasp, betrayed by his own lust. The great druid Merllyn goes into hiding with the tyrant's infant son, and the cycle of civil wars continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into this mix of war and politics this game introduces all the mythic elements of the time: Druid Magic, Christian Miracles, the Sidhe, the old Gods, and the magical nature of the land of Logres itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now that the Characters begin their careers during the upheavals in the mythic Britain of the 5th-6th Century. They will be adventuring as the events surrounding Uther Pendragon, Merllyn, Arthur, Morgaine and the Grail all come to pass. They may even become Knights of Arthur's Court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
