			<description>Who's A Clever Dick: The Card Game For Real Smart Alecs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a card based trivia game - one side has two questions, the other side individual letters (eg C, L, E, etc).  Players take turns drawing a card and asking one of the two questions of the player to their left.  If the player gets the question right, they keep the card, if they don't, the card goes back to the bottom of the deck.  The goal is to spell out &amp;quot;CLEVERDICK&amp;quot; before anyone else.  The only wrinkle is that there are also blank cards in the deck - no questions - and the player drawing one of these cards has to try and bluff the other player by making up a question.  If they pull it off, they keep the card and take one from the player, if not, the bluff-callin' player keeps the blank and take one from the asker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: &amp;quot;Cleverdick&amp;quot; is actually mild slang in the UK, the equivalent of &amp;quot;smarty pants&amp;quot;, you're not actually calling someone a &amp;quot;dick&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
