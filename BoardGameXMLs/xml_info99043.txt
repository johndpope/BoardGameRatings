			<description>Second Kharkov: Strike &amp;amp; Counterstrike, May 1942 (2K for short) is a low-complexity, two-player wargame covering the second battle for that city fought during the early period of World War II&amp;rsquo;s eastern front. The game begins with the Soviets on the all-out offensive, but its second half is dominated by a German counterattack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a historical scenario covering the battle as it was fought, plus a what-if scenario that allows players to explore the possibilities inherent in the all-out effort originally proposed to Stalin by Marshal Timoshenko. In it, the Soviet player begins the game with the historical force along with a total of 26 more rifle divisions and tank brigades: everything that was then in the Soviet strategic reserve. Of course, to win that scenario the Soviet player needs to accomplish a lot more than he does in the historical one (capture all three hexes of Kharkov).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex represents five miles (eight km) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents two days. Each unit of maneuver represents a division or brigade of roughly 2,000 to 14,000 men and 50 to 400 armored fighting vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rules cover such things as: Soviet untried units, initial German unpreparedness, air interdiction, historical and alternative set ups, multi-step German units, sudden death victories, fog of war, German inter-army cooperation, close air support, Soviet armor doctrine, Soviet panic, and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I.    Soviet Player Turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A.    German Air Interdiction Placement Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B.

German Player Turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. German Movement or Combat Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B. German Combat or  Movement Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #271 - Nov/Dec 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 2 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 5 miles / 8 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Regiment to Corps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 16-page Second Kharkov rulebook (6-pages of marketing)&lt;br/&gt;One Player Aid Card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-6 Hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
