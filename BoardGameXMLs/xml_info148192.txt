			<description>Portraits is a solitaire patience style game which was originally called &amp;quot;Peddler&amp;quot; (released in 1992) and redeveloped in 2003. It was released in an Italian gaming magazine and also online via Glastyn Games website. It uses a standard 52-card deck and is playable in 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal in Portraits is to collect all the face cards into your personal vault using other, similar suited cards. You can collect a face card if you are able to discard cards of value greater value than a face card and also of the same suit. There are also several ways to manipulate the cards at your disposal in order to better your position and avoid getting locked out or otherwise losing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
