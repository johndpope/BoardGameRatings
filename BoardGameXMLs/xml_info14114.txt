							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">With Fire and Sword: A Strategic Game of the 30 Years War</name>
									
			<description>From the Rules Booklet (of around '8'-pages in length):&amp;quot; With Fire and Sword is a game type simulation of the Thirty Years War period. From 1618 to 1648 most of Western Europe was engulfed in a brutal dynastic struggle. The game is an operational/strategic Level simulation with each turn representing one year and military units representing armies of various types and strengths.&amp;quot; This is basically a (2) player game with (1) player having the &amp;quot;Habsburg&amp;quot; forces, while the other player has the &amp;quot;Anti-Habsburg&amp;quot;(or 'Coalition') forces. There are (3) Scenarios presented, beginning the Game at either '1618', '1630', or even '1636'. Players will need to provide their OWN '6'-sided DIE, before commencing play. This game is described as: &amp;quot;A medium complexity strategic game of this period of turmoil.&amp;quot; The TROOP 'strengths' can be considered as 'hidden' since the FRONT of the 'counter' depicts ONLY that it is a TROOP, while on the REVERSE of them is the actual 'strength' denomination. The scale is given as '48'-kilometres across EACH 'Hex' and &amp;quot;Yearly&amp;quot; Game Turns. This Game was produced in either a &amp;quot;Plastic Baggie&amp;quot; form, or as a &amp;quot;Boxed&amp;quot; edition, for those that might find one of these versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gamemap(of '3'-colors~BLUE, TAN, GRAY or a combination of those) depicts an area encompassing Eastern France &amp;amp; the 'Benelux' countries, over to mid-Poland/Hungary, and from Northern Italy up to the Baltic Coast. As is usual with the excellent production values of the fine folks at &amp;quot;Simulations Canada&amp;quot;, this gamemap has plenty of useful information contained upon the 'Gamemap', such as: a 'Terrain Key'; a 'Victory Point Track'; (3)~&amp;quot;Resources Available&amp;quot; Charts(for EACH of the '3' Scenarios); an 'Event Generation' Table; 'Movement &amp;amp; Winter Attrition' Tables; with 'Field and Siege Combat Results' Tables. There are '200' Game counters(printed on FRONT and BACK) in quite a large variety of COLORS, such as: RED; Dark RED; BURGUNDY; BROWN; PINK; YELLOW; GREEN; BLUE; Dark BLUE; Light BLUE; TAN; GRAY and WHITE. These mainly consist of TROOP and LEADER counters, with small silhouettes for them, while there are other 'Informational'(with appropriate 'silhouettes') ones as well, such as: 'CONTROL'; 'Siege'; 'Plague'; 'Famine'; 'Barren'; 'Sacked';  'Rebuild'; 'Game Turn'; numbered counters from '1~6'; and (2) sets of 'Victory Point Track' markers('1' SET for EACH player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Sequence of Play&amp;quot; is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;A.-Payment and Recruitment Phase:&lt;br/&gt;1.-Pay Units on Map. 2.-Recruit new Units. 3.-Place new Leaders. 4.-Wounded Leaders recover.&lt;br/&gt;B.-Flip 'Sacked' Markers and Remove 'Rebuilding' Markers.&lt;br/&gt;C.-Event Phase: 1.Roll Yearly 'Event' and any Scenario *Special* 'Event'.&lt;br/&gt;D.-Initiative Phase&lt;br/&gt;E.-Movement and Combat Phase: [1st Player]&lt;br/&gt;1.-Movement 2.-Field Combat 3.-Siege Combat&lt;br/&gt;F.-Movement and Combat Phase: [2nd Player]~same as 1st Player.&lt;br/&gt;G.-Siege Maintenance Phase&lt;br/&gt;H.-Removal of 'Barren' counters placed previous year.&lt;br/&gt;I.-Winter Attrition Phase&lt;br/&gt;J.-Control Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
