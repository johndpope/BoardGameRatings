			<description>The players will be able to reasonably classify 8 cultural characteristics that could possibly develop within a given biome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to get one of each of the eight categories. Each player draws and discards until one of the teammates has eight different categories. This player lays down his or her cards face up.&lt;br/&gt;The other teammates and the &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot; must use only the cards in the players' hands to now create in the game board the most logical, consistent culture possible based upon the cards available and then analyze their culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;48 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
