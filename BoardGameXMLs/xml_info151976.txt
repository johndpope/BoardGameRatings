			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We originally had a much bigger book in mind for the Covert Ops rulebook.  Much of it has been reduced, streamlined, or removed entirely as a direct result of play testing.  Some of it was just too cool or too difficult to part with; most of that is in the GM's Operations Manual. Covert Ops is a lite role-playing game.  Some folks define &amp;ldquo;lite&amp;rdquo; differently than we do, but in our opinion page count has at least something to do with it.  So that&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to create this separate book.  We hope it helps you become a better Game Master&amp;hellip; or entertains you at least.  It is packed full of modular optional rules, detailed step-by-step examples, clarifications, GM advice, and even a fun lexicon of espionage terms to help you learn the lingo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guidelines to help you arbitrate Operative Creation, along with a detailed example to use as a reference when clarity is needed.&lt;br/&gt;An optional rule for prioritized ability score determination to help build the operative.&lt;br/&gt;An optional rule for operative training centers to say where your operative trained to become an agent and what perks he gets for it.&lt;br/&gt;Optional tables to round out an operative to determine his gender, handedness, age, height, weight, even hair and eye color.&lt;br/&gt;An optional rule that provides an alternative to using origins.&lt;br/&gt;Guidelines on how to create new skills, if the ten that come in the core rulebook aren't enough for you.  Included is a full example, the merchant skill, who knows markets, product quality, and haggling like no other.&lt;br/&gt;Optional guidelines to using cash instead of equipment allowance in your campaign.  This is allow for campaigns where operatives aren't part of some central organization.&lt;br/&gt;An optional rule for determining and testing loyalties, as a replacement for or as an addition to the moral code rules provided in the core rule book.&lt;br/&gt;Guidelines on adding to the martial arts system in case your campaign focuses more on the cinematic ninja/kung-fu genre.&lt;br/&gt;A powerful optional system allowing operatives to have &amp;quot;strings&amp;quot; they can pull to pull off amazing things like gaining access to spy satellite data, manipulating internet and data grid information, enacting a quarantine in a city or a no-fly zone over a state.&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules for using initiative cards instead of initiative dice.&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules for hit locations in combat, where skill grants you a clear advantage by keeping hits closer to the kill zone.&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules for using condition cards.&lt;br/&gt;Guidelines for moderating risky social interaction situations, such as bribery, charm, deception, interrogation, intimidation, persuasion, and seduction.&lt;br/&gt;Rules for variant ammunition types, as well as how to model real-world firearms instead of using the firearm classifications found in the core rulebook.  Included are six examples of modelling real-world pistols.&lt;br/&gt;Several step-by-step examples: game play, enemy organization generation, master villain generation, even mission generation.  Even if you don't need the clarification, these are good reads and might spur your creativity.&lt;br/&gt;Some helpful GM advice on storytelling techniques, focus on the story and the mission and its characters, as well as a list of common espionage tropes to sprinkle into your games to give the players familiar thematic elements they've likely seen in their favorite modern action/espionage movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
