							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battles of 1866: Custoza</name>
									
			<description>The last of the three games split off from the earlier Battles of 1866: Frontier Battles project from APL, this game covers the First and Second Battles of Custoza in northern Italy. The first battle pits Josef Graf Radetzky against Carlo Alberto's crack Piedmontese forces while the second takes place on the same battlefield nearly 20 years later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses the same system as War of the States: Gettysburg, 1863 and War of the States: Chickamauga &amp; Chattanooga which is similar to the Rome at War and Eagles Of The Empire series as well. In this game, the units are Austrian, Italian, and Piedmontese infantry brigades, artillery batteries, and cavalry regiments.  The pieces are moved around topographic maps of the various battlegrounds.   Combat is resolved using by rolling a number of dice equal to the total combat strength of units involved in combat, with hits scored on a result of 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game does not yet have its own webpage on the APL site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
