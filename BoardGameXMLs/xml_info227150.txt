			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the near future (as imagined 70 years ago), Zone Runners is the number one show on TV. Each week a team of three contestants tries to complete a Level by running along narrow pathways that hover high in the sky. The better they perform, the more credits they win.&lt;br/&gt;At random intervals gaps appear in these tracks, over which&lt;br/&gt;players must jump, or otherwise fall onto the pathway below. And&lt;br/&gt;large mutant creatures, known as Blockers, are also waiting to try to stop their progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this solitaire micro game is to win as many credits as you can!&lt;br/&gt;Each Level consists of 3 tracks (high, mid and low), divided into 7 Zones (cards). The game has 3 Levels, each getting progressively more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;Runners who successfully reach a Level&amp;rsquo;s End Zone are awarded points (credits), depending on the height of track and the Level. A runner who completes one Level can then tackle the next one (hopefully with their other team mates if they also finished it).&lt;br/&gt;You control a team of 3 Runners. You&amp;rsquo;ll be rolling dice and deciding how best to assign them so that each Runner has the best chance of progressing. Runners also have special abilities that can modify their dice score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zone Runners was voted 'Best Solitaire Game' in the 2017 9-card Nanogame PnP Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;It was also voted '2nd Best Overall Game'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
