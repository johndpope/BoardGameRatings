			<description>As a newly crowned medieval king with visions of grandeur, do you have the skill and cunning to build the greatest empire in the history of the world? Use espionage, investment, and your loyal armies to expand your kingdom and achieve ultimate glory in this portable, quick, and easy-to-learn war based card game -- the only card game of its kind. Get it now and travel back in time ... to the Age of War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age of War card game from Battle Born Games is a medieval era, war-based card game that plays like a board game. Conquering land is the name of the game, and you can do this through battle and espionage. Along the way, enhancing your empire with cities and castles will help you accomplish your goals. You only have three actions to use per turn though, so you must carefully decide how best to use those actions with the cards available to you at that time. Here's briefly how it works:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) The player draws cards to start the turn.&lt;br/&gt;(2) The player then takes action!  This is when you play a card to the table, wage battle, and/or upgrade a city or castle.&lt;br/&gt;(3) After the player completes his actions, one army card may be moved from any territory to any territory within his empire.&lt;br/&gt;The cards:&lt;br/&gt;(a) Territory cards are central to the game. You want land above all else, and you'll do anything to get it!&lt;br/&gt;(b) Building cards can be added to any kingdom in your empire, and there are two types of building cards -- castle or city.&lt;br/&gt;(c) Army cards can be added to any territory or group of territories in your empire, and they attack and defend in battle.&lt;br/&gt;(d) Money cards will pay for upgrades to buildings, buying elite army units, and paying off enemy agents.&lt;br/&gt;(e) Mission cards have various purposes, all designed to help you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;Once you've amassed enough land to prove your dominance over every other king in the world, you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
