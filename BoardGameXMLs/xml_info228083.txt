							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Challenging the USDA Food Pyramid Instructor&#039;s Manual and Roles</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reacting to the Past is a series of historical role-playing games.  Students are given elaborate game books which place them in moments of historical controversy and intellectual ferment.  The class becomes a public body of some sort; students, in role, become particular persons from the period, often as members of a faction.  Their purpose is to advance a policy agenda and achieve their victory objectives.  To do so, they will undertake research and write speeches and position papers; and they will also give formal speeches, participate in informal debates and negotiations, and otherwise work to win the game.  After a few preparatory lectures, the game begins and the players are in charge; the instructor serves as adviser or &amp;ldquo;Gamemaster.&amp;rdquo;  Outcomes sometimes differ from the actual history; a post-mortem session at the end of the game sets the record straight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instructor's manual includes numerous print-and-play components, including character role sheets.  A separate document with &amp;quot;table tent&amp;quot; name tags also is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
