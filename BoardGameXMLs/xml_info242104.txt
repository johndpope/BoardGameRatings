			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twas the night before Yuletide, and outside the village,&lt;br/&gt;The goblins crept closer, eager to pillage.&lt;br/&gt;The gate guards stood idle with nary a care,&lt;br/&gt;Blind to the danger that soon would be there...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the evening before the Yuletide festival, and the people of Glyphstone village have prepared a feast for the morrow, sacrificing livestock and decorating their temple with blood and twigs. Unfortunately for them, several gangs of goblins plan to crash the party and participate in some feasting of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Savage Worlds One Sheet adventure for Saga of the Goblin Horde. It provides a simple five-scene framework which can be run with minimal preparation, leaving room for the Game Master to flesh out the story as much or as little as they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
