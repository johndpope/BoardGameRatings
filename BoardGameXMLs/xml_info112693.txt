							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wind-Up Knight</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wind-up Knight is a platform game with 3-d graphics. Players control a toy wind up knight that runs nonstop through a series of enemy-infested obstacle courses. Players have buttons to make the knight jump, roll, swing his sword, or hold his shield over his head, but they cannot make him stop running! As the game progresses the levels become increasing difficult, requiring more complex maneuvers to make it through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first portion of the game is free; later portions of the game can be purchased with tickets, which can be paid for or can be earned through in-game achievements. In addition there are in-game items (swords, shields, etc.) that give the player extra powers and make the game easier. It is possible, but extremely difficult, to earn and beat the whole game solely through skillful play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
