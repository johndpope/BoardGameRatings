			<description>By 2213, the religions and governments of Earth have separated into various factions competing for resources and technology. The most powerful of these empires, The Genesis, employ strict laws and draconian influence. More than half their population has been imprisoned aboard hulking generation ships. Treated as separate colonies, these ships vie for their rightful access to dwindling basic needs. Among the rising tensions is a small group of outlaws guided by a mysterious puppet master. Could they be the key to saving the galaxy? Or are they part of its endless entropy? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogue Moon is a branching path co-operative game set in a dark science fiction universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of one of several criminals that have been jettisoned in an escape pod when their transport ship was mysteriously attacked. As a team, the players will complete objectives guided by a mysterious figure calling himself the &amp;quot;Broker&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players explore derelict space stations made of quantum matter - making every station different from the last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogue Moon leverages a scenario book full of campaign missions with branching paths based on individual decisions and completed or failed objectives. Throughout the course of the game, players will discover the hidden secrets of each character and their roles in a galactic-wide conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Form a team&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     There are heroes among the bad as well as the good.
