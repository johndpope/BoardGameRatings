							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scions of Asmodeus</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rich and the Shameless&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the outside world, the Scions of Asmodeus is a social club where the wealthy and popular meet to engage in fund-raisers. Hollywood actors, socialite millionaires, and corporate CEOs claim membership. Behind the public perception, the social club is one of decadence and sexual depravity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true purpose for the Scions of Asmodeus is to gather as much wealth and influence as they can in order to manipulate world events through economic, political, and supernatural means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empress (PL 11): Powerful psychic. Spoiled and controlling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rajah (PL 13): Kinetic energy manipulator. Cunning businessman and owner of a genetics lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bishop (PL 9): Gravity controller. Greedy and depraved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dario Zane (PL 10): Brain in a cyber body. Schemes to kill all metas, even those on his team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
