			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;Each player assumes the role of a property tycoon, with the objective of amassing the largest portfolio of iconic buildings, golf courses and luxury toys from around the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a character figurine and begin at the start space, each player receives 7 resource cards, starting cash, a notepad and a player-sheet. Upon rolling the dice the first player then moves clockwise around the board, either landing on an asset, risk or deal space, they have the option to purchase the asset if they hold the required resource cards, or take a risk or deal card from the appropriate pile. A pre-selected banker controls the flow of cash for transactions and income which is received upon passing start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players land on an opponent's asset they must pay the indicated rent to the owner, inability to pay forces them to leave the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play continues until one person is either declared the winner or all other players are eliminated due to running out of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
