			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The religion of the dark god Khayne is divided and scattered, with each small cult worshiping their bloody lord after their own malicious fashion. One of the largest cults in the Brotherhood of Khayne&amp;mdash;as well as the most ruthless and organized&amp;mdash;is the Untharan Brotherhood, a monastic order in which adherents practice draconian discipline, ritual bloodletting, and the art of war. While they spend much of their efforts aiding the rest of the Brotherhood in fending off the quickslavers, members of this order have occasionally clashed with the forces running the Imperial blockade of the islands of Unthara, wielding weapons of terrifying power. Among these weapons are the Twin Furies, a matched pair of kamas that focus the hatred of Khayne into a fierce presence upon the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
