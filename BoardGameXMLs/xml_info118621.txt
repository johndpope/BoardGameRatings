			<description>Hummer Badlands is a racing game that involves off-road racing in a Hummer vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For single player, there are Extreme Off-Road Two areas: Granny Gear and Pike's Peak. The player must shift gears in order to pass different terrains in Granny Gear, and choose different paths in the uncharted Pike's Peak. Both areas have four races: Practice (which unlocks Amateur), Amateur, (which unlocks a &amp;quot;level 1&amp;quot; non-customizable vehicle), Professional (&amp;quot;level 2&amp;quot; vehicle), and Extreme (Best vehicle in the game, Bling or Patriot).  There are also Quick Race, Beat the Clock (the player must get to the finish line in a set time), Championship Racing (a tournament against various opponents.&lt;br/&gt;and Time Trial (which records how long it takes for the player to win).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 Player, there are Quick Race (a 1-on-1 race), Pursuit (a race recording the distance the players have traveled from the finish line), and Tug-O-War (the Hummers are tied to a rope and attempt to pull each other in the water).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models available are the HUMMER H1 (discontinued), H2 SUT, H2 SUV, H3 SUV and the H3T concept. Most models can be customized by transmission and upgrades (which depend on the model). The colors may also be changed. Six unlockable vehicles: The Security (Police, H3 SUV), Custom Racing (racing livery, H3T), Fire Truck (Firefighting, H1), Snow Patrol (A snow themed Police, H2 SUT), Bling (Golden, spinners, etc, H2 SUV), and the Patriot (Eagle and Flag-themed, H1) are non-customizable. Customization determines Speed, Handling, and Hp (how much damage it can take), as well as the look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hummer Badlands&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
