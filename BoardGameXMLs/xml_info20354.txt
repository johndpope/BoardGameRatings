Though you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t guess that from the counters!&lt;br/&gt;- Mont Orgueil Castle - a place where you get sent when you have failed to pay your bills - though you are able to visit if you happen to pass by.&lt;br/&gt;- The Leonidas Square, where you gain &amp;pound;200 by passing through. Not in the usual position of one of the corner squares, but two squares after the Start.&lt;br/&gt;- 21&amp;quot;Pay &amp;amp; Take&amp;quot; and 21&amp;quot;Good News/ Bad News&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;- Mortgages&lt;br/&gt;- Sapphire Bedrooms Sponsored Free Parking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- ... and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box Description :         Mont Orgueil Castle and Gorey Harbour, Jersey.
