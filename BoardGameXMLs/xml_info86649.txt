							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Man&#039;s Trail</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bob Bledsaw's final contribution to the fantasy world he created, the Wilderlands. This adventure module runs some 24 pages, with 12 maps covering the areas of encounters, in addition to detailed Campaign Maps for Wilderlands Hexes 3615, 3715, 3815 and 3914 of the Roglaroon and Gasconfold Plains Regions, between Modron and Tegel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail east from Modron to the Coast, known as Lost Man's Trail, has been a source of mystery for some time. Adventurers have a habit of disappearing from the trail. Are they lured away by some enticement, or waylayed by the legendary Skandic Raiders? The only safe place to stay, The Fat Deer Inn, offers good ale, soft bedding, and an assortment of characters; each having their own reason for being there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product was written by Bob Bledsaw for use with the Judges Guild Universal System, and contains the latest version of charts to date. It is in original PDF format, this is not a scan of an old product. Happy Gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
