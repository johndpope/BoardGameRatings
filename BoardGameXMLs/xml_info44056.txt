			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greatwall is in peril &amp;mdash; not from the military forces of Iuz, but from lack of goods and supplies. Caravans from Willip have ceased thanks to increased dangers on the Willip Critwall Grabford Trail. As the key fort positioned to contain the Iuzian flood, Greatwall is a strategic necessity. Its failure would mean a major incursion along the border.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters are hired to escort a caravan from Greatwall to Willip; if its merchants are afraid to come to the fort, the fort will go to them. This should be simple, cut and dried guard job. Right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course not. There are many surprises in store for your little caravan, and your characters will need to keep their wits about them day and night in order to make it to the other end. Secret plans are afoot, conspiracies are brewing, and nothing is as it seems while on the Border Watch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module uses information presented in the From the Ashes boxed set and the Iuz the Evil accessories. However, ownership of these two products is not necessary to play this module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;for 4&amp;ndash;6 characters of levels 1&amp;ndash;3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
