							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War 2410</name>
									
			<description>War 2410 is a war-related video game that takes place in the year 2003, when scientists have developed the perfect soldier through genetic engineering. Three groups of soldiers that were enginereed to protect humanity have revolted against their masters. As a result, four factions are fighting it out for control of the Earth. The player is in command of the GDA (Global Defense Alliance) and the primary objective for the game's twenty missions is the total annihilation of M.A.R.S. (a group of unsavory superhumans who have turned against their masters), the Orcs, and the Cromes (which can be summarized as a group of self-sentient, self-aware combat robots). Capturing a lab results in the ability to build a superweapon to destroy the other factions; some missions require players to capture enemy bases for the war effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side has infantry, tanks, and the air force needed to get the job done. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a unit's defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the attacker is within range; the counterattack takes place at the same time as the attack. Even if the player finishes off a unit with his attack, they can still hurt the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This war would decide the fate of humanity and set the stage clear for its sequel War 3010: The Revolution. A mysterious intergalactic force known as the Kyllen would end up occupying the universe nearly 200 years after the end of this game's story line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;War 2410&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
