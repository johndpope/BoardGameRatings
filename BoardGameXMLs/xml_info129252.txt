			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is a supplement for the Dungeon World roleplaying game by Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel. These let you play characters from some of the monstrous races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can use this document to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Play a character transformed into a monstrous race during play, because they are cursed or affected by a spell.&lt;br/&gt;2. Play a character of a monstrous race in a normal party. It is usually best to talk this through with the group to check your character will fit in, as the inclusion of even a single character from a monstrous race can change a game completely.&lt;br/&gt;3. Play a whole party of monstrous creatures, starting with the included adventure toolkit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
