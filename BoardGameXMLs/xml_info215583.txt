							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Plunder of North Port</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your cohorts have pulled into Free Haven, a port city in the northern reaches to settle down for the season. Your respite is short lived as word reaches the city that a small community further north has been attacked by humanoid raiders! Refugees from North Port have arrived and report their community has been sacked. There is little hope of survivors and the fear is that Free Haven may be next. With little else to do, it is time for the party to put on their &amp;ldquo;hero caps&amp;rdquo; and save the day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a 4-6 PCs of 12th &amp;ndash; 14th level.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system but was designed for a frigid environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
