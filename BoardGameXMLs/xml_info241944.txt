							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leap Frog Globe Game</name>
									
			<description>This is an educational geography game for children that features an inflatable globe. There are three levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game One is a simple picture matching activity with race element. Players attempt to match the picture on a card (like a Kangaroo) with a location on the globe (like Australia) as a timer is running. First player to the finish space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Two is a race across the board as players attempt to match pictures and locations to a continent card (Asia, Africa, etc.) that was randomly assigned at the beginning of the session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Three adds word cards and requires additional reading skills. This is also a race but it includes a card taking mechanic based on a word search between player's hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2, 3, or 4 players age 3 or older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the inflatable globe, a globe stand, tokens, cards, timer, instruction booklet, and board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
