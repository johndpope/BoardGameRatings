			<description>From the Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the real lives of most people, holidays and celebrations of various sorts often provide them with their greatest experiences, and positive and negative events alike tend to be significantly more memorable when viewed through the lenses of festivities. While most game masters and storytellers certainly understand how festivals, holidays, and celebrations can be used to accentuate the action of their scenarios, however, such events are used surprisingly rarely in this way. Several of the features in this volume of d-Infinity are designed to be of use to game designers and authors who want to use holidays and celebrations to a greater extent in their stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d-Infinity Volume #7 Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Editorial: &amp;ldquo;Holidays &amp;amp; Festivals&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fiction: &amp;ldquo;Introduction to the World of Kos&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LARP/Prop Room: &amp;ldquo;Swords &amp;amp; Sorcery in the World of Kos&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Dice: &amp;ldquo;Black Hat Magic&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 Oddities: &amp;ldquo;Random Holiday Treats&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic System/Mutant Future: &amp;ldquo;Mutant Plant Monsters&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic System/Labyrinth Lord: &amp;ldquo;Six Festive Spells&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathfinder System: &amp;ldquo;Festivals &amp;amp; High Holy Days&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathfinder System/Insults &amp;amp; Injuries: &amp;ldquo;Alcohol &amp;amp; Other Intoxicants&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5th Edition: &amp;ldquo;Bard Background: Thespian&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards &amp;amp; Quests: &amp;ldquo;Monsters of Kos&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chevauchee: &amp;ldquo;A Cold Day in Hel!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d&amp;infin; (&amp;ldquo;d-Infinity&amp;rdquo;) is a multi-platform gaming supplement that covers a wide variety of rules systems and includes content that can be universally applied to many different sorts of table-top, live-action, and role-playing games. It includes both material that can be applied to all or many sorts of games and items that are self-standing and which can be played on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features of each thematic volume include new rules, stats, and bonus content tying in with several different game systems; paper miniatures; and interviews. Rules systems supported include Pathfinder, OGL v.3.5, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; system, Labyrinth Lord, Mutant Future, Cards &amp;amp; Quests, Call of Cthulhu, and Cthulhu Live. It is jointly published by Armorcast, Dagon Industries Inc., Dark Threads, Flying Buffalo Inc., Mindgame Productions, OffWorld Designs Inc., Skirmisher Publishing LLC, and the United States Marine Space Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that the most enjoyable gaming periodicals are not just devoted to single games or even the products of a single company, but also include content that makes a reader interested in other games, material that can be applied to all or many sorts of games, and items that are self-standing and which can be played on their own. For that reason, this publication includes many voices and exclusive material compatible with many rules systems and the products of many different companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
