							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Franklin&#039;s Sea</name>
									
			<description>Simple Age of Sail tactical naval miniatures war game with an alternate history twist (and alternate physics and geography). Includes instructions for simple model construction, scenarios, etc. Designed to be played on the front of your refrigerator, but there's no reason it can't be used for evocative fast play AWI/Napoleonic naval war on a horizontal surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Franklin's Sea Columbus actually sailed off the edge of the world. There being no new world, Ben Franklin was undistracted by politics and discovered not only electricity, but fantastic secrets about the Earth's magnetic field that would allow the new copper-bottomed ships to sail safely over the edge of the world and down the ocean on the side. This began a new age of exploration and exploitation, and literally new horizons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players command naval groups of two to six ships sailing and fighting on a vertical surface. Movement rules include wind direction and handling differences between different classes of ships, as well as drifting down the sea, of course. Ships are rated for broadside dice and boarding dice. Range reduces firepower.  The effects of damage are noted right on the simple record sheet for easy reference. With lucky rolls enemy ships can strike very quickly, or they may be beaten down with many shots. A ship that loses all its sails will be unable to resist drifting downward toward the abyss...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game stats and construction plans included for 18 gun sloop of war, 44 gun frigate, 74 gun ship of the line, and 500 ton merchantman. Three scenarios included, two quite asymmetrical and one straightforward shoot 'em up with multiple large ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple but pleasing ship models are constructed from craft sticks, paper clips, paper, glue, etc with ordinary tools and glue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(author's note)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
