			<description>ネコトコバン ねこかぶりへん (Cat and Koban) is a fast bluffing game. Each player has an identical set of cards, 1, 2, 3, and cat, and lays them out in numerical order increasing to the right, with the cat in any position in the row, with a stone above one card that acts as a doubler. The dealer for the round lays their cards out similarly. If the dealer's cat is in the same position as a player's cat, that player receives no points for the round, otherwise the player receives points equal to the sum of the cards from the left of their cat to the next player's cat. After everyone has been the dealer once, the highest total score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
