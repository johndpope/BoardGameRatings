			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hero's Handbook is packed with enhancements and options for high-fantasy heroes. It contains over 120 new feats, more than 80 new magic items, 12 new prestige classes, 80 new spells and dozens of new inventions of alchemy and craftsmanship. It also features an appendix of bonus material that didn't fit in the other chapters, including a new race and a new class. From sinister weapons and gemstone-plated armor to magical beds and crushing arcana, the Hero's Handbook is essential for any spell-wielding, sword-brandishing band of heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over 120 new feats in the Handbook for classes of all sorts. Combat oriented feats including Overpowering Blows, Axe Kick, Serpentine Strike, Armor Expert, Fearless Assault, Best Defense, Cloud Punch, and Ferocious Rage are supplemented by plenty of utilitarian feats such as Linguistics, Apocrustic Endurance, Deeds of Renown, Stance of Redoubt, and dozens of other amazing deeds of heroics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Handbook also presents 12 new prestige classes such as the arcane master, battle magi, fabled champion, stalwart defender, demagogue, grand pugilist, combat tactician, and other heroic professions for fighters, wizards, monks, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is also packed with 80 pulverizing spells of both arcane and divine origin. Arm your wizards with cannonade, chromatic coruscation, parathematic bolt, contumacy, abyssal vortex, shadow cloud, anthropomorphic ward, and other bone-crushing sorceries! With the Handbook, clerics and other devout heroes can add god speed, hellfire and brimstone, dauntless resolve, earth fist, doom shield, battlefield, and plenty of other acts divine might to their repertoires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hero's Handbook also contains more than 60 new wonders of alchemy, herbalism and craftsmanship. Mining spikes, sleeping pills, mage's blend, dragon's bane, sinister weapons, gem-stone plated armor, and plenty of other surprising objects, chemicals, and tools fill these pages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the Handbook presents 80 new magic items including bracers of battle fortune, blankets of solace, teeth of attack, combat boots, rings of heroism, and dozens of other helms, rings, staves, beds, cauldrons, robes and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
