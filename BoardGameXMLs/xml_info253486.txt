			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;Hyperkill is a flick-screen shoot'em-up, very similar to the Commodore 64 classic Cybernoid. The player controls a ship that travels through the screens, shooting enemies and escaping the levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies from beyond space have invaded your base!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defeat or evade as many as you can while working your way down to the basement generator to try and reactivate the internal security systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your batteries have a limited supply and so you will need to recharge at the wall sockets found throughout the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect power-ups along the way to aid your mission from shield top-ups to the mighty spinner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Mat Recardo: code, graphics, design&lt;br/&gt;Sergey Kosov: AY music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
