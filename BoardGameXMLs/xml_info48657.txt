			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;quot;Tango Sierra Niner, you are clear all the way home.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Home. Jayne Pawn smiled at the word, keeeping her eagle straight and steady toward the Norlight border. The johar grass a thousand meters below her was blooming, giving the Northern Plain a kaleidoscopic tinge. Rolling hills broke the flatness of the fields and Jayne could see how railways and interstates linked the various population centers. Her positioning radar indicated that she could begin her approach and she turned the high-performance fighter toward the landship carrier that was patrolling the border areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The steel and polymer behemoth was her home for now, but the lands to the North called to her heart. She remembered her youth in Kossuth, her pilgrimages to Sorrento, and her family's move to Valeria. It was only in Norlight territory that Jayne felt she could relax, be free with her faith, and trust in her fellow man. She was a daughter of the Prophet, and his peace was with her always.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Jayne remained oblivious to the gunfire far below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Norther Lights Confederacy brings Heavy Gear fans into the heart of the North. The largest league of the CNCS, NLC is the driving force behind the policies of the great northern confederation. The home of the great Sorrento Revisionist Faith, the league is nevertheless a divided house. For every Norlight ready to follow the church wherever it might lead, another claims his own freedom. Truth and peace are increasingly neglected, replaced by fear and hatred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NLC Sourcebook gives Heavy Gear roleplayers and Gamemasters all the background they need to play in the confederacy.  Information from across the league, from the religious center of Sorrento to the decadence of Sesshu, is covered in ample detail.  The Sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A complete history of the NLC&lt;br/&gt;     Details on Sorrento Revisionism and its role in North&lt;br/&gt;     Full write-ups (including maps) on all 14 Norlight city-states&lt;br/&gt;     Information on the Dorothean Order of warrior monks&lt;br/&gt;     Details on the elite quick Response Teams of the Henema Police&lt;br/&gt;     Sample campaing set-ups&lt;br/&gt;     New caracter archetypes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
