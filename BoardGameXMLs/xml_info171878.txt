			<description>OMG-Z is a zombie-themed action puzzle video game developed by UK-based studio Laughing Jackal. It was released as a PlayStation mini on the PlayStation Network in North America on 2 August 2011 and Europe on 3 August 2011. Set in the fictional city of Redfield during a zombie apocalypse, the gameplay of OMG-Z focuses on causing chain reactions to eliminate the zombies. The player's weapons fire a 'zombie-exploding pathogen' which causes zombies to explode and those nearby to also explode in turn. Through the course of the game's 81 levels the player is able to upgrade various abilities to improve their performance and achieve higher scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;OMG-Z&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
