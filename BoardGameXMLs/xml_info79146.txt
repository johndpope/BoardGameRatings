							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pet in TV</name>
									
			<description>Pet in TV was a little known pet-raising simulation released by Sony Computer Entertainment in 1997, The game consists of teaching your Pet tricks, getting it new costumes and learning it what items are edible in the wild along with solving random puzzles around the PET world. The game on release gained very bad reviews for its lack of gameplay, storyline and lasting appeal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose from a selection of PiTs and name it. It is then up to the player to nurture their PiT and allow it to explore the 3D world, learning from its encounters with scenery and objects through trial-and-error. Once these behaviours are learned, the PiT will know how to respond to those objects in the future (such as a Flower, or a Spike). Whenever the PiT becomes injured, or tired, returning it to its home will allow Dr. Y to fix it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective then becomes for your PiT to solve puzzles on its own - for which it will be rewarded with AI upgrade chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_in_TV,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_in_TV,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
