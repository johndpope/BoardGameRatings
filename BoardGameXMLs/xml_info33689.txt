			<description>The game consists of a deck of cards supplied with a box and rules card. It is described as a 'Topical Card game' by the publishers. The subject matter abstractly &amp;amp; comically (for 1939, that is!) portrays the blackout period in England during the German bombing raids of early World War two.&lt;br/&gt;The pack of cards consist of five suits (Silhouettes, Fashions, Search-Lights, Views, &amp;amp; Lights)and are numbered from two to twelve (minus the numbers six and nine)for the purpose of scoring. Additionally there five Black Out cards that provide the blocking element of the game and are valued at one point.&lt;br/&gt;Play consists of each player in turn playing a card from hand to table, face up, from the hand dealt (six cards for up to three players and five cards for four or five players). Each player builds a personal collection by adding either an identical number or suit to the card previously played. If a player is unable to do so, a card must be taken into the hand from the stock of cards not dealt. There is a blocking element of play by the use of Black Out cards which may be placed on an opponents pile in order to stop cards from being played on that pile and forces the player to play cards on other players piles. &lt;br/&gt;The first player to play all cards ends the round and each players played cards are scored. The game is played up to 200 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
