							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One-Minute Che Guevara -- Bolivia 1967</name>
									
			<description>This year will mark the 50th anniversary of the death of Ernesto &amp;quot;Che&amp;quot; Guevara during the 1967 guerilla campaign in Bolivia. One-Minute Che Guevara -- Bolivia 1967 is a microgame attempting to portray these events with a small map and a limited number of counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One-Minute Che Guevara -- Bolivia 1967 is a solitaire challenge. The entire campaign only takes about 60 seconds to play. However, the game offers a player most of the political and military choices available to Guevara in 1967.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player represents Che Guevara and guerilla units represent small groups approximately the size of a platoon. Bolivian army units represent elements of the 2nd Ranger Battalion at the company level. Historical factors like propaganda, supply shortages, and Guevara's limited tactical options are contained in the rules. The political phase is played on a map of Bolivia; the military phase is played on a separate battlefield map. Event Cards are used to guide the narrative but several different outcomes are possible. Victory is determined by the level of Guevara's political and military success ... if he survives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a companion game to the previously released One-Minute Waterloo and One-Minute Little Bighorn. It is a free Print &amp;amp; Play title with a single 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; map, charts, rules, cards, and a handful of playing pieces or markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
