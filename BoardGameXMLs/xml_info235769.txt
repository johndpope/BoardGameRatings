But, the question does arise &amp;ndash; do you dare eat what is suggested?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this special edition of the Equipment Maker series, you'll find tables to help you decide on...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Size - How big is your pizza?&lt;br/&gt;    Shape - Circular, square or something else?&lt;br/&gt;    Base - From the standard base, to bagels and more - (d100 table with repeating options)&lt;br/&gt;    Sauce - What sauce is on the pizza?
