Explore new islands, fight in naval battles, trade exotic goods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the captain of warship from Dominican. After an unsuccessful battle far from mother island, you are on the other side of the world with little money, which just enough for small ships. Now everything depends on you! Will you be able to return home on warships or will disappear in the depths of the sea in one of the bloodiest battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The closer you move to mother island, the stronger the opponent. Large fleet can not be defeated only through a powerful weapon very important to actively maneuver, deviating from enemy shots.

Sometimes peaceful trade brings in more revenue than robbery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game you play on one of the easiest ships. She has a few guns, low speed and small hold &amp;ndash; it is poorly suited for both war and trade. Fortunately for any island has a wide selection of more advanced ships, which you can buy. When buying a ship, pay attention to the speed of the ship, number and power of guns, the volume of the hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to purchasing a new vehicle, you can always improve an existing one. There are three types of improvements:&lt;br/&gt;- Guns &amp;ndash; increases the power of kernels and slightly reduces the recharge time.&lt;br/&gt;- Armor &amp;ndash; reduces the chance of the enemy to cause damage to your ship.&lt;br/&gt;- Sails &amp;ndash; increases the speed of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control:&lt;br/&gt; - To turn the ship &amp;ndash; tilt iphone in the right direction.&lt;br/&gt; - To shoot &amp;ndash; tap anywhere on the screen.&lt;br/&gt; - To see a map &amp;ndash; tap on the compass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features include:&lt;br/&gt; - 15 unique ships;&lt;br/&gt; - 20 unique islands;&lt;br/&gt; - 30 unique battles;&lt;br/&gt; - a world full of dangers and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
