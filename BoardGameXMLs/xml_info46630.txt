			<description>Players start with $12 million each. Each player starts with a pawn on any corner space of the gameboard. Every space on the gameboard's track except the corner spaces and the spaces next to the corners has a stock certificate associated with it. A player may buy the stock, if available, after landing on its space. A player may sell stock to the bank before rolling the dice and moving one's pawn. The price of stock, as indicated on the dial in the center of the gameboard, contantaly fluctates according to the dice roll. Players are free to wheel and deal with other and share ownership of stock certificates. They can even go bankrupt and not be eliminated from the game! The first player to accumulate $50 million in cash is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
