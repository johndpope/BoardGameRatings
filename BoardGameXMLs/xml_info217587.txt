							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure Quarterly (Issue 8 - Oct 2016)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the latest issue of Adventure Quarterly, now with new hand drawn cartography by Tommi Salama and all original art to help create encounters and stories you want to be a part of. Where creative designers cut their teeth, or continue to sink seasoned canines, into the meat of what makes an enjoyable adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a trek, almost a quest, through seven issues of Adventure Quarterly to reach this eighth issue. Like any new frontier, this one is packed with adventures and surprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve Race for the Cage by Haakon Sullivan, wherein a party of 4th level PC&amp;rsquo;s are embroiled in a race against both time and cultists who seek to release a horrible beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, there&amp;rsquo;s the sixth installment of Ruins Perilous by Michael Welham, within which 6th level characters discover The Test Lab and its&amp;hellip;let&amp;rsquo;s say, unusual machinations. There are also some unruly ratfolk and their disgruntled grievances to worry about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, we find ourselves looking at a deliverable from Kickstarter campaign, The Vault of Shaju by Craig Campbell with Ben McFarland. The PCs enter the employ of a lore master. They must escort him to the Vault of Shaju. However, it&amp;rsquo;s-of course- not as simple as it seems. Ninth level PCs should find life very interesting here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Adventure Quarterly. They say pain brings wisdom. We hope you use this issue to make some PC&amp;rsquo;s very, very wise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
