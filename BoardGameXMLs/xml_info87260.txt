			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gbanga Famiglia is a mixed-reality game for the iPhone. The premise of the game is that all players attempt to take over bars and become the best Mafia boss in the region. Gbanga Famiglia is location aware, meaning that the game tracks a player&amp;rsquo;s location in cities and translates it into an in-game location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players need to travel around the city to locate bars and clubs &amp;ndash; which are linked to actual bars in cities &amp;ndash; which they then attempt to take over for their Famiglia. Takeovers successes are dependent on a Famiglia&amp;rsquo;s power, which is determined by cash flow and the number of members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
