			<description>Party Fowl: The Game of Drunk Ducks is a card-based, light strategy game with area control mechanics on a modular board. Players win by being the first duck to score 21 points, which they accomplish by playing cards that dominate specific topics of conversation, sabotage other players, and transform their characters into party legends and the coolest ducks on campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as students attending Duck University. It&amp;rsquo;s the week before finals, and you're fitting to get fowl! You&amp;rsquo;ll need to party carefully though; the social pecking order at Duck U is a real cluster-duck. Strategically move your duck around the house and start conversations that make you the life of the party. Just watch out for those basic hens and duck bois looking to sabotage your fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
