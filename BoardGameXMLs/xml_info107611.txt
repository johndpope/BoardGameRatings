			<description>In Words of Wisdom: the Game 2-10 players compete against one another to be the first to get rid of all the cards in their hands.  Each player begins with 7 cards from one of the 2 decks and must attempt to play his cards to a community board.  The board is divided into 2 sections, and players must play cards only to their designated spaces on the board, only when adjacent to other placed cards, and only into 1 section per turn.  Players may choose to (or may occasionally be forced to) draw simultaneously from both the Book Deck (which has more of the same cards that were dealt initially) and the Providence Deck (which enables special placements).  Some cards are setbacks when drawn, while others allow opponents to save each other from the setbacks (and benefit themselves in the process.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played in either of 2 ways.  The Standard Version contains a few extra cards which force play to the board and which create blockages on the board that can be removed only through cooperative effort.  This extra layer of complexity provides opportunity for cooperative play and additional strategy which is not available in the much simpler Family Version of the game (which is better suited for children and casual gamers.)  In addition to removing a few cards from the decks, the Family Version allows for a different ending to the game: where the Standard Version is resolved in a Discard Phase that awards victory to the lowest scorer, the Family Version is won simply when any player goes out, having played all their cards on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Words of Wisdom: the Game has an overtly Biblical theme.  The numbered board spaces represent the 66 books of the Bible, and the cards in the Book Deck represent individual books of the Bible.  The cards in the Providence Deck channel Bible-based occurrences such as Trials, Miracles, Prophecies, and Parables.  Nevertheless, the theme is as light and non-intrusive as the game play is: the rules state that no familiarity with the Bible is necessary to play, enjoy, or win the game.  Likewise, there are no specific teachings or stories told through the game itself.  If the game attempts anything spiritual, it is only to familiarize the players with the names and order of the books that make up the Bible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
