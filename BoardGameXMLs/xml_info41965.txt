							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Generic Racing Game</name>
									
			<description>In the Generic Racing Game, the pawns of the players represent their racers, ready to race down the track.&lt;br/&gt;The rules are exactly this: rules and nothing else. There is no given track to race upon, as you can create your own track just with a pencil and a sheet of common grid paper.&lt;br/&gt;As racing always has been part of mankind's sports culture, there are a couple of themes given on the last sides of the rulebook, so you are free to choose the setting as well as the orientation of the gameplay (tactics, luck, wargame).&lt;br/&gt;As a solitaire option, you can always race a track on your own and try to beat the number of turns you took on every subsequent lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
