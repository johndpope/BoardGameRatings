			<description>The game is for two competing players seated opposite each other. It uses 25 double sided tiles and a dividing marker. The objective is to remove all your opponent&amp;rsquo;s tiles from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles have 5 separate actions printed on them and a black side and a white side. Players use matching pairs of tiles (one black and one white) to perform these actions to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiles are placed in a line and players travel left to right utilising their own tiles and then their opponents&amp;rsquo;. During play tiles are flipped over when one player uses them making them available for the competing player to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
