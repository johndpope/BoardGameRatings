			<description>'A Scripture Recreation For The Young'.&lt;br/&gt;I cannot find any rules but I think it is going to be a set collecting game but with only two cards per set. It may even be a Pairs memory type game, where all the cards are laid on the table face down. In a turn, the player chooses a card and then looks for its match. This is made more difficult with these cards because you are matching a date with an event.&lt;br/&gt;Half of the cards feature a biblical event, the other half feature dates. All of the date cards feature a B.C. year.&lt;br/&gt;I think this is pretty heavy going for a children's game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
