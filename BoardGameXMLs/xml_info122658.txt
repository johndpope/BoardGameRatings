							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sqez</name>
									
			<description>The playing-field of Sqez is a rectilinear array of dots, of any convenient size &amp;mdash; but arrays of less than 8 x 8 are too small, and exceptionally large fields may prolong the game needlessly, unless there are many players. The easiest way to make the arrays is to type up rows of full-stops on a typewriter; but it's just possible that somewhere or other you can buy dotted paper (wallpaper?), and it wouldn't be hard to get used to playing on small-squared graph paper, counting each inter&amp;not;section as a 'dot'. But I leave this to your ingenuity.&lt;br/&gt;Each player in Sqez must complete a rectangle (oblong or square) by drawing a line through the dots. The line drawn must not anywhere duplicate an already placed line, though it may cross another line, or meet it at one end; and the rectangle drawn must enclose at least one 'free' dot &amp;mdash; a free dot being defined as a dot that has no line passing through it or originating at it. The last player to complete a legal move is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Those are the entire rules, except to say that a player who places a line which he cannot (owing to miscalculation) use to make a legal move (by completing a rectangle as defined) forfeits the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
