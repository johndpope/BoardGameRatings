But as time comes &amp;quot;Luck (Ruck)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Unlucky (ア ン ラ ッ ク)&amp;quot; all swallow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will release a new sensory robot battle this spring as a model!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;36 cards (for 2 people)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One instruction book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The four-player competition is an extension rule, and two sets of these are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The game requires two separate 6 pieces of dice (due to packing, it is not possible to bundle the dice that were predicted in the early days, but it will be accepted)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
