			<description>This game is designed to be played in any workplace, by colleagues or representatives of different departments, in about a minute per workday. The goal is to reach four designated rooms on an office building map and then be the first to reach the &amp;quot;project completed&amp;quot; field. &lt;br/&gt;On each workday, the players can move from the staircase to any empty room - the first player to show up at work can play first, the next ones in order of their appearance. A room that has been reached is marked on a personal success field. When all players have made a move, a random floor is blocked and anyone on that floor cannot go back to the staircase, thus not reach any new room in the next move (on the next workday).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player/team to reach the &amp;quot;project completed&amp;quot; field is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
