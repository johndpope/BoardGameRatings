			<description>From the introduction to the game:&lt;br/&gt;The setting in Arbitrary is modern; pretty much everyday stuff. There's no vampires, werewolves, magic,&lt;br/&gt;time-travellers or laspistols. There might be psychics, but only on the end of phone lines and in labratories&lt;br/&gt;in Russia. Crime is a part of soceity, much as it is in real life - there are certain areas you don't go after dark&lt;br/&gt;(or even during the day). The police will beat the crap out of you if you get on their wrong side, or at least&lt;br/&gt;treat you in a rather unpleasant manner. In short, there's absolutely nothing special to it - it's typical actionmovie&lt;br/&gt;fodder, as seen in Die Hard or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
