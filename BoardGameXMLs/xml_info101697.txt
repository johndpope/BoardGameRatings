			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You go by the name of Pybba, a fierce and proud warrior of the orc race. Fighting, killing your enemies and eating are your only pleasures in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As chief of a motley horde of orcs, goblins and trolls, you live a remote and secretive underground existence in the caverns of the Moonstone Hills, shunned and hated by all civilized races like men, dwarves and elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You frequently venture forth, at the head of your band or warriors, taking fire and the sword to the peaceful settlements of men in your pursuit of plunder and a glorious death in battle. It's one such raid as this that you find yourself in charge of today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the numerous blood sacrifices made to appease the Spirits, the tribal shaman predicts good fortune and hunting ahead. Your warband raise a cheer, eager to wet their blades and spear tips with warm blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You lead them out of your tribal cave, ready for war and wondering what fate has in store for you this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
