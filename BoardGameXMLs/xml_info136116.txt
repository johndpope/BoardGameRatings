			<description>Players in Primo want to rid themselves of cards by laying them in sequence on six stacks shared amongst all the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player has six cards in hand. In any order and as many times as the player wants, she can (1) play a card from her hand onto a stack if the number on the played card is one less than the top card of the stack, (2) move one stack onto another if the highest card of the moved stack is one less than the top card of the stack being covered, and (3) play any card from her hand onto an empty stack. A player's turn ends when she can play no more cards, possibly because she has emptied her hand! Two special cards are available with five copies of each; one forces opponents to take cards from the top of a stack and place them in their personal deck, and the other allows a player to play one or more cards at the top of the stack instead of the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of playing cards on a turn, a player can return any number of cards from her hand to the bottom of her deck, then draw that many cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all cards in her deck and her hand wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two variants are included in the rules. First, players play four rounds, and after each round all players score negative points for the number of cards left in their decks and hands, while the player who went out scores three positive points. Second, instead of ignoring the card colors (blue and yellow), you choose whether you must alternate card colors in the stacks or have only a single color of cards in each stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
