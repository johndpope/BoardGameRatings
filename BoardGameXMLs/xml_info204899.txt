			<description>This is a paper and pencil party game designed to be played in a large gathering, generally in tables of four with players on opposite sides acting as partners. The objective is to draw the creature shown on the score sheet. Two creatures are available, a giraffe and a penguin. The game includes 25 player sheets, each with squares for 12 drawings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a die, with each number corresponding to a particular part of the creature's body. A roll of 6 is needed to start a drawing, and when one is rolled, both partners can draw the body. A five must be rolled next, and again allows both partners to draw the head. After that, each partner rolls only for his own drawing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete a drawing yells &amp;quot;Gooffy&amp;quot; and the players then tally their individual scores (one point per body part). The two highest scorers move to the next table for another round, and the game continues for as many as 12 rounds. The player with the highest total points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The giraffe needs a tail (4), a neck (3), two ears and an eye (2) and four legs (1). The penguin needs a beak (4), one eye (3), two feet (2) and two flippers (1). Each roll only allows one of the corresponding parts to be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
