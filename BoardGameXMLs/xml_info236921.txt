							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Events for a Modern Street</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are always going to be other people and events on a street besides the characters. This is a list of 100 different events that can be seen on a modern street, whether as a pedestrian or in a vehicle. They range from single pedestrians to large congregations of people. Some events are most suited for urban centres, others for more residential or rural areas and some will work anywhere. They are most suited for the latter end of the 20th century onwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These different events can be used as simple scene dressing to make it seem more alive, or perhaps to disguise more important activities that are taking place. More cautious players may suspect that the events themselves are more than they seem; at the GameMaster's discretion, this may be true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recovery Vehicle - A bus is stopped by the side of the road with a breakdown vehicle parked behind it with the lights flashing. The rear compartment is open whilst the driver and the recovery woman look at the engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover and one page the front matter and introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
