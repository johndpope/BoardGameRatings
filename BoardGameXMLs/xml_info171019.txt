			<description>Battle demons and undead attorneys, and win souls to pay back your student loans! At the elite demonic-law firm of Varkath Nebuchadnezzar Stone, you'll depose a fallen god, find romance, and maybe even make partner, if you don't lose your own soul first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Choice of the Deathless&amp;quot; is a necromantic legal thriller by Max Gladstone, Campbell Award-nominated author of Three Parts Dead and Two Serpents Rise. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and powered by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Explore a fantasy realm with a rich and evolving backstory, based on the novels published by Tor Books.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Play as male or female, gay or straight, dead or alive (or both).&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Build your career on carefully reasoned contracts, or party all night with the skeletal partners at your firm.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Navigate intrigue and mystery in a world of scheming magicians and devious monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Look for love in at least some of the right places.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Balance student loans, sleep, daily commute, rent payments, and demonic litigation&amp;mdash;hey, nobody said being a wizard was always fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
