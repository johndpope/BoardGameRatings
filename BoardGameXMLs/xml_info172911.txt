			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daymar Sanctus, a scholarly wizard, began construction of his &amp;ldquo;Suspended Abode of Wondrous Enchantment&amp;rdquo; over two decades ago. Using knowledge gathered over the years he sought to build the most unique wizard&amp;rsquo;s tower yet seen. Initial construction began with traditional laborers and craftsmen, but as time went on his laborers grew more and more exotic. Eventually even these laborers proved insufficient for the construction task at hand. Frustrated, Daymar began calling his project Hellspike in an attempt to frame his ongoing nightmare in a humorous light. With his own sanity of mind fading, Daymar bound a minor demon to help him finish the construction of the tower with his own magic. Recently a magical mishap changed the situation, and the tower&amp;rsquo;s enchantments begin to falter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pocket-Sized Encounter compatible with the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry rules system for 3rd to 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pocket-Sized Encounters from Iron Tavern Press are shorter scenarios designed to be dropped into an existing campaign with minimal preparation. Use them for shorter sessions, provide your players with choices that won&amp;rsquo;t derail your campaign or even as a launching point for a new campaign path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Multiple adventure hooks&lt;br/&gt;    Location based encounter area map&lt;br/&gt;    Seeds for expanding the adventure&lt;br/&gt;    Wizard Beads (minor magic item)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
