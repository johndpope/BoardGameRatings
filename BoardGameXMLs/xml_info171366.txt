			<description>Publisher's description: &amp;quot;Find your way to the center of the web!  Spider-Man's spider-sense is going crazy!  Mysterio, Master of Illusion, is up to his dirty tricks again.  He has hypnotized everyone in New York City in order to trap Spider-Man.  Hobgoblin, Venom, Carnage, and Green Goblin are also on the loose.  Only you can help Spider-Man and Black Cat stop Mysterio and restore peace to the city.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man was published as part of the Marvel Comics Super Heroes Game Book, and the board is a double-page spread of the book which is laid flat to play. This is a fairly standard roll-and-move game where players use an attached &amp;quot;electronic die&amp;quot; to move their pieces around a spiral spiderweb toward to the center.  Various spaces on the board move players back or forward or cause players to gain or lose a turn.  First player to the center captures Mysterio and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
