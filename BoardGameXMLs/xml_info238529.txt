							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Offbeat</name>
									
			<description>This cool rythm and move game wakes your inner musician. You'll drum, beat, whistle and clap. In an accurate way you'll train train your rhythmic sense and reaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can't keep the beat or you make a mistake? Then you're out.  It takes just one mistake to be kicked out of the 'band'. So you better keep the beat, if you want to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offbeat is fun an a challenge for the entire family - or for the class room! It's a party game were you can rhythmically beat the drum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;additional comment &lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a spinner with six holding spaces for counters. There are 6 types of counters: beat (1 hand), beat (2 hands), clap, silence (pause), finger snap and shouting &amp;quot;Ol&amp;eacute;&amp;quot;. Six counters are randomly inserted. The spinner decides where to start the cycle. So 1 cycle could be beat(1)-beat(1)-&amp;quot;Ol&amp;eacute;&amp;quot;-snap-beat(2)-beat(1)-clap. &lt;br/&gt;All the players together now have to perform this. When 1 makes a mistake or doesn't keep the beat with the rest, he's out. The rest continues till 1 is left. He chooses 1 counter, removes it and replaces it with a random new one. &lt;br/&gt;Game ends when 1 player has collected 6 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players should use the box as drum. The box even comes with a drum snare mounted in the lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Translated from the back of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
