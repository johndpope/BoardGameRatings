							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Species of Otherverse America</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity began speciating during the 2030s, and the process has only accelerated since War&amp;rsquo;s End. Today, homo sapiens shares its homeworld with more than a dozen engineered species. New human subraces with incredible powers were custom-grown by mid 21st century mega-corps. Today, at the dawn of the 22nd Century, engineered species like Softlings, Couriers and Fluxminx live as free citizens of a divided America. Alien immigrants like the Half Grey and Stonecutters struggle to find a place for themselves on the human homeworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Species of Otherverse America describes the 13 most common non-human races found in the Otherverse America campaign setting. In addition to comprehensive cultural files, a selection of unique racial feats for each species, short sidebars describe how to use these unique species in Otherverse Games&amp;rsquo; other sci-fi settings: Psi-Watch and Galaxy Command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook is a core character creation manual for the Otherverse America Campaign Setting. It is a companion to Sexually Transmitted Future, which describes playing baseline human characters (and genetically engineering them) in detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
