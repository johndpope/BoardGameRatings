							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mass Extinction</name>
									
			<description>Set at the beginning of the Mesozoic, this game simulates a &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; between various dinosaurs as they struggle to survive. Each dinosaur rolls and moves on the board, trying to survive among mass extinctions and catastrophes, and battles with other players. Cards are drawn when instructed to, and they add a further random component. Dinosaurs have to find food and collect eggs in order to survive. When the dinosaurs get to the end of the Mesozoic, the one with most eggs is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
