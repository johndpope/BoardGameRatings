			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big Thicket of East Texas is one of the last remaining jungle-like regions of North America. Its dense undergrowth is so thick in places that it cannot be penetrated without a sharp machete or hatchet. Every deer season, many hunters find themselves lost within its confines. In East Texas it is often said, &amp;quot;Stay within 20 feet of the road or you&amp;rsquo;ll get lost &amp;mdash; and you may never be found again!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many legends involving the Thicket persist even today: bigfoot and panther sightings, rumors of chupacabra attacks, reports of ghostly Spanish soldiers, fierce Native American spirits, and tales of buried Confederate Hope Gold. Some even say that pirates from Galveston ventured up the Sabine River to hide their loot in the deep woods. Other phenomena are also common, ranging from unexplained lights in the night sky to strange disappearances, bizarre and dangerous weather patterns, and the mysterious Flames of Kirby Smith. In the Pinebox Campaign all of these legends are true, and they make for great side treks or short adventures. Three such side treks are presented in this&lt;br/&gt;issue of Modern Dispatch: The Beasts of the Thicket, Little Lost Child, and Last Chance Gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
