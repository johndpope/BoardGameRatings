							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Circular Chess</name>
									
			<description>This chess variant was developed by David Reynolds after reading a reference to chess being played on a circular board in medieval times.  Imagining how it might have played, he developed such a version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His board consists of four rings (files) and sixteen radii (ranks) with a large, unplayable center circle.  Mr. Reynolds would often adorn the center with the crest of the city of Lincoln, U.K., thus the design is often referred to as a &amp;quot;Lincoln board&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A standard set of chess pieces is used.  However, each player gets two ranks of pieces surrounded by two ranks of pawns.  The king and queen are placed on the innermost file (ring).  Movement mimics standard chess, allowing the rooks and queen to move fully around a ring.  Castling and en passant capturing are not allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This variant is distinctly different from the Circular Chess variant designed by Alan and Martin Mattlage, in board layout, starting set-up, and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This variant does use the same board as Byzantine Chess, but there are rule differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
