			<description>From Publisher Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eternas is a fun new 3-dimensional strategy game of four in a row. The rules and concepts are simple enough to appeal to kids from 6 to 96 yeas of age. But, don't let the simplicity fool you. While Eternas is quick and easy to learn, there is a depth of strategy that will keep you thinking. Eternas is a four in a row style game in which the first player to place four bead of their color in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, wins the game. Conceived around the shape of the circle (the symbol for eternity) Eternas was designed for borderless play. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Eternas is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
