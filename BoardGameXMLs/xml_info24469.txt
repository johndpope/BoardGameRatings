							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spion</name>
									
			<description>Spion (=Spy) is a 2-player strategy game with an unusual victory condition: you must find two hidden points on the opponents half of the gameboard. These hidden points are secretly marked on a paper copy of the gameboard; a whole pad of copies is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard has 2 halves of 64 hex-fields each and the armies of the 2 players contain 6 defenders, 4 little spies and 2 big spies. The defenders are single colored, while the spies show both colors, because they can be turned over when captured! Defenders cannot leave their half of the board. Spies can move everywhere and they are therefore needed to find the 2 hidden points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
