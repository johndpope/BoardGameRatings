			<description>Each player has 6 meeples, which he must get from his starting spaces to the 6 numbered home spaces of his color. Each meeple has to move once around the board. Movement is determined by a die. Meeples are brought into play by rolling a 1. The blue spaces on the track are neutral and can hold more than one meeple. On the yellow spaces, meeples can be thrown out. But this is actually a good thing, because they are put on the home spaces of their color. Throwing out is mandatory. If a Player forgets to throw another meeple out, one of the meeples in his home is put back to a starting space. If a meeple is thrown out on the space of his own color in front of his home, the meeple is put back on a starting space. The first player to bring his 6 meeples home wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
