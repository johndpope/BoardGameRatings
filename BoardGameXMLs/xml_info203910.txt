							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crimson Dragon Slayer 1.11</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This little PDF is a re-boot of the Crimson Dragon Slayer RPG.  It takes two steps back and one in a slightly new direction.  Less comedic, gonzo, 80's references and more dark, weird science-fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were written as ultra-light as possible, taking more of an Alpha Blue RPG approach.  I wanted something that could be demonstrated in one hour, a taste of paper &amp;amp; pencil roleplaying for those who've never played or those who haven't played in years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included is a brief scenario called &amp;quot;The Curse of Xakaar Abbey.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet comes in two flavors - rich and creamy and plain Jane (b/w printer friendly).  You'll get both.  Best of all, it's FREE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoy it.  And please do... show your friends, play at home, play online, play in public, take it to your friendly local game store, run it at a convention, etc.  This is my gift to the hobby that is desperately seeking new gamers, new blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
