			<description>From the introductory scene setting:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient history of Khazan&amp;rsquo;s greatest days holds many tales. One such legend tells of the Temple of the Bull. Manuscripts from these near-forgotten days speak of the followers of the Bull, their greed, boundless hedonism and their dark desire for a living god. They indulged in forbidden arts and evil sorceries before decreeing that the High Priestess would offer herself to the Bull God.&lt;br/&gt;This union between god and human would create the perfect being. For 13 months the Minotaur grew inside the High Priestess; pure and precious, she was afforded every care.&lt;br/&gt;Then, at the appointed time, the beast was cut from its mother&amp;rsquo;s belly and suckled upon her still warm blood. This was the Living God. Alas, the beast now had a taste for blood and its hunger was insatiable. A labyrinth was constructed beneath the temple and warriors came from far and near to win a prize-purse of gems worth 3,000 gold.&lt;br/&gt;Each day, three warriors were lowered into the maze below, hungry for the prize; not knowing they were lambs to the slaughter. To this day, none have survived. The beast lives yet. Will you be the one to end the cycle and rid the temple of its living god?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning!  This Solo is very deadly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
