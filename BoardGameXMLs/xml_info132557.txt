			<description>Text from the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;The characters in this attractive game for young people are taken from the famous &amp;ldquo;Alice in Wonderland,&amp;rdquo; and brightly illustrated in colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card &amp;ldquo;ALICE&amp;rdquo; is the particular one which the players most desire to retain in their hands, as, after all the cards have been played, the player holding &amp;ldquo;Alice&amp;rdquo; WINS the Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are duplicates in the pack of every card except &amp;ldquo;Alice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the cards and deal, one at a time, to each player.&lt;br/&gt;All cards in a player&amp;rsquo;s hand that will match, after being dealt, are thrown aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer begins by drawing a card from the player at his right hand, the player drawn from holding the cards so that the dealer cannot see what he is drawing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the card drawn will pair with something in the dealer&amp;rsquo;s hand, he throws both aside; if not, he retains it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether it pairs or not, it then becomes the turn of the player from whom the card was drawn to draw from the player at HIS right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player entirely runs out of cards, he stops playing and the game continues without him.&lt;br/&gt;The game thus proceeds, drawing and matching, until &amp;ldquo;Alice&amp;rdquo; alone is left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player holding &amp;ldquo;Alice&amp;rdquo; WINS THE GAME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
