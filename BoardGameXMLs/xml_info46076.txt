							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Realm of Chaos: Slaves to Darkness</name>
									
			<description>From the Book's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book, Slaves to Darkness is one half of the two volumes that make up Realm of Chaos, a supplement for the Warhammer range of games. In it, you'll find everything you need for campaigns set in the Chaos Wastes of the The Old World or for discovering the minions of Chaos in the very heart of human society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the following pages you will find the most complete and definitive details ever published on two of the Powers of Chaos, Khorne and Slaanesh. Their abilities, followers, daemonic underlings, and their dealings with the world of Warhammer are all covered. Full details of the magic of Chaos and the foul mutations which warp the bodies and minds of its followers are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two more Chaos gods, Nurgle and Tzeentch, are presented in The Lost and the Damned, the companion Realm of Chaos volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warhammer Fantasy Battle gamer will find the followers and creatures of Chaos fully detailed, with example warbands and armies, and complete notes on creating your own Chaos creatures. Notes and tips are provided for the modeller interested in creating Chaos creatures in miniature, and there are also suggestions on organising battles into narrative campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warhammer 40,000 Gamesmaster will find a complete section introducing Daemons and the followers of Chaos into WH40K battles along with details of the links between Chaos, warpspace and the threat that unrestrained psychic power poses to the Imperium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay GM will find full profiles for Chaos Warriors and Beastmen, which can be used to develop awe-inspiring NPC followers of Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both volumes of Realm of Chaos can be used to create daemonic armies to fight out epic (and smaller scale) table top battles; they can help WFRP GMs create villains of staggering evil for roleplaying games; and they can introduce a new element of horror into any Warhammer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first of two books for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay detailing the gods of chaos and their influence on the mortal realms. Focused on the gods Khorne and Slaanesh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included rules for Warhammer Fantasy Battles and Warhammer 40,000 (Rogue Trader).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considered by many admirers of Games Workshop to be the finest piece of world background released by the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
