			<description>How successful will you be in building your empire?  The aim of Future Tycoon is to build a more valuable empire than your opponents.  A player builds his or her empire by tabling cards, with the value of a player's empire being dependent on the number and layout of cards that player tables during the game.  To maximise your empire you must use your investment chips to maximum effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards have region and industry types, cards must be linked to either the same region (vertically) or the same industry (horizontally).  The more cards in a chain the higher the value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A final element to the game are the Investment Chips.  Each player has the same number of chips, each chip can either double one or more of your chains or halve the value of one or more of an opponents chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the person with the highest value totalling all region chains and industry chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
