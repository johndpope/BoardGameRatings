			<description>A card game lonked to characters in a children's TV show in Germany. The most famous character in it, Bernd the Bread, is illustrated on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six chilipower tiles are shuffled and placed face down. Players are dealt some cards that will have a number on each one, from -2 to +4. A start card is revealed and in your turn you play a card and add it to the start card, announcing the new total. Now next player adds a card and reveals the new total (that is, Start card + previous player's card + his new card). And so the game progresses. If any player takes the total to 13 or more, that player takes one of the 6 Chilipower tiles. The number of chillies on it is bad news because the winner will be the one with the fewest chillies on his chilipower tiles (they range from 1 to 6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After taking his chilipower tile, the previous round's cards are collected up and put on the bottom of the stack and a new start card is revealed and you play as before. When the last chilipower tile is taken, the game ends and the winner is the one with the fewest chillies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
