			<description>The Alpha Word Game System is a comprehensive word game system made up of three components; a deck of Alpha Playing Cards, a set of Alpha Tiles and a double set of Alpha Dice. All three components are by themselves a game system, so having any one component allows you to play several different  games, having all three allows you to play even more games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alpha Word Game System is based on the original deck of Alpha Playing Cards which was released in 1997. There has been a two minor changes made to the Alpha Playing Cards in creating the Alpha Word Game System. The first is the addition of the marked vowels on the semi-wild vowels cards and the second is the addition of the board grid on the backs of the Alpha Playing Cards allowing the cards to be made into game boards for the tiles and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alpha Word Game System and its components are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License; so anyone can make their own components for the Alpha Word Game System. There are free PDF files that you can use to make your own set. If you are feeling really creative, you can design your own graphics too. You can make as many copies as you like, and if you are in a entrepreneurial mood, you can sell them. If you have question about the  Creative Commons License or would like more information please refer go to creativecommons.org. If you still have questions on how it relates to Alpha  write to one of the designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
