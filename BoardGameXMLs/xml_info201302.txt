			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the D&amp;amp;D Gamma World game, you get bonuses on skills based on your primary and secondary origin, and also a +4 bonus to one randomly rolled skill that represents what your character is good at doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, this is just a straight 1d10 roll that doesn't add any actual flavor to your character. You could make something up &amp;ldquo;that +4 bonus to Science &amp;ndash; is because I'm a &amp;hellip; scientist, yeah, that's it&amp;rdquo; but the rules as written don't &amp;ndash; give you much to work with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is designed to expand on the skill system in the D&amp;amp;D Gamma World rulebook by letting you roll a profession for your character. This is an optional system, and it may be superceded by Legion of Gold when that supplement comes out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
