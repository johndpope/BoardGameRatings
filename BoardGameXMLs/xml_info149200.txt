							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Liber Vampyr: Secrets of the Blood (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the Thing that Goes &amp;ldquo;Bump&amp;rdquo; in the Night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years, the legend of the vampire has captivated the minds of mortals, and these dark stalkers of the night have become permanent fixtures of fantasy media and roleplaying games alike. But while vampires in novels, movies, and television each provide their own unique twist or spin on the vampire myth, creating innumerable different interpretations of what it means to be a vampire, for the Pathfinder roleplaying game, at least, there is only one kind of vampire, which fits some styles of vampirism well, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit others at all. Even worse for vampire enthusiasts, the ability to actually play as one of these nocturnal lurkers is incredibly limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In March of 2010, the original Liber Vampyr: Secrets of the Blood attempted to address these issues by creating a new kind of vampire for the Pathfinder roleplaying game: the revenant. Designed to be a player character race and intended to have access to a wide array of different vampiric &amp;ldquo;blood powers,&amp;rdquo; Liber Vampyr invited players to build their own vampire, based on whatever interpretation of vampires they preferred, and was fully designed with vampire player characters in mind, allowing them to progress through their vampiric power the same way that a sorcerer progresses through arcane magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, over 150,000 copies of the original Liber Vampyr have been downloaded. But despite its popularity, we felt that we could make it better. The new version of Liber Vampyr has been redesigned from the ground up to be more intuitive and easy to use, as well as to improve player experience. Virtually every part of the book has been rewritten in order to affect this change, and the result is an entirely new monster that can still provide fun and excitement campaign after campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
