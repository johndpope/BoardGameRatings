							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bucoli Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bucoli are a brotherhood of cut-throat, vicious, tenacious vampires. Beginning each night in prayer, dedicating their undead lives to their gods, the Bucoli are powerbrokers in the vampiric underworld. Similar to the Eligiere in that they crave power, Bucoli are the darker counterparts. If Eligiere were light, Bucoli are dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When choosing from the mortal world, Bucoli take the most cold, calculating, money-loving SOBs in the city. Lawyers, doctors, stockbrokers and those willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done are welcomed into the House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wielding the powerful Dark Gift of Spiritus, Bucoli are inducted into an undead fraternal organization where each member begins as a recruit and has his/her sponsor bring them to The Assembly. Upon going through the Rites, a member may be inducted, embracing their new life, Turned in a ceremony and blessed by the House priest. After this moment the new member must cut throats and backstab to get to the top as he's knocked to the bottom of the status-quo. Given his newfound powers, the Liberi must adhere to not only the Blood Laws, but the laws of his House in order to survive. Only those who prove themselves may learn the secrets of Sorcery and possess the tools to truly manipulate the masses. Through faith and fire a Bucoli is tested and through this faith they are made whole in front of the whole assembly. Do you have what it takes to step into the shoes of a Bucoli? Can you climb to the top and make a name for yourself? Find out how dark the world around you can be as you play a Bucoli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
