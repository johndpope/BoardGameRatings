			<description>From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;Picture the scene. It's Friday night, 11pm. Slug and his sweetheart are settling down in front of the gogglebox to watch the Friday Nite Horror Movie, 'Emperor Hades Meets The Yak Faces Melboids From East London Part 37 (Revisited) when from out of nowhere, a huge mechanical hand reaches down and plucks your beloved from before your every eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bewilderment quickly turns into destermination as you vow, whatever the cost, to save her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You discover that she has been taken to a strange land where monstrous creathres roam. (No not Glasgow silly!) These creatures include Snails, Turtles, Snakes, Blobs on legs, and Sheep On Springs (Hiya Jeff!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your task is to collect the hearts that will guarantee your girlfriend's release. The number you need to complete each screen variates with the level you are on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must also be on the lookout for bombs. These count down from 9 to 0 before exploding, but you can defuse them simple by running into them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may think that all of this is too much for a lowly slug to handle, but you are armed with T.N.T.S. (Tri-Nitro-Toluene Smile!!) which destroy the creatures on contact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So there you have it, your quest awaits. And remember, even if it seems you have found your beloved, all is not what it seems!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
