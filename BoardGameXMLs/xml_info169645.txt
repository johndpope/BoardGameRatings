			<description>Think of it as Magic: the Gathering meets Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your party protect you homeland, and win your opponent's scepter.  This is a game of battling special abilities to obtain land, pour magic into your land with magic stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will build decks of creature, item and spell cards.  You begin the game by building a deck of about 20 cards.  Player tokens begin on zero, as well as the starting castle, on the board.  Each player starts with 7 cards from the starter deck.  You can do each of the following once per turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Take 2 cards from your deck, keep one, place the 2nd on the bottom of the draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;2. Use 1 spell card.&lt;br/&gt;3. Roll the dice to move your token on the board.&lt;br/&gt;4. Perform and action, such as summoning creatures (up to their required land value).&lt;br/&gt;5. Pay the toll to another player if you land on their space.&lt;br/&gt;6. Discard down to 7 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just remember Draw, Roll, Play a card.  When you land on an empty space, you will fill it with one of your creature cards.  When you land on a space already occupied by an opponent, you pay a toll or play a creature to battle it.  Prior to battle, player can equip their creatures with items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to obtain the most land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
