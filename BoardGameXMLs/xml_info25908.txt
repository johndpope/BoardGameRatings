							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jungle Jaws</name>
									
			<description>Jungle Jaws is a simple children's game that involves catapulting your insects into the jaws of the waiting Venus Flytraps The winner is the person who gets the most bugs into the jaws of the jungle plants!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great looking game with a 2 level board - four colorful Venus Flytraps on stalks and 4 sets of 4 plastic insects in different colors. You also get 4 leaf themed catapults to launch your insects. The board is held together with 1 large elastic band and the jaws of the Flytraps also snap closed thanks to elastic bands too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nice thing is that each bug is different instead of 4 identical ones and that the game looks great when assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
