							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Village of Tomore</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When adventurers are in the same area its nice to have a base of operations. The Village of Tomore rests between adventures pertaining to two different campaigns in the Filbar region. The quaint village has a caravan stop and will allow PCs to come into contact with a wide variety of personages and rumors for exploration. This area can be utilized as a base of operations near the areas of the FN or F series campaigns or just as a rest stop for the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for any level of adventurer.  This setting is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
