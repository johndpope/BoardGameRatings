							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ZigZag</name>
									
			<description>Some cute little people have invaded the land, and when they get together in groups of four they trigger strange symptoms in humans. Apparently, this game is so much fun that you may lose control of your faculties, causing others to chant &amp;quot;Zig! Zag!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZigZag is a partnership game (with variants for two and three players) that is played with a deck of 93 cards. Of those cards, 64 show the aforementioned cute little people, and each one of these cards has three characteristics: a person representing one of the four elements, a landscape, and an accessory (sunglasses, a suitcase, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get sets of four cards with a single characteristic (Zig) or two characteristics (Zag) in common. To finish a round, it is necessary to complete a zig, a zag, a double zig, or a zig and a zag. Each combination is allowed only once, and the first partnership to complete all four wins. When a player has completed a set, he must give a pre-arranged signal to his partner, who must then announce what type of set has been completed out loud. If a signal is mistaken, both partners must discard their cards, draw new hands, and play on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone plays at the same time, exchanging cards with those cards in the center of the table. Beware as the opposing team will do all they can to prevent you from achieving your goal, including using some of the 17 special cards that do things like stop you from collecting a set with a certain characteristic or force an exchange of hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the two- to three-player variant of ZigZag, each player receives one of twelve constraint cards, which limits the types of sets they can collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
