							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trollz: Magic of the 5 Game</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the Trollz World! Join the Best Friends for Life as they scoot all around Trollzopolis collecting Gem tokens. But watch out for Snarf--Simon's half dog, half ogre sidekick--or he'll slow down your quest to defeat Simon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get around, players roll a die. Pimple Spell spaces and Snarf spaces can limit players' movement but can be gotten around with Obsidian tokens and Obsidian Spell Phone tokens, which can reroll dice or use the spell phone instead of rolling. Other spaces can call every player to a specific space. The Spell Phone included with the game decides what happens when it's landed on or rolled via a text message that appears on the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to be the first player to collect all 5 Gem tokens and defeat Simon in the final showdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Trollz toyline and cartoon by DiC Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
