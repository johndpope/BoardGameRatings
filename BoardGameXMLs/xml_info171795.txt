							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolling in the Money</name>
									
			<description>Rolling in the Money is an educational game designed to teach children to count coins and make change. There are two levels. In level one, players roll five &amp;quot;money dice,&amp;quot; (which have the names and values of US coins on each side, as well as an X, indicating no money). They then take the indicated plastic coins from the tray.  Next, they may choose to roll as many dice as they wish that did not come up with Xs a second time, and take the indicated coins.  They may then do so a third time. The goal is to get a total as close to one dollar as possible without going over. After each player has rolled, the player closest to $1 wins. Five rounds are played, and the player who wins the most rounds is the winner. This level teaches counting and adding coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In level two, each player starts with five dollars.  On each round they roll two money dice and pay the amount indicated to the bank by making change from one dollar. At the end of the round, the player with the most change left wins, and keeps his change.  All other players put their change back in the tray. At the end of five rounds, the player with the most money in his or her pile wins.  This level teaches making change from a dollar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level one offers a small amount of strategy (the press your luck mechanic of deciding whether to roll more dice and how many to roll) while level two is entirely luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
