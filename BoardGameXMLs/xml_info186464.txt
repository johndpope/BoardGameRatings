			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zigzag is a humorous role playing game that uses alcohol as a randomizer.  The GM is referred to as the Designated Dry Guy and makes all the critical decisions (optional rules may change this).  Players select characters from common media (e.g., &amp;quot;Marge from The Simpsons&amp;quot;), a stereotype (e.g., &amp;quot;the nymphomaniac peasant girl&amp;quot;) or just make them up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game proceeds by characters stating what they want to have happen in the narrative and the Designated Dry Guy assigning an alcohol amount to effect the event; the player then consumes the alcohol amount determined and play proceeds.  Routine inter-player conflicts can be resolved by drinking or by using one of several methods described in the rules, including:  21, Fuzzy Duck, Pattern Game, Rhyme and Reason, Shooting Animals, Word Association, or Word Disassociation.  Alternately, players can engage in any mutually agreed upon contest such as arm wrestling, doing something weird with their bodies, or flipping beer coasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure is represented by alcohol that is distributed from the party store to the finding character's player.  The rules include notes on drinking etiquette and British/American terminology involving alcohol topics (&amp;quot;4 gills in a pint&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
