							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Railway Rivals Map IOW: Isle of Wight</name>
									
			<description>A map for use with the Railway Rivals game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map covers the Isle of Wight. It is very small with many fewer hexes than normal. It is fairly hilly, with the towns very close together. The map was originally printed in the Railway Modeller magazine. This was a relatively late stand-alone map, which was not released in the large (approx A2) size, but just as an A3 black and white map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
