			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the more drunker edition of the ass grabbin&amp;rsquo; Kickin&amp;rsquo; Your Ass card game. It is a card game where you try to build your Ass, while kicking other players&amp;rsquo; Asses and where getting your Ass kicked means shots!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You try to collect each piece of Ass you can get your hands on. Once you have enough Ass to complete your Ass, you win. But along the way, other players are trying to kick your Ass and force you to drink!. This of course results in you losing your Ass, or at least some of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a hand of four cards.  All cards are drawn from a common deck.  You build your Ass out of 5 cards, Tail, Back Legs, Middle, Front Legs, Head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the while, you play cards to Kick someone&amp;rsquo;s Ass which makes them lose pieces of their Ass and drink so it get&amp;rsquo;s better the more ass you kick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also defensive cards such as Kiss My Ass that will prevent this and force the kicker to drink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
