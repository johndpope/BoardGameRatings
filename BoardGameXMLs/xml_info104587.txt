							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HorrorClix: Freddy vs. Jason Collectors Set</name>
									
			<description>We get Freddy Krueger, Freddy Nightmare Worm, Jason Voorhees, Jason Carrying Freddy's Head, and the final uberpiece, Freddy And Jason Together (featuring both figures on a single base). It is worth noting that the scenarios that come with the rulebook do not recommend using this last piece&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The figures are 28mm, and of fine quality, although the factory paint jobs leave a bit to be desired. And for those of you wishing to rebase, they'll come off easily enough (and provide SIX figures rather than five; the Jason Vs. Freddy piece can be separated).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Altogether, a neat tabletop game awaits. Make a neat main event for this coming Halloween, and a nice diversion from the usual zombie geek bingo events&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is actually a Licensed Starter/Expansion style pack for Horrorclix, and doesn't really work as a stand alone game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
