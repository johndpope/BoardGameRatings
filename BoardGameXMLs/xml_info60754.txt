			<description>It's springtime again and the penguins start marching. Every penguin has their own number of floes they wish to cross. Lead them the way and score an iceberg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;17 Penguin cards (with 1-3 ice floes)&lt;br/&gt;35 Floe cards (with 1-4 ice floes)&lt;br/&gt;The rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The players all have 5 cards, 2 cards with a penguin on some floes and 3 with only floes. You start with 1 floe card in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you may play a penguin card if the number of floes on the penguin card and the floes of the cards in the middle exactly matches the number on your penguin card. Since the floe cards in the middle are on a row you can access them from either the left or the right. How many floe cards are needed to add up to the number on your penguin card is free. As long as it matches exactly. If possible you can also play your second penguin card.&lt;br/&gt;Then you always play a floe card on either side of the line. So even if you can't play any penguin card you still add floes to the line to hopefully collect in your next turn (if they aren't scooped up by the other players).&lt;br/&gt;The last thing you do is fill up your hand so that you again have 2 penguin cards and 3 floe cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until either the penguins are all played or until it's no longer possible to play the remaining penguins.&lt;br/&gt;At that point all the numbers on the penguin cards are added up. The player with the highest number of floes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
