			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F-15 Strike Eagle&lt;br/&gt;CHALLENGING AND EXCITING AIR COMBAT FROM THE MODERN ELECTRONIC COCKPIT!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strap into your ejection seat and get ready for challenging and exciting modern jet fighter combat with F-15 Strike Eagle!

F-15 will thrill and challenge tyou and give you the chance to prove you have the &amp;quot;Right Stuff&amp;quot; of an EAGLE fighter pilot!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User addition&lt;br/&gt;F-15 was a great game when it appeared. Though the view out of your cockpit was only blue and green (or yellow) and all object (terrain, targets, aircraft) were basically a few hollow lines, it was a thrilling experience to man a F-15 and fly it in a mix between simulation and arcade: you didn't have to know all the ins and outs of a jet fighter, but you needed to understand and be able to use of of the most important features of the plane: use of the radar, weapons systems, ECM, flares etc. Looking back at the platforms on which it was played, it was an amazingly deep simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to wikipedia, the game won the &amp;quot;Action game of the Year&amp;quot; in Computer Gaming World's 1985 reader poll and sold over 1.5 million copies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
