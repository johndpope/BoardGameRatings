			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was originally played as part of the Babylon Project component of the European GenCon gaming tournament in 1998. As such, the module is designed to run quickly, hopefully bringing the players to the final scene within three to four hours. Game Masters wishing to extend play time will be given the opportunity with specially flagged sections labelled Further Adventures that lend themselves to ad lib gaming, or even full adventures. Only the original 'The Babylon Project' sourcebook rules are required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is thanks to European GenCon that you are able to play this module. With their blessing, I have now released a revised edition of my original adventure. As it was designed to be played in a tournament where every player is given a pre-written character to play, relationships, contacts and group dynamics were very tightly woven into the game, thus the need for a revision of the module to 'Version 2.0'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideally, the Player Characters should all know each other and be familiar with working together to varying degrees. For the adventure to succeed there should be a reason for them to be hired as private investigators, or at least be known as people who are reasonable at finding things. The adventure begins with the Player Characters on Babylon 5, waiting for their new commission to meet with them. How this event comes to pass is left up to the Game Master to decide, based on his/her group's situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is set in the August of 2258. Commander Jeffrey Sinclair is in charge of the station, while Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova is second in command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure ties in closely with a season 1 episode of Babylon 5 titled &amp;quot;Signs and Portents&amp;quot;. It would be an excellent idea if Game Masters were to review this episode before playing the module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
