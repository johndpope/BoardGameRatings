			<description>Shocktato: the Shocking Potato Game. Pass the Shocktato around the group, but don't be left holding the Shocktato at the end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move the Game Mode Selector Switch to the position that says Extreme. This mode is for true Shocktato players. This mode got its name because it has no music, just a surprise buzzer and emits a shock. Now press the start button. In Extreme Mode, it will beep to let you know it is active but will play no music. Begin passing the Shocktato around the circle. Be quick though, when the buzzer sounds, the shock begins. The player who is left holding the Shocktato when it shocks must leave the game. The last player in the circle is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move the Game Mode Selector Switch to the position that says Normal. Now press the start button. In Normal Mode, you will hear music begin to play. Begin passing the Shocktato around the circle. Be quick though, when the music stops, Shocktato emits a shock. The player who is left holding the Shocktato when it shocks must leave the game. The last player in the circle is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move the Game Mode Selector Switch to the position that says Lame. This mode is for the weak at heart. This mode got its name because it does not shock. Now press the start button. In Lame Mode, you will hear music begin to play. Begin passing the Shocktato around the circle. Be quick though, when the music stops, the Shocktato makes a buzzing sound. The player who is left holding the Shocktato at the buzzer must leave the game. The last player in the circle is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
