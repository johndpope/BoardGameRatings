			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quiet village of Greenfork is in a state of uproar, scarred twisted looking goblins raided the village during the night and kidnapped the miller&amp;rsquo;s daughter. The Mayor has put out a call for adventurers to bring the girl back safely and end the goblins threat once and for all. This adventure starts just outside the village of Greenfork and thrusts players straight into the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains a full length tabletop roleplaying fantasy adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Advancing players from one to three.&lt;br/&gt;    Sixteen monsters and characters.&lt;br/&gt;    New Games Masters advice and guides.&lt;br/&gt;    A fantastic first adventure for new players, but more importantly this adventure was designed with first time Games Masters in mind, giving you as many tools as possible to help run the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is system neutral!
