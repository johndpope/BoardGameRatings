			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Armies is set of Generic Table Top Fantasy Wargames rules for 25/28mm fantasy miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are to enable players to fight large battles or skirmish engagments with thier collections of fantasy miniatures.  They was a set of core rules (game engine) which every set of miniatures rules needs which deals with elements like the characteristics of your troops, their weapons, their morale and how these affect their performance on the tabletop like how to resolve combat or will they run away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Armies was written by Nick Eyre for Harlequin/Icon Miniatures for their range of metal miniatures; &amp;quot;Fantasy Battles&amp;quot; and Lord of the Rings Miniatures ranges (probably written to replace thier earlier rules; Raven).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules was to be published in a series of articles in Harlequin/Icon Miniatures own house magazine; The One Ring.  The core rules was to be published in three parts and the Army Lists would follow. The magazine only lasted 6 issues before the company change hands and the magazine was cancelled, so only the first two parts of the rules was published in issues 5 &amp;amp; 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
