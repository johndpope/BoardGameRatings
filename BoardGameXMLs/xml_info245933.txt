			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 different items that could be found by players in a steampunk workshop. Although there are a base 100 items on the list, some of the results have multiple different items that can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items listed are primarily based on 19th century technology, whether real, theoretical or potential, and are technological in nature rather than magical. Some are parts; some are entire machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;39. Gears (Also known as cogs or cogwheels, these toothed wheels come in different sizes from a fraction of an inch to several feet across, and are made from different materials, including brass, steel and cast iron)&lt;br/&gt;40. Glass (Sheets of glass of different thicknesses, up to several inches, some tinted, including armoured glass)&lt;br/&gt;41. Glassware (Bottles, jars, containers and laboratory glassware)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
