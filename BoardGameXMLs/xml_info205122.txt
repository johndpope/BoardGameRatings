			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traveling along the King&amp;rsquo;s Road following the White River, you watch the windswept pines lean in the blustery autumn air. Suddenly you notice a canoe bobbing along the river bank &amp;ndash; there is an unconscious man inside! Hauling the canoe ashore, you are shocked to see the man wearing a redcoat of the imperial army. During the empire such uniforms were common, but one hasn&amp;rsquo;t been seen in Galeay for as long as you&amp;rsquo;ve lived there. The soldier bears many tiny wounds, all infected, and a terrible gash on his head. Even having just been pulled from the river he is sweating terrible and muttering the name &amp;ldquo;Misha.&amp;rdquo; He needs to be brought to a healer quickly &amp;ndash; the nearest, the hermit witch Morae, lives just outside Fallcrest proper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
