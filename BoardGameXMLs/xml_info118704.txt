			<description>Your goal in Speicherstadt Hamburg is to become a Senator in Hamburg during the late 19th century. To do this, you'll buy goods from the ships arriving in the harbor, repackaging some of them to create &amp;quot;donations&amp;quot; (i.e., bribes) to the Senate, while placing other goods onto the market in order to recoup funds needed for future purchases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Senate gives victory points for the best three donations. Which one is best? The Senate has different interests each round, which doesn't take into account the price of goods or how often those goods appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players decide simultaneously which cards are gifted to the Senate, which sold at market, and which placed in the storehouse for later rounds. Therefore before the cards are revealed, you know neither whether your donation will succeed nor whether your goods will create enough income for the next round. You do have a lot of information as to which cards are in your opponents' hands, but you never know what they're going to do with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At game's end, players with the most money and filled storehouses receive extra points, and the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
