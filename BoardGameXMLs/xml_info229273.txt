							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gooblitts of Punchstein</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Introductory Campaign for the Mithgarthr RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reichenbach is a town of about 3,000 people nestled snugly in the foothills of the Suderberg Mountains, in the western reaches of the Barony of Punchstein. Settled along the Klaarwasser, a tributary of the Punchzug River, Reichenbach is known for having a friendly population, their annual spring-time Kindervolk Gl&amp;uuml;cklichfest celebration, and for the doppelbock named &amp;ldquo;Ten Scythes&amp;rdquo; which their largest tavern, The Queen&amp;rsquo;s Leaf, serves. All in all, it is a typically quiet, peaceful, and pastoral town in a pleasant part of Mithgarthr. This is about to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Goblin named Tuz Sickfang, talented in the art of Chaos Magic, has brought a small band of Gooblitts into existence via the Conjure Goblinoids spell. He has been teaching them to keep and train Giant Beetles. Between cleverly-timed uses of the Command spell and his Gooblitt lackeys, Tuz&amp;rsquo;s stable of beetles has become a menacing strike force. The &amp;ldquo;Tuzkind Clan&amp;rdquo; is ready to test their efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a pleasant spring day leading up to the Kindervolk Gl&amp;uuml;cklichfest, Tuz&amp;rsquo;s warriors attack Reichenbach. Neither expecting an attack (nor properly equipped to handle one), the duty of learning about the attackers and snuffing them out will fall on the players&amp;rsquo; characters&amp;rsquo; shoulders &amp;ndash; assuming they are looking for a hint of fame, and a bit of fortune, that is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed specifically as an introduction to the Mithgarthr RPG, The Gooblitts of Punchstein provides enough gameplay to level new characters from zero to first level, including two dungeons, wilderness encounters, and a fully fleshed out town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
