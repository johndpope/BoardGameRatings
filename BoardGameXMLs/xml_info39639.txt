							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Rollo Gebhard-Weltumsegler-Spiel</name>
									
			<description>Rollo Gebhard is a German skipper who sailed round the world in several boats (all named Solveig), with his wife as well as single-handed. He founded the &amp;quot;Gesellschaft zur Rettung der Delfine&amp;quot; (association for saving the dolphins) in 1991, which has nothing to do with the game except that it mentioned on the box.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a large (52x80 cm) board, 4 dobbers (representing boats), 2 dice, 120 question and incident cards, 132 fuel cards and a wad of game money.&lt;br/&gt;Players normally start in L&amp;uuml;beck and try to travel round the world, using square spaces that sometimes carry special numbers or symbols. They must make port in every harbour along the route. They have the option to travel under engines, but must spend fuel cards when doing so. They must also manage their money, as harbour fees must be paid (by penalty of losing the game instantly). To move, players roll two dice and may decide which to use first for one straight lap of movement.&lt;br/&gt;Specially marked spaces are incident fields (players must draw an incident card, which may turn out to be a question that must be answered- correct answers are rewarded by an extra move) and log fields where special events take place (like extra cost, restricted movement etc.). Fields with numbers are &amp;quot;storm&amp;quot; areas; on those spaces, the number printed on the board must be subtracted from the die roll or must be paid by extra fuel cards.&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook briefly mentions a couple of possible variants, like choosing different routes, doing away with the engines or using only one die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
