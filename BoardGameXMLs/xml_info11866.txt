			<description>Triple Flips 1 includes Steeplechase Championships, Ride-em Cowboy, and Ride the High Country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Steeplechase Championships, for 2-4 players, uses a linear path of obstacles, each labeled with the rolls (on two dice) required to pass it.  For instance, to start, you need to roll 2-5; then to clear the water jump, 6-9; then for the brick wall, 10-12.  To clear the logs at the end, you need to roll doubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ride-em Cowboy (a rodeo game for 1-4 players) is a game in which it is appropriately difficult to score well.  Appropriately for simulating a rodeo, players often won't stay on the bronco long enough to score, but, on the other hand, occasionally someone will ride the whole way out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ride the High Country is just a basic roll-and-move game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
