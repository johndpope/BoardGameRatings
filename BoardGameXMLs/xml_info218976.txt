			<description>Normandy, June 9, 1944. You have survived the brutal invasion of Omaha Beach, but your mission is not complete. You have been given new high-priority orders from General George C. Marshall to locate a missing paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan, and bring him home to safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Private Ryan&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts are unknown. Rumors place him directly in the middle of enemy-occupied territory laden with snipers, minefields, deadly tanks, and heavily fortified villages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been made Captain and placed in charge of this mission. With limited intel and an even smaller chance of success, you gather a team, ready your equipment, and set off to bring Private Ryan home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'D-Day Express: Saving Private Ryan' is a solo wargame played using a single deck of double-sided cards. There are no counters and no record-keeping is needed to play. Cards are used to represent terrain, enemies, friendly units, damage, mines, debris, and hills, as well as used to generate random events, direct enemy fire, manage close combat engagements, and even determine whether snipers are successful in hitting their targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'D-Day Express: Saving Private Ryan' is a portable, compelling wargame experience that is easy to set up, quick to take down, perfect for travel and gaming in tight spaces, and most importantly, is fun to play! Just shuffle the cards and play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
