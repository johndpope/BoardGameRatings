			<description>Religions, churches - learning trivia for elementary school&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this trivia game students can test how well they have mastered the basic knowledge on the topic and how far they have understood the key concepts of this area of religion.&lt;br/&gt;For each task there are four answers to choose from - but only one is correct. Which answer is correct (and why), is shown on the backside of the card. Each player plays one of the four answer card: A,B,C or D, and all players reveal these simultanously. Then the trivia card is turned around as well to check the correct answer. Each correct answer scores a point. Player with the most points after the deck is exhausted is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
