			<description>Test your balance like a ninja!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;acute;s time to test your Ninja skills! Balance your way along the path made of sewer grates, and try to get farther than the other players. The winner is crowned the ultimate Ninja master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players set up a path of 16 manhole covers (4 different colors) that lead to the green manhole cover, which is the door to the Turtles' sewer home.  Each player spins the spinner to determine in which order he or she will move along that home to the finish line.  Based on each spin, players attempt to negotiate the color sequence of manhole covers that are their path.  Players must follow the sequence, moving foot, hand, foot hand as far as they can while maintaining their balance.  Once each player is done with their turn, they place their foam &amp;quot;sai&amp;quot; or Japanese sword, at the last manhole cover successfully reached.  It's from there that the player will begin their next turn.  Be the first Ninja warrior to reach the green manhole cover 3 times and become the &amp;quot;ultimate Ninja warrior&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
