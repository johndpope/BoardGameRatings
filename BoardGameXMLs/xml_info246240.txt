			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toonpunk is a tabletop role-playing game set in a dark and humorous science-fiction future, where cartoons have come to life in the dystopian 24th century. The laws of our world and the madcap pseudo-realities of ink and paper have collided, to create a world that is trapped between complete nightmare and complete joke. Players take on the role of anarchistic super-criminals on a mission to get rich or die trying: retired superheroes, former starlets, cartoon capers, futuristic technology, and more all combine to make a cyberpunk crime game that&amp;rsquo;s fun for the whole &amp;amp;%@#%^ family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toonpunk combines the character customization of a roleplaying game with the depth of a tactics game. A simple D10-based system props up a complex interplay of numerous different items, skills, and tactics to create a game which is easy to learn but hard to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have over 150 weapons and abilities at their disposal, each of which fills a unique role. Will you be a suave con man, armed with poisons and cocktails? Will you be a daring thief, using your stealth suit and silenced pistol to pull off impossible infiltrations? Will you be an esoteric artist, and use your pen and paper to animate the world around you? Will you be a hacker, a gunman, or a drug-addled maniac? There are numerous parts to play in Toonpunk, and every single one is important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't have to take our word for it. If you want to play toonpunk yourself, without paying for this book, you can check out [Toonpunk: Pilot Episode]: a free version of the game that contains all the core rules, several pre-made characters, and two sample heists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Toonpunk core book contains the rules you'll need to play the game, and a whole slew of pre-made characters and enemies. But more than that, it also includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Rules and descriptions for all 150+ weapons and skills in the game, all neatly sorted for easy reference and ready to be used at a moment's notice.&lt;br/&gt;    Lightning-quick character creation, which allows you to create a character and start playing a game within minutes.&lt;br/&gt;    Instructions for aspiring game masters: building and running your own missions, encounters, and maps; either as one-off heists, or as an interconnected campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
