			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the title screen:&lt;br/&gt;Bass Class&lt;br/&gt;The basics of bass fishing, by Dick Olsen&lt;br/&gt; If you enjoy bass class, please register your copy by sending $15 (US) to the author: &lt;br/&gt;Richard Olsen&lt;br/&gt;68 Hartwell ave&lt;br/&gt;Littleton, MA 01460 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a major firm production, but a small endeavour by some people knowledgable about bass fishing and computer coding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a bass fishing simulation with six different locations, 6 different rods and 2300 different lure combinations. View is top down. Before even touching his fishing rod, the player has to decide how to get his boat to the perfect spot: using an outboard motor, trolling motor or paddling. Inshort: this will teach you a lot about bass fishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
