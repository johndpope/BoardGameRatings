							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Genotype: A Mendelian Genetics Game</name>
									
			<description>Genotype is a betting and manipulation game about cross-breeding pea plants, as in Gregor Mendel&amp;rsquo;s famous experiments.  Players compete over three generations to predict the traits of new offspring, by controlling the parent plants&amp;rsquo; genetic makeup (&amp;ldquo;genotype&amp;rdquo;).  The offspring are determined by a die-roll at the end of each round and become the starting parents for the next generation.  Changing the parent genotypes dramatically alters the likelihood of the offspring genotypes, and players will have to balance betting on outcomes with manipulating their chances for success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, players take turns placing one of their action cubes, either as a bet, which may earn points for any future generation; or to determine a parent&amp;rsquo;s genotype in one trait area.  If a player matches one of the public genotype goals for a parent, they may receive a special bonus power for the round.  They would also receive a parent token, which can be collected for points at end-game scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three generations, the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
