			<description>Łamisł&amp;oacute;wkais a tile-placement word game played on a field of hexes clustered around numbered fields, where players must place words in twisted lines and the situation on the board is constantly shifting, and can be subject to interpretation. Somewhat reminiscent of diagramless crosswords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player puts down tiles that, in connection to some already on the board, spell out a word; the word has to be declared, as, unlike scrabble, it could be read in many directions, touches letters that aren't part of the word, and so on. Each letter has an assigned number of points, and each word places scores points. Additionally, if one closes the right surrounding a numbered field, one collects as many points as the number signifies. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
