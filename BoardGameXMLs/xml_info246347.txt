			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAT RACE is an action packed arcade-style game with multiple levels of difficulty and challenge. Colorful graphics and superb music enhance the excitement of the game. Picture yourself in a fast food restaurant. The restaurant is so busy that as soon as food is prepared, the chef just throws it wherever he has room. The restaurant is obviously very messy and in much confusion! Your job is to gather the food for the orders and place it into the proper bin on top of the screen. The french fries go into the french fry bin, the hamburgers into their own bin, and so on. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Just gather the food and put it into the appropriate bin. But you know better than that, don't you? There are a few minor problems. Since the food is all over the place, some of the local rats have found the restaurant a very attractive place to hang out for lunch, since it is always so sloppy! Generally, they restrict their activities to certain areas of the screen, but they're so fast. it's a race for your life. If they bite you, you'll begin again with one fewer life. The excitement mounts as the degree of difficulty builds. After you've cleared a few boards, you'll see the infamous super rat, who races anywhere with only one thing in mind - to get you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
