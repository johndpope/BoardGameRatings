			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destruction Derby:  Building iron and wrecking your opponents. That's what Destruction Derby is all about. Well, that and how fast and loose you can play with the rulebook. A new season of bashes and crashes begins soon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrecking Iron: Buy an old vehicle. Fix it up. Prepare it for racing. Decide whether or not you're going to cheat. Try to sneak your cheats past the inspectors. Then get into the arena and bash into your opponents better than anyone else bashes into you! Throw in a racer or two suffering from petty jealousy and personality issues, a muddy track, and a tiny pot of prize money for the winner, and you have the pure essence of destruction derby! ...A muddy arena, a bunch of cheaters, and a vengeful rival all await in this, the first edition of Destruction Derby!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
