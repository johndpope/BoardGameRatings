			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Named after Plymoth, Devon in England, Plymouth (also known as Plimouth and Plimoth), Massachusetts, is best known as the landing place of the ship the Mayflower and its Pilgrims, who were fleeing religious persecution in England. It is one of the oldest municipalities in the colonies and is the oldest in New England. It is also the oldest continually inhabited English settlement. Historically speaking, it is also home to the first Thanksgiving feast and the famous Plymouth Rock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located about forty miles south of Boston in the southern part of Massachusetts known as &amp;quot;The South Shore,&amp;quot; Plymouth is famous for its rope making, fishing, and shipping businesses. Plymouth Bay is an important import and export center for the colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover the plots of the Mandoag. Face the hidden agendas of many. Explore a region that is one of the oldest locations in the colonies. Plymouth is waiting. This new Colonial Gothic location is ready for your use.
