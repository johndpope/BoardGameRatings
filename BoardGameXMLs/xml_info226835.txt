			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to laugh while being challenged? Reap the glorious Glory while playing this funny and strategic resource management game! &lt;br/&gt;Glory is a competitive resource management game for 2-4 players. Players take up the mantle of various champions, who are represented by iconic role-playing classes with a slight twist. During the course of the game, players will collect and use resources like might and sorcery. They can use their resources to combat creatures for Glory, spend them with Glory to devote creatures to increase their army and gain more resources every turn, or use them to purchase powerful spells that will sway the balance of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
