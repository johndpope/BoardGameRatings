			<description>Embark upon a desperate quest to rescue Faramir from the clutches of the Dark Lord's servants. Time is against you, as are the treacherous paths and noxious fumes of the shadowed land through which you must race. Along your way, you must defeat scores of Orcs, agents of Mordor, and three powerful Captains, each of which gains strength and resilience from The Morgul Vale Nightmare Deck! In Nightmare Mode, you have less time to free Faramir than ever before, and every decision you make throughout your quest will play a part in determining whether you succeed, or whether Faramir falls prey to the Nazg&amp;ucirc;l!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightmare Decks for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios cast in the shadows of the game's challenging Nightmare Mode. Featuring deadlier enemies, darker locations, and more terrifying surprises, each Nightmare Deck introduces new, alternate encounter cards and instructions for using them to reshape a scenario's encounter deck. The result? A nightmarish journey through territory you thought you knew, but with twists and turns that will have you on the edge of your seat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
