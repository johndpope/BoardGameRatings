			<description>The board represents a track that can be followed with a car (the pawns represent cars). Each player receivers his car and 250.000 francs at the start of the game. In each round the players roll the dice and advance their car. During the game the players can enter in sports events (they pass them on their track and they include a ski event, horseback riding, tennis, sailing or golf). These events cost 50.000 francs to enter but can earn the player points. The players can also encounter bad luck during their journey (flat tire, accident, they can even end up in hospital). In the end the player who completes the track first with the most points wins the game. This game was created in 1955 by the same designer as 1000 Bornes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
