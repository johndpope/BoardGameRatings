It&amp;rsquo;s a three-story building made of river stones and sturdy oak wood. During the day casual passengers on riverboats can even not notice it, but, during the night, the inn&amp;rsquo;s lights are clearly visible from the river as well as from the land. Strategically placed halfway between two important cities, the Riverside Inn is the must-stop of all the cargo ships sailing on the Great River. Many captains choose to make a stop at the inn to drink its famous stout beer and taste its delicious sandwiches stuffed with salted butter and salmon, even if many of these captains and crews know about the hidden activity of the inn: a gambling house.
