			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;'The board is a bird's eye view of George Street, Charlotte Square and St. Andrews Square in the New Town of Edinburgh.'&lt;br/&gt;'Players must first park their car and then visit up to eight shops or businesses in the area. However, many hazards await them - Parking Meters, Traffic Wardens, Endless delays and Diversions'&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to &lt;br/&gt;1) park your car and put money in the meter. This determines how many turns you have before you must return to your car.&lt;br/&gt;2) visit the shops as determined by a random card allocation&lt;br/&gt;3) return to your card before your money runs out (or the Traffic Warden gets you!)&lt;br/&gt;4) Repeat until all your errands are finished and you drive away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
