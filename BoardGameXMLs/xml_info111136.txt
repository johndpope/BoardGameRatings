							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stellar Prospector</name>
									
			<description>Stellar Prospector is a light game for 3-5 players vying for the chance to run a start-up franchise that prospects rare elements from stars in their planetary system.  The first candidate franchisee to complete five specific delivery missions of specific rare elements to particular planets wins the right to run the franchise (and thus wins the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game with a small amount of money but no ships,  pilots or fuel.  In order to prospect and deliver rare elements, players must hire pilots and buy ships and fuel.  Ships may be bought and pilots hired either at auction or from the shop.  Higher level pilots and ships have a better chance of success but cost more money.  Players make more money either by prospecting and delivering rare elements or bumming around the home base planet doing odd jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must learn which stars contain what rare elements through trial-and-error missions and taking note of other players' routes and deliveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So players must balance observation with action, knowledge with uncertainty in their race to complete their missions, because star mining is a risky business, with pilot error or ship failure resulting in a fiery end to both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
