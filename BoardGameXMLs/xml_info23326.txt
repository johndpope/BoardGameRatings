			<description>In Rivalry each player controls a historical civilization and works to achieve supreme power through military, economic, and diplomatic means.  Each civilization is entirely different from the others and has its own distinctive benefits and heroes.  The game has no specific time period, so Alexander the Great can battle Rommel with his armies, while Montezuma can be played against Genghis Khan.&lt;br/&gt;Rivalry emphasizes cooperation between players since individual civilizations will have difficulty winning alone.  While predominantly a military strategy game, the historical flavor and distinctiveness between civilizations adds a role-playing element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
