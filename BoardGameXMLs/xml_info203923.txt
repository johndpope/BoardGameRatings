			<description>It is Renaissance Italy and you are preparing a banquet. Simple you say. Not so. The Architect can't sit on the same table as the Engineer, Casanova must sit between two females, the Host's Wife must sit next to the Host and can't sit next to either mistress. And so it continues&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses players try to place all their characters but as the tables fill up it becomes more difficult as you have to find ways to shuffle characters around, assassinate or otherwise make space to sit your remaining characters to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to play all of their cards is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
