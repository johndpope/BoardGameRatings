			<description>MC Groovz Dance Craze is a rhythm game for the Nintendo GameCube, developed and published by Mad Catz, Inc. The game is a Dance Dance Revolution clone which came bundled with Mad Catz' Beat Pad accessory. The game was originally announced via a press release on November 2, 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main gameplay modes: Scroll and Spin. In Scroll mode, you play by stepping on four different directions on the game pad (right, up, down and left) as the arrows scroll towards four icons at the top of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spin mode, however, allows you to step on eight directions. The arrows gravitate towards the icons in the screen from the center. In Easy mode, you only step on four arrows. Moderate and Expert increase the number of arrows to eight. The songs are also longer than other dance games, often lasting around seven minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes three extra modes of play: Dance Workout mode, which lets you see how many calories you've burned while playing the game; Dance Together, a two player co-op dance mode; and Dance Faceoff, a two-player versus mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;MC Groovz Dance Craze&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
