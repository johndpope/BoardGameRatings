							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cerii Ously, Halfling Daredevil</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first (of many hopefully)single character codices based on a particular character concept. In this issue we introduce Cerii Ously, a halfling bard (daredevil) that becomes entrenched in the world of fantasy espionage. Presented are six versions of Cerii, starting as a 1st level neophyte bard. She is then presented at 4th level and every four levels thereafter through 20th level. Each iteration includes a brief of her abilities and mindset, possible character interaction ideas, and possible boons she may provide to the player-characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The builds include a normal 15 point buy for her normal ability scores and a heroic block that includes a 20 point upgrade to her ability scores as well as an upgrade in equipment. A new magic item is also presented, an item used by our famous bard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
