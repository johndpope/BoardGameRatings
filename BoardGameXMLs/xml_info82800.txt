			<description>In this card driven simulation of the game of Curling, players are given a number of cards representing curling shots, with each position (lead, second, third and skip) having its own distinct set of cards.  Two cards per position will be played, in order, over a series of eight ends.  As each position will have sixteen cards available, care must be taken in how the cards are managed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As cards are played, disks (representing curling stones) are added or removed from the board, representing the results of the 'shot' taken.  A good deal of leeway is allowed in the position of the stones.  This is important, as some cards will be able to affect stones in some positions, but not others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this way, choosing your shots and placing your markers, players can utilize (and learn) actual curling strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules has one player on each team acting as the skip or captain.  This player calls for the shot, and the shooter (active player) must try to play a card matching the shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
