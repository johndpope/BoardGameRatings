			<description>One of many games featured on ads in comic books from the late 50's into the early 80's. The &amp;quot;Convoy Terror&amp;quot; War Game by Five Star Toys (of Rego Park NY, later of Commack, NY) seems to have been an early version of Helen of Toy's &amp;quot;Fighting Ships.&amp;quot; In fact, Five Star Toys may have been an early incarnation of Helen of Toy, Co. Like Fighting Ships, Convoy Terror featured 132 pieces - &amp;quot;Two Complete Modern Navies in Gray and Green.&amp;quot; It also included a paper Playmat &amp;quot;Battle Area&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2 Gyroscopic Indicators&amp;quot;, and a &amp;quot;Comparison Chart&amp;quot; showing real US and Russian Naval ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
