							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manoeuvre Group</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's information:&lt;br/&gt;Manoeuvre Group is designed to fight all arms actions in the period from 1941 to at least 2010, using forces up to a Company Group (Battle Group in US terminology). That is, up to 8 tanks, 1 or 2 platoons of supporting infantry and their supporting close reconnaissance, engineering and artillery assets, in an evening. The innovative rule system means no book keeping. At this scale the battles are fought at close quarters, in relatively dense terrain, be it urban or rural, from England to Iraq and all points in between. Manoeuvre Group&amp;rsquo;s emphasis is just that, the command of manoeuvre units to eliminate the enemy. The reading of the ground, timing and employment of all arms assets are the key to winning a battle. The player will spend more time moving units about to exploit weaknesses in the enemy&amp;rsquo;s plan than calculation of hit factors and dice rolling. The rules capture the ebb and flow of a battle often missing in other rules. With practise, experts (in tactics) can achieve 10 to 15 bounds in an evening even with a full Company Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
