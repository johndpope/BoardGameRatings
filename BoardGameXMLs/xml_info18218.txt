			<description>This is a &amp;quot;rummy&amp;quot; type game, with elements of &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot; that involves cards with Bible characters and verses on them.  The 44 card deck (11 books with 4 cards each) is shuffled among the players and they ask each other for certain characters or books to complete sets.   First published in 1895 but still seems to have versions up through the 20th. century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is at least one other version from the same publisher with the same box that has 56 cards, 14 books of 4 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
