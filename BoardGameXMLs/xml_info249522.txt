			<description>Quartermaster General: Prelude adds a short pre-game of new &amp;ldquo;Prelude&amp;rdquo; cards, setting the stage for WW II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prelude has a truncated sequence of play designed to create differing opening situations from whence regular play can begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of Prelude cards, History and Armament. History cards are (generally) resolved immediately and have a tension modifier. Armament cards are played face down, like response cards, but cost a regular card to use (not to play). When the total tension from history cards gets to 10, regular play begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
