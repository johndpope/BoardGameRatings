							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Graduation Day</name>
									
			<description>A One-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a beautiful day. The sky is clear and a warm spring breeze blows from the east. Walking down the trail you find yourselves slowing to a leisurely pace, enjoying the fine weather. You're all late, but that doesn't seem important now, because today is a special day. It's your graduation day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past several years you have studied at Wally's  School for Adventurers. The lessons were physically and  mentally hard, and more than once the temptation to quit was  quite strong. The fact that the town of Delmsford was also  home to the prestigious Esterhause Academy didn't help.  Ridicule and contempt were all you could expect from the  Academy's students. Today, though, this is not on your minds. You all feel like you're on top of the world. Approaching the lone building of the school, you see the school banner is waving from the pole in front. The familiar image of a grinning walrus adorns it, with a sword in one hand and gold pieces overflowing in the other. This is not the most orthodox banner, but then nothing about Wally's School for Adventurers is. Even the graduation ceremony is different. Since no guests are allowed, you all had to pick up your presents before the ceremony, which is why you're late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To symbolize the development from students to full fledged adventurers, you have to attend the graduation fully equipped. Your training may be complete, but the official blessing from the school remains. You stand before the worn oak doors at the front of the building. Pausing nervously for a moment, you remember that all your classmates and teachers await inside. You glance at  each other, realizing this is going to be the best day of your lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
