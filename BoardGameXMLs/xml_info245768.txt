			<description>Froggi is the cute, quirky card game in which you try to be the first player to connect 5 of your cards together on the playing surface, while you strategize to interrupt the progress of your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Separate the deck into 4 stacks of cards by color, face-down. Shuffle each deck and give 1 to every player. Set any extra deck(s) aside. Place the sole green frog into the center of the playing surface. The player left of the dealer takes the first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each turn, a player draws 1 card from his or her deck and plays it onto the surface in an invisible grid that may grow in any direction. Diagonal play is not allowed. If a card with an action is played, its action must be completed either after, or as part of, the card's placement (if possible). The action cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 1: Extra turn (after)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c1: Cover an opponent's card (as part of).&lt;br/&gt;m1: Move any card to a new position (after).&lt;br/&gt;-1: Remove an opponent's card from play (after).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No card may be removed that &amp;quot;breaks&amp;quot; the overall grid of cards (creates and island of cards that aren't connected by border to the others).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player with 5 cards in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
