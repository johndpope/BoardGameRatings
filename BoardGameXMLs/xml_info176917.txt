							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyramid (Volume 3, Issue 78 - Apr 2015)</name>
									
			<description>Unleash Your Soul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes and villains are often made of sterner stuff than the rest of humanity. They've got fortitude. They've got style. Most of all, they've got spirit! This month's Pyramid -- the PDF magazine for roleplayers -- looks at the power of the spirit, and how it can be used for good or nefarious purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our soulful selections include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Blessed Be,&amp;quot; an extensive deconstruction of the Blessed advantage from GURPS guru Sean Punch, with lots of ways to refine its scope and abilities. Now you can become Angel-Blooded, a Wilderness Guardian, or a Speaker for the Gods . . . or countless other options you can build and use yourself!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Clerics of Order and Chaos,&amp;quot; which adds factions of Order and Chaos to the eternal crypt-crawling struggle of GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. Invite to your party an unholy warrior of order, a chaos druid, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Voice of the Moon,&amp;quot; this month's Eidetic Memory offering from GURPS Spaceships author David L. Pulver. Learn the secrets of a 17th-century cult, the details of its modern reconstruction, and the powers of the Moorstone (with GURPS effects). Defeat these guys, or become members (or former members) . . . and, no matter what, keep reaching for the moon!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Cursed Thou Art,&amp;quot; Christopher R. Rice's in-depth look at the Divine Curse disadvantage, and how it can be reused or reformed in new and terrifying configurations. Become a Marked One, endure Cassandra's Dilemma, or speak with the Rhymer's Tongue . . . or apply these rules to unleash curses on others!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Secrets of the Universe!&amp;quot; is a religious organization that promises to unlock your inner potential. Is it too good to be true, or the dawn of a new era? The choices are yours, with a small add-on from Pyramid editor Steven Marsh that offers to include the abilities of GURPS Psis in many different settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue also unleashes a Random Thought Table that looks at maintaining and controlling the unbelievable, plus Odds and Ends featuring a Murphy's Rule that's too cruel to be kind. Regardless of how you harness the power or peril of the spirit, this Pyramid will give you a faith lift!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
