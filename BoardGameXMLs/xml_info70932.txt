			<description>(User Description)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each duel master adventure comes as two paperback books and one map shrinkwrapped together&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the first page)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Challenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a powerful mage, one of the Inner Council of Magicians, all of whom have mastered the greater magics. Each of you specialises in one of the five types or colours of magics. The head of your arcane Council, Emeritus the Sorceror, is dead and his successor among the councillors must be chosen in the time-honoured fashion - by ritual duel to the death in the Rainbow Land. As one of the Inner Council, you have put yourself forward as a claimant. Only one other has dared to oppose you, but you know not which of your illustrious colleagues feels mighty enough to challenge you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
