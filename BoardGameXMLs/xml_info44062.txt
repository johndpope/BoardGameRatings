			<description>NOMINATED BEST GAME and BEST RULES for the 2005 ENNIE AWARDS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capes is a superhero game with heart. As you play you will show the amazing things that your hero can do and, just as important, their inspiring reasons for doing them. The game poses the question &amp;quot;Power is fun, but do you deserve it?&amp;quot; The rules will lead you constantly from the joy of super-powers to the determination to show your worth. You'll find what success means to your character, and also what failure means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superhero stories are made of both thrilling victory and devastating failure. Capes rewards you for telling both sides of such stories: Defeat of the character isn't a defeat for the player. It is a different kind of victory, and sometimes the most valuable kind. It gives you more ability to control the story as it moves forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
