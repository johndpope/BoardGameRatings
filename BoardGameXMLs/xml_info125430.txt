			<description>Fast Draw Showdown is a live-action laserdisc video game, released by American Laser Games in 1994 for a limited number of platforms. As one of the last live-action rail shooters released by the company, which began the series with Mad Dog McCree, it is also arguably the shortest. The game was filmed entirely in at the Old Tucson Studios near Tucson, Arizona, with sets used for several notable films belonging to the Western genre. It was also re-released for PC only by Digital Leisure in 2004, with mouse and light gun support. This game was also re-released for WiiWare in North America on January 4, 2010 and in the PAL region on January 22, 2010. A HD port of this game was released for the Playstation Network on the Playstation 3 and supported the Playstation Move controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fast Draw Showdown&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
