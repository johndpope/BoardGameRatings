			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sick of your players throwing away magic items?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's something wrong when an adventurer explores a tomb, finds a better magic sword, then dumps his old magic sword on a small-town merchant whose hometown's yearly corn exports are worth a mere fraction of the &amp;quot;obsolete&amp;quot; sword's worth. One Bling to Rule Them All - Scaling Magic Items helps to mitigate the &amp;quot;disposable economy&amp;quot; nature of magic items with the introduction of scalars, or magic items that level up as the master does. Featuring five tiers of abilities and a rank system that mimics the ubiquitous talent point system, the scalar is an excellent quest end reward for high fantasy sidequests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete scalar attunement, scalar ability generation, and scalar &amp;quot;hacking&amp;quot; rules are presented herein, as well as a number of flavor-rich suggestions on how to justify their insertion into your game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 100 abilities in five tiers covering most common character archetypes&lt;br/&gt;     Rank, or &amp;quot;talent&amp;quot;, point system for customization even if two scalars have the same abilities&lt;br/&gt;     Intuitive system makes it easy to make your own abilities&lt;br/&gt;     Ability assignment is done by the Game Master, while rank distribution is done by the player, thus eliminating the worst of powergaming and letting Rule 0 decide how powerful, or weak, a party's scalars will be.&lt;br/&gt;     Compatible with Pathfinder, as well as D&amp;amp;D 3.5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
