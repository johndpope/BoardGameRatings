							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle for Kirovograd</name>
									
			<description>Battle for Kirovograd is a simulation of the battles in January 1944 between the German 8th Army and the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front.  The battle took place in freezing, often blizzard conditions, around the city of Kirovograd.  While the Soviets were able to capture the city, both sides fought themselves to a standstill with extremely high losses due to combat and extreme weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn of Battle for Kirovograd equals 1 day.  One hex equals 2 miles. Unit counters represent battalions, regiments, brigades and divisions. The game lasts for 12 Turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
