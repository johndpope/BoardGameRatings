			<description>Bop it! meets the rubber ball/paddle game but with electronic voice commands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looks like a funnel with a trampoline over the big opening. You try to bounce a ball in the air off that trampoline to score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:Obey the commands! Hit it quick hit it high! Can you keep up? Compete against your friends in a bounce-off &amp;amp; see if YOU can hit the all-time high score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 slammin' skill games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Max Bounce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You only have 30 seconds to bounce your fastest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Bounce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep it bouncing 'til you can bounce no more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hang Time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catch as much air as you can in 5 bounces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right Height&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game calls the shots - hit it high or hit it low!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little-Middle-Big&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hit it high... hit it low!
