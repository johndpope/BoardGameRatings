							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy of Doom</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A legacy of doom! For centuries, cults dedicated to the World Serpent have worked to pave the way for the Earth's destruction. Years ago, the villainous Steel Snake nearly succeeded in bringing global disaster with his immense strength and ability to manipulate metal. Although he failed, he still managed to claim victory with the killing of the hero, Thunderstrike! He hasn't been seen since and is believed to have fallen to the radiation from his doomsday weapons - or is that something people just tell themselves to help them sleep at night?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now a new champion of the Serpent has been chosen: Bloodrake! His super speed, might, and ability to recover from most any injury make him a valuable agent of destruction to the Sons of Jormungand cult. Luckily for the world, the vandalistic Bloodrake scoffs at all the cult nonsense and is far from reaching his full potential!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
