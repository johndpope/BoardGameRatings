							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure 4: In The King&#039;s Service (fan expansion for HeroQuest)</name>
									
			<description>In this adventure we created cards for the Mountain Orcs and the Iron Skeletons. These new Monsters were so much fun to have in the other adventures that we decided to expand the monster's world. At the time we didn't want to add new monster figures, we wanted to create new monsters that could still use the same figures. so we created the Hobgoblin, the Ghoul and the Uraki Orc from Lord of the Ring. Another thing that we created was more weapons for the armory and the ability to buy more potions. we took the potions from the treasure cards, the expansions series and a few that we ourselves created, we gave them all a price. and created a new store.&lt;br/&gt;This is my favorite story. I hope that you will enjoy playing it as much as we did creating it. Have fun.&lt;br/&gt;These games' pdf files are available for downloading. They are made in a way that will allow you to make the books and cards. The pages are available at &amp;quot;Dragonkingdoms.co.uk&amp;quot; and yahoo's group site &amp;quot;Hero Quest Game board&amp;quot; for free. You do need to join the group to access the file's section where they are stored. The photo section of this site will allow you to read the story and look at the maps to see if this game is something you would like to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
