			<description>Motukoreaite is a rare and expensive commodity. You are scientists and have been sent to an island to recover this precious mineral. Unfortunately your hot air balloon crashes, with parts and equipment spread over the island. With your balloon badly damaged and your team separated, you must work together to survive and get off the island. Little do you know the island is not unoccupied. A roving creature senses your presence and hears your movements. Sometimes it will take what you are searching for; sometimes it will effect your well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding lost equipment will help you explore the island more easily. Each player can carry only a limited number of items, though, so you may be forced to leave something valuable behind so that you can carry balloon parts. To win the game, you must keep track of your team's health and get to the balloon crash site with the missing parts before the creature does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Browns Island consists of a modular board. Players start with a set of four cards, which are played to gain lost equipment as they move around the board. Some equipment gives them added advantages to collect parts for their crashed balloon. Players also try to avoid a roving creature. If the creature discovers a part from your balloon, players lose happiness tokens and must try to take the items back by using their gained skills (via action cards) and found equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
