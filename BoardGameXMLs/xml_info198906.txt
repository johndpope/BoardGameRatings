			<description>This new, fast paced, Russian roulette themed card game puts players in control of their own fates. This deadly game of chance will not only test your luck, but your nerves as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, the dealer deals face-up a card to each player from the deck. If the card is a Click, the player will stay alive and continue in the round, but if it is a Bang!, the player has gotten shot and must leave the round with no points. Each Click card will also contain the number of points won by the player who posses it. The play continues in a clockwise fashion with each player deciding whether they will like to collect their points and exit the round, or risk their lives with a new card for the possibility of getting more points. Once all the players have either chosen to leave or have been shot, the points are tallied, the deck is shuffled, and the next round begins. The first player to 50 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
