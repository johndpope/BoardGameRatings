			<description>A promo expansion for Crooks - new edition (WGG 1201-02)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These six expansion cards (included in the game Matryoshka) replace the six cards in the base game that share portraits. The rules for these new cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racketeer&lt;br/&gt;Each Racketeer shows a bonus or penelty on its left and right edges. During scoring phase, the number on its right edge affects the value of the target to its immediate right, and the number on its left edge affects the value of the target to its immediate left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turncoat&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game you must decide which of these two gangs this Crook is a member of. If multiple Turncoats are in the game, they must choose their affiliation from highest to lowest rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
