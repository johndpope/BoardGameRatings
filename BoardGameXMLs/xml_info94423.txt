			<description>Ironclad (known in Japan as Chōtetsu Brikinger) is a shoot 'em up video game developed by Saurus for the Neo Geo CD video game console. It was never officially released in North America, but if you put the game on a North American system, the game will be playable in English and display the &amp;quot;Ironclad&amp;quot; title screen. However, the game was released on the Wii Virtual Console in the PAL region on March 12, 2010 and in North America on April 5, 2010, with both regions as an import release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cartridge version was developed, but not available until 2009 when it was released for download in Japan on Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console. Hackers were able to create bootleg Neo-Geo cartridges by extracting the rom, which never surfaced on the internet until then, from the Wii release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ironclad (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
