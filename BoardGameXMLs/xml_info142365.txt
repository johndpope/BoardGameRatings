							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gear &amp; Piston: Engineer Assistants</name>
									
			<description>The first mini-expansion to Gear &amp;amp; Piston, it contains 10 Engineer Assistant tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player is dealt one random Engineer Assistant tile. The players may look at the assistant tile they received but the tile is kept secret from other players. The tiles are placed face-down on the table, with the 1VP scoring symbol facing up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Engineer Assistant has a unique special ability that may be used only once during a game. The special ability can be used by turning the assistant tile face-up thus revealing the assistant to the other players. An unrevealed Engineer Assistant is worth 1 VP at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tile is revealed either at the start of the round or at any time.  If multiple assistants are revealed simultaneously, they are resolved in turn order starting from the first player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each portrait on each tiles will bear the likeness of a Gear &amp;amp; Piston Kickstarter backer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
