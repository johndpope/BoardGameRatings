			<description>Hunters is a fantasy adventure card game for 1-4 players, where you and your friends take on the role of battle-hardened monster hunters, out to fulfill contracts delivered to the Hunter&amp;rsquo;s Guild to slay all manner of foul beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your class and build your unique character by selecting from hundreds of abilities, random personalities and backgrounds. Then, work alone or as a team with your friends as you journey out into the wilderness on a hunting contract to track down and defeat a vicious beast in an exciting card-based&lt;br/&gt;adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will face the dangers of the environment itself on your trek, battling against the elements, treacherous obstacles, native creatures and the unforgiving weather as you hunt your prey through a variety of regions, before finally engaging in mortal combat with your vicious quarry in an epic confrontation to complete your task. At least, until you head back to town to take up another contract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of your journeys, you will gain experience with each kill. This can be used to purchase new abilities, recover a number of useful items such as weapons, armour, crafting materials, trinkets and hunting trophies, pick up valuable companions to fight by your side, or sustain ongoing injuries that will stick with them for the rest of their hunting days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dare to venture into the wild?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;A game of Hunters involves choosing from a selection of hunting contracts, kitting out your character with abilities and equipment, before working your way through a Region, represented by a deck of cards, on the hunt for your chosen monster. During your hunt, you'll face native enemies that can be combated, challenges to face and obstacles to overcome, all of which are completed using a simple dice-based system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat in Hunters uses a mix of card-based Abilities, dice and a simple resource management mechanic. A Hunter can only take a limited number of abilities with them on a contract, so choosing the right combination for the job is key. These abilities are then used in conjunction with dice to determine the results of attacks. Once a contract is completed, the players can earn experience and rewards, before heading back to town to take on a new contract and a new adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
