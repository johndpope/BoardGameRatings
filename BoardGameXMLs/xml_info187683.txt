			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talking the Talk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a promoter, it&amp;rsquo;s my job to make other people look good. It may not sound like the most prestigious work but I take pride in knowing that I&amp;rsquo;m the reason my clients have any worth. If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for me, they&amp;rsquo;d still be pit fighting in some dingy bar near the favelas. Sometimes I need to remind them of that fact, but I try to avoid doing so if they have a gun in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I may have built a career out of playing to crowds, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean my talents are wasted else-where. My powers of persuasion are useful when dealing with individuals as well as groups, and my kind are often hired on the side to be negotiators, hagglers, and dealers. Whenever it isn&amp;rsquo;t appropriate for guns to do the talking, I&amp;rsquo;m the person you need to have on your side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psi-punk Archetypes: Promoter is all about the people who use the power of persuasion to bolster their allies, defame their enemies, and win the favor of the crowd.  This supplement provides further insight into the archetype and offers suggestions for skill selections, Gifts, Faults, and Gear that would be useful to any Promoter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
