							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uni-Spec: A Synergic Auction Game</name>
									
			<description>Uni-Spec (also called Spec in the rules) is played on a 7x7 grid. The grid spaces are purchased one at a time by players; on each turn the active player chooses an unowned space to be sold. If it is one of the spaces on the main diagonals, it has a printed price (from 1-7 units) and the player simply buys it. Otherwise an auction is conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each space on the board has an intrinsic value of 1, but a group of orthogonally-connected spaces is worth the square of its size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players need more money, they can take loans equal to half the value of their owned spaces. The rules for this are a bit unclear (no mention of repayment, for example). Players can also sell spaces back to the bank to acquire cash; such spaces are not resold  to players (a fifth color of marker is provided for them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all spaces have been sold. The player with the greatest net worth is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few simple variants are provided (e.g., ignore the prices on the main diagonal spaces, don't allow loans, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
