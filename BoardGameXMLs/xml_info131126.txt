			<description>A shoal of colorful fish tumbles onto the table. The players cast their nets. A handful of dice is all they need to catch the fish. The player who throws matching colors can land one of the coveted medallions with a fish trio. Which additional dice can players throw? Which trio is the easiest to catch? A fisherman's luck helps, but only risk-takers and strategic throws of the extra dice will help players land the biggest haul in their nets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pescado is a fast-moving and entertaining dice game &amp;ndash; not everything is left to chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
