			<description>This game is based on the movie of the same name from 1981. It uses many of the mechanics found in the game &amp;quot;Mille Bournes&amp;quot;. Cards are selected and played for stopping and going, and other cards represent mile markers and hazards along the way. You can play hazards on others and attempt to prevent them from happening to you. The cover features many of the principal actors and actresses in the movie (except Jackie Chan-- I guess his fame wasn't realized yet according to Fox).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
