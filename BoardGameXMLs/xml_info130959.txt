Its playbook includes rules for special units, new optional rules, 10 gripping scenarios, and unit summaries for the US, British and German units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ownership of Expansions 1 &amp;amp; 2 is not required to field the German forces, they are all included here. However, this expands on those German units included in the first two expansions, no unit IDs are duplicated. Combine the German units from all three expansions to create customized scenarios on either the Western or Eastern Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its TO&amp;amp;Es booklet includes details for the US, British and German forces covering the period from 1944 through 1945, including the US heavy and light armored divisions, British armoured divisions, in both Western Europe and Italian configurations, and infantry and airborne divisions.
