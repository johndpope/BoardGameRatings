							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strike Legion: Planetary Operations</name>
									
			<description>Planetary Operations combat takes place at a higher command echelon than its &amp;lsquo;tactical&amp;rsquo; game counterpart. Each vehicle or&lt;br/&gt;troop stand in Planetary Operations represents a company or large detachment of troops, with units representing battalions with attached support units. The Strike Legion &amp;lsquo;tactical&amp;rsquo; game uses a 1:1 representation for troops, with each vehicle representing one vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;The tactical game emphasizes the differences between the quality and technology of opposing troops, and focuses on action involving forces from company to reinforced battalion strength on each side. Planetary Operations places more emphasis on the effects of a more efficient and intelligent command structure, and players can easily field entire divisions of troops and play&lt;br/&gt;games to a conclusion in a couple of hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
