			<description>Upgrade your computer; hack your friends computer; get the most Valued Productivity out of your machine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 to 4 players compete to get the most bang for their buck for their machines while slowing down other players.  This card game features 120 cards and lets players manipulate the deck and their luck to activate their card functions.  But other players get to activate their functions in the same register #, even on your turn, and cause havoc with your plans. And the deck stacking isn't the only way to activate your card functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all computers, random factors can cause you benefits or issues.  So, dice also activate function #s.  And as you replace your hardware, you get to fun your functions one more time as well.  There are combinations of actions that can lead to very interesting results and evolved complexity/depth.  Overall the game can be very deep, but is still accessible and easy to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays via rounds and is only very loosely &amp;quot;turn-based&amp;quot;.  Players can buy and use actions/cards even when it's not their turn.  There are game balancing mechanics to help losing players catch up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game falls into the Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, Glory to Rome, category of games in that you build your own arrangement of cards in front of you, and try to build combos.  Cards are bought via hand discards, but Two Bit Hack has a very unique method for how card functions are activated.  This aspect is most similar to Settlers of Catan.  Also, cards in hand are not only your money, but also your method of activating your functions with certainty.  Or you can leave things more up to luck and leave more cards in your hand for purchasing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
