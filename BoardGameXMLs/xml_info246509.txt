			<description>Pieces confront in a series of duels.&lt;br/&gt;The difference is that you see all your opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces, that you choose your angle of attack, and that the pieces obey a circular hierarchy : in absolute terms, nobody is the strongest.&lt;br/&gt;As you initiate the next duel when you have just lost one, it may be occasionally advantageous to lose.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes it happens that some sacrificial dynamics lead you to the final victory.&lt;br/&gt;The figurines are simply pinched within their bases, and you can pinch them in again when removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To engage a duel, the player moves a piece to the line of battle. The opponent must chose one of the 2 pieces on the left and on the right of the played piece and move it to join the line of battle.&lt;br/&gt;The elephants scratch the cats, the cats eat the mice, the mice frighten the elephants. Between the same pieces, a level 3 beats a level 2, who beats a level 1. The next duel is engaged by the player who has captured the less prisoners.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to eliminate all of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
