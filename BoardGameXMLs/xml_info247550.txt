							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Midnight Council of Quail (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From the module:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs explore a village to locate the lair of a monstrous murderer&amp;mdash;but the villagers don&amp;rsquo;t want the murderer to be discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Summary&lt;br/&gt;&amp;not;The Archdruid Cadeyrn is so old and mystical that his very presence often affects the natural world around him.  Over the years, his close association with the region&amp;rsquo;s quail population has bestowed upon the birds a sentience uncommon to normal avians.  With slightly advanced intelligence, the quail now act as local sentinels, reporting back to Cadeyrn on all matters that transpire in his domain.  But the druid has been away for more than a fortnight on business of the Druidic Order, leaving the quail to decide on important events without his wise hand to guide them.  When the birds learn that a sinister force has infiltrated the nearby village of Earls Pimbeth, where many of them roost upon the thatched rooftops, the quail convene to determine a way to fight back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems that Earls Pimbeth has become the latest hunting ground for a wereboar who has assumed the duties of the village&amp;rsquo;s apothecary after killing and eating the former herbalist.  The wereboar has struck up an alliance with a mad druid who has taken up residence in a lightless subterranean world below the village, where he slowly murders one kidnapped villager at a time as part of his twisted plan for revenge against an imagined crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
