			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tinker's Damn has been written as a flexible gaming system-- this means that you aren't limited to one specific storyline or genre: science fiction, fantasy or modern-day adventure can be mixed in any proportion for an endless range of different campaigns. You can use the rules to duplicate your favorite anime shows or comics, or to create your own world from scratch and be as strange and unusual as you want! Let our lively mascots, Allison and Mittens, guide you through the basics-- including magic, pychics, cyborgs and hackers, as well as special sections on weapon and vehicle design for those weekend warriors and armchair engineers out there! Then try your hand in any of our three sample campaigns filled with tons of hilarious characters and wild hardware....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
