							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Microbe</name>
									
			<description>Players are playing cards from their hands into a 3x3 grid of 9 cards that act as a common game area for all players. Each card has a microbe type represented in the middle and dots at corners. The dots are red, white, or grey. Players score colored markers by placing cards next to each other on the grid in such a way that one or more of the dots on their card line up with similar dots on other cards. For each dot that matches, that player scores a colored scoring marker for the card that their dots matched (not the card they just played).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During scoring sessions, scoring markers are converted into point chips depending on the current layout of the 3x3 grid. Once a scorecard is drawn, play immediately pauses and scoring begins. Of the 4 types available, the one that is represented the least among the 9 currently on the 3x3 grid is worth the most. This means that each colored score marker of that type that a player has may be converted into a 2-point chip. The most abundant type represented on the 3x3 grid is worth negative 1 point. All other types are worth 1 point. Players may never have a negative total. If there are 2 or more types that are both the least represented type, they are both worth 2 points, likewise, if there are 2 or more types that are tied for being the most represented type, each of them are then worth negative 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After scoring has completed, play resumes where it left off and the game continues until the next scorecard is drawn or the draw deck is exhausted. Once the draw deck is exhausted the third and final scoring round takes place. Players then total all of their scoring chips. The player with the highest value wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
