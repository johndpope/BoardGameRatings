			<description>The players move their snake in order to surround face-down markers which will indicate what action will then occur - for example an apple which enables the snake to grow. The snakes are made from wooden sections which link together. They are moved by holding one link in place and moving another section so that the snake wriggles to its destination. A turn ends when another piece is touched. The winner is the player to first get his snake to full size - a head plus 12 body sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
