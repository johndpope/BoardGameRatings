			<description>Playoff is a fast paced discard game similar to Crazy Eights.    It is played on a mat and uses a special deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a card that matches the suit or value of the previous played card.  If a player is unable to do so, cards must be drawn until there is a legal play, and the player pays one chip to the pot for each card drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eights in the deck are replaced by 'star' cards, which allows players to change suit and collect the current pot.  The player with the most chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1976 a version featuring Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, The Odd Couple, was published, with Klugman and Randall cards in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
