			<description>Dogs In The Yard is a tile laying game for 2 to 6 players. It's a game of both chance and strategy, where you and your opponents take turns drawing tiles to build out a map one tile at a time with grass and fences, and try to construct yards around dogs to earn points. They also have to make sure their dogs are fed and watered, and can get extra points with toys and treats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
