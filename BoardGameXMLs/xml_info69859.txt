			<description>A trick-taking game played with traditional playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you win a hand, the winning card is discarded and the rest of the cards in the trick go into your hand. The round ends when one player runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score is kept after each hand for every card left in that player's hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points after 3 rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
