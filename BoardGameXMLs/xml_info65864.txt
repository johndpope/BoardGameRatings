			<description>The players will utilize problem solving strategies to formulate and adapt mathematical equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is similar to rummy. &lt;br/&gt;The play continues until one of the players runs out of cards. Scoring is determined by adding up all the cards that are forming equations. Each card is awarded it's face value and mathematical symbols are valued at 10. Any players with cards in their hand must subtract those cards from their total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
