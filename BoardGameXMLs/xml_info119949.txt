							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arcane Arsenal: Buildup Spells</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first product in S.T. Cooley Publishing's new product line, the 'Shaheen's Scratchpad' line. This line consists of 'Short subject' works of about 8-10 pages focused tightly on a single subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane Arsenal: Buildup Spells introduces a new type of spell into fantasy RPG campaigns - the Buildup spell. Buildup spells allow a caster to get a little more 'bang for his buck' when casting a spell, but the tradeoff is that the caster must wait between casting and discharging the spell. Of course, the question is: 'do you have extra time to wait?' A nice little twist for those wizards or sorcerers who want just a pinch more versatility at their fingertips. This work includes rules for incorporating buildup spells into a campaign by simply including them as new spell options or through use of skills or Feats applied to existing spells(your choice), as well as an 'in-game explanation' of the development of such spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
