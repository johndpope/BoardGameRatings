							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golden Pyramids</name>
									
			<description>Golden Pyramids is a boardgame in which players go exploring an ancient pyramid in search of treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inside of the pyramid is explored as the players go adventuring from room to room. Players will have to find their way around by placing ladders, moving mummies around, collecting keys and opening doors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At times, all players will need to cooperate in order to get deeper into the pyramid. But when there's treasure in sight, it's every adventurer for him or herself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two explorers with which to search through the pyramid. The main goal is of course the Kings Chamber and the treasure within it. Be warned though: the moment the Kings Chamber is discovered, the spirit of the Pharaoh will descend from the heavens in order to keep the explorers from escaping with his riches. Now the race for the exit is on as all that are still inside the pyramid will be trapped forever once the Pharaoh's spirit seals the pyramid shut!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
