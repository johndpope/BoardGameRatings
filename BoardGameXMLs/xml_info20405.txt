			<description>A Canadian variation of the free game Dictionary, more popularly marketed as Balderdash.  &amp;quot;Words&amp;quot; has cards with real words and their definitions, which must be read by one player.  Other players must try to guess the meaning, or else make up a plausible-sounding definition, after which all players vote on which definition they believe is the correct one.  This Canadian edition was published in 1983 and comes with a large box of word cards with definitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
