							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Harvest of Evil</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher's publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new mini-module by Jason Carl! Twin Oaks is a tiny, sleepy little thorp located just within the sheltering eaves of a great forest. Home to an extended family clan of farmers and woodcutters, the community was founded within living memory and since its creation the inhabitants have known only peace and prosperity. But just as the gentle breezes of late summer can transform rapidly into the deadly storms of autumn, dark times have come suddenly to Twin Oaks, in the person of Deskryn, a vampire who finds himself on the run from deadly enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just two nights ago, as the good folk of Twin Oaks prepared for the annual harvest, the terror began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Graveyard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set away from the town, five older graves, and one very fresh one, mark the location of the Twin Oaks graveyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All five of the older graves are marked by weathered headstones proclaiming their names and the fact that each of the dead perished within the last 10 years. The newest grave, however, is unmarked... there has been neither time nor opportunity to craft a headstone for the unfortunate person who died very recently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
