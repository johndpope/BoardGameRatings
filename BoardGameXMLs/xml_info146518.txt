			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Underwater Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a unique game. Essentially, it is a shooting game, but its prime appeal is that it takes place underwater and the battle is between submarines, serpents and whales, very big whales we might add. The player is in command of a submarine which can fire torpedoes with which he must hit large sea serpents that wriggle around the screen. The main objective is to achieve a &amp;quot;clean kill&amp;quot;, otherwise the serpent may divide doubling your problem. If you collide with a serpent you sustain damage, five such collisions destroy the submarine. You must also avoid colliding with the whales, these mammals are extremely large and have the capacity to destroy your ship completely. Like many of our other arcade games, certain parameters can be preset. There are five preset speeds, as well as the option to go on a special mission in which the following parameters can be set: game speed, submarine speed, torpedo speed, number of torpedoes in the salvo and the serpent's speed. All in all, a lot of fun and a refreshing change from zapping space ships. Written in machine code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
