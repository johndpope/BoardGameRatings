			<description>Discon is an abstract game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 10x10 grid is covered with stackable discs in four different colours, save for the corners, which are numbered and act as the players' starting positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 6 &amp;quot;roof&amp;quot; discs which enter the board in their corner. Roofs move in an L-shape, like a knight in chess, and collect the discs in the squares they move to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all discs are collected, at which point towers are scored according to height and colour composition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
