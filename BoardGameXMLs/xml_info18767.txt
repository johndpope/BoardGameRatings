			<description>Pluring is a tile placement game with cards depicting old Swedish coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coins (with values 50, 25, or 10 &amp;ouml;re) are arranged in lines, where half a coin lies on the edge of the card. Each line contains only one type of coin, but the lines with low-denominated coins are usually longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the  game, one card is placed face up in the middle of the table, and each player is dealt two hidden cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you play one of the two cards from your hand, making sure at least one of the fields extends a field that is already on the table. You then add the value of all  whole coins in those fields to your score and draw another card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The victory condition is chosen before the game begins. You can either try to have the largest score after a set number of rounds or race to a fixed sum of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
