			<description>From areyougame.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you get around the world in 80 days? That&amp;rsquo;s the challenge for you and your fellow passengers &amp;ndash; er, players. You must travel through all 6 continents, answering questions based on each one. Questions might be about the food, languages, landmarks, money, cities, and more. Which Central American country is the original &amp;lsquo;Banana Republic&amp;rsquo;? Which 60cm object is Thailand&amp;rsquo;s most sacred figure? The Moors are the dominant ethnic group of which west African country? The answers &amp;ndash; Honduras, The Emerald Buddha, and Mauritania. Each correct answer moves you forward on the board, but each time you are asked a question, one day is marked off your timetable. Direction cards might give you added time for your journey (Air traffic control strike &amp;ndash; add 2 days to your timetable!) but you might lose time as you pass through Customs. Just like with real travel, you can expect the unexpected and you&amp;rsquo;re sure to learn things about the world that you never knew before! Who will make it around the world in 80 days or less? Game comes with 4 Wipe Clean Score Cards, 4 Pens, 1 Game Board, 4 Player Tokens, 295 Travel Question Cards, 32 Direction Cards, and 3 Customs Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
