			<description>City Connection (シティコネクション, Shiti Konekushon) is a video game developed and published in 1985 by Jaleco for the arcade in Japan and published by Kitcorp as Cruisin' outside of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports up to two players (playing alternatively). It's a platform game in which the player controls a car that can never be stopped. The car normally moves at the same speed, although the player can push in the direction the car is moving to make it drive slightly faster. It can only 180&amp;deg; handbrake turn or jump (normal jump or high jump). The object of the game is to drive through a series of cities and paint every part of the roads in each city as proof of the player's visit to that city. City Connection was remarkable for its time in that each location had its own background and music which was a variation on the main theme of the game. There are twelve locations: Manhattan, The Grand Canyon, Easter Island, Paris, Neuschwanstein, London, Sydney, Egyptian temples, and cities in India, Holland, China and Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arcade game was later ported to the MSX, ZX Spectrum and Nintendo Entertainment System. The NES version was also re-released on the Virtual Console in North America on May 26, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. The game has a sequel available on cellphones exclusively in Japan titled as City Connection Rocket (シティコネクション・ロケット).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this game's 10th stage, players will be able to hear the opening theme of the 1960s Batman TV series, in a medley with the Tchaikovsky's music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;City Connection&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
