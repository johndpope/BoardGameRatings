			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in this game strives to become a Social Leader by accumulating Social Points during the several Social Seasons represented by the movement of his piece (a small High Hat) around the board. To do this he must accumulate property, such as Houses, Yachts, Horses, Automobiles, etc., each worth a certain number of points, and also Social Register Cards having definite point values. He may do this by landing on certain spaces, by making successful bets on the Lottery, by obtaining favorable cards from the Human Equation pile, or by trading with some other player. The first player to accumulate 8 different pieces of property (with no duplicates) plus enough Social Register Cards to give him a total of 6000 points is declared the Social Leader and the Winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
