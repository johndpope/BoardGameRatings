			<description>In Confrontation, players choose between being members of the student protesters and Establishment teams. The latter is broken down into ten subgroups, including the military, Washington, city hall, the university administration, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Establishment theme is to keep things the way they are. The students will use peaceful protests, strikes and riots to change society for the better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 11 team cards, 4 results charts (effectively CRTs), 16 confrontation cards, 18 student tokens, 6 police tokens, and 36 Establishment resources tokens. Each side debates the issue at hand, commits resources to confrontation, then consults the results chart to see who wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
