							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Psilink: The Memory Game of the Millenia</name>
									
			<description>Psilink is a unique multi-player Card Game, testing and challenging and enhancing the memory of every player. Educational, captivating, mysterious, exciting, Psilink is custom designed for the lowest level of intelligence all the way up to absolute geniuses, aged 3 to 103. Aside from stretching the memory and word power, with 24 levels of play, Psilink allows for hundreds of other games to be designed and played, using the unique layout and format of 108 cards, in six sets of colours, with six sets of symbols, 18 numbers in each set and the letters of the alphabet mixed and strategically sorted in pure logic throughout the circular cards. Psilink also tests for Precognitive and Telepathic abilities and seeks to discover all the people in the world with Photographic (Eidetic) memories, to engage in Tournaments and Championships. Playing Psilink will actually train and improve a child's memory as well as test and increase their word power. Psilink also won Prestigious Design Awards in Hong Kong and was featured and sold along side with Galaxion at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council's Design Gallery. All other card games can be put aside, in favour of using Psilink Cards. Psilink is ultimately superb, allowing for all known traditional card games to be played with deeper combinations and colours and strategies, as well as proving the memory. Psilink truly is The Future and is also dedicated to God, The Creator of our memories and The True Designer of Colour and Geometry, The True Author of Words and Numbers - Amen with JESUS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
