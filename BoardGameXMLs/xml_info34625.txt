			<description>EVIL WIZARD SCHOOL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old wizard is near death. Before he dies he will teach his final lesson, the lesson that shows his deepest magic. Whoever receives this lesson will be the next master. The player&amp;rsquo;s represent the students and faculty of the school. They will scheme and back stab to be the one who gets that lesson. Everyone wants it. This allows you to find out how far they will go to gain power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil Wizard School is built on the idea that wizards are extremely jealous and treat their students like dung. They don&amp;rsquo;t teach them so they remain weak longer. It is loosely based on what it is like to be in graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an intermediate level Matrix Game. It comes in a box with a 21x16 inch hard board map, character cards, laminated rules, wooden counters and plastic gold coins. It does not include dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPE: Intermediate Engle Matrix Game&lt;br/&gt;PLAYERS: 2 to 10&lt;br/&gt;AGE: 12 to adult&lt;br/&gt;DURATION: 2 hours&lt;br/&gt;COMPLEXITY: Moderate&lt;br/&gt;REPLAYABILITY: High&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
