			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Heaven &amp;amp; Earth, a role-playing game of surrealism, horror, and absurdity. In the small community of Potter&amp;rsquo;s Lake, strange things are afoot. Players assume the roles of ordinary people caught in an epic greater than they can possibly imagine. They will be swept into the extraordinary events that plague this town with frightening regularity. It is up to them to unlock the secrets of Potter&amp;rsquo;s Lake and discover the truth of what is really going on before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This primer is designed to serve as an introduction to Heaven &amp; Earth (3rd Edition). It covers the basics of the setting and game mechanics. It is not designed to serve as &amp;ldquo;Quick Start Rules,&amp;rdquo; but to give a feel for the game. Over the next few pages, readers will be introduced to the fundamentals of the Heaven &amp;amp; Earth. Scattered throughout this document are sidebars covering specific locations, rumors, NPCs, etc. found in the Heaven &amp; Earth Third Edition rulebook and its setting supplement, Paradise Lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
