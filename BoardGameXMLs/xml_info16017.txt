			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Call 'em' All is the furiously fast and frantic think it and shout it game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Call 'em All players are given a category and in 60 seconds they have to think of as many items to do with that category as they can and shout them all out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This may sound easy, but, wouldn't you just know it, there's a catch!  Shout as loud as you can, as quickly as you can, as many items as you can but the only ones which will score you points are the ones that appear on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call 'em All contains 130 categories as diverse as 'Types of Fruit', 'Parts of a Car' and 'Things Found in a Chemist'.  It's a non-stop riot of laughter which will amuse you, your family and friends for hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get your brain in gear, get your mouth in gear because Call 'em All is here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 130 game cards, 2 sets of number cards, 1 scorepad, 1 pencil, 1 60 second timer, 2 counters, rules of the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn takes a card from the deck, which will list a category and ten items in that category.  They lay out ten cards numbered 1 to 10 to match the items, and place a counter on the item they think the other players are least likely to guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the other players then have 60 seconds to shout out as many items as they can in the category, hoping to match the ten on the card.  The player reading the category card turns over the number cards as the matching items are called.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, all the guessing players each score one point for each of the items they have collectively guessed, plus three bonus points if they guess the item with the counter on.  The reading player scores one point for each item that was not guessed, again plus three bonus points if the counter-marked item was not guessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player then takes the next category card, and the previous card reader re-joins the guessers.  In this way the game is co-operative, but the teams are constantly changing and each player will have their own individual score by the game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues for as many rounds as the players decide, although for fairness everyone should have the same number of turns as the card reader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for ages 10+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
