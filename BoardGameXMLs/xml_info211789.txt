							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paranormal Pursuit: The Gifted One</name>
									
			<description>Every second counts in this breathtaking paranormal adventure! Lives are on the line as you race to keep a young boy with psychic abilities from falling into the hands of an evil politician. To evade the henchman sent to kill you and kidnap the child, you'll have to find cleverly hidden objects and solve cunning puzzles using the boy's abilities to manipulate time and matter. Each chapter in Paranormal Pursuit ends with a nail-biting escape sequence during which you must make the right choices to avoid capture.&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Paranormal Pursuit&amp;quot; players take part in the action-packed adventure in which a cruel politician kidnaps psychic children in order to acquire their powers. Throughout the game, the player guides a child welfare worker as she protects a young boy and runs from the bad guys. Distinctive features of &amp;quot;Paranormal Pursuit&amp;quot; include its dynamic and atmospheric story, integrated puzzles, and vibrant, detailed scenes packed with hidden objects.&lt;br/&gt;Released at the end of 2014, the PC version of &amp;quot;Paranormal Pursuit&amp;quot; was successful not only on Alawar's game portals but also on sites operated by Big Fish Games, the exclusive distributor of the title. Immediately upon release, the game entered the BFG top 10, where it stayed for two weeks. The success of the PC version, along with its distinctive features and fully HD graphics, led Alawar to port the hit to new platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
