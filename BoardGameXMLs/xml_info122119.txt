			<description>An abstract game for two or three players.  Each player starts with 14 pieces arranged in two diagonal lines on a 13x13 board.  On their turn each player rolls a die and moves one of their pieces orthogonally the corresponding number of spaces.  Enemy pieces may be captured by replacement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to get as many pieces as possible onto certain designated goal squares.  Each player has separate goal squares.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all of one player's surviving pieces are on that player's goal squares, but the winner is determined by counting scores:  one point for each piece on a goal square, plus one point for each captured enemy, minus one point for each piece not on a goal square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in the book The KnowHow Book of Action Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
