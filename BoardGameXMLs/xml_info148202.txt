			<description>From the PDF back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eleven hundred years after the God&amp;rsquo;s War, the world is still in chaos, trying to claw its way towards some semblance of normality. That goal remains a distant dream. Nations war with each other for dwindling resources, increased power and for revenge. Cultures clash over ideals and the right to exist. Meanwhile, the Cults of Darkness, long thought destroyed, slowly drag the world ever closer to the Abyss. Vhraeden is a place of stark contrasts where there are no limits for those cunning or violent enough to make their own rules and carve their own destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vhraeden is in turmoil and each aspect of this setting presents its own unique challenges and rewards. From swords, sorcery and guns for hire, to espionage, criminal and military operations, the world of Vhraeden is dangerous and multi-faceted. Characters are forces of order; professional spies, mercenaries, soldiers or police officers expected to keep the forces of chaos from spilling over into their nation. It is their job to keep their country and their people safe against those who would do it harm. Those enemies run the gamut from warlords to cultists. Do you have the strength to save yourself, much less your people?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This a complex and dark world where billions of sentient beings live and interact with each other as well as gods, devils and other unique beings. Within this milieu, conflict is inevitable. There is violence inherent in a world with over three billion beings spread over scores of nations, tens of races, hundreds of cultures and countless loyalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
