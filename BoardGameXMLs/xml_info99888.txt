			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;In this exciting new board game, you are allowed to be both greedy and cunning! Outwit your pirate friends, find hidden treasures, and sail around the unpredictable seas of Neverland with Captain Hook, Smee and the rest of the crew of the Jolly Roger. But beware of other pirates, and ticking crocodiles! There can only be one winner, so make sure it is you!&lt;br/&gt;Youngest player starts and game goes clockwise. Players goal is to collect as much treasure as possible by the end of the game. Players travel on the game board from place to place using action cards and collecting tokens which can be saved as treasure, but also can be used as actions as well. For example 2 diamonds can be used to cut through the wall to the other side of the island.&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when one player reaches the high peak of the island. Then the score tokens are scored and the one with the most is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
