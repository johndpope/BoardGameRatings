			<description>An easy to learn set of rules for 18th century Warfare. Tactical, Campaign or Siege sections can be used together or separately. Refight battles from Marlborough to George Washington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tactical rules use simple but in-depth mechanics to portray the fighting styles of the period. They're so easy to remember that many of us haven't consulted the rules in tears, but just get by on the quick reference sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elegant campaign system is designed to keep book-keeping chores to a minimum while allowing platers to exercise grand strategy. Smooth transition from map to tabletop eliminates the friction that kills most campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the siege system presents you with the challenges that the great Vauban once put before engineers and generals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warfare in the Age of Reason has:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Complete and tactical, campaign and siege rules.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Army lists for the Wars of Frederick the Great, the Marlburian Wars, the Great Northern War, the French and Indian War, the Jacobite Rebellions, Clive's Conquest of India, and the American Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; 102 tactical maps.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; A campaigning map of Europe, India, and the American Colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(source: Emperor's press website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
