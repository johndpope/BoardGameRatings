							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gelini Nightlife</name>
									
			<description>It's Saturday evening and lots of guests are waiting outside the discotheques to be let in.  As the host of their clubs the players are trying to control entry and to get as many guests as possible onto their dance floors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player furthest back rolls the die, and either accepts the roll or passes it, allowing the player next furthest back to use the roll, and so forth.  When a player does use the roll, they move forward, and collect the dancer or special tile on the space.  The player who fills his or her dance floor first wins; if someone reaches the final tile without anyone filling their dance floor, the player with the most space filled wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gelini Nightlife is reminiscent of Tutankhamen, except in utilizing a die roll for movement instead of allowing players to move as many spaces as desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
