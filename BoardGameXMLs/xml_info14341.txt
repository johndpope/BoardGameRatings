							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spazm</name>
									
			<description>In Spazm, magnetics, strategy, skill and chance are combined with the theories of poker, rummy, solitaire, pool, and pick-up sticks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the Spaz-Wand, a glass stick with a magnet on the end, to pick up a chip without moving any other chips.  There are seven different colors and the darker colors are worth progressively more.  The gold and silver chips are wild and are worth large amounts of points.  Bonus points are awarded for having sets of all seven colors and for having a flush, or a set amount of a particular color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations include hidden hands, partners, continuous draw, solitaire, and bundling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 72 chips in a pouch, 4 Spaz-Wands, 1 playing case, full color score sheets, 1 score pad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
