			<description>And Away is a Tabletop Novel, a solitaire card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the story of The Wanderer, who is stuck on a desert planet learning Kung-Fu from various teachers, some of which are not human, some of which are very much just a skull, or maybe even a cactus.  Above the desert is a green verdant moon called Paradise.  The Wanderer is learning Kung-Fu in hopes to somehow defy the impossible and reach this moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the desert player&amp;rsquo;s will find familiarities to the world of Spell Saga.  As if the same world had two reflections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of And Away: ~ Tabletop Novel~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a card game for anyone to play alone.  It contains magical items, mysterious places, and dangerous battles. Your hero will have to grow in order to reach the goal of the game, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry, the hero will grow as the world around them is explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is also a story. The major plot of And Away is always the same, but what you do during the game and if you survive is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played an endless amount of times, without ever experiencing the same game twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And Away consists of one 41 card deck, which represents the first act of the story. Players will start with all the cards FaceDown in a pile, and two marked &amp;ldquo;starting cards&amp;rdquo; flipped FaceUp in a second pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progression through the game occurs by Flipping FaceDown cards and either Acknowledging (bringing them to the FaceUp pile) or Ignoring (Cycling them back under the FaceDown pile) based on the game state until each card in the Deck is FaceUp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
