							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crazy Cat Fanciers</name>
									
			<description>A game for two to four pet aficionados.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: - End the game with cats. Lots of cats. Cats that match your personal quirks (youʼre not crazy &amp;mdash; just different) are especially nice to have. Donʼt let the feral cat population get to high or youʼll attract the attention of the ASPCA, and you donʼt want that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need:&lt;br/&gt;A six-sided die. One die per player is good.&lt;br/&gt;A City deck - this where the cats come from (available on the game's website)&lt;br/&gt;A Thumb-Servants deck - This is where food-bringing servants with opposable thumbs find gifts to bring as offerings to their feline masters (available on the game's website)&lt;br/&gt;Cat Fancier cards - These cards describe the cat fancier youʼre playing in the game(available on the game's website)&lt;br/&gt;Crazy cards - These you what kind of crazy you are. You may have a thing for psycho kitties, lazy fuzzlewumps, or whatever.(available on the game's website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn begins by determining turn order &amp;mdash; the player with the fewest cats goes first in each phase. The players then check to see how hungry the cats are (cats can either be sated, hungry, or famished). Cards from the City deck are then dealt out to the middle of the table. Each player, starting with the first player, then has the opportunity to feed cats, including cats on the table, cats in the Wild that were allowed to go feral in previous turns, cats that are in their household, or other people's cats (which gives them the opportunity to steal those cats). Each player then draws from the Thumb-Servants deck, drawing and keeping cards based on each player's Cat Fancier card. Then the players check to see which cats are hungry, deciding whether to call the ASPCA to pick up the hungry cats (which also may cause the player to lose other cats) or allow the cats to go feral, placing them in the Wild on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one or more players has 10 or more cats or if the City deck runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are then scored based on the number of cats each player has and any bonuses they may have received from Crazy Cat cards and Cat Fancier cards. However, if the City deck runs out, the ASPCA may come and get everyone's cats - if this happens, everyone loses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
