							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkest Night: On Shifting Winds</name>
									
			<description>The wind is from the north today, carrying a foul stench.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used to think of necromancy as a black fog, thickening and spreading, covering us in oppressive gloom. I see, now, that this was wrong: A fog is made all of the same stuff, but our doom has many distinct facets, each one we penetrate revealing a new evil behind. Some have become terrified of the darkness; others made numb by despair. Many have had their bodies rent, while others are starting to lose their minds. A scout has just sent word of another new variety of monstrosity that has appeared near the village...but also the discovery of a new artifact that may help us fight them.&lt;br/&gt; Fate, it seems, never runs out of ideas. We can only handle each new challenge as best we can as it arrives on shifting winds...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkest Night: On Shifting Winds from Jeremy Lennert expands the game with a variety of new content: It adds the Ranger, Scout, Wayfarer, and Wind Dancer as new playable heroes, introduces eight new blights and new treasures to search for, and also includes new Event and Artifact cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Shifting Winds can be used either with or without the first expansion, With an Inner Light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This game requires that you (or someone in your group of players) own a copy of Darkest Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 4.5 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- One full color 8-page Rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;- Four standing character tokens (minor assembly required)&lt;br/&gt;- Four hero sheets&lt;br/&gt;- 40 Power cards (10 per hero)&lt;br/&gt;- 10 Artifact cards&lt;br/&gt;- 10 Event cards&lt;br/&gt;- 15 map cards&lt;br/&gt;- 22 1&amp;quot; square blight counters&lt;br/&gt;- Eight multi-shaped item counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
