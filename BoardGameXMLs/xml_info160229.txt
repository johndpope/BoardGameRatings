							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sboura Destinations</name>
									
			<description>The name &amp;quot;Sboura&amp;quot; comes from the Greek word for &amp;quot;a spinning top&amp;quot; and included in the game is a numbered spiiner that's used to determine which cards are picked from a deck of destination cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will enjoy hours of educational fun testing their knowledge and counting skills by answering the many questions asked on the game cards while collecting, paying out and trading Sboura points for each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is, of course, a hitch! Within the card desk, there are 16 cards that contain NO questions. These cards have some strange characters that will give instructions that MUST BE FOLLOWED, some will help you, others will definitely not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is basically a trivia game. At the start of the game you start with 544 dollars (yes, 544) you then put 100 dollars in the pot. The first player rolls the dreidel (yup, it's a dreidel with numbers on it). The spinner then gets asked 3 questions, each one harder than the last. For each one they get right, they get money out of the pot corresponding to the amount shown on the card for the question. If they get it wrong, they pay the amount shown on the card to the pot. When the pot is empty, the game is over. The most dollars at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
