							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Test of Honour: The Samurai Miniatures Game â€“ Ronin</name>
									
			<description>The masterless samurai known as &amp;lsquo;ronin&amp;rsquo; roam the land as mercenaries and highwaymen. The warband of Tadashi &amp;lsquo;the Dishonoured&amp;rsquo; has a reputation for using bribes, dirty tricks and even poison to massacre its enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ronin have often been presented as noble figures, forced to make impossible choices while seeking revenge for the death of a beloved master. As such this set contains a range of Infamy skills which take your samurai far away from what was considered honourable behaviour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, just as often they ended up as mercenaries, thieves and thugs, abandoning their code for the sake of survival &amp;ndash; so we&amp;rsquo;ve included Recruitment cards to use these models as commoner Ronin if you wish, giving you basic troops with a slightly different stat line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 unique cards - including Hidden Attacker and Dangerous Reputation&lt;br/&gt;    1 metal character model - Tadashi &amp;lsquo;the Dishonoured&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;    5 plastic figures&lt;br/&gt;    5 metal 'scruffy' heads&lt;br/&gt;    2 mulltibases&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
