			<description>Chrome is a first-person shooter video game by Techland, released in 2003 by the publisher Strategy First. A prequel, Chrome: SpecForce, was released in 2005. In March 2006, Techland announced a sequel, which will feature the latest version of the Chrome Engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of Logan, a veteran mercenary turned bounty hunter who is out to become rich. Chrome features six controllable vehicles, including bipods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features many weapons, and a system of augmentation to improve your character (speed, targeting, etc) called Implants. Implants get stronger as the player progresses through the game. New implants are received when missions are completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's scripting engine is written entirely in Java. The Java source code is freely available and can be extracted from the code pack shipped with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was later repackaged as Advanced Battlegrounds: The Future of Combat. Some changes were made, mostly fixing instability issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chrome (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
