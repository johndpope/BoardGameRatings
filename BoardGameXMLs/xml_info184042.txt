			<description>Res Publica: 2230AD is expanded through the New Horizons. 5 new planets with different missions in order to increase the replay-ability of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stradus II: An earth-like planet with an unusually large axial tilt causing extreme seasonal changes. Both the northern and southern hemispheres experience harsh winters, with cold nights that can last for weeks or months at a time depending on latitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loorte: A habitable planet with a pleasant climate, homeworld of the Loort species. The Loorts are a friendly species with a simple agrarian society and limited scientific knowledge. While they are not capable of spaceflight (and seem to have no interest in leaving their world) they nevertheless interact with other species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khone: A large terrestrial planet with high gravity. The curious thing about this planet is that life has evolved on a miniature scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cenai: An extremely hot planet with high levels of CO2, sulphur dioxide, and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. The planet was probably once like earth, but runaway global warming has turned it into a barren wasteland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alura Prime: An earth-like planet with a breathable atmosphere. One large continent stretches from the north pole to the south pole, dividing the planet's large ocean in two. The super-continent is home to a species of intelligent but primitive frog-like creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
