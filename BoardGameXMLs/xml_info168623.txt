			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MYSTERY WOMAN OF THE JUNGLE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is unknown if she is a sorceress or a nature spirit, but Fantomah's name is spoken in hushed whispers... and she is feared by all save those who are insane or ignorant of her power. Those who do evil within her jungle domain suffer terrible fates....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Three Lives of Fantomah: Book Two continues NUELOW Games' trilogy relating the varied existence of Fantomah. In addition to the classic comics (by Richard Case and &amp;quot;W.B. Hovious,&amp;quot; a house-name covering a number of anonymous artists and writers), the book features new OGL Modern d20 spellcasting rules built using the feats and talent tree system and game adaptations of magical items featured in the comics. D20 game statistics are also provided for Fantomah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Fantomah first appeared in the pages of Jungle Comics #2 (Fiction House, 1940), she was nature's wrath personified. If those who did evil in the jungle she called home failed to change their ways, they were subjected to her magically delivered poetic justice. After the departure of creator Fletcher Hanks, the series was toned down and steps were taken to bring it more in line with conventional &amp;quot;jungle girl&amp;quot; series like Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. This would turn out to be the shortest period in the character's history, as further changes would come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
