			<description>World in Flames is Matrix Games&amp;rsquo; computer version of Australian Design Group&amp;rsquo;s classic board game. Covering both the European and Pacific Theaters of Operations during World War II, World in Flames is global in scope while simulating each branch of service in detail. Land units are corps and army level, supplemented with specialized divisions. Naval units include individual counters for every carrier, battleship, cruiser, and light cruiser in the war. Air units represent groups of 250 to 500 airplanes displayed on screen using 1000+ unique bitmapped images. With 6000+ unique units, 250+ countries, and a global map of 70,200 hexes, World in Flames is the premier World War II grand strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 11 scenarios from World in Flames Final Edition are included and they range from the small 5 turn Barbarossa offensive in Russia and the 5 turn Guadalcanal battle in the Pacific, through to the 36 turn Global War campaign which spans all of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. You can play either the Axis or the Allied side or take the role of one of the 8 major powers. Besides solitaire against yourself and head-to-head, you can play over the Internet. The last two modes of play permit team play with up to 6 players (3 per side).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the full set of rules from World in Flames, Final Edition, there are 80 optional rules. Under the optional rules section you can choose to include the World in Flames expansion modules: Ships in Flames, Planes in Flames, Carrier Planes in Flames, Cruisers in Flames, Convoys in Flames, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simulation models national production from conveying raw resources over rail and sea lines to factories for the manufacturing infantry, armor, naval, and air combat units. Because oil was so important during World War II, there are separate optional rules for synthetic oil plants and deployment of oil reserves to the front lines. Game units are represented in both armies and corps, aircraft carriers, naval task forces, and the air groups that took part. Everything you need to re-fight the greatest conflict in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to six players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations. What forces to produce, where to commit them, when and how? No two games of World in Flames play the same, no strategy is foolproof, any decision may have unforeseen, long-term consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to change the world then World in Flames is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: This title does not include an AI player in the initial release.  It is designed as a computerized, automated and online multiplayer-capable World in Flames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher / Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
