							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Popeye Spinach Flip</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple dexterity game.  It comes with a metal &amp;quot;catapult&amp;quot;, 4 green balls, a folding stand up target with target holes of different values, and an insert that has landing holes of different values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before play the target back board must be assembled by fitting it across the game box bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Play: Players take turns in firing spinach at the target.  A shot which goes through any of the target holes marked 100, 200, or 300 collects that number of points.  If it should go through one of these holes and rolls down to a 25, 50, or 75 point area, player also gets those points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A shot that does not go through, or land in any hole does not count.  Play continues with each player taking 4 shots per turn.  The first player to collect 1000 points is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
