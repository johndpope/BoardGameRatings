							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dark Elf</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides you with a new race your players may select to use while creating characters in your games. Aside from the base racial Traits, within each product in this series you will find some Racial Edges, possibly some related Hindrances, new gear, and other materials of relevance to the new player race. In this particular product Misfit Studios gives you the dark elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this offering you&amp;rsquo;ll find the dark elves, evil opposites to their surface-dwelling relations. Forced to flee underground in ages past, dark elves have become foul and dark, both in flesh and spirit, as they forged out new kingdoms in the deep darkness where they could offer up worship to their demon-gods. As a new player race, you may opt to become one of these dark elves, although exiled to live apart from your own kind but never accepted by other peoples due to the stigma of your kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
