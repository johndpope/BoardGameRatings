			<description>&amp;quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine (真・女神転生IMAGINE), formerly Megami Tensei Online Imagine (女神転生ONLINE IMAGINE), is a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game based in the Megami Tensei universe. Aeria Games acquired the rights to the game from Cave Co., Ltd. ( contracted as simply &amp;quot;MegaTen&amp;quot;.) Shin Megami Tensei is a major intellectual property of the Japanese developer and publisher, Atlus Co., Ltd. The first of many titles in the franchise was released by Atlus in 1992 for the Japanese Super NES and has grown a large and loyal following around the world with additional game titles for consumer consoles and handheld systems. The latest installment brings the brand online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally released in Japan in 2007, Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine Online was Cave&amp;rsquo;s first massive multiplayer online (MMO) title for PC. It features demon summoning and other gameplay features from the previous games. The game requires no subscription fee but charges for specific in-game items which are sold for real currency. On September 9 2008 it was announced that Aeria Games &amp;amp; Entertainment had licensed the game for North American and European Release. Beta invitations were first sent out on December 1, 2008, and the closed beta began the same day. Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine's open beta was started as of December 30. The official game is now available for download.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Imagine,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
