			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New ideas are fun. Through the Ooh, Shiny! series, Interjection Games seeks to add new and interesting ideas without the need for heinous amounts of flavor text and the resulting bloat in price. With five supplements and over one hundred magical items spanning such basic concepts as from twang to clang and from whistle to magic missile, there is, most assuredly, something for pretty much anyone in Ooh, Shiny!*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of Ooh, Shiny! contains four items from previous supplements. Take a look today and see what you've been missing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Detonator - heavy crossbow, originally from Ooh, Shiny!: Long Arm of the Elf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everready Gloves - gloves, originally from Ooh, Shiny!: The Clothes Make the Man&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illusionist's Slicer - shortsword, originally from Ooh, Shiny!: 20 More Unique Weapons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swine Skewerer - longspear, originally from Ooh, Shiny!: 20 Unique Weapons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ooh, Shiny &amp;ndash; A Few of My Favorite Things is an OGL licensed supplement for 3rd edition D&amp;amp;D and is compatible with both 3.5 and The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Characters taking a feat that disallows the acquisition of wealth may very well be disappointed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
