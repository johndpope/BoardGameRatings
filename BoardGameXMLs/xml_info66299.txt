							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Hickory, Dickory, Dock</name>
									
			<description>Information from gamearchives.org:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a piece and begins the game either on the &amp;quot;Start Here&amp;quot; space or the &amp;quot;Or Here&amp;quot; space. Players take turns spinning the indicator and moving up as many places as the indicator shows. Players play in turn trying to reach the UPPER SPACE first. A player must reach the UPPER SPACE by exact count in order to win. &amp;quot;When the clock strikes 1&amp;quot; that is to say, when a player spins a 1, instead of moving forward  one space his piece is immediately dropped to one of the spaces marked &amp;quot;Start Here&amp;quot; and the players piece is obliged to climb again. The only time a 1 does not cause a piece to return to the start space is if the piece is 1 spot away from winning and a 1 would be required to win the game. Then the 1 spin does indeed win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
