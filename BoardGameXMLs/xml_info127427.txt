			<description>Statistical boxing game especially designed for the Finals at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. The designer felt that there was a need for a quick version of his Championship Boxing game. It plays the same but has less detail. Each boxer is rated in various skills with dice and charts deciding the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
