			<description>The aim of the game is to become the wealthiest player by collecting as many goods as possible from the other five ports using vehicles and then to exchange the goods collected for payment.  The faster you can get round the board - within the speed limits - the more money you can earn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of goods, general goods (all one color) and dangerous goods (white with a colored cap).  A player can only collect one item of goods per port visit and vehicles have capacity limits.  Both types of goods cannot be carried at the same time.  Dangerous goods also require a dangerous goods license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game the wealthiest player is determined by adding each player's total assets, including goods (at market value), vans and lorries (at value less finance costs), licenses, passes and contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
