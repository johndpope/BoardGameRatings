			<description>Cadwallon: City of Thieves is a faithful adaptation for iPad of the board game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recapture the sensations of the original board game in glorious 3D and take the game with you wherever you go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the four members of your gang of thieves within the dangerous city of Cadwallon and get rich or die trying. Outpace your rivals to open the treasure chests or simply defeat an opponent to steal what he is carrying. Each character has 3 abilities and one unique skill, so you will have to adopt the right strategy and trust the luck of the dice, if you are to bring as much treasure as possible back to the thieves&amp;rsquo; den.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the City of Thieves, dirty tricks are the order of the day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful though, as two militiamen have been assigned to maintain law and order and they move about the board, interfering with your Machiavellian plans&amp;hellip; Woe betide any thief caught inside the militia&amp;rsquo;s cordon at the end of the game. This iPad version takes you on a 3D adventure deep inside Cadwallon; an adventure you can take with you wherever you go, to play against friends or fellow travellers. The intuitive gameplay of a City of Thieves allows beginners to quickly understand the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
