							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes &amp; Aliens</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the saga of Babylon 5 developed over the years so its crew and passengers grew, gaining in skill and cunning, as their heroic deeds and clandestine plots unravelled in the deeps of space. Heroes &amp;amp; Aliens presents each of the major (and some of the minor) characters in the series, giving a complete list of their statistics, fully updated for Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game 2nd Edition, and showing how they developed over the years. With this book you can include any character from the series from any period in your own games. Sheridan, G'Kar, Londo and all the major characters are detailed, along with Morden, Byron and even the crew of the Excalibur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with a comprehensive list of characters, Heroes &amp;amp; Aliens also includes complete details for two updated prestige classes: the Master of Subtlety and the Xenobiologist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, details of fifteen races are presented, from the Cascor to the Zanderians, giving players a huge choice when creating their Babylon 5 characters. Some of these races, like the Gaim and the Llort are can be regularly seen wandering the corridors of Babylon 5 whilst others, like the Hurr and Dilgar, are very rare indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes &amp;amp; Aliens is intended for Players and Game Masters alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
