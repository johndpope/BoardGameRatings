			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Fate Makes No Promises is an adventure for the On Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Service setting designed to be run by a moderately experienced Games Master (GM) in order to introduce players who are both new to role-playing and / or new to the LowDie System roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play duration is variable but should be between 3 and 4 hours depending upon how the players decide to tackle the challenges presented.  This adventure can be run as a demonstration game at conventions and other events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This is a cinematic/action espionage scenario in which the protagonists attempt to locate and recover a missing high-level London Stock Exchange personality and in the process uncover a deeper plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
