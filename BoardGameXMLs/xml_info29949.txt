			<description>Action Ice Hockey by Pressman is a very simple dexterity game where each player has a stick and tries to score goals on a playing board that looks like a platter, shaped like an oval arena, with a circular wooden disk acting as a goaltender in front of a hole in the boards that is the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
