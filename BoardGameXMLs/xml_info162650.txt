			<description>The Devil's pot cooks! Never before have the 'wilden Kerle' had to make such quick and accurate passes. It's not easy to pass the ball to the right player, whenn they all storm the field at the same time. You must act quickly and still keep a cool head when the thick headed Michi appears. Whoever manages to play all his cards first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
