			<description>In this Co-operative futuristic board game for 2 or more, one player will take the role of Mission Control, and the others will take control of an Astronaut stranded on a derelict space station. need to use wits and cunning to interpret the instructions as they will not be delivered in order! Figure your way through the objectives before time runs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESCRIPTION: a 5&amp;times;5 Grid of tiles with stations and objects scattered randomly, some broken, comprise the game board. Individual instructions are provided by Mission Control to the Astronaut team, but shuffled before revealed. The Astronaut team must deduce what the correct interpretation of the instructions are. Too many mistakes, and time will run out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY: Asymmetrical/Co-operative. One player is Mission Control, feeding instructions to the rest of the players who act as a single team controlling the Astronaut meeple on the Board. Mission Control will have a list of objectives to complete, and may only be able to communicate to the Astronaut by use of command cards providing simple instructions to move East, West, North, or South, or to Collect or Drop objects. Each round a card will tell Mission control how many of these cards to give to the Astronauts, but they are randomized before they are turned over. Work co-operatively, but without speaking, to figure out the solution within the allotted number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
