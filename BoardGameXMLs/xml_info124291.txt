							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Embrace of the Zombie</name>
									
			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kincaid Larean, the president of ZeitGeist Motion Pictures, owes a lot of money to the kind of people you don&amp;rsquo;t want to owe a little money to, and he&amp;rsquo;s skipping town before they come to collect. It has been several years since the director, cameraman, and president of the company has bankrolled a hit. This has led him to take loans from the National Crime Syndicate at outrageous interest rates and deadly penalties for late payment. Kincaid is late on his payment. He&amp;rsquo;s very late. And he&amp;rsquo;s very scared of the penalty. At this point he fears for his life, with good reason, and he&amp;rsquo;s skipping town while the skipping is good. He&amp;rsquo;s called in every favor he could, and he was able to hire an unknown writer, his best prop man, an up and coming starlet who didn&amp;rsquo;t know better, and an aging icon that does know better but yearns for another shot at stardom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kincaid has every penny he could beg, borrow, and steal wrapped up in this last ditch effort to get right with the National Crime Syndicate by making a film: Embrace of the Zombie. He&amp;rsquo;s decided to promote his film as a silver screen spectacle by taking his crew to film on location in Haiti, saving all the money that would normally be spent on sets, extras, and props. So far the filming on the action-love story-pulp-thriller is coming along better than expected. That&amp;rsquo;s all about to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a week of filming, Kincaid has taken his crew deep into the bowels of Sans Souci Palace, an exotic looking castle-like structure that has fallen into ruin. While scouting set locations for the climactic finale (the zombie attack scene), the prop master, Darby O&amp;rsquo;Hara, stumbled upon a section that had been hidden behind a large pile of rubble. Darby cleared the rubble and inside they found the perfect location: an old burial chamber with a large altar in the middle of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: This adventure was a 2007 Gen Con Demo; Lair of the Golden Death is Part II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
