			<description>From the game's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world has lost its color and its soul. People have gathered in cities, leaving the countryside little by little. Slowly, insidiously, people are losing their humanity. They commute, they work, they sleep; the townspeople settling for a life on autopilot, where cooperation, conversation and other simple things in life have completely disappeared. Little by little, they are losing certain feelings and certain emotions. It begins with joy and love, but once they are weakened, they also lose their most negative emotions, like anger or sadness. Eventually there will be the fateful day when indifference and apathy take over, when the emotionless townspeople reach a state known as the Coldness. Now that they have become mere automatons in the eyes of those around them, they are no more than soulless organic robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, children and adolescents, all worried about their parents, still hold hope. Equipped with magic lanterns, they have chosen to leave the cities to capture feelings and emotions and bring them back to save the adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kimochi no kory&amp;ocirc;shi is a &amp;ldquo;feel-good RPG&amp;rdquo; in the style of role playing games such as Ryuutama and Golden Sky Stories and mangas like Yotsuba-to, Azumanga Daioh and Mushishi. In this game, there is no fighting or violence. The goal for players is to take on the role of children whose emotions are still intact, and who will do everything in their power to capture feelings which manifest themselves as small firefly-like creatures, in order to heal the adults from the Coldness...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
