							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hope Prep #2: Halloween Ball (M&amp;M 3E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Halloween Ball, a night of costumes, dancing, dark arts&amp;mdash;wait, what? It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to stop the troublemakers before the dance is ruined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halloween Ball is a scenario in the HPS Freshman Year story arc. It may be played as a standalone, or it may be used with first-year characters who are already established in the Hope Preparatory School setting. A map of the dorm and a range of NPCs provide everything a gamemaster needs to run the scenario and experience a day in the life of a metahuman student.&lt;br/&gt;This scenario also provides background and game information on Sister Synestria&amp;rsquo;s Certified Soothsayers Society. This organization is devoted to providing the professional support necessary to distinguish between professionals highly talented in the fields of precognition and postcognition from mere charlatans. Their Certified Soothsayer Professional (CSP) certification program offers the gold standard recognized by governments and businesses worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The [Hope Prep School Freshman Handbook] provides additional details about the HPS setting used in this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
