							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lotus Turbo Challenge 2</name>
									
			<description>The second Lotus game shifted focus to arcade-oriented gameplay. Being the first of the series released for a game console (for Sega Mega Drive under the title Lotus Turbo Challenge), the fuel limit and difficulty levels were dropped, and the lap-based levels were replaced with course-based time trials, (not unlike arcade games such as Out Run), with the player required to complete each course within a specified time to qualify for the next one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the Esprit Turbo SE, Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 also featured the Lotus Elan SE, hence 'Esprit' being dropped from the title. There was no choice of car however; it varied depending on the scenery of the level (the hard-top Esprit was used for the snow and thunderstorm levels, for example, while the Elan SE appeared in the desert and forest levels).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an improvement over its predecessor, Lotus 2's single-player mode used all of the game screen instead of half, and opponent cars appeared in a variety of colors (opponent cars in the original game were all white). However, music was absent from racing altogether; the player instead hears the car's engine sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lotus 2 was developed for the Amiga and then converted for the other platforms. It was considered as a technically most impressing game in its own genre. The Mega Drive port lacked the smoothly running graphics of the original version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lotus (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
