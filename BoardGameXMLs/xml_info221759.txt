			<description>Antarctica is in anarchy. The pecking order of penguins is extinct. Who will waddle to power? Manage your cards to place your birds, split the ice, and gain control of the frozen land. May the best bird win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, players are trying to gain control of the most grids over two rounds. To do this, each player must manage their hand of six multi-use cards, playing only five cards per round. The multi-use cards have three options: place a dice/die to add numbers to the board, play a special power, or place an ice splitting card to divide the board into smaller areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you split up the board first and then play your dice after or play your dice first and split up the board later or do you mix it up? Meanwhile, power cards are influencing the icy landscape, current turns, and future strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of two rounds, players resolve each subdivided area and add the total number of squares won as their final score, higher score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
