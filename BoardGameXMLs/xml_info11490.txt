			<description>The object of the game is to get one playing piece on each of the eight movable tiles.&lt;br/&gt;The eight movable tiles are arranged in a square pattern in the playing box, leaving the center space open. Each player receives eight playing pieces of the same color which are arranged on the movable tiles in a symmetrical pattern. To play the game:&lt;br/&gt;In his/her turn a player can do one of two things:&lt;br/&gt;1. Move one of his/her playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;2. Move any one of the movable tiles.&lt;br/&gt;A playing piece can be moved forward, backward, left, or right to an adjacent vacant hole in a tile. Diagonal moves are not allowed. A playing piece may not jump over another playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;A tile can be moved by sliding it into the vacant space, vertically or horizontally. A player can move a tile regardless of whether he/she has a playing piece on that particular tile.&lt;br/&gt;The two players alternate turns moving one playing piece or one movable tile. The first player to succeed in getting one of his/her eight playing pieces on each of the eight tiles at the same time wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
