							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Olympiks</name>
									
			<description>Six Athletes are competing against each other.  Their goal - The Olympiks!  There are three levels of competition in which the athletes must participate: Amateur Level, Novice Level and then - The Olymp..      yikes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OK, now we have to change . . . because:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS GAME was shut down by court order in 1988 in a case of Olympics vs Rhema.  Seems we were too amateur and presumed that phonetics were not important in trademarks. It may well become a collectors item. It was a first run, and If I say so myself, needed a lot of work. Some great medals though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 YEARS LATER, we have come to full circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOW THAT SPORTS GAME, is our new name, and the game is a far superior game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the ATHLETE WITH THE highest number of points: as determined by the score sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money: 1 point for each 10,000 IMU to maximum of 5 points. Medals: Gold=3 points, Silver=2 points, Bronze=1 point. Athletic Award: maximum 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;Product Endorsment Cards: 2 points per card, maximum 6 points. Coach: 1 point  Sponsor: 1 point   Sports Event Cards: 1 point each to maximum 10 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goals of the game are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancing Levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regional to National:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win 2 Sports Event cards,  Get a Coach and have at least 1000 IMU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National to Global:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win 5 Sports Event cards, Get a Coach, a Sponsor and have at least 4000 IMU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have 7 points in medals, a Coach, a Sponsor and 2 Product Endorsement Cards and 50,000 IMU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since then, the game has been revised numerous times. It is now available as:   THAT SPORTS GAME&amp;reg;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thatsportsgame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.thatsportsgame.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get a new game, have a grrrreat time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
