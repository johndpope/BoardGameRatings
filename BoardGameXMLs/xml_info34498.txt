							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Siege</name>
									
			<description>From publisher's press release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the classic chess, Siege is played with a standard set of chess pieces, a circular 120-space Siege board, and new objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its debut at the 2008 Canadian Toy &amp;amp; Hobby Fair on January 26-28 in Toronto, Siege Games is poised to unleash this innovative new game on Canadian chess players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If you can play chess, you can play Siege&amp;quot;, says Frank Elstub, President of Siege Games. &amp;quot;Where chess represents two opposing armies facing off across a field of battle, Siege moves the conflict to the siege of a castle. The pieces move basically the same as in chess, so it's easy to get started, but there are more spaces and new perspectives, so standard chess strategies are out the window.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
