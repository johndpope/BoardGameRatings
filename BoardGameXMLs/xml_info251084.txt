			<description>Adventuring on the World of Mper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morgan and Paladin Marcus wake up one morning to find that thirty years have gone by. In that time an evil presence has taken over the throne and the church of Chaldisaya has fallen from its high position. Although they have no memories of the past thirty years they&amp;rsquo;re lives have continued. In that time Morgan has married and had two children (one of whom is married to Marcus).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set on the world of Mper, this item provides an adventure narrative (much like a session report), with game element presentation.  Most of the content is advertising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
