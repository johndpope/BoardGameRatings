							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Subtle is Their Song in the Throats of the Earth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A riddled plain. Intricate song carries over the lips of its sinkholes from settlements strung within, above the river clamouring in the depths. Slinkers shrink back. Discord grows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It presents core ideas and key numbers to fall back on, with general approaches that can be applied in other situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted plain as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including dwellers, eyries, a mineral-rich river, warrens and song distortion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The river could be detailed using Elaboration: Atmosphere &amp; Liquid, and the network including the warrens simplified or extended using one or more of the maps in the Location, Landscape &amp;amp; World bundle, not least The Livid Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
