							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Republic</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to Rome, circa 510BC. Following generations of tyrannical monarchy, the fledgling republic of Rome has become a political battleground for a few old and powerful families, each now vying for control and influence. As the city grows so do familial ambitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Change is inevitable and the Republic will soon fall, only to be replaced by an empire the likes of which the world has never seen... but a great empire needs an emperor of great conceit and wiles. With the rules, alliances, and strategies ever changing, it might not be who you think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Republic is a game of political intrigue and city building for three to six players. Although tile placement and economics are important considerations, the true focus of the game is on the politics. Each round, players are required to vote on laws that drastically alter the way the game is played, often affecting players in radically different ways. The winner of the game is usually the first player to collect a set amount of Imperium, a resource which can be earned through well-planned construction or lawmaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
