			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dance of the Damned is a storytelling game where the players tell the story of what happens in a castle as its inhabitants hide from a terrible plague that ravages the world outside. Will your character survive or fall to some decadent desire? Perhaps they will fall to corruption themselves. Maybe the&lt;br/&gt;plague will find a way into the castle and destroy everyone...&lt;br/&gt;To discover the fate of the inhabitants of the castle we use a deck of cards to adjudicate the action of the scenes and the outcome of the final days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires no Gamemaster and plays in around an hour or so, depending on how much detail you put into each scene. Each player tries to force cards from their hand onto the other players. The suits of the cards used define the way the scenes play out, and these scenes build the story of the castle. There is no real winner of the game, but a tenuous victory can be implied if one of the players manages to steer the events into a particular fate of their choosing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
