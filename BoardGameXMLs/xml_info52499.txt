							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enterprise: Role Play Game in Star Trek</name>
									
			<description>Enterprise - Role Play Game in Star Trek was a Japanese roleplaying game released in 1983 that, despite an impressive history of firsts, is not widely known in the western world. It was the first Japanese domestic RPG (note: RPGs in Japan are generally known as Table-Talk RPGs, or simply TRPG, to distinguish them from computer-based RPGs). It was Tsukuda Hobby's first entry into tabletop roleplaying games, alongside the wargames that they were already publishing. And as Enterprise was based on an official license from Paramount/Tohokushinsha for Star Trek, it was the first Japanese RPG based on a licensed property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wargames were already popular in Japan in the early 80s, published by Tsukuda, Bandai and other hobby publishers. Tsukuda had their &amp;quot;Hobby Simulation Game SF Series&amp;quot; which included 1982's Star Trek: The Invasion of Klingon Empire (HG-009), a strategic wargame similar to Task Force Games' Federation Space; two Star Wars games, Death Star (HG-005) and Hoth (HG-010); and various titles based on the Gundam and Xabungle anime universes. Enterprise would be the first of the series to be designated as a &amp;quot;role play game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like most Japanese publications and boxed games, the quality of the components of Enterprise was exceptional. It came packed in a brilliantly colored hard cardboard box (8.5&amp;quot; x 11.5&amp;quot; x 1.5&amp;quot;) featuring Kirk, Spock and McCoy on the front; and a black and white rear cover with a description of the game, pictures of some of the character cards and their stats, and a list of the game components, as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A 20-page Rulebook, almost entirely text with few illustrations and no other Star Trek photos&lt;br/&gt;- A 13-page Adventure book, including 4 pages of maps with a &amp;quot;blueprint&amp;quot; look to them&lt;br/&gt;- 15 double-sided Character Cards, coated for use with erasable markers or crayon; the front featured a photo of the player character, and the back listed their statistics and provided space for tracking hits, making notes and so on; cards were provided for Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, Sulu, Chekov, Chapel, Rand, Commander Kang the Klingon, Stonn the Vulcan, Subcommander Tal the Romulan and three blank cards for NPCs and original Player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;- Two twenty-sided D10 dice (red and white, numbered 0-9)&lt;br/&gt;- One 9mm D6&lt;br/&gt;- Mail-in return survey card&lt;br/&gt;- 4-page 1983 Tsukuda Simulation Game catalog detailing the SF Series, HG-001 through HG-016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MECHANIC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enterprise used its own one-off system: roll 2d10 under attribute for most task resolutions, as well as some percentile rolls. Each character has five basic attributes: Strength (1-18, which also acts as HP), Dexterity (3-18), IQ (10-18), Charisma (10-18) and Luck (3-18). Characters may also have Special Abilities (Mechanical Repair, Medical Talent, Science Talent, and a PSY (ESP) Talent with special powers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also have an Alignment -- Logical Good, Logical Bad, Neutral, Emotional Good, Emotional Bad -- that is cross-referenced with an opposing character's alignment to determine CH and IQ modifiers to opposed tasks. Hand-to-Hand combat is simply ST minus ST cross-referenced on a table to determine the % required to roll under.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for race, skills and custom character creation. The rules are structured in such a way as to support a &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; game that consists of using the pre-generated characters and their cards in the adventure included with the game. But it stresses that the real fun is when players create their own characters, and game masters create their own scenarios, and the rules provide plenty of guidelines for doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no rules for starships or starship combat, with adventures mostly limited to landing party type missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCENARIO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box set included a separate booklet, an 14 page adventure module entitled &amp;quot;Scenario No. 1&amp;quot;, the only official module released for (and included with) the game. The adventure is titled &amp;quot;The Drifting Ring&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Captain's Log, Stardate 3205.6, Record of Captain Kirk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are in pursuit of a spectacle beyond compare. The Enterprise discovered it while exploring within UFP territory near the Klingon border. It possessed a remarkable velocity that, in many ways, could not be believed. Spock judged that it must be an artificial satellite powered by some kind of technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the size! It did not seem conceivable to me that this was a ship, dozens of times larger than our own Enterprise. Once it was before our eyes, however, our suspicions were confirmed. Now this enormous torus with a diameter larger than 10km is before us. Bones calls it &amp;quot;The Drifting Ring&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, &amp;quot;The Ring&amp;quot; is hurtling toward Klingon territory. This is our pretext, and we have no way of knowing how they&amp;rsquo;ll react. We must investigate and stop the Ring. And we must do it as quickly as possible...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADDITIONAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were no releases of supplemental material for the Enterprise game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--from the translator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
