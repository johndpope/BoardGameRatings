			<description>At the beginning of each turn, a question-master is selected.  He/she choses a card from the deck.  On it are 4 categories: animal, vegetable, mineral, other.  The player on the right choses a number from 1-6 that will correspond to a word or phrase that will be in one of the categories above.  The category is revealed but the first player on the left has to ask questions that result in a yes or no answer whilst the sixty second timer is running.  If he/she gets the right answer then they win the card, if not then the next player on the left (and so on) can attempt to get the right answer until someone wins the cards.  Play continues for a previously agreed number of cards, with the question-master role being rotated, and the winner is the one who has won the most cards at the end.  Many of the answers can be quite obscure, such as: blade of grass, a monocle, a cindy doll...so it can be quite hard to gain the card within the first sixty seconds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
