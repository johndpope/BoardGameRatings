			<description>The game board is a map with hiking routes of Jotunheimen, a mountainous area in Norway. 2-6 players roll for a start position and begin the hiking race for the mount &amp;quot;Galdh&amp;oslash;piggen&amp;quot;, the highest mountain in Norway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The die is six-sided, but instead of the normal, it has the values 1V, 2H, 3V, 4H, T and U. These are abbreviations for 1 Left, 2 Right, 3 Left, 4 Right, Fog and Stormy weather.&lt;br/&gt;The players move the number on the die, and when comming to crossroads they must go either left or right depending on the die. If they roll T they must pass a turn, and when U is rolled, they must immediately move to the nearest tourist cabin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player lands on a spot with a number, an event occurs for that player, like &amp;quot;At H&amp;aelig;ran&amp;aring;se: You've got blisters. Pass one turn&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Over Friken: You are in good shape, Get another roll&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publisher Damm's game No. 208.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
