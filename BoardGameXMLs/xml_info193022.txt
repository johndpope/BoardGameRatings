							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doom: Semper Fidelis</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game presents a table-top adaptation of ID Software's computer game series DOOM.  Characters have three Traits (Health, Time Left, and Bodycount - sort of like hit points) that begin with values distributed from a point pool.  Characters also select a Stance, which determines what their goal is during the game.  The rules also present a Morale system for characters which may force them to alter their Stance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game characters attempt to gather Keys so they may descend to another level to complete their mission.  Humorously, the game includes the infamous &amp;quot;cheat code&amp;quot; from the video game, allowing characters to say the word &amp;quot;idkfa&amp;quot; to gain all the Keys for the current level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
