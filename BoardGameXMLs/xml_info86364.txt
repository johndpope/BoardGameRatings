			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greenbaum&amp;rsquo;s Prison: A Trip to Hell is an adventure for four to six characters of levels 9 - 10. An expert party should consist of at least 36 combined levels; parties consisting of players with less experience should consist of at least 45 combined levels. The module is designed within a generic setting and is implantable in any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mrs. Lea Frybur packed her cart and hurried a day&amp;rsquo;s travel to the baron&amp;rsquo;s land to plea for help in relocating the two boys. After a previously dispatched party vanishes and devils begin to steal away the villagers, the baron taps into his vast network in search of an able group of heroes. The PCs are introduced to the opportunity by a mutual friend and, after speaking with the anxious baron, they venture to Burge&amp;rsquo;s Burrow and find the entire thorpe empty of its villagers and overrun by the fiendish servants of hell. After battling their way to Frybur Farms, the PCs come upon the shattered stone seal and a portal at the bottom of the water well. Knowing that the children somehow pierced this extradimensional veil, the PCs continue the adventure by blindly jumping into a window to hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs enter the prison of Greenbaum, a bone devil imprisoned long ago by a duke of the first layer of hell. The tower is comprised of seven levels and its domed top still houses the bone devil himself, although the lower levels have been transformed from a general prison into a Soul Bank, a vile facility used for the cultivation and storage of soul energy. The PCs must scour the tower, destroy the evil and save as many poor souls as possible. Then, they must find a way to close the portal. After all, there&amp;rsquo;s now a window open to the lands of men&lt;br/&gt;that may soon find the attention of the powers that keep Greenbaum at bay. Will the PCs be forced to sacrifice innocent lives for the greater good?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
