			<description>In the crazy cat-collecting game Here, Kitty, Kitty!, your neighborhood has a cat problem, the problem being that the cats don't all belong to YOU! Unfortunately you can't just grab them for yourself as everyone in the neighborhood wants to claim those adorable kitties. Outwit your fellow feline fiends as you lure cats onto your property, move cats into your house, and steal cats from your neighbors. All's fair in love and cat-collecting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player chooses a Property board, which contains three zones: the Yard, the Porch, and the House. At the end of the game, cats in the House are worth 5 points each, cats on the Porch are worth 3 points each, and cats in your Yard are worth 0 points. However, having cats in your Yard does have advantages for special scoring conditions, such as having the most cats of a single color or the most cats overall. All 40 cat miniatures are placed in the center of the table, and represent the Neighborhood. Each player is dealt 2 or 3 cards, depending on the number of players in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each player's turn, they perform two Actions: moving a cat, playing a card, or discarding cards. Cats can be moved 1 space for 1 Action, by picking up the cat and putting it in the next zone of the property. For example, a cat can be moved from the Neighborhood to the Yard for 1 Action, or from the Yard to the Porch or from the Porch to the Yard (and vice versa). Playing cards may allow a player to move multiple cats at once, to move cats multiple spaces, to steal cats from opponents, or to make opponents give up cats. A player may also choose to discard 1, 2, or 3 cards as an Action. Once both Actions have been taken, the player draws back up to a full hand, and play passes to the person to the left. If an Instant card (red border) is drawn, it is played immediately and affects the entire group. The player then draws a replacement card for the Instant card until a full hand is achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final round is triggered when a player draws the last card from the draw pile. From that point every player, including the player who drew the last card, has one final turn to maximize their score. Then, the cats are counted and a winner is lauded for their purr-procurement proficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
