			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfairy is a game where each player assumes the role of a peculiar fairy tale character who wants to be the hero of its own tale. Fight against popular fairy tales characters and win magical items that will get you stronger by stealing and annoying your opponents. At the start of the game every player gets a character and a characteristic that changes the way the player will have to play that match. You can play as a hysterical fairy, a faint-hearted knight or a headless mage. There are 400 different combinations to play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Unfairy each player receives 5 cristals that works as its attributes and are used as resources to, in alternate turns, activate their magical items, fight encounters, steal from its opponents and search for the objective encounter to fight it and win the game before your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
