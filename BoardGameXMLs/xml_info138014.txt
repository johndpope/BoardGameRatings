			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever wonder if your Sleep spell caught that last goblin but there was disagreement between you and a DM or player?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever experienced a stoppage in game play over an agonizing, time-consuming spell lookup in the Player's Handbook?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get clearer results and faster answers by using Spell Effect Patterns (SEPs). These are an exciting new way for DMs and spellcasting players to 'see the results&amp;quot; of the spells characters cast, and to lessen lookup time in reference books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scaled for use with miniatures, these handy printouts answer the questions of &amp;quot;Who/what does my Burning Hands spell affect?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;What's the area of my Fireball?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;How is my Detect Poison spell targetable?&amp;quot;, among others. And they do it quickly, and in the coolest visual way possible (barring holographic explosions!!!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Full-color, artistically-designed, and made for use with miniatures - cool!&lt;br/&gt;     Color-coded - each spell effect is outlined in a color which tells its school of magic - a handy mnemonic device.&lt;br/&gt;     Made to Scale -1 inch = 5 feet, the scale for almost all D&amp;amp;D; miniature campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;     Info-packed - Consult important spell information on the SEP while you use it!&lt;br/&gt;     Customizable - players can cut out the patterns to best utilize them during play&lt;br/&gt;     Durable - can be printed on cardstock and/or laminated for greater durability&lt;br/&gt;     Markable - If laminated, can be written on using dry- or wet-erase markers.&lt;br/&gt;     Spellbook Alternative - The patterns can be used as an alternative to a spellbook, and in most instances, referencing the Player's Handbook.&lt;br/&gt;     SEPs include patterns for different caster levels - for example, a Ray of Frost cast by a 1st level caster is 5 inches (25 feet range), whereas the same spell cast by a 2nd-3rd caster is 6 inches (range of 30 feet).&lt;br/&gt;     Each pattern has the full System Reference Document spell stat block and spell description included for your reference, and are in a block of text that can be cut and pasted to a 3?x5? card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
