							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baby Cruise</name>
									
			<description>Sun, sea, free drinks and slot machines! Welcome on board of the luxurious Baby Cruise! While your spouse is visiting the sun deck, you promise to take care of the kids...in the on-board casino with a cocktail in your hand. Generously you are giving free drinks to the other &amp;quot;responsible&amp;quot; parents &amp;mdash; yes, the cruise is all inclusive! &amp;mdash; but with every cocktail you offer, you increase their chances of triggering the jackpot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kids are bored quite fast and start messing up your plans. Baby Luck gives poker chips to another parent, the Shy Baby offers a cocktail to the most thirsty passenger, the Captain Baby passes one of your cocktails on to another parent, and the Police Baby can rat you out to your spouse if you had too many cocktails. All that chaos grants plenty of bluffing opportunities to snatch the jackpot for yourself. Make sure you'll win the jackpot before you get caught drunk behind a slot machine or you'll be in big trouble!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn in Baby Cruise, you take a card from the draw pile and show it to everybody. You must give the card to another player. Most cards show a baby, a cocktail, and a fruit symbol. Every baby has their own special rules, and they can mess up your plans (or the plans of the other players). As soon as you have received a set of three matching fruit symbols, you win the round, but you can also lose a round if you get caught drunk with too many cocktails in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards show a slot machine and a cocktail. These cards also have to be given to another player and it will give them an additional winning condition, but due to the cocktail they also increase the risk of getting caught drunk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play several rounds the winner of a round will receive golden milk bottles and the loser (if there is one) will lose a token. The parent who owns the most golden milk bottles when they run out wins the jackpot (and the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
