			<description>What's Damage Incorporated?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage Incorporated is a 3D action strategy game for Macintosh and Windows '95 in which you command a team of four marines while trying to keep yourself alive at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in present day, some unknown organization has been funding, arming, and training various militant fringe groups around the United States. It is your team's mission to uncover information on the sinister workings at hand, secure the safety of civilians caught in the crossfire, and neutralize with extreme prejudice whatever opposition comes your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed by Paranoid Productions, powered by Bungie's Marathon 2 engine, and published by WizardWorks (for Windows) and MacSoft (for Macintosh), Damage Incorporated presents a 3D action experience unlike any other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
