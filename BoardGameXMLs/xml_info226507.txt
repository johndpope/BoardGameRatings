			<description>The British are coming! With its usual professionalism, the British Army had prepared for war. Now, as the Soviet Army flooded across the border into West Germany, it was ready and waiting. Scorpion and Scimitar light tanks skirmished with the Soviet forward detachments as the Chieftain armoured regiments waited. The infantry held the towns and woods, forcing the enemy into killing zones. If anything broke through, the airmobile troops in their Lynx helicopters would hold them. The British Army is ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Maiden provides players with Army lists for the &amp;ldquo;Death or Glory Boys&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Chieftain Armoured Squadron, the Irish Guards&amp;rsquo; Mechanised Company, the Gordon Highlanders&amp;rsquo; Airmobile Company, and the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Dragoon Guards&amp;rsquo; Medium Recce Squadron, as well as history of the British Army of the Rhine, painting guides and scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
