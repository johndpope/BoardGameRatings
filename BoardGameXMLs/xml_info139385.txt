							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Encounter Critical: The True Scientific Edition</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Critical, the True Scientific Edition: The ultimate EC swag, a physical copy of the game that includes the entire original text and layout (printed from the clean digital masters), printed on cream stock and available in both softcover and hardcover. The cover is a full-color wraparound of the original obnoxious-orange &amp;quot;hero prop&amp;quot; scanned to create the PDF version (the hardcover has the same thing on a dust jacket, instead, with added map-flaps for a touch of cartographic class). The True Scientific Edition also features several pages of extras, including the armor table, character sheet, a design essay by S. John Ross, a guide to the anagrams hidden in the game, and even some (gasp) poetry. Perhaps best of all, there's a beautiful gallery of more cool Encounter Critical artwork by the original illustrators (Cody Reichenau, Dave Insel, and S. John) - outtakes that were drawn for the original game but that didn't squeeze in! Since you can't pry any staples from these books, each also includes single-page versions of the monster chart and map for easier reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This is the print version of the rules with additional content and artwork.  The hardcover version features a dustjacket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
