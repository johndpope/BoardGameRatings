			<description>Deeper Darkness is an asymmetrical esoteric horror board game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game pits the combined might of a highly trained division of troopers against Nithodeus the unclean as he stalks his prey through the labyrinthine passages of an ancient Himalayan temple. Frightened, and facing humanity&amp;rsquo;s darkest imagination manifest, the troopers will be tested to their limit, having to stave off madness as they are hunted by the diabolical Nithodeus and his sinister magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play experience is unique dependant on which side each player chooses. The troopers objective is to find and repair a generator. This will allow them to power a radio and call in an air strike to destroy the temple and the evil within it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Nithodeus and his army of vermin, the goal is to drive the troopers insane and feed on their madness to grow strong enough to destroy them outright. To do this he will use powerful spells to bend the game to his will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
