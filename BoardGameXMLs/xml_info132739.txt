							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Necropunks</name>
									
			<description>This expansion includes 3 Necropunks, which work as minions for the Resurrectionists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactics Wiki site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twisted little undead, Necropunks are used for their mobility and resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Necropunk is much more mobile than most Resurrectionist models. Though it only has a move of 4, it has the (0) Leap spell allowing it to move its charge distance of 7 for a zero action. In addition, it is an Arachnid, so it can get through terrain very easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Necropunks generally work out best for Strategies where a Master needs to get minions to multiple objectives quickly. Their leap ability for (0) means that you can move 7 inches and then still have two actions to interact with an objective, such as a dynamite counter. Its best to hold a the Mask you will need rather than depending on it to come up in the turn you need it, if you can afford to do so. Note that because leap is their only 0 action, you might as well try each turn and flip for it. Be careful however about getting your Necropunks spread out all over the place, as leap isn't going to go off on a flip all that often. The unpredictability of leap is the greatest frustration you will have with these models, making a lot of what looks good on paper about them not work out in actual practice. However even with a single model, the leap ability can be used very effectively in conjunction with Flurry, allowing them to hop in and gain three attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
