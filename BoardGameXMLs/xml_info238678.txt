			<description>Too Much is a team game where, in turn, a player called &amp;quot;Orator&amp;quot; will have to guess a word to the rest of his team. But beware: it is not allowed to say everything! The Orator must abide by the restrictions and decide together with the team as they have. The more you accumulate restrictions and the more points you will get, but it's just a mistake to lose everything. Can you stop at the right time or risk TOO MUCH?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
