							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">En-Ar-Co Automobile Tour</name>
									
			<description>Actually a spin and move game for from 1 to 4 players. The game En-Ar-Co Automobile Tour was developed by EN-AR-CO Brands of Scientific Refining and produced by the National Refining Company in 1919. Each player spins to see who will go first. Players then spin in rotation, each player taking one turn. You then move a number of circles equal to the number that you spun. If the dial of the spinner lands exactly on a line you take another turn. If more than one auto lands on a circle they both stay there. Some circles give players one or more extra spins while at some other points you must go back a certain number of circles. If a player lands on the last circle located at number 45 before entering the large final circle, he must spin a #1 in order to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See Also:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     En-Ar-Co Auto Game A similar 1925 game also issued by En-Ar-Co, with a different track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
