			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1990s. Explosion of 16bits Videogames era in the world.&lt;br/&gt;Time when the greatest dream of childhood was to be The Videogame Champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game Players are children in the early 1990s; dividing their attentions between getting some money from their parents, studying, buying game magazines, renting games, begging their parents for new games, and finally, playing as much as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take cards from a Action Grid, activating one of two effects corresponding to the position of the card(line or column). The cards obtained are used to assemble Poker style combinations in your hands, which are necessary to finish the games. The challenge of the game is to manage resources like money and study promisses to gain access to games, new releases and magazines, as well as the combination of Poker hands to play and finish the games. The goal of the game is to score as much as you can in a point salad system between finished games, most games played, most new releases checked and variable missions scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
