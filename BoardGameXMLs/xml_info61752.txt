							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classes of Legend: Priest of Celestial Spheres</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its own way, the cleric is perhaps the most iconic class to D20 fantasy gaming. It has far less of a basis in myth and fantasy fiction than the wizard or fighter; even the paladin or druid. More so than any other class, it owes its current place in the scheme of things not to the sources that inspired the game, but to the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 39-page PDF, written by Ari Marmell, presents a replacement for the standard cleric. The priest's spells and class abilities are heavily influenced by his selection of &amp;quot;spheres,&amp;quot; or areas of divine influence. Like domains, spheres are determined by the priest's choice of deity, ensuring that a priest's powers are firmly in line with his patron's interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF also features an assortment of new feats and over 30 spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
