			<description>Pecos Bill is a card game played with a slightly customized deck of cards, although it could be played with a standard deck too. However, special deck helps players to remember various things - e.g. which cards are valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game is very similar to Casino. Players try to capture cards from the board with their hand cards by a similar mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many ways to score points. E.g. when player manages to clear a table, he's awarded with a Pecos, which equals one point at the end of the round. Getting a Pecos Bill card and all four flags is worth 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over multiple rounds. At the end of each round, players receive points according to the cards they managed to get. The player who first reaches exactly 301 points is the winner. Going over is penalized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's no signs that the game is published outside Finland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
