			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;Endless Working is the English title of 今日も帰れない (Kyou mo Kaerenai), a card game released during the Tokyo Game Market 2016 Spring (ゲームマーケット2016春) in  Odaiba, Tokyo, Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the 4th game by the group MR Entertainment (MR エンターテイメント).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title can be translated to&amp;quot; 'Today I won't be coming back home either'. It is a name nicely fitting the context of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a fictional &amp;quot;black company&amp;quot; called CHI-KU. Each player is an employee at this company and has to work hard and do many hours of overtime work every day. The players are trusted 'slave workers' all affected to a new project called 'Endless Working'. They are expected to work super hard to make it a big success!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game got popular thanks to its theme, which is a real and well-known problem in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Endless working, the players take turn in drawing cards from the deck. There are 3 kinds of cards: TASK, STOP and END.&lt;br/&gt;The player who can collect the most TASK cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;You start by drawing as many cards as you want, one by one. When you stop drawing you have to carry out the action on the last card you drew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TASK cards are 'safe' but change the state of your hand.&lt;br/&gt;STOP causes your turn to end right away and is a penalty for you or all players.&lt;br/&gt;END cards either ends the whole game immediately, or forces the rest of the game players to draw more cards before they can chicken out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To put the players in the right atmosphere for the game, they recommend the players to say '進捗をすすめます！' (Let's make progress!) before drawing a new card and '帰ります！' (I'm going back home!) when they want to stop drawing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
