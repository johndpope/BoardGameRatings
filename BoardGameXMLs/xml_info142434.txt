							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apples to the basket</name>
									
			<description>It's a family game for 2-6 players with a strong memory component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete against each other by placing apples in a basket in such a way there are as many as possible from the same player altogether. The difficulty lies in that all apples have the same appearance and only at the end of the play when all apples are turned around (apples are marked on the back side) you can see if you have placed all your apples together. To make it more difficult there are some apples with special effects that can be used to obstruct other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
