			<description>14 Days is a 2-player simple resource and disaster management game with a roleplaying soul, in which two characters who suffer from migraines try to juggle work, relationships, hobbies, and self-care while navigating the spiky migraine minefield. At the start of your turn, you schedule your day on a board styled as a day-planner, placing discs on three tasks you hope to accomplish&amp;hellip; if migraines permit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Migraines in the game, just as in real life, range from troublesome to fully debilitating. In 14 Days, this requires you to remove discs from your schedule. &amp;quot;On a bad migraine day, this might look like skipping game night with your friends. On a debilitating migraine day, this could look like an entire day in bed&amp;mdash;or in the emergency room.&amp;quot; The player must choose when to tap the limited supply of medication, and when to let responsibilities get crushed under the heel of a migraine. Shirking responsibilities brings consequences, but 14 Days thrives on narrative: When your character suffers a migraine, the other player asks a question about how the migraine reshaped your day, such as, &amp;quot;What sort of 'home remedy' did someone recommend to you today?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the two weeks are up, each player gives an epilogue that explains the long-term negative effects of the migraines (or miraculous lack thereof) the character suffered, at least as the player imagines them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
