			<description>Sometimes your friends can be so annoying that you just want to hit them. Especially that guy on your left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a quick, brutal game by Chris DeLeo. Each turn, you make an attack against the player on your left. If they fail to defend, then they take the attack cards into their hand. The goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand after the draw pile has been exhausted. Being the first player to do so is nice, but being the second player to do so is just as good. The loser is the last player left holding cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is exclusively available in The Decktet Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
