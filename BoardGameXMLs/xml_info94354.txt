							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheat the Reaper</name>
									
			<description>From publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We all have to knock on Deaths door, but eventually he will catch you. In this game you and your opponents will attempt to CHEAT THE REAPER, and live to tell about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends will attempt to meet or exceed the current number in play until one of you cannot. That person must take their life in their hands and knock on Deaths door. Maybe he'll catch you, maybe he wont. You wont know until you draw your card from the REAPER DECK and find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THRILLS, CHILLS, AND STRATEGY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHEAT THE REAPER is about strategy, as much as it is about fun. Lowering the number lowers the number of cards your opponent has, but raising the number increases his hand size and ability to compete with you. Do you pass to the next person in line or skip them all together? Careful what you choose, because it may come back to haunt you...or claim your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO CHEAT THE REAPER?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The immediate goal is to reach or exceed the active number (starts at 0, adds numbers played on top, or subtracts negative numbers) and try to keep your neighbor from doing the same. Use &lt;br/&gt;action cards to avoid being caught unable meet the active number. If a player cannot meet or exceed the active number, they draw from the &amp;quot;Reaper Deck&amp;quot;, which could eliminate them from the game, or reset their hand. Once all but one player has been eliminated, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
