							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Electropy</name>
									
			<description>Electropy is a side scrolling action arcade title with a fundamental gameplay twist. Rather than directly moving your character, the idea is to grapple on to floating polygons in order to swing your way to the goal. The game features a wide selection of power-ups such as gravity change, invincibility, and flight thrusters to diversify gameplay. The title also includes over 125 levels of varying difficulty as well as the same fully functional editor we used to make all the levels in the game. Players are ranked via online scores that are uploaded through the game and can download replays of any submitted score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
