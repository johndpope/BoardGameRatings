			<description>The Eternity Game is a Biblical trivia game for players ages 12 and up.  Players answer questions in one of 5 different categories: Characters, Words, History, Geography, and Miscellaneous, and these questions are in 3 levels of difficulty: Easy, Harder, or Hardest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to be the first person to move their token across the board to reach the space indicating &amp;quot;Eternity with Jesus&amp;quot;.  A player simply answers a question taken from one of the hundreds of question cards corresponding to the color of the space their token is on.  The color of the space indicates the question's category and the number on the space indicates the difficulty level of the question.  If answered correctly, the player rolls the die and moves accordingly.  Should a player be unable to answer a question, the player on their next turn may attempt a lower level of question in the same category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played in teams.  There are also &amp;quot;Advanced Play&amp;quot; rules, in which the die is not used.  In this rule set, once a player answers a question correctly, the token is moved ahead on the board the same number of spaces as the level answered (1, 2, or 3), and the player retains her turn until an incorrect answer is given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
