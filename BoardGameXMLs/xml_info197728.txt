			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Scotland's Trivia Quiz Game. A Fun Game To Test Your Knowledge Of Scotland And The Scots.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're the Scots! can be played either by individuals competing against one another, or teams of players competing against one another. ... Play commences with the first questioner (the player on the immediate right of the starting player) drawing the first card from the end of the pack which displays the photo-image. The starting player is then asked the 6 questions on that card in sequence. The questions are graded by degree of perceived difficulty from 1 to 6. The points awarded for correct answers correspond to the number of the question, i.e. question one scores 1 point, question two scores 2 points, question three scores 3 points, etc. ...&lt;br/&gt;On all cards Question 4 (highlighted in yellow) relates to the illustration on the facing side. When it comes to this question, the questioner should read from the card, then hold up the illustration to provide the answering player with a clear view. ... Players should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to answer each question in their own time. Nevertheless, when an answer does not appear to be forthcoming, the questioner may introduce a time-limit using the one-minute timer provided in the game. A player who is unable to supply an answer within the period forfeits the points for that question....&lt;br/&gt;The winning player is the one achieving the highest score. (From the instructions)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
