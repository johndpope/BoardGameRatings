			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxphar the knight is on a quest to find the blue stone of Savanah, said to bring supreme happiness to whoever finds it. He's accompanied by Gal, a strange and malformed creature who calls itself the Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxphar is a graphical text adventure game. The scenario was developed after a theater play created by the French troup &amp;quot;la Compagnie de la Manicle&amp;quot;. As it is, a player can finish the game by following the actions depicted in the play, though there are other ways to succeed implemented in the game. The setting of the game is rather unique, blending fantasy with anachronistic objects and situations (it was described as &amp;quot;poetic and adult&amp;quot; by several reviewers). Gal the Game Master travel with the player and intervenes at several points of the story (often with sarcastic remarks). Gameplay-wise, the game uses a text interpreter for player input (the text parser can learn new words if you teach it a synonym), and a system of icons for managing the player's inventory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxphar was programmed by Philippe Taupin, with graphics by Michel Rho.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
