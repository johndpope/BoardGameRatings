							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sheriff</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shire-reeve, or more commonly, sheriff, is an officer of the nobility that acts in their stead. Within the noble&amp;rsquo;s lands, a sheriff is entrusted with the authority and responsibility to collect taxes, keep the peace, enforce the law, and punish lawbreakers. In lands farther from civilization or where other officers of the law are few, a sheriff is also empowered to raise a militia of the common folk to defend their lands and to pursue dangerous criminals. Despite technical boundaries to their authority, most sheriffs consider it their obligation to uphold the law and punish lawbreakers wherever they roam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Sheriff is a martial character entrusted with the good sense and honor to uphold the law in the dark times. They are capable on the front line, and have offer a range of combat options beyond straight onslaught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each sheriff selects one of five different precincts under which to operate. Each precinct grants a number of class abilities, a bank of bonus feats, additional skills, and a code conduct to adhere to in their duties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sheriff is the ultimate expression of law in a dangerous world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
