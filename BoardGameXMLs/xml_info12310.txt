							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Dominos</name>
									
			<description>Ages 6 and up.  2 to 6 players. To begin with, all the space dominoes are placed in the cotton bag and mixed up so that nobody can see them. The bag contains 39 pieces. If four players are playing, each player discreetly takes 9 pieces each and puts them behind his/her hidden cardboard plate so that none of the other players can see them. Each player plays when it is his or her turn. When the players can no longer put elements down, all the remaining points are worked out for every player.  After 10 games have been played, the one who has the most points wins the whole game. Fun educational game based on observation, sums, and the occupying of a 3-dimensional space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
