			<description>Legends of Rock is a game about acquiring as much Fame as possible before meeting your untimely and tragic demise. Rockers begin the game by creating an album in one of the 8 genres represented on the genre wheel. Throughout the game rockers will create new albums, go on tour, and create hit songs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends of Rock is primarily a set collection game with two resources: Music Tokens and Tour Chits. Turn order for selecting these resources can be manipulated throughout the game during the Free Time phase, where rockers can choose to become more Talented, practice their on-stage Diva skills, impress a better Producer, or hire a competent Managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Album sales rely on the genre track, only what is popular sells. Hit songs rely on the quality of the song and can score the most points but don't offer lasting success. Touring can score a lot of Fame if you have the Fan base that wants to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
