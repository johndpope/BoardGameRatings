							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magical Brickout</name>
									
			<description>Magical Brickout offers a new twist on the beloved classic Breakout formula. Instead of moving a small paddle back and forth across the screen you are able to rotate the bricks in a circular fashion as you frantically try to keep the ball in the play area. This fast-paced and addictive gameplay is only half of the fun. Combined with a fantasy theme and beautifully hand painted graphics, casual and hardcore gamers will be entertained for hours.&lt;br/&gt;The magical lands of Wondaria have long been a source of pride and beauty in the kingdom, thanks to the tireless efforts of the fairies that live there. Peace and prosperity existed for generations&amp;hellip;until now.&lt;br/&gt;In his quest for unending power, the Evil Wizard has captured all of the good fairies in the land and trapped them in bricks which he used to build up his wicked castle fortress. With the help of his foul minion and a host of diabolical cohorts, no one dares challenge his reign&amp;hellip;no one except YOU!&lt;br/&gt;Using an enchanted spherical orb, you must help free the fairies by breaking apart the Evil Wizard&amp;rsquo;s castle brick by brick. Only then will balance be brought back to the kingdom!&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;Liberate fairies in over 48 thrilling levels spread across 8 magical themes&lt;br/&gt;Acquire magical powers and avoid treacherous hazards&lt;br/&gt;Overcome unique challenges and boss levels&lt;br/&gt;Steamworks integration including achievements, leaderboards, cloud saves, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Gamepad support for popular controllers&lt;br/&gt;And much, much, more&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
