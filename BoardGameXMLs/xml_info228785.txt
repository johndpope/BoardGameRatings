			<description>No matter their race, origin or desires, everyone has the right to be a child. Be it a knight or a magician, when we lie down to sleep the unconscious thoughts seem to transcend all realities. It is up to us, which is the connection between desire and thought, and the best children to all as persons. There are so many dreams created that are not so much that they have nicknamed our house of Factory of Dreams!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of a mystical character such as Fairy, Unicorn, Gnome or Ente and build the dreams that citizens both crave in thoughts. Each character has a special ability that assists in their production and each citizen's card has a different dream to be built. During a match, it is necessary to send out items and emotions cards on the table according to what each citizen card is demanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How about joining that magnificent sword, a little courage, and giving the Warrior the glory of that very successful moment for him to kill the fearless Dragon ... in his dreams, of course! Can you be the best mystic in the game and be the employee of the month in the Factory of Dreams? Come and test your gifts, come and dream of us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME SETUP: Each player stands at one end of the table. Your position is important because it determines whether a Desire card is valid for you or not according to the arrows of the cards. All players choose a character. Shuffle the Wishes deck (6 types) and reveal 16 cards in the center of the table placing four cards per row creating a 4x4 square. Shuffle the deck of Dreams and deal 2 cards to each player. The Dream cards are the template from which the player must form the same configuration with the cards arranged on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY: F&amp;aacute;brica dos Sonhos is divided into turns and actions. Each player on his turn performs the following mandatory actions:&lt;br/&gt;World Change - You must remove a Wish Card from the table and place it in your hand, then replace that card with another one from the top of the Desire Deck or another one in your hand ( maximum of three cards in the hand). If you exceed the limit, before you pick up a new card, you must discard one of the cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;Intercept - Choose between moving Desires Cards on the table or buying a new Dream card. The movement of Desires is simple. The movement points you have are equal to the number of players +1 . You can swap two orthogonally adjacent cards, or two cards diagonally that are on the corners of the 4x4 diagram. You can still rotate a letter anywhere. Each change of position or rotation counts as a point of movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL: The objective of the players is to format the cards of the table according to the template of the cards of Dreams in their hands. The winner is the player who can achieve 3 dreams first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS:&lt;br/&gt;1 Rules Book&lt;br/&gt;4 Character Sheet&lt;br/&gt;20 Dreams Cards&lt;br/&gt;38 Desires Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
