			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most creatures that come to the attention of the Order are lone predators or members of a small pack or cult. They may be dangerous adversaries &amp;ndash; red in tooth and claw, or wielding foul sorceries &amp;ndash; but they tend to be isolated threats. They lack the co-ordination and resources guardian priests can bring to bear. Such enemies are dealt with swiftly and without mercy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, however, it has become apparent to the Masters of the Order that other forces are at work in the world. These are not just mindless monsters or heretical rabbles but organised and purposeful groups whose powers are not to be underestimated and whose goals are dark and fathomless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, the Order must respond. It must adapt and counter these new challenges, in order to see His Will done and Christendom protected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But can the truth be uncovered in time? And even then, can mortal man hope to stand against such ageless adversaries when, for so long, they have gone about their work undetected?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented within this book are details of some of the mysterious groups whose activities threaten not just Christendom but the world itself. Many of these organisations are centuries old, with schemes and ambitions set to play out in the years ahead. They can provide even experienced guardian priests with new and diverse challenges &amp;ndash; and move the events of a Deus Vult campaign far beyond the relative safety of northern Europe to the Holy Lands and beyond. For, just as the Order is increasingly aware of these shadowy groups, so they too are taking a greater interest in the warriors of the Mont St. Michel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These include Malik Dhukan, the exiled King of the Djinn; strange were-races of the Scions of Zeus; and mysterious eastern sorcerers from far Cathay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But fear not brothers and sisters, for ours is a divine calling and we shall not be alone. Strike out into the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
