			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skweek is an arcade-puzzle game, the first of a series. The Skweeks are little furry balls who lived happily on their pink planet until the evil Pitark came and repainted each of the 99 continents blue. Now Pitark is dead and a young Skweek has decided to celebrate by repainting the world in its original color. But Pitark's minions are still here, and each continent has its own hazards and dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a Skweek, the goal is to clear each of the 99 levels by painting each tile pink by walking on it. The Skweek can shoot bullets to destroy monsters (they respawn after a few seconds) and can pickup a number of power-ups like a stronger laser than can destroy walls, shoes to walk on ice, bonus items... Each level has its specific dangers to overcome and monster behavior can change between levels (there are levels where monsters can paint back tiles in blue, others in which they can build additional tiles over the water). Each level has a time limit. The player can earn extra lives by picking up Baby Skweeks or scoring points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other Loriciels action-puzzle games, the game levels can be played either sequentially or in random order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
