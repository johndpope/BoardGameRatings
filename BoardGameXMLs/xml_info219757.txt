			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 32 x 30 inch, Battlemap of a Post-Apocalyptic Outpost , it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;They kill anything that moves towards that base. Something tells me they are following their last orders to the letter. The radio signals are the most curious part. Why waste the power that should be conserved to keep the robots themselves going? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Post-Apocalyptic Survivor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Post-Apocalyptic Outpost is a single level exterior map of a base with walls made of rubber tires, steel drums, aluminum siding, and tin roofs attached to wooden pallets built on top of a high ground of crumbled buildings or natural rock with two guard towers and a signal tower inside the base. The base has a southern gate with a descending metal stairwell that can be pulled back up to act as a sort of drawbridge with the dirty water moat below and rebar stakes as defense jutting out from the low ground and under the water. At the bottom of the stairwell is a bridge of palettes that can be used as a pier for airboats on the dirty water or to travel south by land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Post-Apocalyptic Outpost is intended for use in modern post-apocalyptic games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Outpost: Stories in the swamplands tell of a military base in Florida that still stands. They raise The Stars and Stripes on a flagpole and send out radio signals calling for survivors to come to Dade City, Pasco County, Florida to Fort Dade for sanctuary in between very patriotic and military music being played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they get to Dade City, they find the place in ruins with dirty water flooding much of the area from the nearby swamp. There is a base here to the east near Florida State Route 301 where the expanding swamp has sunk most of the eastern part of Dade City. However, when they get close to the base, they witness robots inside wielding lasers at a distance with deadly precision against humans, zombies, mutants, and mutated creatures alike who approach the base. If any make it inside the base, the robots use giant whirling bone saws in close combat to decapitate perceived threats. Salvation doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely here, but radio signals and laser weapons means they have electricity in that base somewhere and those robot weapons could help them if they could incapacitate or kill the robots and scavenge them for parts&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
