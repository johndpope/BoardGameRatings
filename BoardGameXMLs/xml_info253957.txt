							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Minotaur</name>
									
			<description>Minotaurs&amp;rsquo; enormous strength, minimal intelligence and vicious, depraved mentality would appear to make them almost perfect Blood Bowl players. Fortunately for most other players however, few coaches allow Minotaurs in their team. This is mainly because of their disconcerting habit of going berserk before, during and after the match and attacking anyone or anything that gets in their way: friends, foes &amp;ndash; even the coach!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-part resin kit contains the components you need in order to assemble a Blood Bowl Minotaur. You can field him as a Big Guy for your Chaos, Chaos Dwarf, Chaos Chosen or Chaos Renegades team &amp;ndash; he definitely lives up to this, looking both pretty big and pretty chaotic. Densely packed with powerful muscle, the Minotaur is stomping forth with fury, challenging any opposing player to get in the way of his bunched fists and enormous horns. He&amp;rsquo;s not particularly heavily armoured, but the bits of armour he has strapped on are menacing and spiky, with a delightful skull on the right shoulder; this probably used to belong to someone who didn&amp;rsquo;t get out of the way quickly enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
