			<description>A Game of Teenage Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Teenage heroes fight evil baddies and giant monsters, as a metaphor for growing up and dealing with relationships and emotions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the one sentence sell for Growing Pains. It tells us what the game is about, but not necessarily what you do over the course of the game, but that too is fairly simple, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay it out like it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes go about their mundane lives, in which they face mundane challenges in the form of overblown teachers, overprotective parents or overbearing bullies. In facing these challenges they find themselves facing ever more dangerous challenges in the form of evil minions and monsters. The heroes might fail in facing these, but in doing so gain the ability to transform into greater beings and face down the threat. By fighting and overcoming the supernatural challenge, they also manage to fight and overcome their personal problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
