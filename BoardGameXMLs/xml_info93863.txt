			<description>User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firezone is a computer war game released by PSS in early 1989. The game is thematically loosely based on OGRE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firezone - Ground Combat - 21st Century&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the breakup of the Superpower blocks, colonial wars ravage the world. The development of powerful beam weapons and defensive energy shields have revolutionized ground warfare giving a new lease of life to the concept of the Armored Fighting Vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Propulsion systems have advanced beyond recognition. The development of the GRAV engine means tanks can skim across a battlefield at the speed of todays helicopter gunships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIREZONE simulates this new style of combat. It can be played as a solo game against a tough computer opponent or as a two player game. The player can control either of the two main protagonists - the EUROPEAN LEAGUE or the PACIFIC COMBINE - in any of the set scenarios. Victory is yours when the opposing forces are either wiped from the map or forces into mass retreat. Also incorporated is a scenario editor program allowing the player to design his own battles.&lt;br/&gt;FIREZONE is a phased game and incorporates the latest in Artificial Intelligence techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Phased game&lt;br/&gt;- Highly intelligent computer opponent&lt;br/&gt;- 9 pre-set missions on disk&lt;br/&gt;- Unique scenario editor&lt;br/&gt;- Hidden or open movement&lt;br/&gt;- 1 or 2 players&lt;br/&gt;- Multiple terrain types&lt;br/&gt;- Hex based scrolling maps&lt;br/&gt;- Variable unit types including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        INFANTRY, team of foot soldiers in powered armour.&lt;br/&gt;        NOVA GEN, heavy artillery on slow tracked platforms.&lt;br/&gt;        STRIDER, bipedal heavy fighting machine&lt;br/&gt;        GRAV TANK, fast lightly armoured strike tank&lt;br/&gt;        HEV TANK, main battle tanks - slow but well armoured&lt;br/&gt;        COM BASE, static or tracked nerve centre of the force&lt;br/&gt;        LEVIATHAN, the ultimate killing machine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
