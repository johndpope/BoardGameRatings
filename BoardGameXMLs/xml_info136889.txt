			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every day in the South China Sea up to 200 ships slow to as little as 15 knots to pass through sea-lanes less than a mile wide ... leaving them open to attack from pirates. Valuable cargo is constantly stolen. Sometimes lives and whole ships are taken. Understandably, not everyone is happy about the situation. Some corporations are prepared to spend vast sums of money employing people to protect their investment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People like you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Simis, the team behind the critically acclaimed AV-8B Harrier Assault, comes a simulation of phenomenal proportions.  Fly four of the world's most advanced helicopters...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kamov Werewolf KA-50 Hokum&lt;br/&gt;The Kamov HIP HI-8&lt;br/&gt;The Bell Super Cobra AH-1W&lt;br/&gt;The Westland Army Lynx&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... each one simulated to an unprecedented degree of realism with solid texture-mapped detail and authentic flight models tested and approved by experienced pilots.  Take advantage of the unique two-player co-pilot feature, and the most advanced strategic battle-planning system ever implemented in a combat simulation.  Spectacular camera views bring to life the full explosive impact of combat in the air and over Gouraud-shaped terrain.  But do you have the nerve and ability to command a four-strong fleet and wage war against the pirate armies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
