			<description>Battleague is a collectible miniatures game produced by Mattel.  It uses a combat system similar to Attacktix Battle Figure Game Marvel Superheroes.  Figures are eliminated by physically knocking them over using the physical abilities of other figures (i.e. shooting projectiles, punching, etc).  More advanced rules exist that include mission cards and power chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This the latest action-figure board game (without the board) by Mattel. Using beautifully sculpted figures by the Four Horsemen, kids can build their armies of heroes and villains with booster packs, and set up elaborate play environments thanks to packaging that actually transforms into city buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battleague Starter Set: Kids can battle like a hero with Battleague the new action figure board game, but without the board. The starter set includes everything kids need to gear up for battle, including four beautifully-sculpted figures, mission cards with four power chips and two tokens. All Battleague packages convert into battlefield buildings, from city hall to banks and more. Battleague offers many different games in one, including mission play, last man standing and first to score 10 battle blows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$9.99 Age: 7+ Available: July 2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battleague Booster Set: The Battleague Booster Set expands the play of Battleague by adding new heroes and villains to one&amp;rsquo;s army of action figures. Each booster pack includes two surprise figures, a mission card, four power chips and two tokens. Additionally, each booster box converts into a building to help players create the ultimate urban battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
