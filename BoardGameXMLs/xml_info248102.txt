							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chess II</name>
									
			<description>It's the chess game of war - played on a new, exciting Space Age battlefield!  The 64 squares of standard chess become 64 stations of varied size and shape.  They alternate light and dark and have the standard playing relationship to each other. But, rather than follow straight, predictable paths, they bend, curve, and soar - like the trails of space ships in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You follow the rules of standard chess, devise your strategy, develop your tactics and make your move.  But your playing piece attacks like a space craft, changing trajectory as it travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chess II has the proven challenge of the ancient game - played in the environment of tomorrow - for exciting entertainment for today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
