			<description>The children are little gardeners and try to have as good a harvest as possible in their garden. Each has his own garden with 9 squares, in the middle of the table there are 12x3 vegetable cards, 4 watering cans, 4 x weeds and 4 x parasites. One card after the other is turned over, vegetables are placed in the garden. So are weeds, for a parasite a vegetable has to go out, for a watering can one can turn over another card. Who has managed to plant 3 cards each of three different kinds of vegetables in his garden has won the game. 2 game variants are given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
