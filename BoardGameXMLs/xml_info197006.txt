			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure focuses on the exploration of Morren's Overlook, a ruined keep in the wilderness of the High Moor, east of the Sword Coast between Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate. If the party is too far removed from this area, it may be transplanted to most other temperate, unsettled areas in Faer&amp;ucirc;n. In this case, the Dungeon Master should change any references to the town of Secomber to the town nearest to the keep's new location. For example, if the keep is in the Wood of Sharp Teeth in the south, the nearest settlement would be Beregost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is suitable for four to six characters of 3rd to 6th level and is optimized for five characters of 3rd level. Instructions are included for how to adjust encounters for stronger parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure usually is distributed as a ZIP archive containing the 19 page PDF adventure and two subordinate ZIP archives containing, respectively, black and white, and color maps.  Each map set includes four JPG maps suitable for print-and-play.  The two map sets are identical, except for color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
