			<description>The year is 800 A.D: the dawn of the Viking Age.  For the next three centuries, explorers, warriors, traders, and builders will sail from Scandinavia to stake their claims across the globe.  They are bold, ruthless, and utterly fearless.  You are now one of them.  You and your family will make a noble name as the world burns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;' Valhalla I Am Coming!' is played in 10 turns, each turn representing roughly 30 years, or one generation. Players start with control of one Viking, but will come to control that Viking&amp;rsquo;s entire family as spouses are courted and children are born.  On each turn, players will explore, fight, settle, and build their families, often confronting death or injury and winning glory for their accomplishments. The player who has accumulated the most glory at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is straightforward, with action points being spent, skill checks being made, and tables being rolled upon.  The objectives of the design are fun, collaborative storytelling, and historical understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
