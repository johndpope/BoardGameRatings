							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enclosure at the Zoo</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple enclosure, measuring roughly 60 by 65 feet, like many others next to it on either side. This enclosure was not designed to provide the natural habitat of the animals kept within, but to showcase said beasts to the spectators. Still the fence is high, and the columns in which it is anchored are massive, to provide the audience with at least a feeling of safety, even if it could be rightly doubted that fence or gate could hold back the beasts within. A second much lower fence surrounding the enclosure is supposed to keep people out of reach from some of the animals that might be kept in these enclosures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
