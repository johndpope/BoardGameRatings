							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tarball Run</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Extensive Mission for characters of levels 8-9&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intel indicates that a long-time enemy of the Union Guard is going to enter the popular starship race known as the Tarball Run, though he will be disguised and registered under an alias. Your team will enter the race undercover, posing as racers, and attempt to track down this notorious criminal. Be prepared to compete in the intense starship race to defeat your target, an aggressive and deadly pilot with a kill sheet that includes UG agents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this mission, players will explore the Tarball Race Arena and interact with various racing teams, gathering information and gossip that will not only help them track down the criminal they seek, but will help them learn about other racing teams and how to survive or defeat them in the upcoming race. Each of the major racing teams uses different tactics and starships, so the players will need to gather as much intel as they can before they face them in the competition. Players will work together on board their starship to get the most out of their craft, taking on roles such as Science Officer, Engineer, Communications Officer, Pilot, and Commander. Using their combined skills and the advantages each crew role provides, the players will manage their starship in battle against other racers until the final showdown, where they must defeat the outlaw not only in a dogfight, but in combat aboard his ship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
