							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pass the Buck</name>
									
			<description>A nicely produced and packaged Hearts variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are in four colors (acting as suits), with values 1-10, 15, 20, 25, and 50.  Red cards are bad to take in tricks, with a degree of badness equal to their numerical value.  The purple 20 (the &amp;quot;Bad Buck&amp;quot;), if taken in a trick, *doubles* your ultimate score for the hand (ouch).  The player with the most points loses the hand and decrements a six-sided die (thoughtfully provided) to keep track.  When any player loses six hands, the game ends and the player with the most hands not-lost (whatever) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
