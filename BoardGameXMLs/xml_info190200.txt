			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are created in a free-form process, starting with 3-5 Skills defined by a narrative tab.  Characters also have two motivations (one personal, one shared by the group) and a flaw.  Action resolution is determined by 2D6, modified by +1D6 for every applicable &amp;quot;Asset&amp;quot; (bonus) and/or by -1D6 for every &amp;quot;Complication&amp;quot; (penalty).  A result of 5 or less is failure, 6-10 is success with complication, and 11+ is success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as a four-page PDF; page three is a character record sheet, page four is entirely blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
