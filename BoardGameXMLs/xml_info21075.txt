			<description>From reading the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bizarre and unlikely combination of checkers, Chinese checkers, backgammon, and chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: production quality of this game is surprisingly high. The &amp;quot;checkers&amp;quot; feel to be made of high-quality material, and feel cool and smooth to the touch, reminiscent of 'Go' stones, but much larger (and flat). They have star outline, star-filled, and star-filled in a circle designed etched into them: 1 set blue etchings, 1 set red etchings. The board is standard hard cardboard. The board art is gray background with white lines, with blue and red stars, triangles, and square delineated colored zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 1 'pawn' (checker) and 1 &amp;quot;King' (checker with a star in a circle design} on their designated opposed short-sides of the 9 x 10 square board. Two dice (each numbered only 1-3) are rolled to determine movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Pawns&amp;quot; (checkers) move forward or sideways and can only jump other &amp;quot;pawns&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Knights' (checkers with a star design) are created by jumping a &amp;quot;pawn&amp;quot; with its own &amp;quot;King&amp;quot;, They can jump &amp;quot;pawns&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;knights&amp;quot;, and may not be jumped by &amp;quot;pawns&amp;quot;. When a &amp;quot;pawn&amp;quot; is knighted, the checker is flipped over to it's star-design side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kings&amp;quot; (checker with a star in a circle design) move forward, backward, or sideways. They can jump any piece, but must stay out of the opponent's &amp;quot;holding zone&amp;quot; (a 3 x 3 square area in the middle of the opponent's side).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A piece may enter the board on a player's holding zone when a 2 is rolled on a die, and is moved the number on the other die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A piece may leave the board when it is in a &amp;quot;destination square&amp;quot; (located on the last rank of the opponents side of the board) on any roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captures are only made by a King. When a king jumps an opposing piece, that piece is placed back in the opponent's 'holding zone' (effectively starting over it's journey).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a scoring system in place for end-of game (Pawns with 1, Knights 2, Kings 4), and the doubling-cube is used to issue challenges during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule-sheet has a small section on strategies, and &amp;quot;Championship tournament&amp;quot; guidelines. Very ambitious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
