			<description>Vendetta is a chess variant for four players. The game is not very original - very similar games like 4 handed chess exist already since a long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vendetta is played on a cross shaped board: attached to each of the four sides of a standard 8x8 chess board there are four 4x8 parts. &lt;br/&gt;The final board has a 192 squares, differently from most 4-way chess sets which have only 160 squares, as the additional parts of the board are only 3x8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, queens start the game always on black squares. The rules suggest to play in two teams of two, or each player for itself, but do not mention what the conditions to win are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces, colored white, black, blue and red are hollow and should be filled with sand. &lt;br/&gt;On the reverse side of the board, a normal chess board is printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box tells that &lt;br/&gt;The game is copyrighted by J.
