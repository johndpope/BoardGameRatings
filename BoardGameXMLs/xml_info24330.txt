			<description>Word in Progress is a sort of word game which turns the methodology of building complete words, as is found in word games such as Scrabble or Boggle, on its head.  In Word in Progress, players must work together to build partial words without being the player to complete an actual word, all the while attempting to discard as many of their respective points (letters) as possible before being eliminated from the round of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
