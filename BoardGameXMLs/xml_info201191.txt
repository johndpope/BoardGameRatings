							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampire: The Eternal Struggle â€“ Gehenna</name>
									
			<description>Gehenna was the seventh card set for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle to be published by White Wolf. Published in the same time period as the Time of Judgment books that ended the original publication run of the Classic World of Darkness, this set spotlights the Final Nights, the Antediluvians, and Gehenna. Gehenna also features cards whose social context deviates from the expected status quo of the World of Darkness: Camarilla-aligned Setite primogen, Sabbat Archbishops ruling over canonically Camarilla-held cities, and so on. Gehenna was the first White Wolf-published V:TES set to not receive a preconstructed starter deck, and thus the first White Wolf V:TES set to consist exclusively of new cards in the only format in which it was published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the cancellation of Vampire: The Masquerade and its contemporary World of Darkness games, V:TES continued publication after Gehenna, remaining the only active Classic World of Darkness game line for several years afterward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
