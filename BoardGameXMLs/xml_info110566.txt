			<description>Quinella is a game that brings you the excitement of the racetrack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bet on which of 4 horses will win the race.  The horses are represented by the suits of a standard deck of cards: Heart, Diamond, Spade and Club. Each round one player acts as the caller, dealing cards to determine the odds. Bets are placed using chips.  When all bets are placed the caller deals cards to move the horses.  When the race is over the caller pays out the winning bets.  The player to the left of the caller is the caller for the next round.  The winner is the player who finishes with the most chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
