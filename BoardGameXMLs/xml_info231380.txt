			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sage Signs is a competitive faux-medieval card game for 2 to 4 players in which the players must make poker-like combinations of mystical Sign cards in a dominoes-like arrangement. Making combinations allows players to place summoning Seals to block opponents, cast crafty spells, and in the end summon a powerful (but benevolent) Spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a typical turn, you may use your two actions to either draw or place a numbered Sign card next to another card of the same value, one higher/lower value, or the same suit. Additionally, by discarding a Sign card onto an open spell slot, you may cast the spell of that card's suit, and by placing Seals atop a Sign card marked with a &amp;quot;V,&amp;quot; you may invoke the effects of one of the eight game-changing Virtue cards. When specific poker-like combinations of cards are made, a number of Seals corresponding to the strength of that combination may be put down. When someone has laid down all 7 of their Secondary Seals, they must create a combination of cards that yields more Seals than the the central Spirit card demands. The number of Seals indicated on the Spirit card (1 to 4) indicates the difficulty of the end game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
