			<description>&amp;ldquo;This game is a futuristic race of the WipeOut or Star Wars episode 1 kind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A single championship is made of one or several circuits. Except if otherwise voted by all players, all circuit will have to be played three time, once for each category. Each race belongs to one special category and has special rules and only the third one allows the use of weapons. Categories are: Total Speed Way - a speed race where the initial risks bidding is essential, Dragster Show - an die-fast competition where wreckage are far from being uncommon, Destruction Derby - where the pilots are allowed weapons aboard.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different kinds of racing ships, each rated for Speed, Hit Points, and &amp;ldquo;Space Available&amp;rdquo; for further customization. Pilots are rated for Piloting and G-Endurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
