			<description>In this &amp;quot;3rd Millennium World Challenge&amp;quot;, players move around the board acquiring and adding population to geo-political territories.  In addition to sets based on vicinity, players can gain benefit by collecting members of the same &amp;quot;offensive group&amp;quot;, which are linked by ideology instead of geography.  Players also have opportunities to challenge others for control of territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score is determined by the amount of money in hand, less debts, plus a factor for the amount of population controlled.  The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
