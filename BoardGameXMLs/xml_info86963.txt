			<description>From Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the dangers present in swampy regions, many sages have questioned how anyone is able to safely emerge from the swamps. Whether a lone merchant, or a group of highly trained adventurers, the sheer number of perils points to a minimal chance of survival. Yet, the actual numbers are far higher than statistically probable. These higher numbers are in part due to the existence of the aegire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aegire are seldom seen by travelers, but their watchful presence is often felt. Aegire aid travelers when they can. Those who benefit from their aid are usually not even aware that it was rendered. Those who are aware of the aid seldom know the actual source, leading to legends of beneficial swamp spirits. In particularly dangerous swamps, travelers go so far as to create travelers shrines to the aegire, though the aegire have no interest in such recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The select few druids, rangers and sages who know the truth about the aegire are silent when queried. Even they do not know the reason why this shortlived race provides aid, though a few legends exist. The most common tells of druids from an extinct race that protected the swamp. According to the legend, the druids gave up the last vestiges of their racial heritage to defend the swamp. Whether this story is true or not may never be known. However, any druid or ranger who respects life can be comfortable knowing they have allies in the shadows of the swamp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
