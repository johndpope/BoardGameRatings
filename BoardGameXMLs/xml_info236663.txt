			<description>A Two-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life has always been simple for your people. You hunt, tend your crops, and create the implements of everyday life, and at night and during days of relaxation you sing the songs and tell the stories of old. You wage contests with the other tribes on your island in times of peace and meet them on the battlefield in times of war. Occasionally warriors die in battle or from accidents or from disease, but that is the will of the Great Spirit. The oldest and wisest mothers and fathers of the tribe guide daily life and pass judgment when necessary, and the shamans interpret the omens sent by the Great Spirit, judge when it is time for festivals, and speak to the spirits of the Other World. If none of them have an answer for a situation that arises, then a delegation goes to visit the Oracle. Life has been no more complicated than that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
