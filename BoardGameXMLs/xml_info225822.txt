							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buzzed Bands</name>
									
			<description>Each player puts a band on a cup, wrist, or bottle. Players hang out at a party as they normally would while also carrying out the dares printed on their Buzzed Bands. Keep following through with your dare until someone switches bands with you. Play continues until a player has received the Switch Bands for a third time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone wins when they play this game.  You get to drink while having a great time.  This game also acts as a wonderful ice breaker game to get to know new people at a party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
