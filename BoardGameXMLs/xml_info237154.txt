			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utah, Salt Lake Desert, June 1992:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six young people are severely injured while searching among the wrecked remnants of a Desert Mountain. In all likelihood, magma in the interior of the mountain caused a giant explosion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are hospitalized with memory loss, at the prestigious Whitedale Recreational Facility.  Six months later they're still there - still with memory loss, but otherwise healthy and healthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kolding, Denmark, Summer 1993:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six tired young people - Cathy, Bobby, Alex, &amp;quot;Bananas&amp;quot;, Lee and Niels Bo - are taking a break in peaceful, sunny Denmark at Niels Bo's family house, the Christensen family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mrs. Christensen is delighted with her American guests and dishes up mountains of homemade meatballs. The pretty little townhouse is full of Danish spirit and the rich smell of brown sauce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the time of music festivals, and rock and roll fills Denmark.  It's the time of long summer holidays and people stroll the beaches. The sun shines mildly from an unusual blue sky; even school teachers are longing for the beaches, and the beer has never been colder or cheaper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life couldn't be better for our six ragged friends...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
