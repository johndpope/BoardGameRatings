			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ongoing effort protecting the kingdom of Dardarrick is a never ending effort for the men and women of Wraith Recon. They are sent into danger time and time again to eliminate threats and must respond quickly to the schemes that threaten their homeland. Whilst the ongoing struggle against the growing threat from Lorn is foremost in their thoughts, it is not the only trouble the kingdom has to face. Wraith Recon cannot keep its eyes constantly watching the east; otherwise some new threat could grow to become more dangerous than even Lorn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mission Pack 1: Skies of Fire details one of these threats. While Spellcaster Command&amp;rsquo;s attention was turned toward the Lornish border after the events that took place in Mission Pack 0: The Lorn Initiative (see Wraith Recon page 125), the events in this book took shape and began to form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skies of Fire is a collection of linked missions for the Wraith Recon game setting for D&amp;amp;D 4th Edition and assumes the Player Characters are part of that elite organisation. These missions could be undertaken by a normal party of adventurers, but they are likely to be difficult and dangerous for Player Characters who are not supported by the Wraith Recon organisation. The missions take place sometime after the Lorn Initiative, and characters should be of 7th or 8th level at the start of the campaign in order for the encounters to provide the optimum challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
