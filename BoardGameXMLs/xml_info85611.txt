							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dallas November 1963</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dallas, 1963. The President is coming, although he really shouldn't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city is on edge, and all the players are busy playing - John Birch patriots and pro-Castro lunatics, Teamsters, mobsters and assorted other entrepreneurs in the burgeoning fields of sex, death, and race war. A lot of very serious people are doing a lot of very serious things. A smart guy can really get ahead in times like these, looking for the angles, making connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you know what? Guys like that have more important things to do than worry about the President speaking at a Dallas Trade Mart luncheon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Chris Bennett, Dallas 1963 evokes films like JFK and Executive Action, and was heavily influenced by James Ellroy's novel The Cold Six Thousand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
