							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atomic Cafe 1957</name>
									
			<description>Theme: 1957 is drawing to a close. The U.S.S.R. launched a multi-stage ballistic missile earlier in the year and the U.S., not wanting to fall behind in the missile race, launches its first ICBM on December 17th.  Soon the world is blasted to ruins and only small pockets, isolated from the destruction and ensuing radioactive fallout, prove habitable over the long term. And between those pockets, battles rage between gangs of survivors (The 8th Avenue Greasers, The Michigan State Bowling League, and others) and rogue military units. All of them seeking food, fuel, or a place free of radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play: Players compete and combat for possession of the remaining resources among the nuclear wastes.  Player activate their gangs by random card activation.  Encounter markers are used to designate various sites to search.  Combat is fast and bloody between the players, or with wandering with RadZombies, Mutated men, animals and insects.  Final victory is determined by the exiting of these few precious items off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
