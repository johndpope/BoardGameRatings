			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2007, at the Milton Keynes Role Playing Group, we played a short campaign of Dogs in the Vineyard, round robin style, with each participant taking it in turn to be in the hot seat as GM for a session while the rest played their Dogs and sorted out the town the GM had prepared for us. It was very successful and a lot of fun and if you're thinking about running a Dogs camapign yourself, it's the format I'd recommend.&lt;br/&gt; Here are the two towns I created and ran for the round robin; enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From HAGEN&amp;rsquo;S BASIN &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;MUDSLIDE&amp;rdquo;:&lt;br/&gt;When the Faithful settled this peaceful little spot in the foothills at the base of the great mountain range that cuts them off from the East, they assisted a family of the Mountain People is binding an evil spirit at the bottom of the lake from which the town now takes it name. The Mountain People were so impressed with the powerful medicine of the Faithful that they converted en masse to the Faith. As a result, Hagen&amp;rsquo;s Basin is composed roughly 50/50 of those of European descent and the Mountain People, as well as some individuals of mixed descent: not everyone welcomes this&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From LASKEY&amp;rsquo;S CROSSING &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;THE ENEMY OF FAITH&amp;rdquo;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     20 years ago: Malcolm Trumbull had an affair with his brother&amp;rsquo;s wife back east many years ago: there was a minor scandal and Malcolm moved west, where he has survived and grown prosperous with his investments. He is the richest man in Laskey&amp;rsquo;s Crossing and has title to nearly all the land thereabouts.&lt;br/&gt;     10 years ago: the &amp;lsquo;pox visited Laskey&amp;rsquo;s Crossing, killing many of the children; Isaac Leominster was 8 at the time and his younger sister, Bethany, was 5. Medicine was procured, but too late for Bethany who died of the illness: Isaac survived with a &amp;lsquo;pox scarred face.&lt;br/&gt;     Now: Jennifer Trumbull is a smart, plain young woman with a passion for art &amp;amp; science: she is the daughter of Malcolm Trumbull, but believes that he is her uncle. She has moved west to Laskey&amp;rsquo;s Crossing at his invitation, in order to teach the older children some culture &amp;amp; reason: Malcolm believes in investing in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
