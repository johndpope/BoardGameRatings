							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Citadel of Prokhorovka (Kursk 1943)</name>
									
			<description>The Citadel of Prokhorovka is a board game simulating the conflict around the small Russian town of&lt;br/&gt;Prokhorovka, which was fought on Monday 12 July 1943 between German and Soviet forces. The battle&lt;br/&gt;plan was part of Operation Citadel, Hitler&amp;rsquo;s attempt to eliminate the large Kursk bulge at the Eastern Front,&lt;br/&gt;consolidate his defence line by about 80 miles and deprive the Soviets of any serious capacity to attack for&lt;br/&gt;the rest of 1943. The fighting mainly took place among the armoured formations of the two sides, but the&lt;br/&gt;participation of infantry, artillery and air force was also important and is reflected in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
