			<description>Famicom Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shōjo​ (ファミコン探偵倶楽部PartII うしろに立つ少女,? &amp;quot;Famicom Detective Club Part II: The Girl who Stands Behind&amp;quot;) is a text-based adventure game released by Nintendo in 1989 for the Family Computer Disk System. The original version was released in two discs in 1989, and the game was ported to the Super Famicom and the Game Boy Advance several years later. The Super Famicom version was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on April 30, 2008 and the Famicom version for the Virtual Console on December 22, 2009. Neither version of the game was ever released outside of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ushiro ni Tatsu Shōjo is the successor of and a prequel to Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Kōkeisha, and is the second game of the Famicom Tantei Club series. Its scenario was written by Nagihiro Asama, based on the concept by Yoshio Sakamoto. Kenji Yamamoto composed the game music. The popularity of Part I: Kieta Kōkeisha prompted the release of this sequel, which employed the similar graphic-adventure gameplay. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Power cartridge rewriting service in 1998 with improved graphics and sound, and the Disk System version was released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of the Famicom Mini series. The murder and smoking scenes resulted in a CERO (ages 15+) rating for the GBA release, making it the first Nintendo title to receive a parental advisory rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school's ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SFC remake had improved graphics - directed by Tomoyoshi Yamane, object and Samus designer for Super Metroid and designer for Wario Land 4 and Metroid II: Return of Samus; the remake's music was yet again composed by Kenji Yamamoto. Since the SFC version is on a cartridge instead of a Disk Card, it avoids the load times when saving games and switching between scenes. The SFC version utilized the SFC's 8-channel Sony SPC700, which had more channels than the Famicom's 5-channel Ricoh 2A03 and the FDS's channel together. The SFC version generally had extended remixes all of the original version's songs, and a few extra songs. The game uses either waveforms or white noise to &amp;quot;voice&amp;quot; the characters. The FDS version's voice waveforms are all the same frequency square waves, but in the SFC version, each character is designated to one of a number of different voice waveforms. In the original FDS version, for the protagonist's search for Ayumi, the game required the player to manually go through the town as a pseudo-3D maze; the SFC version had this trimmed down to just text and visual descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;The SFC version adds a &amp;quot;memo&amp;quot; interface that the player can access throughout most of the game. It can be used to look up information on most of the characters (except the protagonist himself, Utsugi, Maruyama, Fumi Tazaki, and all unnamed characters). At some points, the memo's interface is used to fill in question blanks with the names of the correct characters. The memo is also utilized during most &amp;quot;Review&amp;quot; sessions, where the protagonist reviews on what new information he discovered so far. This version also has a &amp;quot;logbook&amp;quot; feature, which summarizes all story and information gathered so far in a save file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SFC remake adds an extra, final part to the ending - a personality assessment for the entertainment of the player, based on the player's actions and patterns. For example, analyzing or touching Yoko's skirt could have the game assume a flirtatious personality. In addition, based on how the character treats Ayumi, the game will determine the protagonist's &amp;quot;compatibility&amp;quot; with Ayumi, out of 20 hearts. Actions with Ayumi and other schoolgirl characters would be used to select who to match with the protagonist - this includes the art club member,[64] a flirtatious schoolgirl, and Ayumi herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Famicom Detective Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shōjo&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
