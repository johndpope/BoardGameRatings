			<description>BandFuse: Rock Legends allows you to use your own real guitar or bass to jam along to your favorite tunes with support for up to 4 players on a single console. Strap on your guitar or bass, or grab the USB microphone to sing along with your friends! Choose Karaoke mode to just sing along for fun, or choose real Vocalist mode to get scored while you sing with 5 levels of difficulty on every song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique interface using animated tablature simplifies music for beginners, showing them where to place their fingers and when to strum the strings. Experienced guitarists will be challenged to master solos and advanced techniques, playing along with songs exactly as recorded by the original artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
