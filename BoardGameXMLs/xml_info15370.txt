			<description>Typecast is a guessing game about the assumptions our society makes based on personal appearance. Each card contains a photo of a person who has been polled with regard to their likes and dislikes. Based on the photo, the players must guess which choices are true about the subject, such as whether they are a a tax lawyer, musician, zoologist, cab driver or photographer. The first player to answer two out of three correctly wins the card, and the first to collect five cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
