			<description>&amp;quot;Tell your own stories of crime in the big city.&amp;quot; A card game inspired by the film Noir genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players share a common custom deck of cards that contains six suits: Atmosphere, Locations, Help, Hindrances, Witnesses,  and Clues. Each card is named after something reminiscent of the elements of film Noir movies from the forties and fifties. There are twenty cards in each suit for a total of 120 cards in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules call for &amp;quot;the meanest player&amp;quot; to start the game. The players seek to play six card combos (a &amp;quot;storyline&amp;quot;) containing one card from each suit in the deck. The game ends when the deck has been exhausted. The player who played the most combos wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
