							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkmantles</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the unusual darkmantle. These stalactite-resembling magical beasts are typically fodder for 1st-level adventurers, and are notable mostly for their annoying ability to drench the area around them in darkness. The first of the new exotic darkmantles is the death&amp;rsquo;s hood darkmantle (CR 3), whose smaller size is not the liability that it initially seems, as it allows it to better conform to the faces of its victims. It attaches itself to its prey&amp;rsquo;s face and quickly strangles it, then uses the corpse like a puppet for its own nefarious ends. The equally insidious shadow weaver darkmantle (CR 5) is more powerful in areas of darkness, and is surrounded by an aura that subtly lowers the light level around it. Finally, the goliath darkmantle (CR 8) is a huge darkmantle whose favored tactic is to drop from above on unsuspecting victims, and can grapple a large number of victims at once, weakening them with its acidic drool before swallowing them whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
