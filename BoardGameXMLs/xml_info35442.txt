			<description>For two players or more. The goal is to receive as many white pieces as possible. One player selects something on the wheel. The other player doesn't know what the other has selected and has to guess. Among the alternatives are &amp;quot;take two pieces&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;give two pieces&amp;quot; and so on. Correct guesses are rewarded and wrong ones punished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
