			<description>This trick-taking game is played with a standard deck of playing cards.  Each game, a pair of dice is rolled.  The first die determines how many cards are held in each player's hand (1-6); the other die is special and determines the trump suit.  The second die may come up &amp;quot;no trump&amp;quot; (there is no trump suit) or &amp;quot;no suit&amp;quot; (suit doesn't matter, only face value).  Chips are used to keep score.  Players must ante up before each hand, and the pot is won by the first player to reach eleven points (or to have the highest score after four hands).  Scoring centers around the fact that at start of each game, players use bidding wheels to predict how many hands they can win.  Penalties are applied for guessing incorrectly, while guessing correctly and winning all tricks in a hand can lead to an instant win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
