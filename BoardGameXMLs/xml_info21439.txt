			<description>&amp;quot;Despu&amp;eacute;s de Colditz&amp;quot; (After Colditz) is the sequel to the acclaimed game &amp;quot;Fuga de Colditz&amp;quot; (Escape from Colditz), designed by Major P. R. Reid, B. Degas and the production team at NAC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The escape from the castle was only the beginning of a long adventure that would take the prisoners along several escape routes out of Germany. The most important routes were Switzerland, Spain, the Baltic (on to Sweden) and Bretagne (on to Great Britain).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the escape routes the players will encounter many obstacles such as the German army, the Gestapo, German civilians, etc. Intelligence, stamina, the knowledge of foreign languages, luck and audacity are all represented in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the players will lead the German security forces and the rest will play as teams of escapees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
