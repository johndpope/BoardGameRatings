			<description>(from the designer:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldiers of the Rising Sun (SRS) is a simulation of warfare in the Pacific Theatre of Operations during World War Two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Turn represents part of a day. Each military unit represents a company or platoon. Each section of track is one to three kilometers in length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a counter and map simulation using a point-to-point movement and combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's envisaged that SRS will have a number of modules, each depicting a certain stage of the conflict in the PTO. These modules will be divided into a number of scenarios. Each scenario presents a challenge to both sides, with clear objectives which must be achieved in a limited number of turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first module, Gathering Storm, focuses on the opening battles of the Kokoda Track Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
