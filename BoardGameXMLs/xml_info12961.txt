			<description>From the publisher, Murmel:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is in turmoil! Gigantic power cuts affect entire continents. Traffic chaos, computer crashes, millions of people blocked in elevators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happened ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We investigated and identified the cause for these mysterious blackouts: ENIX a strange moody being that is at home in the sun, in the wind and the water, in warm springs and old trees or in the wild surfs of the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plunge yourself into the fabulous world of renewable energies, use the energy points wisely to increase your energy score. But beware of ENIX because a victory close at hand may disappear straight into the next blackout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe with the help of ENIX you might succeed also to play tricks on the other players ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting game about energy points for 2 to 6 persons Ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 6 game pieces, 6 energy boards, 72 game cards, and the ENIX Blackout-Cap. A brochure with interesting information about renewable energies is contained as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
