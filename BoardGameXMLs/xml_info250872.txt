							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Citadelle</name>
									
			<description>A race game with AA and coastal guns. 2 to 6 players compete to reach the citadel (a fortress surrounded by a body of water) with their 4 pieces. There are 3 paths to reach the citadel, each as dangerous as the others. Cards help the players and moving spaces is with a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the paths is by ship, but an opposing player can sink it if he mans the coastal gun. Do you have an armor card to protect you? Another way is by plane, but the AA guns may hit you. Finally you can try the lower tide but will you drown?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arriving at the citadel's island, you're still not safe. You have to move around the citadel until you get the exact number of spaces with the die to enter it. Beware of opposing players' spies and a hole in the ground that will make you start from the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one with the most of his pieces in the citadel at game's end or the first one to reach it in case of a tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
