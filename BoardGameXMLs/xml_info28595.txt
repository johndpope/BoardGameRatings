							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dennis the Menace and Gnasher</name>
									
			<description>This is a REAL Dennis the Menace game. It has all the naughty, silly fun of Dennis in 'The Beano' and it is easy to learn as well. Each player must play three dirty tricks on characters on the board using various items they collect on their travels. (What could you do with a banana, a bucket, a rope and six pints of rasher slop ? ! )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUT ... look out for Sergeant Slipper, if he catches you in the act it's curtains !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is THE Dennis game. Just for kids or the whole family, it is brilliant fun. When Dad &amp;amp; Mum turn into children you know you have a good game on the table !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
