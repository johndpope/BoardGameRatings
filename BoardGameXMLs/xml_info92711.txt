			<description>Some peculiar things are happening down here in the Toyshop...Our shopkeeper has lost his marbles (quite literally!) and it's up to you to help him find his special marbles and restore balance to this once peaceful toy store! Guide one of the shopkeeper's favorite toys through a variety of playful, platform puzzles. Collect all of the lost marbles, avoid the electrically-charged Nanobots, and discover secret areas hidden deep within the stacks of toys and games. Use your trusty lasso to grab and move certain objects to help reach your goal. Check in with other toys you meet on your adventures for help and power-ups! Open up the Toyshop today and uncover a miniature world of platform hopping playthings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
