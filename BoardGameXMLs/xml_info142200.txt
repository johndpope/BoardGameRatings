			<description>Bloodforge is a hack and slash action game in which the player must combat his enemies with an array of weaponry. The player uses an equipped weapon to attack the countless opponents until they are defeated or get until they get disoriented (signaled by an icon on the head), Where Crom can then perform a gruesome finishing move on the opponent. This gives the player more Blood which is the currency in the game. The more damage done to the enemy, the more Blood that is spilled, thereby rewarding the player with excessive amounts Blood currency. Blood can be then be used for purchasing upgrades for special abilities. The main weapons of the game are a crude-like sword, war hammer, claws, and the crossbow. All which have 3 available weapon upgrades. The Health Bar is shown at the top left of the screen in green, along with a Rage bar in red. Health and a variety of Runes can be found in breakable cairns, the player can also find Mana runes which recharge Crom's Rune Bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bloodforge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
