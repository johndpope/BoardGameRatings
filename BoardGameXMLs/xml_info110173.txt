							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirates of Dark Water</name>
									
			<description>Pirates of Dark Water video games were also released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis systems. The Super Nintendo version was a &amp;quot;beat 'em up similar to Final Fight, with a slow but strong character (Ioz), a fast but weak character (Tula), and a well-balanced character (Ren). Each character has a life-draining Desperation Attack (spinning kick for Ren, ecomancer energy for Tula, and spinning punch for Ioz) and the ability to block - something not common in games of this genre. The Sega version was a side scrolling platform game with RPG elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Pirates of Dark Water&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
