			<description>From Amazon, publisher blurb for second edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of the Nine! This is a world much like our own, but with a few key differences. First and foremost among them are the existence of Nine extraordinary individuals who possess fantastical powers. Every great event throughout human history has seen the Appearance of at least One of the Nine. These individuals are heirs to ancient bloodlines devoted to stopping the forces of Stagnation. The forces of Stagnation will stop at nothing to hold back progress and change, and only the Nine are capable of defeating them. So, unlike other RPGs that present a deep and interesting world where no one seems to be able to get anything done without the assistance of a random group of adventurers, the Nine: Elements of Change casts the players as literally the most important people in the world. The Nine wield both the elements and the Fates themselves to do battle with mankind's greatest foe. Will you join the ranks and be the next One to Appear? New in version 2: New cover art 2 New Sample Adventures 3 New Professions 5 New Weapons 13 New Antagonists 71 New Pages 147 New Feats More lore Improvements and edits to existing content Simplified and Advanced Combat Rules Glossary and How to Play guides for new players Helpful advice from everyone's favorite talking sword, Dave! What's not new? The price, still $25.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
