			<description>Taken from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CromoGnomo is a game for four players, playing in two teams of two players each, that deals with four painter gnomes.  Each gnome/player begins the game with the same hand of twelve &amp;quot;colour&amp;quot; cards. During his turn, each player either plays in the bucket one of his card, or passes. The colours in the bucket blend to form other colours: at the end of each round, one of the team may score points if the resulting colour is one of his favourites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An elegant and fun card game created during the event &amp;quot;Create a Game from Scratch&amp;quot; (Gradara Ludens 2003) by:  Andrea Angiolino, Roberto Cestaro, Claudio Del Pizzo, Emiliano Liverani, Giovanni Galanti, Silvano Sorrentino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
