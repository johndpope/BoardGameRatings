							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wisdom from the Wastelands (Issue 4 - Feb 22, 2012)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue #4: New Races&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though some post-apocalyptic game worlds have only allowed Humans, mutants, mutant plants, and animals as characters, there has always been room to expand upon this. Mutant Future did an admirable job by introducing androids and other similarly &amp;ldquo;created&amp;rdquo; races but not enough to please many players and game masters. With that in mind, this issue of Wisdom from the Wastelands contains seven new &amp;ldquo;races&amp;rdquo; for players and GMs to use in their campaigns. Two are essentially mirror images of one another, while another brings in a group that was completely missed in the Mutant Future game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are general guidelines and are as such subject to the whims and moods of the GM. The GM can use as many or as few of the races presented here, as they stand or with his own modifications. Rules for dealing with robots are also included at the end of the article.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
