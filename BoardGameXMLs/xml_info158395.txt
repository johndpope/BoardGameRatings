							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Into the Dragon&#039;s Cave</name>
									
			<description>Times are tough for ninjas. Smoke bombs are waaaaay more than you'd think, and jobs are scarce - so both you and this other ninja have to take the almost impossible task of breaking into Tomiko, the Dragon Queen's cave and stealing back the Kyorinrin scroll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into the Dragon's Cave is a custom dice game for 2 players, who'll attempt to make sets and earn 60 silver before their opponent. They'll work their way into the cave as far as they think is best and judiciously use smoke bombs to get out of tight spots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will roll custom dice (or a set of standard d6s with conversion table) trying to create sets - and choosing to push their luck if they think they can earn more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
