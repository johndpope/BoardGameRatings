			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of an Elemental Cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;They said it was impossible. Improbable maybe. I&amp;rsquo;ll prove them all wrong and show that all the elements can exist just fine in the same place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DramaScape brings all the elements to its new cave! Fire, ice, water, mud, howling wind at the entrance, and of course earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Cave is a single interior map of a cave featuring many tunnels that lead to dead ends including caverns containing a single element and large empty cave rooms perfect for the lair of a monster, dragon, or magician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Cave is intended for fantasy games with magical elements held in certain pools and areas. It might also make sense on a science fiction planet with unstable weather or some sort of shield holding the various elements in place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mad Elementalist: An elementalist was told that keeping all the elements in the same place was impossible. So he went to a local cave and started manipulating leylines until he did the improbable, created different areas in the cave capable of freezing ice, flowing water, burning lava, mud, swamp, and other elements. His greatest triumph as a magician was fleeting however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for the elementalist, his heavy use of elemental magic to partition the areas of the cave alerted evil dragons to his creation. Usually unable to work together because of a love of different climates, the evil dragons formed an alliance and took control of the various areas of the cave they were comfortable residing in and avoid the other areas they are less comfortable being inside. Now they raid the local castles, towns, and villages from their central lair and fill the cave with hoards of treasure. Slaying one dragon is a heroic task, but slaying a group of dragons requires epic and legendary heroes. All other would be dragon hunters lured by their treasures have failed. Will your group be the first one to succeed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
