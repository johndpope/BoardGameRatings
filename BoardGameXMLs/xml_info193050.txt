			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Echoes of Heaven&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once Man stood in the full glory of God. Now he must strain to hear even the echoes of Heaven. &lt;br/&gt;Veteran game designer Robert J Defendi brings you a world of darkness and danger, where a monolithic church has split into dozens of quarreling factions and holy war looms like a shadow. Here, strength and brutality win the day and only those with the most faith, honor, and courage can stand against the terrible tyranny of those who would enslave everyone of a different belief, a different philosophy, a different race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worse, it is a world infected by the very fabric of Hell itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Echoes of Heaven is a game world of infinite possibilities, where the nature of Hell corrupts the Mortal Realm, creating adventure sites both many and varied. Ulcers shape themselves to the minds of the Demon controlling them, the dreams of the former inhabitants, sometimes even the minds of adventurers. In an Ulcer, even the most basic laws of nature can break down, making possible any adventure the GM can envision. Ulcers grow, mature, and devour. Only prompt actions can stop them from becoming permanent, and one day an Ulcer will destroy the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Throne of God&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure that spans ten thousand years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Belm is the center of culture, government, and commerce for the Kingdom of Ludremon. But when a young girl disappears just miles outside the city walls at the same time the cathedral's holy relic is stolen, who will dare undertake an adventure that leads into the tattered fringes of reality itself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 2nd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
