							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fancy Bazaar or Aristocratic Traders</name>
									
			<description>Mainly a card game, with the gameboard being a place to put the counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Bazaar is fourfold: to aid the Acclimatisation of Society, to help pay the National Debt, to raise a fund to build a bridge from Dover to Calais, and to build a school to teach Grown Children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stalls are run as follows: the Fruiterer and Greengrocer is Lady Verysoft, the Grocer is Mrs Plausible, the Pastrycook is Miss Wheedleton, the Toy Dealer is Baroness Goodchild, the Earthenware Dealer is the Duchess of Otherland, the Hosier and Glover is Viscountess Pumicestone, the Poulterer is Miss Silverstone, and the Florist is the Marchioness of Bailbury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the cards relate to the goods found on these stalls. The players take the part of the various stall holders. The cards are dealt out to the players in turn, who have to follow the instructions of paying counters to the various stalls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
