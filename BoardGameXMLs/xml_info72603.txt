			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Berserk for the Playstation 2 is directly based on the story in the manga with a few extra twists. Unlike its game predecessor Berserk &amp;ndash; Forgetful flowers for the Dreamcast in 1999, it is not a full side chapter, and is also not a sequel to that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While not being a sequel, the game plays largely the same as its predecessor; the player takes the role of Gatts (Guts) as he fights his way through hordes of monsters, clearing stage after stage arcade-style. Points are earned for doing combos: hitting enemy after enemy without break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game advances through the story, the player is treated to some story surprises that did not show up in the manga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was rated CERO-Z (18) and was later, with the strengthening of the ratings in 2006, treated as a game that is illegal to sell to children under 18.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
