			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Overview&lt;br/&gt;The Fighter Flight Stand with built in Altitude dials makes playing with the altitude rules quick and simple and with the aircraft's stats engraved right on the base, everyone can see the stats without having to look them up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details&lt;br/&gt;The ACE Messerschmitt Bf109 Squadron Flight Stands come with all the necessary aircraft stats laser engraved right on the base so that all players can quickly and easily see the plane's stats durning the game without having to look them up.  This special Squadron pack comes with three flight stands, one each for the different pilots depicted on the decals for the miniatures (1, 7, &amp;gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The built in altitude level and climb rate dials make it easy to incorporate the altitude rules into your games. Engraved into the base is the altitude ring. It allows you to track your altitude level from 0 all the way up to the max altitude of 16. The climb rate dial allows you to track how many climb cards you have played. Just turn the top dial each time you play a climb maneuver and once this dial equals your planes climb rate, rotate the altitude dial up one number and the climb rate dial back to 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details&lt;br/&gt;The laser cut and engraved parts ensure the highest quality and precise markings. One altitude peg (not included) needs to be modified for use with these flight stands. Simply cut the small tip off and insert this peg into the base from the bottom. The peg will fit snugly into the base (pressing the base down on a hard table top works great) and the two dials will slide over the peg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
