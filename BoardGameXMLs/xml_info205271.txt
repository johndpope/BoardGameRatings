			<description>This is a paper-and-pencil game, clearly a &amp;quot;beer and pretzels&amp;quot; game since it promotes the witbier (white beer) produced by the Belgian brewer Hoegaarden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a deck of 124 cards, each of which has six words in both French and Flemish. There also are two pencils, a pad of square drawing sheets and a bag of blue and white chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in charades but on paper, players are challenged to pick a word on their card and try to draw an image that will prompt the correct response from their partners or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
