			<description>From the rulebook/play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playwright: Oh, hello there. [He stands and moves downstage.] Let me apologize for this &amp;quot;one-man-show&amp;quot; opening; it's gauche, but I felt it was important to discuss how this was going to work. This isn't really a play, you see. This is a game. A game in the genre I mostly hear called &amp;quot;Story Games&amp;quot;; table-top role-playing games built around simulating particular sorts of  narrative, generally built for single sessions of a few hours, and often without a Game Master or similar figurehead.&lt;br/&gt;But it's written in the form of a play. Yes, that makes this an in-character document, and yes, those can be dreadfully obnoxious, but if I didn't get an opportunity to flex my obnoxiousness from time to time I would positively burst.&lt;br/&gt;[The Playwright pauses to take a mug from his desk and sip at it. He pauses a moment, savoring both his beverage and the impatience of the audience.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Note: This is a story game intended to create a story much like an Oscar Wilde play.  A Game Chef 2014 finalist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
