			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello, and welcome to Time Wizards: The Sober and Serious Edition, a game for serious individuals with serious lives. At least, by the standards of Time Wizards players, which is sort of like saying &amp;quot;a particularly Chaotic sort of paladin&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a very healthy lich&amp;quot;. As the name might somewhat jokingly suggest, Sober and Serious Edition is an attempt at producing a game with similar potential for shenanigans as traditional Time Wizards while being more accessible to a general tabletop audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This revised and largely re-written version of the game primarily is based on Time Wizards Revised First Edition, minus the idiosyncratic &amp;quot;dice slap&amp;quot; rules.  It was published in October 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
