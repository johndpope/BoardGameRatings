			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were once quite worthy fellows. Something terrible happened and you hit rock bottom. Were it not for a mysterious benefactor you would have died. Maybe you would have been better off that way. Your life is one long fight to survive in the twisting, dank alleyways of Whitechapel area of London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now rumor has it there is a serial killer on the loose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Jack Hack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jack Hack is an OSR-inspired game using the Black Hack system by David Black. A copy of the Black Hack is needed to play The Jack Hack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jack Hack is a game of trying to beat the odds in the depravity of late Victorian London. It has particular focus on the Whitechapel area just before, and around the time of the infamous Jack the Ripper murders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
