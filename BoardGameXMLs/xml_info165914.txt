			<description>Stack, pattern and match the multicolor shapes. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by appearances, these endlessly enjoyable blocks mean brain-boosting business. Mental Blox help children practice following verbal instructions, asking questions and build critical thinking skills. Activity cards provide children with examples of what to build. Children can recreate what is on the card or can give verbal instructions to a partner or group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ways of playing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Stack, pattern, and match the multicolor shapes, but don't be fooled by appearances: these endlessly enjoyable blocks mean brain-boosting business&lt;br/&gt;     Twenty activity cards keep strategic thinking skills in tip-top shape, while ensuring all players use strategy and visual literacy in a variety of clever cognitive activities.&lt;br/&gt;     Re-create a hidden arrangement or listen to verbal instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game #1: Look &amp;amp; Build&lt;br/&gt;2 teams receive 10 identical blocks each. A player will be the counter.&lt;br/&gt;A card is placed away. &lt;br/&gt;A player of each team will go to see the card, return to his place an take a block to start building the structure, This must be done before the counter gets to 10.  Then a another player from each team will do the same and so on until a team agree that they correctly built the structure calls out  &amp;ldquo;Mental Blox!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Check the team&amp;rsquo;s structure against the card.  If he team built the structure correctly, they can  keep the card. If they built the structure incorrectly, see if the other team came closer to re-creating the structure; if so, that team keeps the card. Continue playing for three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2: Listen &amp;amp; Build;;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you&amp;rsquo;ll have one caller and two builders.  Divide blocks so that each player has an identical  set of 10 blocks.  The caller should take a card and, with his or her back to the builders, describe the  structure to the builders.  After the caller finishes describing the structure and the builders complete their re-creations, compare the card to the structures. Which builder came closest to re-creating the picture with blocks? The most accurate builder can keep the card. Continue playing for three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both games have a variant where players should answer the bonus question on the bottom of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
