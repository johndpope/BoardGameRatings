			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neptune is a Playstation 3 game published by Sega. The game is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the video game industry, with a number of video game consoles and games personified as characters in the game. The game takes plays in Geimugyokai (lit. Game Industry), a fantasy world broken up into four regions: Platetume, Rinbox (Xbox 360), Lastation (PS3), and Ruwii (Wii).  Neptune is the game&amp;rsquo;s amnesiac heroine, and she finds herself needing to defend the world against the evil goddess Majikonne. The name Neptune is in homage to the Sega Neptune, an add-on for the Sega Saturn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay follows the standard turn-based RPG format, and combat has 3D character models in 3D settings. Players can customize Neptune&amp;rsquo;s appearance and abilities, and can also summon &amp;ldquo;Guardian Angels&amp;rdquo; from actual games or from pictures in the PS3 photo album. In addition to the four regions of Geimugyokai emulating consoles, there are goddesses that protect each region which are personified versions of their console. Game companies also have character avatars, and a number of old Sega characters appear in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
