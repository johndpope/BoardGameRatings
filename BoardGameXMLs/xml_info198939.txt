			<description>To D Island is a stick-men survival game, where the players (the stick-men) have to face the dangers of the island and escape. It can be played cooperatively, with all the players working together, or competitively, where it&amp;rsquo;s each player for himself and until the last man standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dangers the players must face are the devious traps meant to hinder them on the way, the Monster trying to devour them and the volcano which will eventually envelop the island. But most importantly, the players have to deal with the Flip, an event which will change the perspective of the island, and move the play to an entirely different map, one where is it a lot more difficult to survive and get away from the Monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help them, the players search through the island looking for items that boost their abilities, movement and overall make their job easier. However, the traps are hidden amongst the same treasures that they need to find items, so event this is a perilous task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome To D Island!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
