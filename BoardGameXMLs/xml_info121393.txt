							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crusader States</name>
									
			<description>Crusader States is a non-collectible card game for 3-5 players. Each player represents one of the major European crusader factions as they attempt to carve out a kingdom during their march to the Holy Land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards represent key nobles, money, cities, soldiers and titles as well as events and battles. By skillfully playing your hand you attempt to form a kingdom that is both powerful in votes and powerful enough to fend off the lurking Saracens as well as your fellow crusaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
