			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blastkrieg Mountains rise up from rolling hills and immense forest to stand as a beacon in the distance of the oncoming lake just beyond their rise. They have been home to the Orcs of Clan Angrep and their Goblin allies for centuries and act as a bastion for their people. Protecting them from the elements and those who would do them harm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a year the Stronghold at the heart of the mountain opens its doors. and the Orcs within go down to the Goblin encampment at the entrance to the mountain range to prepare for a week-long festival. During the first week of summer few places are as lively or exciting as the Goblin Encampment in the Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You all have come along the winding cobblestone road through the deep forest surrounding the mountains, excited to join in the celebrations. Food, ale, contests of wit and might at every corner, the anticipation is almost too much to bare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet the forest is oddly quiet, the road seems less travelled than to be expected of the day before the coming of the festival. After miles of deep green wood, the path gives way on either side to what was once lush and green swamp life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, however, the swamps waters are brackish. and black. What were once healthy trees rise up out of the murk like skeletal hands grasping at the sky. The already sparse wildlife disappears entirely as you make your way along the last section of the cobblestone path. Ahead you spot what appears to be a cart overturned out in the brackish water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shadows of weapons jutting out of the mire just at the edge of your vision...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 2nd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
