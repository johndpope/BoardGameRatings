			<description>Explore temples and swipe artifacts with your friends! You won't get very far alone, but who knows if your friends can be trusted?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ruinous, each player is an adventurer attempting to collect valuable items within dangerous ruins. They must brave these deadly ruins while balancing teamwork and trickery on the way to finding ancient Artifacts - powerful and expensive items that imbue their holders with unique abilities. But be careful: no item or player is safe from treachery! The first player to collect and sell at least $1000 worth of treasure and artifacts wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it's your turn to explore a ruin you may first assemble an adventure party made up of other players in the game. The more people you recruit, the easier it is to overcome traps and obstacles. But keep in mind, they're still your enemies! Offer them a cut of the treasure to encourage cooperation, but remember: in the depths of the world's darkest ruins there are no contracts, there are no witnesses and sometimes only one survivor... So always prepare for an opportunistic backstabbing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you enlist the help of your rivals or attempt to go it alone? Are your fellow adventurers trustworthy? Are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
