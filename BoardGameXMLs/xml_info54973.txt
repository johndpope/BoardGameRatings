			<description>Subtitle: Schwertmeister - Set 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The heroes of Das Schwarze Auge have grown beyond their continent. They have become experienced veterans, elite heroes.&lt;br/&gt;DSA Professional is dedicated to all those who have reached at least 15th level and lived through countless adventures in Aventuria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But although this box was developed as an advanced game for The Black Eye, you don't have to know DSA to become a swordmaster. You should have some knowledge about the techniques and possibilities of roleplaying though, since the basics of roleplaying will not be explained in this set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a detailed, breathtaking combat system with series of attacks and parries, feints, dodge maneuvers, hit locations, wear and tear of armor, etc.&lt;br/&gt;- 18 runestones to tangibly cast your spells. A magic system with boundless variety that will leave the heroes speechless.&lt;br/&gt;- an adventure unlike any before. Join an expedition into the unknown and enter the world of the Tharun swordmasters.&lt;br/&gt;DSA Professional: the challenge for all roleplayers. As a player you will find the rules for advancing up to 40th level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you feel like calcuting the number of new spells, have fun:&lt;br/&gt;1*3 + 2*3 + 3*3 + 4*3 ... + 18*3 = ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 rulebook&lt;br/&gt;1 adventure book&lt;br/&gt;18 runestones&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
