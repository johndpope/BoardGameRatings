			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It happens a little bit differently for everyone usually in the places where the walls are thin and the brambles are overgrown. Perhaps you were playing hide and seek with some friends when a voice from the closet called out your name a siren song for the young and curious. You might have been digging through your toy chest when you happened to just fall right in. Who knew toy chests could be so deep and dark? Maybe it was even something as simple as waking up one morning and realizing that the bed and room you were in was not your own in spite of the striking similarities, and that the voice calling you down to breakfast did not belong to your dear mother after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
