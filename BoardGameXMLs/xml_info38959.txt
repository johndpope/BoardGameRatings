			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a sister-f@#%&amp;amp;*n' redneck-bluffin' hootin'-hollerin' good time!  Players take turns braggin' about their sisters. If you don't think someone's boast sounds convincing, you can f@#%* their sister to make sure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a hand of cards with different descriptors such as &amp;quot;...aint got no teeth&amp;quot;  and &amp;quot;...can suck the chrome offa trailer hitch!&amp;quot;  The starting player picks a saying and begins with &amp;quot;My sister...aint got no teeth.&amp;quot;  Each player in succession must repeat the previous players statements, then add one of their own: &amp;quot;My sister aint got no teeh and can suck the chrome offa trailer hitch.&amp;quot;  Play continues until someone calls &amp;quot;I'll f@#%* your sister!&amp;quot; at which point the last player to add to the chain must reveal cards from his hand that match each statement in the chain.  Whoever wins the challenge discards a random card from their hand, and play continues.  The first person to discard their hand wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
