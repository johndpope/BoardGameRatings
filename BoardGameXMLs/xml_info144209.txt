							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seasons of War:  Days of the Conqueror</name>
									
			<description>Days of the Conqueror is a mass-battle miniatures game for the period of William the Conqueror (11th century).  Units are composed of a number of stands of miniatures.  Units are rated by a die (D4, D6, D8, or D10) in each attribute:  Discipline, Morale, Attack, and Armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit must make a Discipline Test (with results of either Rash, Simple, or Strategic) each turn to determine what action it can or must perform.  Rash actions require units to make disadvantageous actions, while Strategic actions allow more complex actions such as reforming, force marching, and forming shieldwall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system is very &amp;quot;Risk-like&amp;quot; where the Armor dice of the defender are compared to the Attack (or missile) dice of the attacker, with each Attacking die that exceeds an Armor die causing a hit.  Units use their Morale attribute whenever they take damage to determine their reaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Army lists for Normans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Franks, Bretons are included.  Six typical scenarios are included as well as a campaign system that links the scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
