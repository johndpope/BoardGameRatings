							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outbreak: Deep Space</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outbreak: Deep Space is the first sci-fi module created for the award winning Zombie Survival RPG Outbreak: Undead created by the developers of the same system.&lt;br/&gt;Outbreak: Deep Space pushes the boundaries of sci-fi survival horror to the edges of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your players come face to face with mind enslaving parasites, terrifying alien races or be forced to confront the depths of their own madness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Outbreak: Deep Space?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The open-world system of Outbreak: Undead has been adapted for Outbreak: Deep Space to represent the claustrophobic confines of ship corridors and space stations. The introduction of a more rapid &amp;lsquo;sTime&amp;rsquo; (for &amp;ldquo;Ship Time&amp;rdquo;) allows periods of time to pass much more rapidly, meaning more Encounter checks, more dangers and a much more rapid pace to gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is different?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Health, Damage and Combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most notable difference between Outbreak: Undead and Outbreak: Deep Space is that Health and Combat are handled in a much more fast and loose fashion. The complex survival strategies of Outbreak: Undead gives way to a fast-paced action-horror with streamlined combat and damage systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology system of this setting far outstrips anything we can know or understand in present day. As such, instead of individual items, all gear is built on a chosen &amp;lsquo;Chassis&amp;rsquo;. The character's equipment is fully defined by the different customizable features the players wish to add and there is little to no limitation to the kinds of modifications they can make to their gear. Creating gear with Tech upgrades becomes an exciting art in and of itself and will give a character that extra edge in their desperate bid for survival!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is similar?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like in the Outbreak: Undead Core System, a character can earn Survival Points (or SP) by accomplishing missions objectives and use the SP to work towards an endgame scenario for dramatic scenario conclusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random Scenario Generators&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;no two games will ever be alike, as the ability to generate random scenario objectives, will allow a GM to experiment and weave narratives to link the randomly generated events together. Storytelling just got a lot easier now that you know the main plot points! The GM is always free to invent their own objectives and, more importantly, their own dramatic endings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your Zombie (Organisms) Survival Plan into the void of DEEP SPACE, and discover why YOUR ZOMBIE SURVIVAL PLAN WILL FAIL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
