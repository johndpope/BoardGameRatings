			<description>The Way of War is a Tactical Strategy Turn-based Role-playing game for the table top. The game can be played with action figures or with miniatures, whatever the preference of the players. The game is a hybrid of tactical strategy games and role-playing games. The game setting is set in a real 3-D environment with characters that improve with experience and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game turns go back and forth in the standard you go, I go system. Each character gets a certain amount of Action Points per turn, which determine what that character can do that turn. Moving, Shooting, Operating a Vehicle, interacting with terrain, using equipment all costs Action Points limiting what you can do each turn. What's unique in my game is that there is an interrupt system allowing you to react to enemy moves before they can attack you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic version of the game is set in the modern world with modern weapons and equipment. Characters are able to obtain Special Training to enhance their abilities in order to become further specialized. There are additional options in the game to include monsters, animals, cybernetic enhancements. Also included is the Private Contractors Campaign where you lead a group of mercenaries in helping to stabilize a country under attack by terrorists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
