			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone yelled &amp;bdquo;That armor&amp;rsquo;s too strong! Our weapons won&amp;rsquo;t dent it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fea peeked through a hole in the wall. The massive war robot tore down the  remaining pieces of that last block of buildings and was closing in on their position. She gave her comrades an inquisitive look before replying: &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have to bring it down, just stall it long enough for our transports to escape.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All eyes were on her. Everyone knew what that meant. If she couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of  something quickly that fight will not go too many rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robots and computers: no science fiction is complete without them. Be they small nanites or giant machines, driven by Artificial Intelligence or just dumb automatons. This book gives you guidelines to build robots and computers, new careers, benefits and the possibility to play a robot as character. It also contains dozens of sample robots ready to deploy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a must-have for every Traveller campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
