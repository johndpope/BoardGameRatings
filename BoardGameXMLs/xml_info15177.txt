			<description>W.I.T.C.H. kortspel (&amp;quot;card game&amp;quot; in Swedish) is a card game based on the Disney comic W.I.T.C.H.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player chooses between drawing a card from the pile of cards not yet drawn, or giving a card to the player next in turn. Cards drawn are placed in front of the player, without looking on the back side. A player that is given a card by the previous player has to draw a card, they can't give one away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most cards have a score on the front face (visible to the person in turn), while a few others are scrying cards. The scrying cards allow the player to turn one card over to read the prophecy there. The card is then left with the back up, and this gives that card a new score. The prophecy text is about characters in the comic, and has nothing to do with the game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one card can be turned for a player at one time, so if you get the option to turn another one over, you must first decide if you want to flip the reversed card you may have back, before turning over a new one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score when the deck runs out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt; - 32 cards.&lt;br/&gt; - Rules (one card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
