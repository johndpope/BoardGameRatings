							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Italian Job</name>
									
			<description>Why working  when others can do it for you?!?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survive to you Boss&amp;rsquo; fits of rages, inventing all kinds of bullshit  your mind can conceive,  just to convince the token boss to do the arduous job to another of the poor players at the table!&lt;br/&gt;The aim of each worker will be to make  their colleagues  do what he should ,  taking a cue from what is written on the cards!&lt;br/&gt;Players must survive to a bloody working day  or a task that NO ONE wants to accept!&lt;br/&gt;Cheat on  your boss, by taking the commitment to do it and then leave it someone else!&lt;br/&gt;Threaten your colleague, lest he appoints you as his substitute to do the tedious task!&lt;br/&gt;Have a great time with your imagination pretending to be engage  in other tasks with the events described on the cards in your hand!&lt;br/&gt;Put off, put off, put off work! Sooner or later someone else will do it!&lt;br/&gt;With the ability to play a different kind of &amp;quot;Boss&amp;quot; at each game (a politician, a gangster boss, an owner of a company, etc.), as well as to make this role interpret to more players during a single game, each session of Italian Job will be different from the previous one!!!&lt;br/&gt;AIM:&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the number of players, wins the player (or players)  who has less Hassles when the second player is out. Once reached the third Hassle, a player is out. Whenever a player will receive a Hassle, he will become the Boss. When the first player is out, he will play the role of Boss until the end of the game (that is until second player will be out)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
