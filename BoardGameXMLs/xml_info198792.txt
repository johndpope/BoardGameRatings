							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rangers Upon the Wild</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are all &amp;quot;Rangers&amp;quot; and belong to the same family (though the game does not specify the nature of family).  Rangers have Skills, with all Rangers being relatively competent in all Skills.  Rangers also have various Tools and Weapons.  Rangers are guided by the Rules of the Queen - in essence, humans belong in villages and animals belong in the wilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is implemented in Twine, an &amp;quot;open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories&amp;quot;, and presented as a series of HTML pages.  Play is assumed to be collaborative but could work as a solitaire endeavor.  The game presents a situation and then the players determine their relative success through narration and continue along one of a few options (somewhat like a &amp;quot;choose-your-own-adventure&amp;quot; structure).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
