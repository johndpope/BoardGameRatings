							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Peter Rabbit</name>
									
			<description>First made available to the public in 1995, the design for the game was originally submitted by Beatrix Potter to her publisher, Frederick Warne, in 1904.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board represents Mr. McGregor's garden, with 12 key points of interest from the book marked on the map, and is a reproduction of Potter's watercolor original.  Peter must enter at the gate, visit each of the twelve points (leaving a brass button behind to mark his visit), and then exit through the gate.  He is pursued in this endeavor by Mr. McGregor who is restricted to moving on the garden pathways, unlike Peter, and who wins by catching Peter.  Should McGregor choose to guard the gate rather than pursue Peter, an alternative escape route becomes available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes copies of Potter's handwritten rules for the game, as well as her original letter to the publisher introducing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
