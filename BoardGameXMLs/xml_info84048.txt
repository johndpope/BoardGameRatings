							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic Potions III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alchemists at Creation's Edge Games have whipped up another 50 potions for your d20 fantasy campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hasting Cloud&lt;br/&gt;This potion has a dual use. Drinking it causes the imbiber to become hasted as though they were the target of a haste spell (as described in the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Player's Handbook, Third Edition) cast at 8th level. Alternatively the owner can choose to shatter it upon the ground. This shattering releases the potion's magic in the form of a 20' billowing cloud. All creatures within this cloud become hasted as though they were targeted by a mass haste spell (as described in the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Player's Handbook, Third Edition) cast at 12th level. This cloud will effect up to 8 creatures and will dissipate as quickly as it formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
