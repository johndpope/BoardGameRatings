			<description>Includes 2 mini expansions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Blind Monkey, suggested by Vlaada Chv&amp;aacute;til.&lt;br/&gt;Cover one of your tiles to avoid giving info about your tiles.&lt;br/&gt;(and make it a bit harder to you)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Interferences by Toni Serradesanferm.&lt;br/&gt;Interferences are making the test more difficult, they interfere with the available tiles so you never know all of them for sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available at Essen 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the official rules I received by mail from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE BLIND MONKEY&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes 1 &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; tile and places it in front of him, beside the &amp;ldquo;Hand replenish&amp;rdquo; tile.&lt;br/&gt;PLAYING THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;At any time, the players can place their &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; on any purchased tile (they cannot place it on the &amp;ldquo;Discard Hand&amp;rdquo; tile), so the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; entirely covers it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The covered tile by the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo;:&lt;br/&gt;-Cannot be turned to take 3 more cards&lt;br/&gt;-Cannot be checked.&lt;br/&gt;SCORING PHASE&lt;br/&gt;Before Pass 1, players with the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; not over a purchased tile, place it aside as they do with the wrong combos.&lt;br/&gt;Pass 1.&lt;br/&gt;The players with the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; over a purchased tile, show it to verify if there are repeated tiles.&lt;br/&gt;If the tile under the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; is repeated, the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; is place aside with that tile.&lt;br/&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s not a repeated combo, leave the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; on the tile cards, so the tile can be clearly seen.&lt;br/&gt;Pass 3.&lt;br/&gt;If the smartest monkey verifies the tile cards where there&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; and finds that they are wrong, he places aside the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; along with the wrong tile.&lt;br/&gt;Pass 4.&lt;br/&gt;If the &amp;ldquo;BLIND MONKEY&amp;rdquo; has been placed aside, it counts as -2 victory points as the other wrong tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTERFERENCES&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;Once there are the combo stacks at the centre of the table, each player takes 1 &amp;rdquo;INTERFERENCE&amp;rdquo; tile and put it above one of these stacks.&lt;br/&gt;During setup, an &amp;rdquo;INTERFERENCE&amp;rdquo; cannot be put above another &amp;rdquo;INTERFERENCE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;PLAYING THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;At any time, the players can remove an &amp;rdquo;INTERFERENCE&amp;rdquo; from above a combo stack and place it above another one. In this way, they can show the combos (on a starting stack or on a single tile that a player set apart during game).&lt;br/&gt;During the game, an &amp;rdquo;INTERFERENCE&amp;rdquo; can be put above another &amp;rdquo;INTERFERENCE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;If only 1 stack remains at the centre of the table (this one with all the &amp;rdquo;INTERFERENCE&amp;rdquo; tiles on it), the players return all &amp;rdquo;INTERFERENCE&amp;rdquo; to the box and the games continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
