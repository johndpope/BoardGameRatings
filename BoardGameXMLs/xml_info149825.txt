			<description>A quiz game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round starts with a question and the setting of a 30 second timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two opportunities to answer the question (the questions are open, for example &amp;quot;Name a car brand that begins and ends with a consonant&amp;quot;, so there are always lots of possible answers). When a player answers, she puts her hand on the board. Next player puts her hand on top of the first hand and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the timer goes off, round is over. The topmost hand scores five points, the next hand scores four points and so on. Scores are recorded and the next round begins. The player with the most points after 20 rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
