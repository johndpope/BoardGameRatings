							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Symmetry</name>
									
			<description>Symmetry is an abstract 2-player game. Players need to create symmetrical patterns on the board to gain territory, while simultaneously preventing the opponent from creating symmetrical patterns on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry can be played using a Reversi set (board+stones).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The excact rules of Symmetry are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;-Black and White take turns putting stones on an NxN board (White starts).&lt;br/&gt;-When a stone placing causes a square on the board to be fully covered with stones, this square changes into the color of the last placed stone if the square in question has become horizontally or vertically &amp;acute;mirror&amp;acute; symmetric!&lt;br/&gt;-So &amp;acute;diagonal&amp;acute; symmetries will not cause any color change.&lt;br/&gt;-Symmetric squares can potentially have any size  (2x2, 3x3, 4x4 etc.)&lt;br/&gt;-Sometimes more than one square becomes a 'symmetry' by a move. All such squares change color.&lt;br/&gt;-The winner is the player who at the end has the most stones of their color on the board!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
