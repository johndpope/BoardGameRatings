			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Items of Luck and Skill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a little gambling? That high-stakes thrill where everything is on the line and you have to trust to luck to get you through. This book contains 5 new wondrous items, all of which are based on games of chance. Gaspar&amp;rsquo;s table of summoning selection brings carnival cup-in-the-ball games to life, but instead of winning a goldfish, you could win anything from a baboon to an adult red dragon, to fight for you for a brief time. Meanwhile, the fez of deceptive concealment allows you to turn the prospect of attacking you into a shell game, as opponents are forced to guess which of the three versions of you that they can see is the real one. Or, try a roll on gaspar&amp;rsquo;s wondrous dice, a pair of d6 that produce a variety of sensational results depending on what result is rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
