			<description>Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Media speculation from when the game was first announced was that Dragon Quest Builders would be a Dragon Quest version of Minecraft. Early screenshots show the player building a camp out of blocks; the camp gains levels based on how much it has been built up. Materials that are gatherable by the player include &amp;quot;rock, wood, fruit, plantlife, slime ooze, and more&amp;quot;. Monsters such as Slime and Dragon in original Dragon Quest will appear in the game. The player has a health bar, and early screenshots show a food meter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in Alefgard, the world of the original Dragon Quest. The game is based on a parallel ending of Dragon Quest: before the final battle, the hero accepted the evil Dragonlord's suggestion - each rules a half of the world. But that's indeed a trap, and the hero was eliminated, then the world was dominated by monsters. With time passing by, a new hero (the player character) appears to revive the desolate world. Players gather &amp;quot;material&amp;quot; all over the world in order to rebuild the land of Alefgard from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dragon Quest Builders&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
