			<description>Appearing in Europa Magazine #15, Enter Rommel (Europa Battle Scenario #2) is a specially numbered 4 page pullout in the center of the magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the introduction:)Enter Rommel is a scenario suitable for use with Western Desert of &amp;quot;War in the Desert.&amp;quot; Players may use either the original Western Desert rules or the later &amp;quot;War in the Desert&amp;quot; rules ... several additional rules and rule variations are included. Use of the special scenario rules is mandatory, while you may use the additional option rules as you see fit. However, be warned that the scenario was developed and play-balanced using all the additional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optionally, Enter Rommel can be used as an alternate starting point for a complete Western Desert or &amp;quot;War in the Desert&amp;quot; campaign game. For this reason, the Allied Order of Battle includes units in Gibraltar and Iraq. Disregard the setup of these units unless starting a campaign game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Situation. March 24, 1941: Rommel has just arrived in Africa and taken over command of the Axis forces there. Although ordered to stand on the defensive, he discovers that the British give ground easily to his probing attacks. Soon his &amp;quot;raid&amp;quot; becomes a full-blown offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
