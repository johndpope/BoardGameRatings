			<description>From publisher description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Co-operative Deck-Building!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No-one knows what dark secrets were whispered into the ear of magecraft's most promising student in generations. Whatever they were, they led him to reject the wisdom of his teachers and take short-cuts to power - ones that left him far less, or perhaps far more, than human. He is consumed with the desire to destroy the mages he felt were holding him back, at the head of an army of brainwashed followers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Are Not Ready To Face This&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Messianic Uprising is a challenging Foe deck that can run you out of Wounds without even putting any into your deck. Almost every card interacts the the others, leaving you with very little room for error. Worst of all, the Arcane Messiah himself becomes harder to kill and more dangerous the more of his minions are around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
