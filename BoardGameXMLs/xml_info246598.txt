			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real baseball is more than just hitting, pitching and fielding.  It's also your favorite major league teams, the great stars of today and the Allstars of yesteryear.  It's statistics and coaching, and it's managing your own game strategy.  With The World's Greatest Baseball Game, you have it all.  Pick your major league line-up using the actual player and team stats.  Then watch the action unfold against an opponent or the computer.  Two modes let you choose between managing and controlling your team or managing only.  The World's Greatest Baseball Game - everything you would ever want except the hot dogs and peanuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One or two players; joystick controlled&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
