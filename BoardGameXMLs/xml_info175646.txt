			<description>At the beginning of the game, four token are placed on every colored body-circle of the eight figures on the game board. The players start from the circle of their color in one of the four corners of the board. If they get on a colored body-circle, they get to stack one of the token on their playing piece. On a circle of his own color, the player takes all token on the circle. If a player gets on a space that is occupied by another player, he gets all the token from his playing piece, which is then returned to it's starting circle. The captured token can be brought back to the safety of ones starting circle. The game ends when all body-circles are empty and all playing pieces have returned to their starting circles. The player, who catures the most token wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
