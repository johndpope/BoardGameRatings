			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you enjoy taking selfies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Always crave for those pictures that will get you tons of like?&lt;br/&gt;Wanna mess with your friends by posting their embarrassing photos on social networks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or just simply want a short and simple game which haves long lasting consequences?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If YES then Style Up is the perfect game for you.&lt;br/&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s main theme is based on an activity that most young people enjoy &amp;ndash; taking photos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is rather simple. On your turn, you play a card from your hand. These cards will let you draw more cards in 5 different ways. But, there&amp;rsquo;s a little twist, to use the card, you must maintain a special pose/gesture (specified on the card) until your next turn. After drawing some cards, hopefully you will have enough to purchase equipments from the store. These equipments may help you in various ways or win you the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most exciting part of Style Up is AFTER the game ends. Because the Losers must make silly pose (based on the cards) and have their photos taken. Furthermore, those photos will be shared online for the world to see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There you have it, a simple relaxing game that&amp;rsquo;s a fine combo of two trending hobby!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And don&amp;rsquo;t forget to #StyleUp when sharing your trophy (embarrassing photos of your friends)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
