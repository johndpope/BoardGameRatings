			<description>Beyond the Beyond is a console role-playing game that was developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation in 1995. Beyond the Beyond was the first traditional console role-playing game available for the PlayStation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in Beyond the Beyond is, for the most part, standard for a console role-playing game. However, the turn-based battle system does contain one feature that was not standard in console role-playing games of the time. Dubbed the &amp;quot;Active Playing System&amp;quot;, this feature allows the player to increase the chances of either landing an improved attack on an enemy or defending from an enemy attack by pressing the X button at the correct time during battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Beyond, unlike most RPGs of the PSX era, offers more side quests and three secret characters. It is also longer than most PSX offerings, with total gameplay time averaging between 124 and 144 hours. It has been argued that the gameplay time is extended due mostly to long and complex dungeons, frequent random encounters, and the steep difficulty of bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Beyond the Beyond,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from a merged entry&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the case&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Battle Evil when Two Kindoms Collide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Evil Force, shackled for centuries, throbs like a heartbeat within the Earth as it seeks open air! And in the body of a youth beats the soul of a poet and heart of a lion. Stride into Darkness with young Finn and his vigilant firebreathing dragon as they hunt down the Evil that threatens to annihilate the world. Luanch into a quest Beyond imagination - and possiblly Beyond endurance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
