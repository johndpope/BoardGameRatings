			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How often do you really think about the gear your characters carry for the day-to-day business of being an adventurer? Sure, you have a backpack, and a lantern, and a ten-foot pole. You might have lockpicks, and torches, and rope. It's all functional, generic, and boring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trinkets - Adventurers' Gear aims to liven up the gear you carry, injecting some personality and intrigue to the mundane items you use in your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trinkets line is intended to inject more detailed descriptions, variety and flavour into your RPG worlds. The tables you'll find inside this book are system-agnostic, but work most easily in a fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this download you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    tables full of new and unique trinkets that your players will be intrigued by every time they use them - and they'll use them a lot&lt;br/&gt;    over 100 unique and interesting pieces of adventuring gear ready to drop straight into your game, eash designed to add depth to your worlds and to provide interesting hooks for future adventures&lt;br/&gt;    adventure hooks, NPCs, and new locations to drop into your games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
