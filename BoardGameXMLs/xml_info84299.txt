			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patrician II is set in early 14th century Northern Europe. It is a highly detailed real-time nautical trading simulation game. It uses unique political, military, merchant and naval combat elements from the historical background of that era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game as a minor trader having a small cog. You are a citizen of Lubeck, one of the 20 cities of the Hanseatic League. Your purpose is to gain fame and fortune, to become a Patrician, your town's Mayor and later, even the leader of the Hanseatic League. You do these by trading heavily among the 20 cities, by increasing the number of your ships, by investing in your home town as well as in other cities of the League, and by fending off pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can, on the other hand, become a pirate and gain your fortune by means of piracy and smuggling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patrician II offers many kinds of gaming experience. You can choose to play a single mission or an epic lifelong quest in a single player experience or against real life opponents on the same computer or via internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
