			<description>In 1990 Kick Off 2 was released by Anco. It was even more successful than its predecessor. Kick Off 2 retains the pace and accuracy of the universally acclaimed Kick Off, with a full size multi directional scrolling pitch and the players, markings, goals etc, in correct proportions. Both teams play the game strictly according to tactics. Players move into position to receive passes and gain possession. The ball, as in real game, travels ahead of the player thus making a tackle a matter of skill rather than of choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kick Off 2 like real soccer, requires skills in ball control for passing, dribbling, shooting etc. Accuracy in shooting, the ability to swerve or bend the ball to score, when taking free kicks need a lot of practice. The practice option allow to practice the ball skills and set pieces, without being harassed by the opposition and practice the skills to perfection. If two players are to team up, it is an ideal opportunity to practice ONE - TWO up and down the pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of attributes and skills suitable for the skill level at which the game is being played. An International is superior to 4th div. player in all departments. One of the most useful options is the provision to set the skill levels of both teams independently. A novice with International Squad can give a professional with 4th Division Squad a run for his money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a league and a cup tournament with sudden death penalty shoot outs, in case of a draw. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but with different styles of play and the player skills to match, that style. There is an option to load your own team from &amp;quot;Player Manager&amp;quot; along with your own tactics, to play against another &amp;quot;Player Manager&amp;quot; team in a single game or enter league and cup tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special events selection in the main menu allows data disks to be loaded. Kick Off 2 also provides the facility to change strip colours and on expanded Atari ST's (1 MB or above) there are additional sound effects. The &amp;quot;Action Replay&amp;quot; facility allows you to see the goals at normal pace or in &amp;quot;Slow Motion&amp;quot; and compile your own &amp;quot;Golden Goals&amp;quot; disk. There are 24 referees and have their own distinctive temperaments. Some referee turns a &amp;quot;blind eye&amp;quot; and someone has a pack of red cards to distribute. On the other hand, like human beings, they have good days and bad days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kick Off 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
