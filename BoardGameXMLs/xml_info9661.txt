			<description>Players play one of four humanoid &amp;quot;Tunnel Rats&amp;quot;, each represented by a painted plastic miniature. The rats are trying to find their way out of an ancient underground city through the use of an electronic compass. The pyramid shaped compass contains 16 different maps for the maze board and shows players if they hit an &amp;quot;invisible wall&amp;quot; (counters are included to represent the walls). The first player to navigate their way out of the maze wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; Tunnel Rats Adventure comic book to assist with the theme of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to &amp;quot;Lost Treasure&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dark Tower&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Electronic Dungeons and Dragons&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Trapped by a landslide in an ancient underground city, the Tunnel Rats must find their way to the secret passage that will take them back to the surface before their supplies are exhausted. Although there are 16 different routes to the hidden tunnel, they are enclosed by invisible walls that can only be detected by the Tunnel Rats' ELECTRONIC compass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determined to be the first to reach the surface, each of the Tunnel Rats takes a starting position on the map of the ruined city. Then the ELECTRONIC compass is turned on and selects one of the secret routes. The first to escape through the secret passage is the winner!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard is 15x15 grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
