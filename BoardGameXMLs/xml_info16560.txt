			<description>This game was created to encourage players to find their own hidden spiritual self and to illuminate our understanding of ourselves in relationship to others and to the universe. The first section of the game involves questions of a Physical, Mental, and Spiritual nature. Further play reveals Insight questions, which elicit unexpected answers, and ultimately challenge each player to overcome self-deception and gain true insight. In answering the questions, players discover personal revelations which facilitate positive change and give rise to new visions for the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
