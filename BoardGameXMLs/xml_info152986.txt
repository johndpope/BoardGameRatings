			<description>GeoCards World includes fifty cards with which players can play three games that challenge their geographical knowledge. Each card is double-sided, with the outline of a country, its name, its population and its size on one side of the card and its capital and the surrounding countries on the other. In all three games, whoever collects the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first game, shuffle the cards with the capitals face-up, then take turns naming the country depicted on the card. Guess right and you claim the card; otherwise, remove the card from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second game, deal the cards out evenly among the players with the capitals face-up. On a turn, you hold one of your cards capital side-out toward your left-hand opponent. If he can name one of the countries adjacent to the depicted country, he claims the card; if not, the next opponent in clockwise order can try to do so. Remove the card from the game if no one guesses correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the third game, deal ten cards capital side-up to each player. On a turn, choose two cards and hold them out to your left-hand opponent. If he can guess which country is larger in size or population (depending on what choose at the start of play), he claims both cards; otherwise, remove the card from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
