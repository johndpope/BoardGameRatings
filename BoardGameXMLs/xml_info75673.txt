			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mortals Stumble in Darkness; Heroes Light the Way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcanis is a world of high fantasy, intrigue, and suspense. Diplomacy, skill, and discretion will carry you as far or farther than skill at arms or in the arts of magic. Heroes come in a myriad of forms. Some are fantastic beings born with the blood of Valinor or the souls of elementals. Others are the descendants of Celestial Giants who once roamed the stars as freely as a fish swims the sea.
