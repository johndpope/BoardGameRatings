							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Opera Game</name>
									
			<description>There are 3 ways to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Type 1&lt;br/&gt;The first involves dealing out cards face down. The remaining deck is placed faced down. The first player draws a card. Cards are drafted by each player. There is a 5 card maximum hand limit. You may discard cards and other players may draft the discarded cards. You are trying to collect the sets of performers to perform your famous opera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Type 2&lt;br/&gt;Same as first game but the completed operas are scored and better operas will score more than more minor operas. The game is played to a score of 40 with operas scoring from 12 to 18 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Type 3 is the expert game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To score bonus turns you must answer trivia question correctly about the operas in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photography: Ron Scherl&lt;br/&gt;Opera questions: Kenn Harris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
