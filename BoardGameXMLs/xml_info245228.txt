			<description>In The Glory That Was Greece (GTWG), you, as a conglomeration of city-states, are seeking to expand your economy.&lt;br/&gt;That means you must colonize new territories, gain allies, and support the growing levels of civilization. While players control specific city-states, they do not represent a specific city-state. GTWG is also a game that requires the players to not only control areas, but to effectively use them to build, maintain and use colonies as well as to maximize Resources.&lt;br/&gt;GTWG is, at heart, an economic building/conflict game. Warfare is extremely limited and somewhat restricted, as it was historically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn a player collects resources from their territories, play cards, and pays their armies. Every card grants an amount of activation points which are used for activating armies, building new colonies, adding population to colonies, and raising new armies and fleets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player controls 10 city-state areas, he automatically wins.&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise at the end of the game (when the last card is drawn from the deck) every city-state area, colony, and resource point are accounted. The highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
