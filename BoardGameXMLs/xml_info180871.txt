			<description>KONTER (&amp;quot;Counter&amp;quot;) is a dice-handball game with tactics, fast pace and team spirit &amp;ndash; for 2 dice-handball game players, 10 years and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sport of (European) handball is characterized by quick moves and a lot of goals. KONTER has been inspired by this; with its specific game course, it creates a similar feel of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     On his turn, the active player rolls two dice at the same time &amp;ndash; for himself and for his opponent (passive player). Now the active player chooses one die for the passive player and puts the die on its tray. If he uses his Tactics cards, the active player may change the number rolled on his die.&lt;br/&gt;     After that, he immediately carries out an action; e.g., he can substitute a playing figure with a &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; and strengthen his own defense, or he can try to start an offense to get a chance of throwing a goal. Then, with his die, the passive player has a consequent reaction, e.g., guarding opposing offense spaces with a &amp;quot;1,&amp;quot; or fine-tuning his own tactics.&lt;br/&gt;     Both players try to use their &amp;quot;all-rounder&amp;quot; (a playing figure with special abilities) tactically and cleverly; there are different kinds of throws, fouls with 2-minute penalties, yellow cards and just one &amp;quot;Super Glove&amp;quot;; for reinforcement, the &amp;quot;Team Spirit&amp;quot; comes into play&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has &amp;quot;thrown&amp;quot; the most goals by the end of the game wins. And who else does? Of course, the player with the best tactics, the fastest pace, and with the Team Spirit as the eighth player on his side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
