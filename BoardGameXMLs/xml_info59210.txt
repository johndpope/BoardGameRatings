			<description>The object of this game is to make the journey around the board--driving a little metal car--the most times and be the only player with any money remaining at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the dice and move around the outside of the board, following instructions on the spaces which deal with traffic &amp;amp; weather conditions, speed limits, rest areas, one-way streets and all sorts of other driving experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a Jail space (you've been pulled over and need to take a breathaiyzer test) and a Courtroom space (Must roll a six or pay the bank $500). Two colors of cards get you rewards for being a good driver and fines for being a lousy one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
