			<description>In June 1944, the Russian High Command decided to knock Finland out of the war with an offensive designed to ultimately reach Helsinki. On paper, the Red force allocations seemed to guarantee victory by 4 to 1 and more. Hundreds of tanks, artillery and aircraft were opposed by weak Finnish forces, many of them at only 50% strength. Only a few Finnish divisions opposed over 15 Red divisions at full strength.The Finns were clearly worried and rightly so, as when the Red offensive began in late June, one Finnish defensive line crumbled after another! The only equalizer was the terrain mostly of forests and lakes. The few key roads channeled any offensive plans. By the 28th of June, the Finns had already sounded the SOS call to the Germans for help. Hitler sent in the Luftwaffe, StG 303, and hundreds of Panzerfausts and Panzerschrecks. The Red steamroller stalled, started and inched closely to Ihantala, the last Finn defenses. When July arrived, Ihantala was threatened. The Finns were close to collapse-but would they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
