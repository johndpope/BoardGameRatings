			<description>Excerpt from the pdf:&lt;br/&gt;The players in this adventure are all minor celebrities who have attended a television convention called Boxplosion. No sooner have they supped a little cheap coffee, eaten a free pastry and settled into a pretty tedious press junket than, wouldn't you know it, zombie apocalypse instantaneously occurs.&lt;br/&gt;Will the players survive? Will their brains provide a snack for their televisual peers, or their fans? Or will they themselves succumbing to the zombie plague before they can make their escape? Find out in the No Dice scenario that's too hot for TV.&lt;br/&gt;This adventure uses the standard No Dice Vanilla Rules which are outlined in the Core Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is available as a free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
