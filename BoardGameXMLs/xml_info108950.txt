							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkness Over Keryhk Nhor (Fantasy Craft)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly a century ago, the once great Dwarven Empire abandoned the Jagged Reaches when the mines collapsed and a majority of the miners were killed. Keryhk Nhor, the Great Western Hall and source of great pride to the Dwarven Empire, was sealed and has not been opened since. That is, until today. The question is two-fold: who was powerful enough to break the Seal of the Iron Mage and why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness Over Keryhk Nhor serves as a continuation of the Old School Fantasy series, a nice one-off, or a side trek to drop into your ongoing fantasy campaign. It is an adventure filled with action, gnoll slavers, risen dwarves, and a murky old dungeon (cleverly disguised as a dwarven hall). Remember those days when sometimes you just wanted to let your hair down, grab some dice, and have an excuse to kill things? Good. This one&amp;rsquo;s for you. Remember, Reality Blurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
