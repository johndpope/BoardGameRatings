			<description>Road Rash 64 for the Nintendo 64 was released in 1999. It is noteworthy because Electronic Arts did not design or publish it. Instead, the intellectual property rights were licensed to THQ, who in turn had its own studio, Locomotive Games (founded by former EA employee Don Traeger), develop the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road Rash 64 was also designed similarly to F-Zero X in that the game used very low polygon models, low resolution textures, and few special effects so that the game could instead feature several dozen motorcycles, traffic models, and obstacles while being able to keep a high frame rate. The game was more focused on the combat aspects the earlier 16-bit games featured, and was ahead of its time in terms of customizable settings in a console game. N64 owners with a Ram Expansion Pak were able to choose from Wide Screen, Letterbox, and High Resolution settings in addition to the default graphics setting. The game also managed to feature five of the tracks (two of them 100% unedited) from Road Rash 3D through audio compression software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the games before it, which used a single long road in independent locales, Road Rash 64's races took place on routes laid out through a single interconnected road system. The race routes were pieced together from branching road segments. The four corners of the game world had distinctly different geographic features. Once past the first level the races would be between or through different locales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Road Rash 64&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
