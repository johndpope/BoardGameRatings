			<description>From back of box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sniff, sniff ... it smells like cheese! &lt;br/&gt;Oskar, the cheeky mouse creeps closer to outwit the cheese. &lt;br/&gt;but alas, the mousecatcher lies in wait! &lt;br/&gt;He tries to catch the mouse before he reaches his goal. &lt;br/&gt;Who wins - mouse or mousecatcher?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to prevent the other player from reaching the mouse hole. This can be done Oscar the &amp;quot;sneaky&amp;quot; little mouse, and his sister, Lilly, sit in their mouse apartment drinking tea. &amp;quot;Sniff, sniff...,&amp;quot; something smells like cheese! From the church kitchen over the stairs, the smell of cheese fill the whole apartment. Will they try to &amp;quot;sneak&amp;quot; a piece of cheese? Will they be caught by the mouse catcher?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays the mouse who is trying to get to a square with the cheese without getting caught. The mouse moves by rolling a custom die that has a one, two, three and a X on it. Once the player has moved, the mouse catcher rolls the die and places that many red gates around the mouse trying to trap it. The game ends when either the mouse has gotten to the cheese or the mouse catcher has trapped the mouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
