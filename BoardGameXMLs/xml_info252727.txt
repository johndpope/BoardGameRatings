			<description>PvP Fighting Arena Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An illegal, underground fighting pit has orchestrated nonlethal fights in an undisclosed location in a big city. Over the years, it has grown from minor nuisance to a secretive, political cabal that controls and terrifies almost everyone in the know. However, its non-lethal fights seem to have become more dangerous. A woman rumored to be one of the combatants has disappeared, prompting a world faction and the woman&amp;rsquo;s disabled father to seek help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any Party Size, Any Level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of this adventure allows the DM to run this story for any level party, regardless of how many players there are. That said, it works best for lower-level characters, because the DM will have to control NPC adventurers, and higher-level characters have so many class options that it can be overwhelming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
