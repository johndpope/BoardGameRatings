							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventures Under the Laughing Moon Role-Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures Under the Laughing Moon is a fantasy role-playing game that introduces players to the world of Mythren where magic and danger are a part of everyday life.  Prophecies warn of magical persecution and the rise of ancient powers.  Shadows of evil threaten the lands as a call for heroes is sounded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A story-based, character driven RPG, this is a great introductory game for anyone new to the RPG scene, or veteran gamers looking for something new. Similar in style to other story-based games like D&amp;amp;D, Laughing Moon players have a variety of skills that help define their characters without limiting them to a single &amp;quot;class.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills, magic, occupations and creature concepts are very open for player input.  This is a story based game designed to accompany the Laughing Moon Chronicles fantasy series.  It's a quick and easy adventure setting for new players with a system designed to support a story created by the game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are able to create characters of their own and become a part of the epic story found in the fantasy series, The Laughing Moon Chronicles.  Enter a world of ancient mystery, and a system of magic that lures sorcerers toward forbidden power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seek items of power, battle creatures of darkness and uncover the mysteries beneath the Laughing Moon in this tabletop role-playing game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
