			<description>This is a dexterity game from Brazil for 2-4 players.  It consists of a arced base with a flat caricature of boy; his hands clip on and hold a bar.  On your turn, you roll a die and you place however many disks that the die says onto the bar.  The die has an empty side, 2 ones, 2 two's, and one three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
