							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diamonds</name>
									
			<description>Diamonds is a baseball game from the perspective of the team manager.  Each manager has a set of player cards, each with individual skills ratings.  Players determine the batting order and starting pitcher.  As the game plays out, players can make substitutions and other managerial decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is sold both as a Basic Edition, with 4 different teams, and a League Edition with 6 teams and un-laminated player cards (so that managers can name their own players).  Both use the same rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains four or six 25-card team decks, several other play cards, a sheet of uncut markers, and four dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
