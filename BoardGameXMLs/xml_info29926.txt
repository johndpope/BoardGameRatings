			<description>Big Builder appears to be an educational game, as it was produced in part by the Ohio State University Research Foundation and is an &amp;quot;Industrial Art Curriculum Project,&amp;quot; according to the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game players move around a set of different tracks in an effort to bid on and complete major construction projects (e.g., a bridge, a dam, etc.).
