			<description>OBJECT:  To be the first player to move all four of his playing pieces from matching base to matching finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY: &lt;br/&gt;1.  First player must roll a one or a four to move any of his playing pieces from BASE to START.  Play moves to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Once a playing piece has been placed on START, player may move four spaces, he is entitled to an additional turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Each time a player rolls a four and is able to move four spaces, he is entitled to an additional turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  A player must roll the exact number to move his playing pieces into the HOME spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.  A player may not pass or land on one of his own playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.  When a player lands on a space occupied by ANOTHER PLAYER, he replaces that player's playing piece with his own and sends the other player's playing piece back to the matching base, where that player must start again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BONUS:&lt;br/&gt;1.  When a player's roll of the die places his playing piece exactly on any of the six black BONUS spaces, around the center of the board, he may, on his next turn, choose to move that playing piece around the board, using the black BONUS spaces only and thus shorten the path to HOME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  He moves the number of spaces as rolled, counting around the BONUS spaces until he reaches the row by his HOME and continuing down that row the remaining number on the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOUBLE BONUS:&lt;br/&gt;1.  The center black space is a double bonus space that may be entered from any location on the board, by rolling the exact number to land there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  In order to leave the double bonus space, a player must roll a one and he then proceeds to any of the six bonus spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;IN BOTH OF THE ABOVE BONUS CASES, IF A PLAYER LANDS ON A BONUS SPACE ALREADY OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER PLAYER, RULE 6 OF PLAY APPLIES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO WIN:  To be the first player to move all four playing pieces to the matching home is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
