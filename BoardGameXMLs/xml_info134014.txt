			<description>A traditional roll the dice and move on game that incorporates the theme of safety in the workplace.&lt;br/&gt;The game allows for you to jump ahead in the game by taking 'short cuts'. You may get in the lead quickly but there is a cost involved. You may get away with gambe, you may have an accident and have to put a plaster on you. Get 3 plasters and you are killed off.&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to train people that where taking a short cut in processes may pay off in the short term, in the long term you are gambling with your life.&lt;br/&gt;The game is Print &amp;amp; Play and involves a board, sets of cards and a rule sheet. You will also need a box of plasters and a simple timer if you want to keep the game to a specified time.&lt;br/&gt;If you decide to incorporate this into your workplace you could use counters that have something to do with that business: As a can manufacturer we used mini aerosol cans.&lt;br/&gt;An understanding of PPE would be helpful. (Personal Protective Equipment)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
