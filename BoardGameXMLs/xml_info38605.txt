			<description>&amp;ldquo;The Seven Years War (1756 - 1763) was a military struggle between Britain and Prussia on one side, and France, Russia, Austria, and Sweden on the other.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The leading military figure in the conflict was King Frederick II of Prussia, later known as Frederick the Great. One of his innovations was the oblique attack order. This maneuver was designed to bring the bulk of his army against one of the enemy's flanks, defeating it decisively before the entire enemy army could become engaged. At the battle of Leuthen (1757) he used the strategy effectively to defeat a larger Austrian army.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale miniature figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opposing forces are composed of Cuirassier, Hussars, Musketeers, Grenadiers, Dragoons, Cannons, and Commanders. Only one terrain feature is marked on the game table - the village of Leuthen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
