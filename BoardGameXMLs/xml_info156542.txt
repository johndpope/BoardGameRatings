			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Winston!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located on the trailing edge of the Clement Sector frontier, Winston is one of only two colonized worlds in the Winston subsector.  Winston is a harsh world both in its frozen environment and in the rule of its newly installed military dictatorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can this totalitarian government continue to rule?  Will your characters help to overthrow it?  Will they help to keep it in power?  Or is this government merely an obstacle for scoundrel characters to circumvent through smuggling?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Worlds 26: Winston comes with detailed descriptions and maps of the Winston system and the planet itself.  UWPs and a map of the Winston subsector are also included to provide a basis for future adventures.  It also features political, legal, and cultural details designed to get your characters directly immersed into the action as fast as possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See the vast snowy surface!  Visit explosive Mount Rudolph!  And find out why hurling tomatoes may be the beginning of a revolution!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Worlds 26: Winston has been designed with the busy Referee in mind.  Winston is an interesting and exciting place that can be easily added into any existing Traveller campaign.  While Winston has been designed to fit into our Clement Sector setting, it can be easily adapted to fit into any Traveller campaign with ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And short of ideas?  We've added several adventure hooks to get your creative juices flowing and allow you to make a visit to the Winston system one your characters will remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
