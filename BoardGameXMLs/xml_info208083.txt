			<description>Outlawyered is a law based card game that puts players in the the suit and lawsuit of an attorney. Each player is given three clients and must do what they can to be the first to win 5 trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must use their given Briefcase cards to play various types of Evidence (Ex. Expert Witness and Mistress' Testimony) and Lawyer Tools (Ex. Objections and Outlawyered cards)in order to prevail. Each round sees one player's client get sued by the deck. The player must fight off opposing players to secure their client's freedom, and a trial win. But be careful, just because you win at the trial level does not guarantee a victory at the Super Ultimate Court!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win at trial the player must keep their client's Trial Score above the designated Trial Card's Conviction Score. Evidence cards can either decrease or increase the Trial Score while Lawyer Tools can dramatically impact the game in various ways, including negating a strong piece of evidence or even changing out which player is on trial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No legal experience is needed nor will any be gained by playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
