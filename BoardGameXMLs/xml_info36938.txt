			<description>In this panda-themed game, players move along black and white squares of a game board, drawing cards with panda facts and movement directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created by 9 year-old Amanda Wilcox along with twin sister Laura and their mother Melynda.  They started working on the game when Amanda was only about eight years old.  Proceeds of the game go to Washington DC's Smithsonian National Zoological Park Giant Panda Conservation Fund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
