			<description>Dept. 13 is a game in which players use the Steel and Glory System to battle the creatures created by Occult Nazi Forces. Dept. 13 is a secret government agency dedicated to fighting supernatural forces. The game includes super spies (who are identified only by one letter initials), Nazi zombies, ghouls, mad scientists, and themes of occult horror. As with the other games in the S&amp;amp;G system, the battles are very quick and can be fought one-on-one or with players each controlling large groups. Each character has several unique stats, including their fighting ability, and the cost to hire them as a mercenary into your fighting force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players activate a character which can take up to two actions, including fight, move, rest, climb, or stand/go prone. Characters can attack enemies that are one square away for melee attack or may use ranged attack for enemies further away. Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. Victory is achieved by having a character remain on a certain part of the board for three complete uninterrupted turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
