							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Introductory Rules for Ships: Crews, Combat, and Trade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pirates, Norse Deities, magic, wanton elves, Cthulhu, and rum in the Southwest Pacific!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t do it&amp;hellip;I mean, a fantasy RPG with actual rules for sailing ships that can allow you to run an encounter in less than 37 hours? Adventures starting at Rick&amp;rsquo;s in the thriving seaport of Tenaru on Guadalcanal? An actual game mechanic for the players that just have to hit on the elf serving wench? Zombies invading Savo Island and only YOU can stop them?  15 minutes to create a character? This is why you started playing RPG&amp;rsquo;s, come home and enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course since this is free it is not the complete game, just an introduction with the rules for sailing ships and a couple of scenarios, hopefully enough that combined with the blurb above you will be excitedly checking DriveThruRPG or our Facebook Page to make sure you are one of the first purchasers when the full game is released in PDF on or around March 20th, 2014 with the print version following as quickly as I can arrange the layout work.  In the meantime give these rules a try with your current fantasy RPG, it won't be quite the same but hey, any time you can work 'Avast ye scurvey dogs!&amp;quot; into a night's game, it's all good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
