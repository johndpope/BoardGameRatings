							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">13 Relics</name>
									
			<description>Hired by various sages, historians and merchants, the players must enter a newly unearthed, ancient underground stronghold,in search of 13 Relics.  The Relics were broke apart and scattered through the dungeon's 5 chambers. Once inside, though no one can leave until all of the chambers are free of Relic Cards.  The Players will need to find the two parts of each Rlic to make a match, allowing them to utilize it's magic (+1 Combat for instance).  While exploring the Dungeon, the Players will come across a host of Monsters, trapped within the Dungeon with them.  They must also evade devious Traps, evade diabolical Shadow Magic, find secret doors, and hunt for helpful potions to help them along the way.  Will the Players help one another survive and escape, or will they attempt to match the most Relics?  They may have to do both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have two different colored dice that they will roll at the start of their turn.  One is for movement, the other, the Dungeon Dice, will determine whether a player will have to draw a card from the Dungeon Deck, based upon 2 numbers from 1 to 6 that each player must choose at the beginning of the game.  When one of the five chambers is emptied of it's contents, it will collapse, never to hold a card again.  Each time a collapse occurs, the players must add another chosen number, increasing their chance of drawing from the Dungeon Deck.  Once all chambers are free from Relic Cards, the exits will open allowing Players to leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can decide the ultimate victory for their play.  Simply escaping the dungeon, making the most matches, being the last one alive are all valid goals for which to strive.  A standard win however, is to escape the dungeon with the most matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
