							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Barn</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of an old barn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Orc raiders! We have to get out of here!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The barn is a single map of a farmer&amp;rsquo;s room and barn and the surrounding farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map can be used in most settings. From fantasy to modern games to primitive worlds in a science fiction game. It would be only out of place in a truly primitive setting before brick and mortar architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The barn can be used for a lot of encounters. The small barn has a single bed, which would be enough for one farmer, or perhaps a farmer and his wife. They could end up being extremely friendly and helpful characters that offer them shelter in the barn if they don&amp;rsquo;t mind the smell of the place. They could offer them a meal for the night and/or to sell them food/provisions for the road or water from the well to wet their lips and fill their canteens. They could even rent or sell them their wagon and a horse if the group is encumbered with loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The farm could be the site of a murder investigation. The farmer or his wife could be dead or both of them. The group could be hired by a nearby village to investigate the murder(s). When they arrive, they approach the barn to begin their investigation. Were they killed by orcs who wanted to steal the farmer&amp;rsquo;s crops? Are monsters lurking in the barn inside the haystacks? They killed the horses first and then the farmer when he went to investigate. Did the farmer or his wife kill their spouse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
