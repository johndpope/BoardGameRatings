			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is the first portion in a series of connected adventures. The Border Prowler Series is designed to provide a Judge with a ready-made mini-campaign. This first adventure scenario is set up in tournament format, with handout sheets of equipment, and pre-generated characters. This particular mission can be accomplished with only a portion of the resources available in the crew and equipment of the Hrunta. Other crewmembers and other equipment will be called upon in subsequent scenarios. While this scenario is designed to be self-sufficient, and run with characters who are on active service, it can be set into an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Auxiliary Patrol Cruiser Hrunta is assigned a mission to travel to the Amycus system to investigate an unknown ground installation attempting to jam scanning equipment. A commando team and a team of analysts will investigate the anomaly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
