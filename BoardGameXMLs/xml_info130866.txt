			<description>AVSEQ (which we pronounce &amp;ldquo;A-V-Sekk&amp;rdquo;) is an audio-driven game based on an installation design by our chief programmer, Tom Betts, who multi-classes as an artist and musician. The idea behind the project was to create a challenging, abstract action game in which you link up atoms to obtain a high score. As you do that, however, you unlock the underlying structure to each level, which is a musical sequencer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, so now we&amp;rsquo;re getting to the origins of that strange name. AVSEQ = audio-visual sequencer. As you play through the pretty-looking visual atom-linking element of the game you also activate the sequencer grid, creating musical loops. This process is random, so each level playthrough will create a different loop, based on the grid of sounds you are able to unlock on that level. Each AVSEQ level has 2.2300745198530623&amp;times;10^43 possible audio permutations, thats 22 tredecillion in total. No, honestly, that&amp;rsquo;s a real number, we looked it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
