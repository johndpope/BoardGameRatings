							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Merchant Princes</name>
									
			<description>Concept:  Merchants in the ancient empire of Byzantium (circa 7th century) attempt to accumulate, trade, bribe, cheat and manipulate their way to becoming the richest Merchant Prince in the land.&lt;br/&gt;Summary: Assuming the role of one of four wealthy merchants in Constantinople, players develop a trading empire across Anatolia, buying goods in far off markets to sell in the city, while doing their utmost to undermine and obstruct their rivals. Players use Trader pawns to amass goods appearing across the board, avoiding dangerous local events and rival player skulduggery to bring the goods to the great bazaars. The player with the biggest merchant empire at game end is crowned the Merchant Prince of Byzantium. The game plays across a main geographical board with each player having a player board for storage of trade goods, special tiles, money etc. Stocks of Event and Option cards give each game complexity, depth and variation.&lt;br/&gt;Status: Game is currently being play tested and rules further modified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
