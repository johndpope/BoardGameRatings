							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wardenhale: Gambling Den</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Wardenhale, the city with a thousand names. City of Shadows. City of Trade, City of Justice. Wardenhale is like every city, and yet like no other&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wardenhale Gambling Den is a printable dungeon floorplan compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. It can be used as a standalone gameboard, or combined with any same-scale tileset. As part of the Wardenhale range, it can be combined with other maps in the set to make a huge city area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: &lt;br/&gt;From the outside, the building seems no different to countless others in the city of Wardenhale. In fact, if you were to enter the building you would simply find the offices of Dalor and Son: Import &amp;amp; Export Services and be asked to be on your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, if you knew the right people, you'd be shown through the back door and into the real business here - gambling. Patrons wager their livelihoods on the throw of a dice or the turn of a card, and if you are in the mood you can venture downstairs and bet on one of the illegal fights that takes place in the arene down there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxing fights, knife fights, bear baiting - it all happens in the Wardenhale Gambling Den&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
