			<description>The first in a series of sequel decks to the original, UK Games Expo Award Winning Lords of War games, this expansion adds a huge number of new Unit Types, new Ranks and new rules to the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alongside adding in new gameplay functions and mechanics, this expansion also introduces Moving Units to the Orc and Dwarf Factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first of the major new Unit Types included in this expansion are Magic Units, capable of buffing allies and damaging foes using Elemental Attacks and Spell Tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game introduces Monstrous Units - extremely tough cards with 'Monstrous Defence' which allows them to ignore low damage attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the Magic and Monsters Expansion also introduce Flying Units which are only vulnerable to Ranged Units and other Flying Units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While primarily designed as an addition to Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves, this expansion is also compatible with all other Lords of War Factions and adds additional Command Cards, Special Units and Elite Units to the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
