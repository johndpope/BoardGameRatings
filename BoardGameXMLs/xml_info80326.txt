			<description>From the back of the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sitting in the frigid waters off the Norwegian Sea, you guard the coastline and begin to plan a full-scale naval assault on the enemy.  Suddenly, sensors report a hidden submarine 60 degrees port side and a fleet of enemy ships 92 degrees starboard.  Knowing that the best defense is a good offense, you decide to attack.  And now, armed with an arsenal of over 100 high-powered weapons, you proceed to destroy everything that stands in the way of total sea control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the original Harpoon, one of the most sophisticated and realistic contemporary war games ever developed, Harpoon Classic 97 offers two games in one: (1) strategic, modern naval warfare with 50 new missions and (2) a gateway to Harpoon On-line with free Internet play via AOL.
