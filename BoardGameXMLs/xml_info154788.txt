							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lepelstronten: Het Bordspel</name>
									
			<description>Lepelstronten: Het Bordspel is the board game developed for the 8th anniversary of gaming club Stobbeldeen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using dice, players try to move their pawn to a central target as soon as possible. As soon as one of the players succeeds, the target moves, forcing the other players to change direction and try to reach the new location. During the first phase of the game, users can, instead of rolling the dice, choose to buy cards, which can be used during the 2nd phase to move faster or block other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who doesn't reach the target in time will be penalized. After a predefined number of rounds, the player who has the least penalty wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
