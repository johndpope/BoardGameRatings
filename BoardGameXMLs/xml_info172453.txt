							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">[d0x3d!] v2: a network security game</name>
									
			<description>Like its predecessor, [d0x3d!] v2 has players working together as a skilled team of hackers, pulling off a digital heist on a secured network to find and reassemble the pieces of their digital assets and escape before being detected by the network's administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players work against time, changing network topology, and increasingly aggressive sysadmins to score their objectives and get out before they're caught, or enough of the network is taken out of service to make reassembly or escape impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The v2 version of [d0x3d!] changes the modular board - instead of square, adjacent tiles with unrestricted movement, the network is now made up of (24) hex tiles with asymmetric pathing to challenge the players by forcing them to forge a path through the system, and adds two new hacker roles (the forensics ninja and the traffic spoofer) to complement the powers of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[d0x3d!] v2 is released with a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 license (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3&lt;/a&gt;.0), allowing for the free sharing and remixing of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
