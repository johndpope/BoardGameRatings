							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silver Bullet: Murder Mystery Game</name>
									
			<description>The players sit around a table for dinner (a real dinner) and each one is assigned a role within the game, and is given an envelope with a letter indicating something that only his character knows, as well as some instructions in the form of a menu that indicates how the dinner will be taking place. The game includes a DVD that seems to contain some instructions on events that will be happening during the dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the dinner progresses, players have to find out who has been the killer of a girl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone's a suspect when murder is on the menu. And with a Classic Detective Murder Mystery you have everything you need to serve up a perfect murder dinner party. First the invites, you choose which of your friends play which devious character. Then the shopping list, menu suggestions and recipes. Plus of course .....a really tasty murder to solve. We guarentee that it will be drop dead fun, and by the end of the evening one (or more) of the suspects, your 'friends' will be caught out as the murderer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The night of March 1905 saw a full moom rise over the remote Hampshire village of Thor Bridge. Here there are still some prepared to celebrate the coincidence of the old pre-Christian festivals of Eostrara and Lady Day. For weeks the village has been rife with rumours of pagan rituals, tales of the spitits and demons that would stalk the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even on this haunted and mysterious night, no one could have predicted the form that evil was to take. Until the body of Maria Gibson was discovered. The Brazilian wife of the millionaire who lives in the big house, she has been shot dead with a single silver bullet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one man can solve this bizarre case that seems shrouded in the folklore of three continents. And now Sherlock Holmes has gathered the suspects together to uncover the truth of what happened that terrible night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Suspects are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;J Neil Gibson - The American gold minig tycoon who moved into Thor Place five yeasrs ago with his exotic wife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mary-Lou gibson - J Neil's daughter from his first marriage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rev Marlow Bates - The vicar of Thor Bridge, an authority on the old religion and it's most implacable foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grace Dunbar - The beautiful young governess who looks after the two children of the Gibsons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chastity Darling - A chilhood friend of Grace who has come to visit her in the old manor house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juan Pinto - The younger brother of the murdered woman, he is visiting England from his home in Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Countess Von Orlock - A Hungarian noblewoman who has know J Neil Gibson for many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack E Jackson - A South African gold miner who has made and lost his fortune many times over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
