			<description>Blockers is a two-player variant of Chinese Checkers, as players race to move all their pieces from the starting location across the board to their home spaces (that is, the spaces originally occupied by their opponent).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played corner to corner on a 10x10 board, with 15 spaces of each neutral corner not in play, resulting in a 70 space playing area.  Pieces advance by moving to an adjacent space or by jumping an adjacent piece.  Multiple jumps are allowed, in any combination of a player's own pieces or their opponent's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 10 Runners and 3 Blockers.  Runners may only advance forward toward their goal, never backward toward their starting location, while Blockers may move in any direction.  Blockers may also jump over a contiguous line of pieces in its own colour.  Finally, no piece may jump over a Blocker, not even another Blocker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success is determined by stringing &amp;quot;jump ladders&amp;quot; along for multiple pieces, and by judicious placement of the Blocker pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
