			<description>This is an abstract strategy game with an Old West theme.  It is inexpensively produced, with a small cardboard board, a 3D cardboard backdrop, and 14 cardboard playing pieces that are inserted into plastic stands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player controls the 13 deputies (the posse), the other controls the 1 outlaw.  The object of the game is for the posse player to surround the outlaw such that he can no longer make a valid move.  If that happens, the posse player wins.  The outlaw player tries not to get cornered and wins if he is able to remove enough deputies from the board such that it is impossible for the posse player to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play starts with the outlaw player who must move his outlaw each turn, if possible (if not, he loses the game).  He can move the outlaw to any open orthogonally adjacent space.  He can also jump a deputy piece, like in Checkers, and thereby remove the deputy piece from the board.  The outlaw can make multiple jumps in a single turn, again like in Checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The posse player simply moves one of his deputy pieces into any open orthogonally adjacent space on his turn, trying to create a situation on the board where the outlaw player can not move his piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
