							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gold Cup Table Cricket</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Of the few indoor cricket games ever known, Gold Cup Table Cricket is the best. This indoor game is to be played by two players each acting as captain of his side. This game gives the player greater opportunity to develop and display his talent and capacity at game than cricket on turf.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with miniatures on a cricket ground printed on green cloth. A plastic shute represents the bowler. There is a selection of two batting devices, one mechanic and the other one manual. There are nine fielders and a wicket keeper. The rules and the scoring of turf cricket apply (more or less). It's up to the players to choose format: 20/20, ODI or a full test match!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
