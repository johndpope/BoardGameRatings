			<description>Space Orx is the second supplement for Injurius Games. This supplement brings the bar way, way down, in more ways than one: the Orx are rude, crude and easy to operate. They are faster on the ground that the Humans, have lots of hit points and powerful weapons. Orx almost never lack for Command Points, and their size and strength make them naturals in melee. These guys are off the wall, and their Skilz and Stuff reflect that: for example, who else eats Brain Candy (you have to be stupid to eat Brain Candy!), or drinks G.I. Coffee (this stuff makes Human coffee look like a hot milk toddy!)? And only Orx have the Tag Team Skill (gang up on a hapless opponent in melee!), and Athletics (Orx make physical fitness their priority).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Orx is not a stand-alone game. You need a copy of Injurious Games to play Space Orx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Injurius Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
