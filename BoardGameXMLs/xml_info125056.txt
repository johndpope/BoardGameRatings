							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Human Race: A matter of life and death</name>
									
			<description>The Human Race is a game for people of all ages. As you play, you will see that each move is like life itself, with rules that allow for freedom of choice and ensuing consequences. Here you will witness the gravity of your own judgement and values, as well as that of others. What will be sacrificed to win the Human Race?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other games that endorse a win-at-any-cost moral, The Human Race demonstrates that employing such a moral is possible, but not likely to win the game. Points, intelligence, cunning or luck may win the game, but if you play with heart and conscience you will never lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bitterness over loss has no role in The Human Race. For if you lose, it is totally your own doing. The freedom of choice is yours. Whether you play to teach your children or learn about yourself, The Human Race gives you hours of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple. The play, intricate. Downright soul-searching. The Human Race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game: First player rolls the white die and moves the number of squares indicated by the die moving in a clockwise direction. If a player lands on a square which points are indicated those points are added if it is a blue square (good)&lt;br/&gt;and deducted from the score if it is a red square (evil). After the player has moved, they draw a blue card or red card determined by their final location, either adding (good) or deducting (evil) points from their score or following the instructions on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling the Life Dice: After following the instructions on the card the player rolls the three black &amp;quot;Life Dice&amp;quot;. If all three dice show the same number then the player dies. If on a red square or has negative points the player is out of the game. If a player dies while having positive points and on a blue square, then even though the player is out, they still may win the game -- that is if all the other players do not reach the Final Resting Place with positive points or if the others die with fewer good points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Resting Place: The game is won by the player to reach the Final Resting Place. If no player reaches the Final Resting Place, then the player who dies with the most good points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
