			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deathbots was developed by Odyssey Software and published by American Video Entertainment.[7] In Deathbots, the Mutech Corporation created a base on Alcatraz Island, where attempts to create superior computer intelligence has backfired, as the robots they've created has taken over the computer systems and is threatening the world. Deep in the fortress is an atomic bomb&amp;ndash;like device called the Gamma Bomb, which one lone robot must destroy. The game is played from an overhead perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Box Back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutech Corporation, the gigantic nultinational conglomerate, purchases Alcatraz prison for the site of Gamma Base, the first clean energy Gamma Ray Reactor. OR SO THEY CLAIMED!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alcatraz, famous for preventing anyone from escaping alive, would ironically now prevent anyone from entering it's forbidding walls.  WHO could have guessed that Mutech Corporation was controlled no by humans, but my a malignant digital life form?  WHO would have believed that these life forms had evolved into a level of intelligence far beyond that of man? Mutech's ultimate plan is a simple one...enslave all mankind or destroy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ONLY YOU CAN STOP MUTECH AND SAVE HUMANITY AS WE KNOW IT!  PREPARE  YOURSELF FOR THE CHALLENGE OF A LIFETIME... YOUR LIFETIME!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
