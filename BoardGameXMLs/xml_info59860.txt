							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beast of Limfjord</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather close and hear the saga of Hrofgar, great warrior, and his journey home. Many were his triumphs in the years that he explored the north, west and east. Stories of his battle with the Serpent of Iceland, the defeat of the Tyrant of Wales and his tangle with the Witches of Rus were spread from fire side to fire side, wherever men shared tales. But as the weariness of ages grew upon Hrofgar he (as all men do) longed to return home and claim the prizes of old age - a welcoming hearth and a warm woman. So it was that Hrofgar and his crew of bondsmen set out for home. But the Gods often have plans for the bold of heart and able of body and the north winds were unleashed upon Hrofgar and his crew, smashing their longship upon the shores of far northern Jutland, a desolate place of rugged men and great peril. It was here that the villagers of Limfjord, recognizing the warrior in their midst for who he was, petitioned Hrofgar to save them from the Beast that had descended upon them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the tale of Hrofgar and the Beast of Limfjord...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the author:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Limfjord is under siege from a foul beast and the timely arrival of legendary hero Hrofgar and his band of companions heralds a chance to rid themselves of the monster once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beast of Limfjord is a complete roleplaying game containing all the rules, characters and information you need to play. All you need to supply are some friends, pencils and a bunch of polyhedral dice (you know, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
