			<description>How to carry the wolf, goat and cabbage to the island? It's not that simple, because the wolf has a taste for goat and goat will gladly eat cabbage! The only hope is to get a dog on board to keep thing in order. Players will have to demonstrate their cunning and a good memory to transport their animals and cabbage to the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives the same set of cargo cards with wolf, goat and cabbage. Each round a player draws a ship card which will tell him where she can place one of his cards (out of 6 ships available). Everybody needs to remember what is on each ship already, because when the ship gets 3 cards it arrives on the island. But then the rules of food chain apply, so the goat eats the cabbage and wolf eats all goat on the boat. So not everybody will actually reach the island. The goal is to deliver the most cargo cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have also 3 special cards which they may use at any moment during their round. Those cards allow them to sink one boat or to make the wind push the boat to the island before it gets full. The animals on the selected boat can also get seasick and return to their players hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
