			<description>The board is laid out with a tree in each corner and a clearing in the centre. Players move along pathways that connect the different areas, and they follow printed directions, which include both forfeits and rewards. In the middle of each outer edge is a store comprising four oval spaces on which players place the food they have gathered. The playing pieces represent four woodland animals: a wood mouse, a red squirrel, a bank vole and a harvest mouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires the players to gather winter stores for the animals and attempts to instill knowledge about the animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rewards: forward movement, collect items. &lt;br/&gt;Forfeits: backward movement, missed turns and forfeit of items &lt;br/&gt;Equipment required: 4 round markers of stained wood, green with a paper label showing a woodland animal, 16 tokens, ovals of printed card - four each of acorns, beechnuts, pine cones,  hazel nuts and wooden dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
