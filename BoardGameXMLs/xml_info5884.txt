			<description>This game is heavily based on Monopoly (as evidenced by the cover, which says &amp;quot;The Monopoly Stargame That Strikes Back!&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around a not-entirely-linear board buying orbital stations and the like and charging rent (sorry, docking fees).  There are some additional ways to make money such as mines and special side tracks on the board.  Additional mechanics are mostly combat-related - players start with fighters and may buy frigates and battlecruisers.  Players may fight each other or the fleets of the Empire, which is a neutral party that moves around the board taxing players (although players may take their fleets over sometimes, apparently - the rules are very hard to follow).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box says it can be played by up to 12 people, but only 4 pawns are provided (and fighters come in just 3 colors - but organization does not seem to be the publisher's strong point).  The components could fairly be described as primitive, except for the board, which is a bit garish but serviceable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
