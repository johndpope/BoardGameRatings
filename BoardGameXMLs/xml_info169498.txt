			<description>In this game, players take on the role of grizzly bears who are trying to collect their beloved honey. Yet, they can never get their precious without taking some risks. Not only are there furious wasps and bees ready for revenge but also their bear buddies may be casting a covetous eye and trying to snatch each others&amp;rsquo; honey with their bear hands (no pun intended). There are different types of function cards in the game which allow the players to do different things such as finding out what is hidden in the beehives or taking another player&amp;rsquo;s tile. Players can use their memory and deception skills to make full use of the different functions and turn it into a mind game, in which the winner will have outdone the others by tricking their opponents and earning the most honey. At the end of game, players score points for each honey tile that they own. The honey bee and wasps cause no instant harm to the players during the game, however if the players still have them in their baskets when the game ends, they will be penalized. The player with the highest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
