			<description>One of the first general-purpose space flight simulators, Microsoft Space Simulator (MSS) was based on Microsoft's popular Flight Simulator. It was developed by BAO Ltd., a company run by Flight Simulator developer Bruce Artwick. Charles Guy was lead developer on MSS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSS incorporated concepts from astrodynamics and celestial mechanics. It uses Newton laws of motion but takes account of relativistic effects by decreasing a spacecraft's acceleration as its speed approaches the speed of light. However, it does not take account of time dilation. In addition, atmospheric flight is not modeled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSS provided support for high-resolution graphics running in 256 color mode at up to 800x600. The graphics featured dithered gouraud shaded 3D vessels, with texture mapped planets, moons, and deepsky objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     14 spacecraft models (real and fictional) ranging from a compact manned maneuvering unit (the Space Shuttle's MMU) to an interplanetary passenger transport (Galactic Explorer) and a giant interstellar freighter (Zander Freighter).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Destinations including space stations (both almost-historical e.g. Space Station Freedom and futuristic e.g. Ring Station 1), bases (e.g. Kennedy Space Center or futuristic Marineris Base on Mars) and celestial bodies (including comets) in both the solar system and outside (e.g. in the Polaris or Vega star system).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Spacecraft instrument panel providing altitude and velocity information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Video recording and screenshots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Predefined missions which task users with accomplishing certain objectives (like Apollo 17 moon landing or docking a Shuttle to Space Station Freedom).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Autopilot and flight computer autopilot can be used to execute 15 maneuvers of different complexities (ranging from attitude/orientation control to automatic landing). Maneuvers can be also compiled into a complete flight plan that can be automatically executed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Observatory mode that can be used as a planetarium for viewing stars and other celestial bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Slew control mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included spacecraft:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;br/&gt;Apollo Service Module&lt;br/&gt;Lunar Module (LM)&lt;br/&gt;Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU)&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Explorer&lt;br/&gt;Bussard Ram-Jet&lt;br/&gt;Callisto&lt;br/&gt;F-79 Galactic Fighter&lt;br/&gt;Zander Freighter&lt;br/&gt;All Terrain Lander (ATL)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included Space Stations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ring Station 1 (Earth Orbit)&lt;br/&gt;Space Station Freedom (Low Earth Orbit)&lt;br/&gt;Lunar Orbiter (Moon Orbit)&lt;br/&gt;Mars Orbiter (Mars Orbit)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Microsoft Space Simulator&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Microsoft Space Simulator, you are a citizen of the universe.
