							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Big Board</name>
									
			<description>Advance your token forward on even rolls, and backward on odd rolls. You buy and sell stocks depending where you land. The board is clearly based on Monopoly and there are two stacks of cards that can alter game play in one way or another. Also included is another stack that randomly changes the values of the stock prices for buying and selling. Players mark there purchases on their own notepads. As in all of these games, the player with the most money at the end, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the stocks at home on The Big Board. Educational and FUN. Featuring the &amp;quot;Don Jones Industrials&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
