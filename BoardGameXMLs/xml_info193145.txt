			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short encounter &amp;quot;mission&amp;quot; that is systemless and scalable for about any level of PCs in any OSR-style game. The design is deliberately vague in several areas to make it easy to &amp;quot;tweak &amp;amp; toss&amp;quot; into your current campaign. Perfect for when the party goes &amp;quot;left&amp;quot; when you expected them to go &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;, any GM/DM/Judge can easily drop this into the current campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea behind this Tweak &amp;amp; Toss is that a logging camp has been unable to get logs downstream to the sawmill/market and they do not know why. Extra men have been dispatched to investigate, but they have not been heard from. Before the remaining loggers set out the Foreman would like to send the PCs to ensure the path is clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
