							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eamonn Andrews Presents Questo</name>
									
			<description>'Questo' is a question and answer game that traded on the popularity of the then very young Irish television presenter Eamonn Andrews. It consists of a slotted spinning disc that reveals a letter through the slot when it stops, and a pack of 48 question cards. The first player to answer the question on the card correctly with an answer beginning with the letter disclosed is given the card. The winner is the player who has the greatest number of cards at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Eamonn Andrews also presented &amp;quot;What's my line?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;This is your life&amp;quot;, amongst many others in his career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
