			<description>Terra is new semi-cooperative board game from Touko Tahkokallio. &lt;br/&gt;The game is targeted to school classes and the theme is environmental. In the game players are collectively trying to save the world from the environmental catastrophes. Players win or lose the game collectively, but still you can count who's got the most successful country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Terra you play five rounds and every player has one turn in every round. Every player represents a country and all players together represent the international community. &lt;br/&gt;1. At the start of the round you remove old development tiles and turn over six new development tiles. &lt;br/&gt;2. Then first player starts his turn. On his turn player can do next actions as many times as he can afford in free order:&lt;br/&gt;-Buy one development tile.&lt;br/&gt;-Activate development tile with his/her worker.&lt;br/&gt;-Donate money to planetary fund to avoid catastrophes.&lt;br/&gt;-Trade with other players (one on one)&lt;br/&gt;-Remove catastrophe markers (with two money)&lt;br/&gt;After player has made as many actions as she/he wishes, it's next players turn. &lt;br/&gt;3. After every player has had turn, then global warming kicks in. First you remove two carbon cubes from the atmosphere and then temperature marker goes up as many places as there is carbon cubes left. (New carbon cubes emerge when you burn coal in power plants.)&lt;br/&gt;4. And then environmental catastrophes kick in. The temperature track tells you how many catastrophe cards you turn over. Now the chairman of the international community (i.e. starting player of this round) decides how to use planetary funds to overcome catastrophes. If he/she can't defeat catastrophes they will hit every player.&lt;br/&gt;5. At the end of the round every country has to feed its workers and produce needed energy. Player loses points and workers if she/he can't. And finally chairman of the international community marker goes to next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you get points from some of the development tiles (cities, schools, laboratories) and at the end of the game you get points from workers, money and all your development tiles. Catastrophes make you lose money when they happen and points at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To succeed you collectively most have more than 50 points (minimum 0, maximum 100). If the game is played in the classroom with many copies, then you can also see which group got the best overall score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
