							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Relative Paradox</name>
									
			<description>Relative Paradox could best be described as a Deck Building Game, with mechanics including Strategy, Hand Management, and a little bit of Luck. The point is to match up History A with People B and multiplier/bonus for History C with Cosmos and Paradox Cards create &amp;quot;trouble&amp;quot; that alter history all together. All the cards are easily recognizable to their time in history, so you don't need to be a Historian to play. This game features all Public Domain Time Travelers including Professor Helvetius and Doctor Omega.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 to 8 Players will have to take their Traveler into Time and Space to collect pieces of history and put them back together. First players will be dealt one time traveler to represent them during the game, these are Traveler Cards, The Traveler you are dealt is who you will represent throughout the game. Then each player is Dealt Five Cards from the main deck, the remainder are separated into one pile per the amount of players (i.e. 2 somewhat even piles for two players) and a card is placed face up on all sides (see the image above), these cards are now obtainable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you can either create a timeline (matching cards with same symbols) or draw a card from the tabletop that is obtainable. A player can have as many or as few cards as needed in their hand at one time. When you make a pair, you do not draw to replenish. Also, if you have a timeline available to lay--you must use it and lay your pair/three of a kind. Each Timeline Card will have a value that will count towards your final tally, these are called Timeline Points. Each Traveler interacts with a particular timeline differently, either giving them a bonus/multiplier for Timeline Points or immunity from a certain Paradox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
