			<description>Wickie is a German board game for children; it is designed to promote recognition of colors and numbers.  Thematically, it is uses elements from a television series of the same name.  Players assume the roles of Wickie and his friends as they race each other to board a Viking ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a character and takes four tokens.  They play their turns by first rolling the dice.  There are four lanes to reach the ship.  The squares (of which some are colored) on the lanes are printed with the faces of a die.  A player can move his or her token to the next square if one of the rolled dice matches the square's.  If the token moves onto a colored square, it can jump once to the next square of the same color.  Each character can take a short at certain points along the path.  As each square cannot accommodate more than one token, blocking is possible.  However, a token can jump across blocking pieces if the player has a die that matches the square at the opposite side of a block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player gets all four of his or her tokens aboard the viking ship at the end, making him or her the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
