							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Colosseum Alter of the Sun</name>
									
			<description>Colosseum Alter of the Sun is the sequel of Colosseum. This game is basically the same game to the previous game only with different characters and skills. You can even play with character cards and overdrive cards of both games mixed together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colosseum is a one-on-one duel card game. This game reflects many features seen in fighting video games, such as character-specific abilities, distance control, anticipating opponent's moves, three-way-deadlock skill interactions, and overdrive skills. With these features, this game provides an environment where players' risk and return fluctuate throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
