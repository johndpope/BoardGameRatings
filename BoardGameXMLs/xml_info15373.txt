							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So you think you know about Ireland</name>
									
			<description>This is a trivia game concentrating on Ireland: History, geography, politics, rumor, movies, folk tales, etc. The game consists of 104 cards (two of which detail the short rules). The cards have questions on one side of increasing difficulty, answering each of which correctly scores points (more points for harder questions). The difficulty progression is different on each card, so one card may have three easy, one medium and one hard question; while another may have two, two and one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot answer a question, the card has four multiple choice possibilities on the reverse for each question. Taking this option halves the points for a correct answer. Correctly answering allows you to keep being asked questions and scoring from the same card. A wrong answer has the card discarded and play passes to the next person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has no given end conditions; either a fixed number of rounds or a time limit seem reasonable. Most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
