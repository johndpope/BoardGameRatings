							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enter The Arena</name>
									
			<description>Enter The Arena is a competitive strategy based card game for 2 to 4 players. The game is intended for audiences aged thirteen and older, and has a play time of 15-30 minutes. As in the real Gladiatorial arenas of old, fighting prowess alone is not all that is required for success. The love and adoration of the crowd is no less important if one seeks to triumph in the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played using Attack, Defense, Style, and special Prowess cards which are all used in their own unique way, and are the tools you will use to be victorious in the arena. Enter The Arena is played in a series of trumps that continue until the game end conditions are met. Every turn you can either go on the Attack or Defend yourself against incoming attacks. Properly gauging your opponents reactions and moves is an important part of the game. Each player is sent into the arena with the same &amp;quot;tools&amp;quot; to defeat the other gladiators. How and when you use them is up to each player as the game develops. Augmenting your attacks or defense with Style cards is another integral part of the gameplay. Gaining the favor of the crowd is another potential way to win the game rather than defeating the other gladiators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adding another level of strategy to gameplay are the Prowess Cards. These cards have various effects that can be used to increase your chances in the arena and/or hinder your opponents as you battle for victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter The Arena is designed to be fun, strategic, and fast-paced with the ability for anyone to seize the upper hand at a moments notice with a properly executed combo. Be careful though because leaving yourself defenseless will in turn leave you at the mercy of your foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
