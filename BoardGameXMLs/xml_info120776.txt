			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;A Japanese home made card game. The players lead a team of nine house keepers through three houses, trying to clear room after room, competing with the other keepers, gaining points. Rooms are laid out in a 6x3 grid and the players attack it from the sides, advancing one room at a time. Each house keeper has a strength of 1&amp;ndash;9 and all rooms have a similar difficulty. All keepers also have special powers that can be activated with different timing.&lt;br/&gt;The game relies on planning and when to use the one-time special effects, creating a chaos with virtually no random elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back&lt;br/&gt;The rules are extremely simple! You compare numbers 1 to 9 and the highest number wins! That's all! But in this game, you never seem to win as you think. The interaction between each of the 36 characters' special powers turn the tables in a eyeblink, causing the one who should win to lose and the one who should lose to win.&lt;br/&gt;A simple game, allowing for many different tactics&amp;hellip; not to mention the chaos emerging from having several players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
