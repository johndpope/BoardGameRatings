			<description>From the designer's web page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cats, either you love 'em or you hate 'em. Whatever the case, you'll find something to like in this game. It's a lazy, crazy race around the house to end up right back where you started ... doing nothing! Napping, eating, scratching, and staring at things ... this game has it all. Oh yeah, did I mention the evil twins who are out to humiliate and torture you? The game includes the board , all the cards, rules and tokens you need to get started! As an added bonus, there are some game variations included to really get the fur flying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
