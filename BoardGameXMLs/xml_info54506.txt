							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seafood Express</name>
									
			<description>Seafood Express is a dice game for 3 to 5 seafood chefs.&lt;br/&gt;Players run a hawker stall in Singapore serving delicious seafood dishes. The key to a successful business is to serve your customers as fast as you get your ingredients - that way they know they are getting only the freshest produce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to gain the most points by picking the freshest seafood and serving it up to complete seafood menus. Each menu requires accompanying beverages and usually includes a vegetable dish. If you&amp;rsquo;re short of a precious ingredient you can always use a couple of coins to buy what you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published on BGG in this thread:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/428877/page/4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/428877/page/4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of the game are similar to that found in Seafood Express&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
