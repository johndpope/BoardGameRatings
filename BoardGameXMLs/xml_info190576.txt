			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chronicles System is a major implementation of a generic, universal tabletop role-playing game.  It was published as an extensive series of well-developed web pages that were freely available online.  The core system was presented as major web pages, each with sub-pages, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;01.0: Character Creation&lt;br/&gt;02.0: Traits: Merits and Flaws&lt;br/&gt;03.0: Skills&lt;br/&gt;03.1: Skills: Combat Masteries&lt;br/&gt;04.0: Basic Rules: Definitions&lt;br/&gt;05.0: Arms and Equipment&lt;br/&gt;05.1: Melee Weapons&lt;br/&gt;05.2: Ranged Weapons&lt;br/&gt;05.3: Armor&lt;br/&gt;06.0: Basic Rules: The Chronicles System&lt;br/&gt;07.0: Combat Rules: Basics&lt;br/&gt;07.1: Combat Rules: Defense&lt;br/&gt;07.2: Combat Rules: Offense&lt;br/&gt;07.3: Combat Rules: Unarmed&lt;br/&gt;07.4: Combat Rules: Advanced&lt;br/&gt;07.5: Combat Rules: Firearms&lt;br/&gt;08.0: Health and Damage&lt;br/&gt;09.0: Experience&lt;br/&gt;09.1: Downtime Character Growth&lt;br/&gt;10.0: Heroic Characteristics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is surprisingly robust and balanced for a free product.  Version 1 was developed for in-house play through about 2000.  In 2002 the author copyrighted Version 2 of the system.  In 2005 the author published Version 3 (the only published Version) on the internet as HTML pages.  This version went through continuous minor development until 2008 when the game unfortunately went offline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
