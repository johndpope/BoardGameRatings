			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I ran some real Monty Haul games back in &amp;quot;The Day,&amp;quot; but it seems like I wasn't much better during my mid-90's D&amp;amp;D renaissance - I may have even been worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was glancing through this dungeon while compiling the scans, and I realized just how much the treasure-to-hazard ratio is skewed. Heck, in one room, there's a gem worth 20,000gp and the only thing guarding it is a giant spider. It's practically a giveaway. I almost think I made this dungeon solely to pump up low level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wouldn't recommend that anyone run this as written - it could use a little beefing up, even if just by adding some really challenging wandering monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
