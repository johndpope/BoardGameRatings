			<description>Checkers and chess are classics, but where is the modern twist? tak&amp;bull;tak is today's new two-player strategy board game. tak&amp;bull;tak has simple rules like checkers and the layered strategies of chess. The game uses the familiar grid and 'battlefield' board to allow players to &amp;quot;advance, stack, and attack&amp;quot; chips of matching colors and numbers. While learning to play is quick and easy, it takes a real strategist to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does it play?&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving their pieces across the board one space at a time, either straight ahead or diagonally, into the gray &amp;quot;war zone&amp;quot; with the goal of reaching the other player's safe zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stack &amp;amp; Attack&lt;br/&gt;While moving across the board, players may stack any of their pieces of the same number or color. These stacks can now move as one piece to get across the board faster. When players meet in the war zone they may attack their opponent's pieces by stacking on any that are the same color or number and absorb them into their own forward moving stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to win?&lt;br/&gt;Advance the highest numeric value of chips into your opponents safe zone and win tak&amp;bull;tak!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
