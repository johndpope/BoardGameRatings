							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Warfare: Campaign Book Hades</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is 1947, and the armies of the three great blocs have collided in a small city along the Caspian Sea. Zverograd, a city that lies at the divide of continents, lies also at a crossroads in world history. Now, the battle that has raged here for months has reached its tipping point, and only through the use of recently developed technological terrors and innovative new tactics can any of the three warring factions prevail.&lt;br/&gt; Dust Warfare: Campaign Book Hades, a supplement for Dust Warfare, continues the tense struggle for this all-important metropolis, while adding new rules, options, and stats for upcoming Dust Warfare units. This 48-page softcover book has details on locations around Zverograd, rules for Tesla weapons, and new special abilities. What's more, this jam-packed resource features the epic Hades Campaign, a long-term conflict in which players plan their engagements using a detailed overland map of Zverograd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
