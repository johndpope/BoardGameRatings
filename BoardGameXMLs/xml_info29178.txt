			<description>Spaceship is a spin and move space exploration game published by All Fair Games about 1948 (estimated on knowledge of the Jet age in 1944 -45 (i.e V2 Rocket) and appearance of flying saucers in 1947). Retro graphics adorn the board with characters like the Saturn Saucerman, Mars Batman and Giant Robot Space Master. Players travel from Terra (Earth)via Saturn and Luna (the moon) to the Zero Gravity Space Station. From there players continue via Mars or Venus to Jupiter. The pathway that players travel along is called &amp;quot;Spaceways&amp;quot;. The Spaceways are under the control of the Interplanet Patrol System of United Planets. Each spaceship has a Cosmic Space-o-gram receiving set and when a player lands on a space marked &amp;quot;Take Space-o-gram&amp;quot;, the player takes a Space-o-gram Card and follows the instructions. &lt;br/&gt;All ships must stop at the &amp;quot;Zero Gravity Space Station&amp;quot; and when leaving if a player spins an even number they go to Jupiter via Venus, and an odd number via Mars to Jupiter. Players cannot stop on the Asteroids as the nears Jupiter but spin a larger enough number to carry across the Asteroids. &lt;br/&gt;The First to reach Jupiter wins.  Listed in[American Games] #4195.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
