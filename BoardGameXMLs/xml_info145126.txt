			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Telen is a partially walled town on the Thard River. The capital of Telen District and Coranan Province, its impressive citadel is the headquarters of the Coranan Legion. The town&amp;rsquo;s population has tripled in the last century, making it the third-largest settlement in the Republic after Coranan and Shiran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Telen Castle article describes the settlement&amp;rsquo;s history, government, religion, and economics, and provides details for some of its craftsmen and other locations. Includes GM and player local maps as well as interior plans for the fortified villa of the powerful Nordaka clan, all in full color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics release. Portions of this article were originally published in 1987 as part of the Thardic Republic Module. The article has been upgraded with new color artwork and redrawn maps, as well as expanded descriptions of the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
