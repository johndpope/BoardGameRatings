			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Are you a fan of the True20 gaming system but wish you weren't bound by the concept of role? Have you wanted to to be able to mix and match different elements of roles without worrying about the effects of multiclassing on your character concept? Perhaps you've had characters that really could benefit from having an extra hit die in lieu of weaker saves, or a bit of a lower combat bonus as a trade for increased adept ability, or maybe even the ability to completely customize the amount of skill ranks to perfectly fit your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full Control offers a mechanic for completely customizing your character in countless directions by stripping down all of the progressions for feats, combat bonus, saving throws, ability score increases, adept powers, and other aspects of character design into build points. Build Points can then be used by players as currency to make their character into precisely the character that they desire. The game can become role-less, where the players determine their character's effectiveness by actually building their character from the ground up rather than multiclassing between roles to approximate the character design!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build the character you've always wanted with this 14 page supplement for the True20 Adventure Roleplaying Game.  Written by John Fraser, whose other works include Complete Control: Character Design for the Uninhibited.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
