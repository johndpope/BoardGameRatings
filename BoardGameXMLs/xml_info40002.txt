			<description>Adaptation of The Sword and the Flame for the conflict between the British and the pirates of the South China Sea in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Being a set of playable, entertaining and enjoyable skirmish-level Wargame rules that will recreate the exciting Land and Sea Battles between the Trading Powers of the World and the Pirates of the South Seas.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The peoples of Borneo and other nearby islands did a lot of fishing, which gave them opportunity for occasional informal piracy for millennia, until the British showed up and took umbrage. This lead to many small battle between British troops and the Dyak, Malay, Illunan, and even Chinese. Ultimately British adventurer James Brooke's alliance with the Sultan of Brunei lead to his creation as the &amp;quot;White Raja of Sarawak&amp;quot; as he ruled part of Borneo while fighting the pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes movement and combat rules for European sailing ships, junks, and various war canoes, grappling, and bombs, as well as the various tribes and special &amp;quot;Bravado&amp;quot; morale rules for the Dyak and Malay, who fight better with Gongs, insults, and enemy casualties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-two  pages including reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
