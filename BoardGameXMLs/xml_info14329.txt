			<description>Pecuniary is a simulation game of international diplomacy and trading for 3-5 players which is not won through luck but rather as a result of skillful, though merciless, dealing and aggression.  Each player represents a different country which produces and consumes specified amounts of the fifteen commodities involved in the game each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
