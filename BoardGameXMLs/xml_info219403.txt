			<description>Yikes! All the foliage in the forest has been stirred up by a violent gust of wind, and 36 little critters have lost their shelter. Equipped with the appropriate leaf cards, the players in Insectini need to hide the insects again leaf by leaf as quickly as possible. To do this, they need to spot the tiny details on these critters &amp;mdash; a light bulb on a firefly, a grub playing the guitar, a caterpillar munching on a snack &amp;mdash; and cover them with a matching leaf in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
