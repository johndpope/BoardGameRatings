			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Shadows is a science fiction / fantasy adventure role-playing game. In the Future Shadows game, participants play the roles of people in a sci-fi / Fantasy galaxy that has been decimated in a galactic war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Future Shadows] is your chance to play a character that is completely different from your own real life identity. You can chose to be whatever it is that you desire most, or find appealing at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Shadows is a space opera. It is filled with the politics of the Empire, the strong influences and possible corruption of Mega Corporations, the ruin of war, and the dark ages of lost technology and recession. Optional rules allow other setting influences of hacking, psionics, mecha, vehicles, and space ships. FS is very customizable to almost any setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC Handbook (2005 Version) contains the bulk of the system rules and is intended for all players and the GM.  The book itself is available for free download as a series of seven PDF files, each file representing one chapter in the book.  It is much reduced from the previously released version, with the removal of materials into other books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
