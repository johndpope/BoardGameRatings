			<description>From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know that this ancient clan shows no mercy to it's captors You've heard stories you now realize are true, of skulls lain end to end, or found in piles throughout the land. They number in the thousands and lie bleached by the sun and rain, a testament to the power of the Chinese Dragons. You've got to do something, you realize. But what? A fun for freedom could be risky. Perhaps it would be best to remain where you are and take your chances as a prisoner. There haven't been many options for you so far as a young orphan in 7th century China. But you are brave, wise and skilled. It is the dawn of the Tang Dynasty and powerful warriors are bringing change all around you. Who will you become now that you are free from the drudgeries of servitude on your Uncle's family farm?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
