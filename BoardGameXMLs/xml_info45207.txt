							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shrine of the Frogmen</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People whisper their names, and fear their kind. These monsters dwell in the depth of the earth, within murky and muddy caves and worship a deity with an unspeakable name: they are the frogmen or the ?ones who dwell deep?. Will your adventurers dare to take a journey to reach the frogmen fortress and punish them for the evil they brought on the surface world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrine of the Frogmen is a large underground complex inhabited by strange and mysterious beings said to be half men and half frogs. This large complex is situated deep beneath the surface of the earth and features three known levels. The complex is a nightmare for those who want conquer it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that two of the maps of this product are double maps, divided in west and east sections. The numbers progression belongs to the two joined maps of each level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The level 0 is where the common frogmen live, along with their king and their priests. Many pools for breeding and living are scattered on this level, along with more common sleeping rooms and common rooms. Also, the kings? seraglio and royal guard are found here. The dread shrine to the frogmen deity occupies a central position in this level and it is probably the first thing an adventurer will see upon arriving in this place. A great corridor runs all around the complex, like a ring. This corridor is actually the main defense system of the whole complex, since it has double the height of the other rooms and, on the highest part of it, rows of deadly arrow slits are set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The level 1 is where the main armed force of the frogmen is detached. They have the duty to defend the lower and upper levels of the complex. Arrow slits corridors allow the guards to fire deadly missiles over unaware intruders walking around the corridors of the lower level. The arrow slits corridors are flanked by dozens of armories containing every sort of missile weapons. Nearby storage rooms hosts peach and other throw-down materials that can be used when in need. Furthermore, murder holes are scattered everywhere on this level allowing to fire in any room and corridor below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The level 3 is the uppermost level. This was the first dwelling of the frogmen, now abandoned. Mostly a cave complex, this level has become in time the home of all sorts of underground predators. In a large cavern you can find a pit overlooking the very shrine of the frogmen, although it is nearly 300 ft down. A small outpost of the frogmen guards this area, reachable through a spiral staircase, which crawls from the level 1 below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
