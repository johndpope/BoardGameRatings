			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call to Arms: Horses &amp;amp; Mules contains information on how to more accurately use horses, mules and other equids for transport, roleplay information including a horse personality generator and glossary of horse colors, information on when and why you might want a mule rather than a horse as well as stats for new horse &amp;quot;types.&amp;quot; You will also find horse-like monsters and mounts, and examples of &amp;quot;mythic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;artifact&amp;quot; horses, some of them new to this book. It draws on real life horse knowledge as well as mythical horse-like creatures from around the world. Horses &amp;amp; Mules is for the GM who wants to make overland travel more realistic and a key part of the game as well as players of mount-focused classes, such as the Cavalier or Paladin. Horses are a vital part of Medieval-style and other low-tech settings and this book will help you do more with them than tie them up at the dungeon entrance and hope they are still there when you get back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Information about horse physiology, psychology and health&lt;br/&gt;     New horse and mule types&lt;br/&gt;     New feats for both riders and mounts&lt;br/&gt;     Hussar (Cavalier variant class) and archetypes&lt;br/&gt;     New horse-like monsters and mounts&lt;br/&gt;     and more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
