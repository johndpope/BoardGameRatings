			<description>In this third installment, players continue the story from the land of Ardania. Only now the king has been overthrown and has fled the safety of his palace.  With only his trusted advisor and his bedclothes to spare his blushes, the unseated king must turn to former enemies in order to reacquire the throne.  Gather the gaggle of creatures, train them, equip them and send them forth.  Order them to attack your betrayers and retake what is yours. Monster Kingdom contains a new eight mission campaign called 'Exiles of Fate'.  With a host of new buildings, heroes, abilities and guild powers to discover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
