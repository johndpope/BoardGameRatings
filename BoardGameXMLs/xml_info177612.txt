			<description>From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not All Threats Are Born From Nightmares&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now, GURPS Monster Hunters has focused on the paranormal: Champions, often empowered by magical and mystical abilities, face supernatural monsters from myth and legend. GURPS Monster Hunters 5: Applied Xenology is here to prove that horror meshes with science, too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applied Xenology offers choices for your Monster Hunters campaign. Are the heroes masters of tech, the supernatural, or both? If magic exists, does it rely on willpower and Hermetic knowledge, or on properly programmed computers? Do the monsters the hunters face hail from our world, the third level of Hell, another planet, or all of the above? Applied Xenology will help you find answers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Scientific&amp;quot; character revisions. Every supernatural-themed template from GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions and GURPS Monster Hunters 4: Sidekicks is discussed in depth and (where possible) revised to fit a focus on the scientific rather than the paranormal. What happens to the sage if magic doesn't exist? Does Mysticism have a place in a world without demons and undead? How do warriors stay relevant in the face of TL9+ weaponry? Find answers to these and many other questions.&lt;br/&gt;     Technomagic. This revamp adds a &amp;quot;sheen of science&amp;quot; to Ritual Path magic -- but it's more than just a reskin! Technomages need computer hardware and software to operate at full power, creating spells as programmed &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot; they can run immediately, save, or even email to a friend. And it all works whether you're using Champions or the detailed system in GURPS Thaumatology: Ritual Path Magic.&lt;br/&gt;     Aliens. Terrifying extraterrestrial threats have always had a special place in modern horror, and now your hunters can protect the Earth from them. From classic conspiracy fodder such as Greys, Nordics, and Reptoids to straight-up monsters like Devourers and Insectoids, there's an alien race to fit any plot the GM cooks up (and suggested &amp;quot;close encounters&amp;quot; to provide inspiration).&lt;br/&gt;     And more! Face invisible danger in the form of insidious plagues. Convert supernatural monsters to a more &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; form. Play aliens as inhuman PCs. And load up on -- or invent -- new gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applied Xenology provides more options -- for your champions, settings, and bad guys -- so that you can run the game you want. We've given you the tools . . . now go save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
