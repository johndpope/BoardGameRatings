							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Temple of the Half-Tusk</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monks of the Temple of the Half-Tusk are an anomaly - half-orcs who grew tired of the constant warring of the southern orcs tribes and fled to the mountains, where they have existed in quiet seclusion for some 30 years. Their small valley has been protected by strange magics that occlude the memories of those who come near, so that none may find the Half-Tusks unless the orc-kin want to be found. Their days are devoted to worship, reflection, and training - though they loathe the violence of their brutish forebears, they know that the day may come when they will need to defend themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
