			<description>Nationally-released adaptation of the early-1960s KTLA (Los Angeles) game show produced by Desilu, in which players are tested on their memory recall and ability to make wild guesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment consists of a clear plastic grid covered by square cards numbered from 1-30, an assortment of cards that fit under the grid (containing all 26 letters of the alphabet and four blanks) randomly organized, and 32 tall letter cards the size of four squares on the grid. The game consists of two parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Part:&lt;br/&gt;One of the alphabet cards is placed under the grid so that none of the players can see it. Players start by picking a number on the grid. The card is removed and all players see the letter underneath. This letter is written down and the number card replaced. The player then chooses another number revealing another letter in the same way. The letters revealed are written in the order they are revealed and must have the possibility of making a word. If a word is possible the player may continue to choose numbers and revealing letters. If a complete word is formed the player gets ten points per letter added to their score and may start over trying to make another word. If a blank or a letter that can not be used in the word is revealed then that players turn is over and the next player takes their turn in the same way. The front game ends once a player scores 150 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second Part:&lt;br/&gt;One of the losing players forms a secret six-letter word using the letter cards placed on a special sheet, and this word is placed under the grid. The winning player from the first part chooses five numbers, which are removed to reveal one-quarter of one letter. The player tries to guess the secret word to win $1,000; if the player fails, s/he selects another number to reveal and $100 is deducted from the prize. This continues until the player either guesses the word or the jackpot goes down to $100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in three rounds, with the player or team with the most money being the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
