							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Contract Madness</name>
									
			<description>The players negotiate a contract that the loser of the game has to reward the winner in some way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone begins with $1000, two letter cards, and a pawn on the start square. Each players roll in the dice and moves one's pawn in turn. The space one lands on tells the player was action must be done: collect a letter, conduct an auction for a letter, hold a lottery, etc. The winner is the first person who can spell &amp;quot;C-O-N-T-R-A-C-T&amp;quot; with the letters one has or has $200 for each letter missing from the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
