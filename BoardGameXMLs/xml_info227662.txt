			<description>The game comes with 35 cards, instructions and a Parker Brothers ad sheets for some other of their games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, all of the cards are dealt. The players place all matches on the table and use one of the green tokens for each match they have. The players take turns taking a card from another player&amp;rsquo;s hand, hoping to come up with another match or to secure the Elmer card. The winner of the game is the one who ends up with just one card in his or her hand with that card being the Where's Elmer? card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
