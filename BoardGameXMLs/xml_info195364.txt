			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game focuses heavily on the setting, which is &amp;quot;Binary Five&amp;quot;, a prison world to which the characters are transported for conviction of crimes.  There are no characters attributes beyond whatever descriptions and history players care to create.  The game is played in phases; the rules recommend telling the stories in cut scenes placed in reverse chronological order.  Action resolution is nearly entirely narrative.  Two decks of custom cards are used to resolve conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The custom cards are not provided, though their values are noted.  One deck contains fifteen &amp;quot;color&amp;quot; cards, with faces of specified colors.  The other deck contains forty Assertion Cards with four sets numbered 1-10.  In addition to using cards for conflict resolution, they can be traded for other in-game advantages as players see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
