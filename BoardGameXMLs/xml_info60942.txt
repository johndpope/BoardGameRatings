							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Matter of Faith</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is Your Faith Strong Enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 12th-century England, the Welsh-English border is an unstable place. But one Christian outpost is determined to make a stand&amp;mdash;with the PCs help, of course! Part adventure and part setting, A Matter of Faith is a 1st-level adventure designed for beginner Game Masters and brings 3.5/OGL fantasy adventure to medieval England. Once the adventure is completed, the outpost will make the perfect home for the new adventuring party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Matter of Faith provides... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A murder-mystery featuring equal parts roleplaying and combat. &lt;br/&gt;    Detailed maps of the Malbank Outpost, its church, and the English landscape around it. &lt;br/&gt;    Over 20 fully-detailed NPCs that bring the Malbank Outpost to life &lt;br/&gt;    Numerous adventure possibilities that use the outpost as a backdrop (including a quest for a religious item of biblical proportions!) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your novice characters have enough faith both in their abilities and in their hearts to overcome the forces of evil and save the outpost from certain doom?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
