			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 books that players might find on an occultist's bookshelf. The books are mostly suitable for a modern setting, as many were first published in the 20th century. There are books with older initial publication dates, primarily those in Latin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The books cover a wide range of subjects, from Alchemy to Kabbalah to Tarot to Yoga, and are genuine books, some by famous names. Whether or not the books have any in-game value other than decorative is up to the GameMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries have the book's name, author, if known, and in some cases other details. They can be used to pad out a bookshelf with other genuine material, although it is unlikely that any one person would have books on the whole range of subject material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16. De Praestigiis Daemonum et Incantationibus ac Venificiis by Johann Weyer (Latin, On the Illusions of the Demons and on Spells and Poisons)&lt;br/&gt;17. Der Lange Verborgene Freund by John George Hohman (German, The Long Lost Friend)&lt;br/&gt;18. De Sole et Luna by Michael Scot (The Sun and the Moon)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
