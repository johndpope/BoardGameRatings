			<description>Each player represents the leader of one of the main Gladiatorial schools in ancient Rome, sending groups of Gladiators into the arena with hopes of survival (and freedom).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a stable of gladiators.  They each pick 3 (or more) of their gladiators and send them into the arena trying to kill their opponents Gladiators.  Then the next group of Gladiators are sent in, until they have all fought.  Lastly, all the surviving Gladiators are returned to the arena for a final battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses a move action/attack action allotment with a counterattack element.  It was based on an Abstract theme at first, then a minor coin-flipping mechanic was added later on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was produced for the One Full-Sheet Label contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
