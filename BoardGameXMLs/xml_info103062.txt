			<description>Card game with two packs of cards, a red pack and a black pack.&lt;br/&gt;The black pack is shuffled and both players are dealt half of them. This deck must stay face-down and is called your Store. Now the red cards are shuffled and placed face down in the centre of the table after each player has been dealt five cards.&lt;br/&gt;The object is to complete a set of 15 cards by playing cards in order from 1 upwards. The top black card from your Store is revealed and should be used as the next number required. Just collecting a set is not the main objective, but using all your Store cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;Essentially for two player, but there are rules for three players and a 4 player game with two partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
