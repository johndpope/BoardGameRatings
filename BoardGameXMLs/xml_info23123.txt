							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder at Farthingay Manor</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 6 guests!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Murder at Farthingay Manor&amp;quot; is a murder mystery for 6 people, all of whom are given a character in the plot. They have been invited to attend a country house weekend in England in August, 1924. They do not know their host, Lord Farthing. They do not know each other. So why were they invited? As the plot unfolds, they gradually find out&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The murder mystery is usually run over a meal, but if you are feeling particularly adventurous, you can run it in short bursts over a whole weekend. The characters include a vicar, a nun, a countess and a butler. All, of course, have dark secrets to hide. But who is the murderer? How is the King of Ruritania involved? And how many characters survive till the end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
