			<description>An abstract strategy game played on a special board. Two players, X and O, take turns placing a bridge between any two of their adjacent pegs not blocked by an existing bridge. The first player to complete a connected chain of bridges between their sides wins. Ties are not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visavis is a Shannon switching game on the edges and belongs to the same class of connection games as Bridg-It and TwixT (and to some extend Trellis). Even though a trivial winning strategy has been found for Bridg-It (called Connexxions on the server) Visavis consists of a more complex system of overlaid triangular grids that allows richer variety of play, and no winning strategy is known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michail Antonow points out that different tactics must be applied when blocking an opponent's rightward path as opposed to a leftward path. The path can be abruptly cut by a single piece in one direction only; in the opposite direction a single bridge will only divert the path and two bridges are needed for a successful block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules state that a bridge can be placed between any two adjacent pegs of the same colour. However since it can never help to place a bridge between the opponent's pegs, then it is assumed that all moves are made between the current player's pegs. This also simplifies the board notation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
