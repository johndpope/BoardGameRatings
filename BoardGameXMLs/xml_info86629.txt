			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your character is going to die. There's very little you can do to avoid it, but you can make your death mean something... and rise again to crush your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our ninth edition of Combat Advantage offers the revenant but not just as a revised monster. Presented as a &amp;quot;resurrection paragon path&amp;quot;, this undead reincarnation allows you to bring back a deceased character with a vengeance. Brought back by powerful forces, the revenant must carry on his life quest to avenge his death and kill his enemies with new powers and path features providing bonuses against those who have wronged him with roleplaying opportunities galore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the revenant, CA9 presents an Open Call for Risen: The Guide to Resurrected Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
