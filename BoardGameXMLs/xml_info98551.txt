			<description>Fungus is an abstract strategy game played on a hex grid by 2 to 4 players. Players take turns placing markers into hex spaces with the ultimate goal of having the fewest number of connected areas on the board and the most markers on the board when the board is completely full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, players take three turns placing a marker anywhere on the board, except along an edge or adjacent to any other marker. After this initial phase, player take turns placing markers, but now they must be adjacent to an enemy marker. During the game, players may have the opportunity to capture enemy markers and place one of their markers in the space or save the markers to alter scores at the end of the game. When the entire board is full of markers, players count their total number of markers on the board and deduct their total number of separate disconnected groups from that amount. The player with the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
