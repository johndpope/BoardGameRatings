							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ile Jokisen Kapakkakierros</name>
									
			<description>Ile Jokinen is a Finnish stand-up comedian who created this satiric take on Monopoly. Players are going through pubs and are in constant danger of losing all their money. Luckily every time you pass 'start' the state pays you your unemployment benefit so you can keep on roaming in the pubs. Also the main goal is to be the first to get to a 100% invalidity so you could leave on a pension. &lt;br/&gt;So there are two ways of wining. Be the first to get the invalidity or the last with some money left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
