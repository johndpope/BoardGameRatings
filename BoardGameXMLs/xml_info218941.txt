			<description>From where he came from and who he is a mystery to all in the Kage Kaze Zoku save for the grand master. He never speaks and is never seen without his mask, it seems to the rest of his fellow shadow crows that he neither has need to eat nor sleep, spending most of his time on the training fields. None would ever consider questioning his place amongst them though. The word of the grand master is unquestioned and beside that fact the man fights like a demon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister contains one model, one 30mm base and one full colour profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
