			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Chocolatiers, you take on the role of a young chocolatier boxing up chocolates to make a decadent chocolate display! Sharing is caring in the world of chocolates, so while you'll draw three chocolates into your hand, you only get to keep one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have your Chocolates, discard them to claim Box Tiles for your display. Each Box Tile rewards you with victory points. When boxing chocolates, make sure to select boxes that will fit well in your display as you'll get bonus points for getting the majority of connected chocolate-types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can't quite make the right connection for majority? That's okay, because as a chocolatier you have the special ability to craft a WILD chocolate that matches with all adjacent chocolate-types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins the game! Do you have what it takes to become the next world-famous chocolatier?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
