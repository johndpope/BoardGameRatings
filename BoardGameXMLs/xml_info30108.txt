			<description>Premiered at Essen 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended for Ages 4 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: 26 card pairs displaying food, 1 pair of family cards, 1 tooth, 1 toothbrush, 1 bacterium, 1 Decoder, tooth cleaning glossary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first game children gather together pairs of food cards and take turns stating whether the food is healthy for teeth or contains too much sugar.  By training the decoder on a red point on the cards, they can determine whether they are correct or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game is played more like traditional Memory, but in addition, after claiming the pair the child must state whether the food is tooth-friendly or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The family cards are always taken automatically without further tests being applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tooth, toothbrush and bacterium are used to indicate the various food statuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Received 2 out of a possible 6 dice pips at Spielphase, due to ambiguities of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
