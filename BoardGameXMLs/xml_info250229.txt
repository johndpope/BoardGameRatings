							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rival Turf</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The situation is wack! Your gang was crossing through rival turf on the way to a big party when everybody got jumped by members of the Westside Rumblers. You made it out of the brawl without a scratch but your crew wasn't so lucky. Six of them are now in the hospital and your rivals stole their &amp;ldquo;colors&amp;rdquo;... that is their vests that identify them as members of your gang. Word on the street is that these vests were given to a bunch of hobos to wear as a joke. Your gang's street cred is in the toilet right now and that ain't good if you want to keep holding your own turf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're gonna do something about it alright. You might be in the middle of rival turf but you can fight your way out of any corner, just like you did earlier. While you're at it, you're gonna recover those lost colors and settle a few scores with some of your rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though your crew managed to take a dozen Rumblers down earlier you realize that this ain't gonna be an easy task. You're alone now, and this side of town is the worst. In addition to fighting the remaining members of the Westside Rumblers you're gonna have to put up with a lot of other goons that want a piece of your hide. This place is crawling with bikers, junkies, thugs, pimps, and even a few edgy security guards.  There's vicious dogs and sewer rats that you're gonna have to avoid long the way, and other hazards like crazy drivers, stray bullets, and mean little old ladies with pepper spray. Still, you gotta do it. Before you leave Westside you gotta make sure you've settled a few scores. Your reputation depends on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Exiles of the Wicked Maze, this adventure features single player, solo play action that is driven by a symbol filled maze, simplified rules, and a random roll chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a complete game on its own. Your imagination is the only thing required other than access to a printer, a pencil, and some six sided dice. A perfect game for when you don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time, can&amp;rsquo;t get a full gaming group together, or have a power outage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
