			<description>In this game, each player runs a team of five athletes, one in each of the Pentathlon disciplines (Marathon, Cycling, Swimming, Sailing and Canoeing), hoping to win the gold in as many as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten cards are dealt to each player. You start by drawing the top card of either the draw or discard piles, and end your turn by discarding a card --or by playing nothing and saying &amp;quot;Pass&amp;quot; (to build up your hand).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may play tricks of three cards of any event suit to roll the two dice for your piece in that event. Free cards are used to round out incomplete tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a trick on the table from a previous turn, you may add the appropriate Good Start card to it --this gives you an extra roll of the dice. You may also play Bad Start cards on other players' tricks, to prevent them from playing Good Starts (but not from adding tricks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who goes out (played all his cards, with or without discarding) gets a free dice roll in the event of his choice.  The deal then passes left, and both the draw and discard piles are picked up and shuffled anew (as at game start).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No two pieces may occupy the same spot; if you cannot pass, you stop behind.  As pieces pass the finish lines, medals are awarded as appropriate for that event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three players: the fourth team isn't used.  Two players: Each player runs two teams; each trick is good for two separate rolls in that event, one per team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring: Gold is worth 8 points, silver 4 and bronze 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
