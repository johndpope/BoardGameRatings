			<description>Using Tabletop Role-Playing Game Creation to Enhance Literature Education in High School English Classes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dissertation submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree of Doctor in Education in Learning Technologies (Pepperdine University).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Describes an extended methodology based on TPACK for leading high school students through a multi-week process of creating a roleplaying game based on a piece of literature.  Includes detailed instructions, comprehensive evaluations, and two major examples of games created using a novel (Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury) and  a play (The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde).  Presents partial transcriptions and photographs of the created games being played by the students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, does not contain complete documentation of the actual games that were created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TPACK is the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
