			<description>WAFFLE-OPOLY was produced exclusively for the employees of The Waffle House Restaurants. In celebration of Waffle House&amp;rsquo;s 50th Anniversary, the game has both a very distinctive look and a name that&amp;rsquo;s just fun to say. Late for the Sky designed and produced all of the art, including the sunny-side up eggs that sit in the game&amp;rsquo;s distinctive Skillet token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As time has passed, this game has developed a bit of a cult following. People still want to know where they can buy the game. It seems that customers of these popular restaurants have as much love for Waffle House as Waffle House employees! But this game was designed for Employees Only. The four Company principals appear in caricature on the game board and a timeline representing the Company&amp;rsquo;s 50 years in business is also featured. The property spaces on the board are store locations that were selected through an internal Waffle House contest, driven through performance of a store&amp;rsquo;s employees. A great competition ensued, coupled with a real source of pride throughout the entire Waffle House store network. Regardless of the competition&amp;rsquo;s outcome, every Waffle House employee received a WAFFLE-OPOLY game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
