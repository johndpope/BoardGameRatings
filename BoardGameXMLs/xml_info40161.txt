			<description>Over The Top by Whitman Publishing Co. of Racine Wisconsin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this game the player places the wooden shooter at any point behind the starting line and puts a ball in the cup. He then snaps the base of the shooter with his thumb and finger so the shooter slides down the playing board and hits the wooden barrier, making the ball jump out of the cup, over the barrier and into one of the numbered holes. To determine who shall play first, the players each snap one ball. The player having the highest score shoots first. Each player in turn then shoots all the balls. He adds the numbers appearing near the holes into which his balls fell. This is his score. 500 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
