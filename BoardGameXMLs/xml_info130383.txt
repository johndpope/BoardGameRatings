							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Another Lifeless Planet and Me With No Beer</name>
									
			<description>A text adventure by Dennis Drew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have played MAROONED AGAIN, you are acquainted with our hapless hero.  He wrecks space ships like you and I munch hamburgers.  In Marooned Again, he found an alien ship and sent clones aboard to try and get the vessel to blast off and go for safety.  Apparently he succeeded, because he's back again, and he's done it again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the way... he is you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have crashed your ship on a hostile alien planet.  This one is REALLY hostile; you realize you've landed right in the middle of an alien security hive.  Surviving this time isn't going to be just a matter of figuring out a relatively harmless alien ship; this one is out to get you.  Your frail human body cannot stand the strain of the severe artificial gravity within &lt;br/&gt;the alien structure, so you have to send in somewhat retarded clones to do the job for you.  If you can get them to blast off and go for help, you just might, maybe, be rescued.  They are under your full control, through telepathic link.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the telepatic link section was slightly damaged in the crash.  The clones are all functioning, but your link with them is shaky at best.  Upon testing them you discover a few commands in one or two words such as LOOK, GET CHAIR, GO DOOR, N,S,E,W,U,D (directions of travel) and you figure you'll discover the rest by trial and error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clones need to go into the alien security nest and come out with the materials required to allow a forgotten (but valuable to you) alien ship to blast off and go for help.  If you fail, you will never have another beer; aliens hate beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
