			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dusk settles over the silent streets of Ravenor as the remaining residents hasten to be indoors, racing against the sinking sun. There, behind barred doors and bolted shutters they await the coming of the dawn and news of the next horrific discovery to be made on the streets that used to be their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Universal Adventures Chamber of Blood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures Chamber of Blood is the sixth release in the Adventure Module series set in and under the town of Ravenor and this adventure is loaded with fantastic, imagination-firing, dungeon-adventuring fun and excitement. The Adventure Module includes a new Adventure Record, 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards, 18 Treasure cards, and 27 cards for new special areas and features. Chamber of Blood also introduces an all new type of card, the Lore card. The Adventure Module brings you 9 Lore cards, which draw your characters into the adventure and add a whole new dimension to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;J really pushed the bounds of imagination and creativity with Chamber of Blood and we hope it will bring you a great gaming experience. Chamber of Blood is the most engrossing, imaginative Adventure Module to date and certainly the most deadly. The characters will enter deadly new environments and face dangerous new foes. Not to mention a host of new cards to add to your collection. Play this adventure and you&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about it long after the dice have stopped rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, Chamber of Blood can be played solo or with a group, with or without a GM. The adventure is highly re-playable and compatible with other Universal Adventures cards. In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
