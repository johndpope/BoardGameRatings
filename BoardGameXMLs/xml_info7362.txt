							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rhyme Time</name>
									
			<description>At the start of each round one player draws a card, selects one of the ten words on the card (words like Troth, Underlay or Trapeze) and reads it aloud. Each player then announces how many words they think they can come up with that rhyme with the selected word. The player with the highest &amp;amp;quot;bid&amp;amp;quot; wins and is the rhymer for that round. The rhymer then has one minute (on a sand timer) to write down all of the rhymes they can. If they are able to write the correct number of words then they win a number of points equal to their bid. If they fail to write the correct number, they lose that many points. The first player to reach 500 points wins. In the case of a dispute, the game comes with an official rhyme dictionary for all of the words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
