			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 4-6 characters of level 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jean Lemaistre, celebrated cavalier of the Order of the Lily, defeated the vampires of Ch&amp;acirc;teau Rougemord many winters ago, though he himself perished in the process. Having no wish to be brought back to life, in common with most cavaliers of his Order, Lemaistre was entombed near the village of Sans-Secours, close to the ch&amp;acirc;teau, with all of his possessions either bequeathed to the Order or sent back to his family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All, that is, except for his banner, the &amp;ldquo;Fleur de Lis&amp;rdquo;, which inexplicably failed to return, and which the Order is now paying you handsomely to retrieve for them from Lemaistre&amp;rsquo;s tomb, which is presumably where it ended up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So wrapped up in warm winter clothing you have journeyed into the mountains in the hope that the trail that you now seek has neither gone too cold nor regained any of its former danger. After all, it has been 50 years &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Dollar Dungeons are standalone adventures designed to be logical, entertaining, challenging and balanced, and easily integrated into any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure has enough material to last three or more playing sessions and enough experience to raise four characters of the appropriate level up by one extra level. Treasure is commensurate with the encounter challenges faced. Scaling information is included for adventuring parties of five or six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this adventure is set around a snow-capped mountain range most of the action takes place within the cold stone walls of the Ch&amp;acirc;teau de Rougemord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
