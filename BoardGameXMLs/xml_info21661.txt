			<description>From Publishers Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CIVIO is a strategy card game that explores the relationship of issues, freedoms, laws, and Supreme Court cases that have both strengthened and reduced civil liberties. Each player starts as an intern at a law firm specializing in civil rights. Using a handful of cards representing laws, Supreme Court decisions, constitutional amendments, key issues, rights and freedoms, players race to combine these cards into precedents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
