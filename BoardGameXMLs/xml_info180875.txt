			<description>There are 7 different fashions for 2, 3 or 4 players to play the game. Each player has up to 24 pawns, which can be moved in every direction or jump over other pawns. In some games opponent pawns can be taken by jumping over them, as long as they are not in neutral territory (starting positions and center spaces). The goal is to get ones pawns to the starting positions of the opponent or on the center spaces of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published before 1908.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
