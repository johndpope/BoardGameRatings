			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Punk is an experimental roleplaying game where players will create Punks who are opposed by &amp;quot;The Man&amp;quot;.  One player will be &amp;quot;The Man&amp;quot; (GM), who will generate a list of Threats that can be used against the punks.  These Threats may be customized to fit the specific &amp;quot;-punk&amp;quot; genre desired (steampunk, cyberpunk, etc.).  The remaining players will be Punks.  Note that The Man need not be &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; as the GM traditionally is in other roleplaying games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Punks have three statistics called Passions:  Fight, Fuck, Flight.  Each of these is defined with a narrative tag and at least one of them must express support or devotion to the status quo.  Punks also have three details (skills, quirks, personality, or whatever).  Each Punk must also identify one or more signature punk songs.  Each character should have about the same number of songs that aggregate to about the same play length, and no two characters should share a signature song.  All of these songs need to be placed on a single device that can randomly shuffle and play them continuously.  It is The Man's responsibility to make sure the punk music keeps playing in a random arrangement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Punk sessions begin with all the Punks in a bar.  Characters each get five Anarchy tokens; The Man gets ten Authority Tokens.  Narrative action then begins.  The Man will present a Threat and the Punks must respond. If (when) conflict occurs a dice pool is used to determine who succeeds.  Characters describe their own failure, but The Man describes characters' successes.  If desired, a Punk may spend an Anarchy token to gain success.  When a Punk spends his or her last Anarchy token, however, they Fade Out.  Likewise, The Man may spend an Authority token to enforce failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Punk music soundtrack plays during a conflict, the character who is associated with the current song, as their signature song, gets to describe narrative success without spending an Anarchy token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
