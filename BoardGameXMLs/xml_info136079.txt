			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the midst of the Age of Mind and Magic, one of the Sorcerer-Kings sought an alliance with a great green dragon against the Cavians. When the wyrm would not give its power willingly, the sorcerer took it by force. Using blood rituals he gifted his greatest general with a measure of the dragon&amp;rsquo;s physical power. He then took her spirit and bound it into a powerfully enchanted axe to arm that general for battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasures of NeoExodus: Mordant Wrath is created for use with your NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting home gaming for the Pathfinder RPG. The Treasures of NeoExodus series focus on creating unique and interesting magical and mundane items that you can use in your NeoExodus home games that give you more a personal connection to the item.
