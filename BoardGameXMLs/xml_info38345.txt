							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Take it Away</name>
									
			<description>Take it Away was published in A Gamut of Games. A word by Sid Sackson:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Take it Away is the name of the game and not, I hope, the verdict of the reader. Compared to Focus and Network, which demand extreme concentration to be played at the highest level, Take it Away can, and should, be played in a relaxed manner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take if away is based on Solitaire but is designed for up to four players. It uses a checkers board and poker chips in different colors. The first player take the first chip and creates a hole in the board, then the play continues with each player doing a solitaire-like move. Each chip captured counts to that player score, different colors have different values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any player can give-up playing at any time, except the last, that must continue play until no more moves are allowed. This last player has a penalty to his score based the chips remaining on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
