			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A modern warfare wargame, intended to be used with 1/285 miniatures and terrain tiles, developed and adopted as a training tool by US Army from 1977 to 1997.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scale is one inch to 50 meters. A curtain is suspended half way down the playing area to simulate fog of war, and can be moved forward or backward depending on the knowledge of the terrain of the opponents. The game is normally played with three of four players per side and an impartial controller. Opponent teams take alternate turns, going through a sequence involving, in that order, artillery fire requests, previously requested artillery fire resolution, direct fire, movement. Combat is resolved by dice rolls on probability tables. The game uses two six-sided dice of different colors, to generate numbers from 11 to 66.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
