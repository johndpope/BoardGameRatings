			<description>Fourth Quarter Football miniatures game, recreating the thrill of gridiron football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coaches select plays from a play deck they have designed, in an attempt to outwit their opponents. The plays selected are played out on the highly detailed game field, with fantastically detailed miniatures. Players are rewarded for sticking to the planned plays, but it's the fourth quarter, and things get tough, and crucially, players make mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a unique two phase movement mechanism to recreate the feel of a football game, but plays in under one and a half hours.&lt;br/&gt;Any actions are decided by dice rolls, but the chances of success depend on the skills and the placement of the players involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
