			<description>The Piggeries game is played by each player gently pulling a string on the back of their respective pig to advance it toward the center of the game, which represents a well.  Players can place bets using the enclosed game counters.  There are four wooden pegged tracks, four hand painted wooden pigs, a &amp;quot;well&amp;quot; for bets, and a cardboard roof for the well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The description of the game that appears on the inside of the box lid:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As many persons can take part, as there are pigs in this extremely interesting and amusing game, which holds the players and onlookers spellbound with excitement, from beginning to end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is set up, as seen on the picture.  The players then deposit money or counters in the pool.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The pigs are placed, with their hind legs on the lowest step of the planks.  At a given signal they proceed, step by step, up the plank, by the aid of the string, which the players must pull lightly.  If the string is pulled too hard or violently the pig will tumble and fall from the plank, which necessitates going back to the starting point, thus rendering the game very exciting and making the fun fast and furious.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;At first many of these 'accidents' will happen, but with a little more practice, the player becomes adept and the pigs make splendid progress.  The player, whose pig arrives at the trough first, is declared winner and accordingly takes the stakes.  Throughout the game the pigs must not be touched by the hand.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No year or publisher is on the box...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
