							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sundered Legion</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sundered Legion serves as the Series&amp;rsquo; stunning conclusion and is written by Liz Courts and Brendan Victorson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fires still burn and smoke billows over the bloodstained walls of Lord Erasmus&amp;rsquo; fortress in the Castle Ward. In the aftermath of the attempt on Erasmus&amp;rsquo; life and the chaos that followed, the Kharel had no choice but to enact martial law to regain some semblance of order. Talquar troops stationed in the Army Ward were deployed into the city to reinforce the Night Watchmen in every ward and the city walls have been manned with full complements around the clock. As the Kharel prepares to lock down the city, tensions run high with the reports of Commander Jaken Abberbaugh&amp;rsquo;s thousand-strong army fighting in the borderlands returning to enforce Prostolom&amp;rsquo;s decree. Commander Jaken Abberbaugh, Malkan Abberbaugh&amp;rsquo;s less popular twin brother and mentored by General Uril Krakon himself, has designs upon a seat in the Kharel and has been waiting for just such order to return to the Great City. Favored by General Krakon for the position within the Kharel, and with his brother out of the way and leverage in place, his confirmation is sealed &amp;ndash; or is it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City is on verge of tearing itself apart and the Kortezian Army may follow suit. Whatever happens in the next 48 hours, the Great City will never be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 48 pages adventure will take you to explore the depths of the Circus Maximus, in the Army Ward of the Great City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sundered Legion is an urban adventure most suitable for 14th-16th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
