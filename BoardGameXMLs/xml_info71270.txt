							<name  sortindex="1">Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Fallout 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed game that took RPG'ing out of the dungeons and into a dynamic, apocalyptic retro-future.&lt;br/&gt;It's been 80 long years since your ancestor trod across the wastelands.  As you search for the Garden of Eden Creation Kit to save your primitive village, your path is strewn with crippling radiation, megalomaniac mutants, and a relentless stream of lies, deceit and treachery.  You begin to wonder if anyone really stands to gain anything from this brave, new world.&lt;br/&gt;Mastering your character's skills and traits for survival, Fallout 2 will challenge you to endure in a post-nuclear world whose future withers with every passing moment....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     We Are Family: Not everyone that joins you looks like you. Super-mutants, robo-dogs and ghouls may join your adventure, or why not do-it-yourself by implanting a brain into that shiny new robot body.&lt;br/&gt;     Bigger &amp;amp; Badder Than Ever: Bigger, smarter, nastier enemies than you've ever fought before.  We've given you a few pals that are just as ugly.  You didn't think you were the only Bad-ass in town did you?&lt;br/&gt;     Kill Smarter, Not Harder: Improved combat AI for friends and foes alike.  Most of the people in your own group won't take that burst shot with the Flechette-gun, but a coupe are probably just aching for the opportunity. &lt;br/&gt;     Sex &amp;amp; Romance After The Bomb: Fall in love, get married, then pimp your spouse for a little extra chump-change.  Hey, it's a dark and dangerous world.&lt;br/&gt;     Share The Wealth: If you want to, you can upgrade any traveling companions with more dangerous weapons, tougher armor, or even teach them new skills and abilities.  You'd better make sure they're on your side.&lt;br/&gt;     Learning Is Fun-Da-Mental: Over 100 new skills, called perks, available to learn during the course of your travels.  Better to learn the exquisite art of Pyromania, the uncanny timing of a Demolition expert, or how to squeeze the trigger on your spiffy new Gauss-rifle faster than the next guy?  Decisions, decisons...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
