			<description>A promotional card game from Kellogg's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set collecting game with everyone playing at once. You call out cards you have available to swap (but not the colour) and you try to do a deal with a player who is calling out a letter you need (but, of course, it might be the wrong colour but you don't know that until you add the card to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have a set of three cards (that spell POP) you shout out &amp;quot;Pop!&amp;quot; and lay down the set face-up. The game stops whilst your set is checked as valid and then starts again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to lay down all their cards in valid sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Really, this is a simpler form of Pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
