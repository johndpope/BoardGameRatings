			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultra 7 is a fast, fun card game with plenty of twists and turns. After being dealt 7 cards each, players take turns playing cards face up onto one of two play piles. The card being played must match the top card in terms of color, number, or suit, and the first player to rid their hand of cards wins. However, the deck also contains an abundance of special cards. For example, the Flip card requires a coin toss, the results of which determine who must draw two cards. The Trade card provides the option of trading hands with another player. The Grab card is a mad grab for spoons (one less than the number of players), with the empty-handed player required to draw two cards. The dreaded Spoiler card can be a major roadblock to winning. The unpredictability these cards bring to Ultra 7 lend it an exciting playfulness that make for a rip-roaring good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
