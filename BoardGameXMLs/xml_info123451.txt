			<description>&amp;quot;Goblin-Pr&amp;uuml;gelparty&amp;quot; (Goblin-Beatingparty) is a Fantasy-cardgame in which two players take control of Goblins, kobolds and little devils, who enjoy beating up each other, after they have been summoned by a wizard who was not powerful enough to take control of them.&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 3 cards on their hands and have to decide which cards to play for themselves and which to play for the opponent. Playing cards for the opponent may seem odd, but it is the only way to gain new cards. And since 11 cards in one of the card-rows end the game, you will need some more cards than the 3 you start with if you don't want the game to end early.&lt;br/&gt;Nearly every single one of the 30 cards contains a unique effect, but while some of these effects are executed immediately, others wait for the end of the game before beeing executed. And you can't be completely sure whether they will be in the same position on the same side at that moment.&lt;br/&gt;When the end is declared and the last effects have been executed, it is time to count the strenght and see who has collected the stronger - or more effective - little horde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
