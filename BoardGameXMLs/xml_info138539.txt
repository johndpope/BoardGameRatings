							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bull</name>
									
			<description>Much like Liar's Dice and other bluffing games, Bull uses 4 sets of cards numbered 1 to 11 as well as 4 Wild Cards and 2 &amp;quot;Bull&amp;quot; cards. Players play cards face down and make an annoucement concerning what those cards are. If someone challenges, then if the player was telling the truth, the challenger takes the cards. If not, the annoucing player keeps the cards. Scoring is based on the value of the cards players take and the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
