			<description>Imagine a world where instead of using his experiences with LSD to become an evangelist of therapeutic psychadelia, Timothy Leary had instead opted to learn assembler and program low-budget shmups for pc-download. For those unable to afford even the smallest portion of crack, Spheres of Chaos will dilate the pupil of your third eye and give you change from a fiver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is no usual Asteriods family member, SoC is the difficult nephew. The one with all the good albums who stayed out late and got that girl into trouble back in school. Those particle effects? You can recognise the family traits as being present and correct, but somewhere in the past you can see some Minter has entered the bloodline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're going to be glad very soon that SoC doesn't really vacate from the Asteroids paradigm, because whilst the basic game is in the same world - visually, this has vacated the previous galaxy. This is the anti-asteroids. Whereas Logg drew his space pure, flat and black - exquisitely cut with bright white - McLeod gives you all the colours. All at once. And then he cycles them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
