			<description>CHAOS RINGS is a brand-new role playing game (RPG) which was initially released for the iPhone&amp;reg;/iPod touch&amp;reg; in April 2010. The game has earned high praise as a title that stretches the hardware to the limit, boasting a huge adventure and beautiful graphics. As a result, the title earned the No.1 sales spot in 15 countries around the world and is now available for iPad featuring 1024x768 HD support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHAOS RINGS is set around a battle tournament called Arca Arena, where teams of two compete for victory and eternal life. Characters gain levels and earn experience points from defeating their foes to upgrade their team's combo skills, enabling the pair to launch bigger, stronger and more devastating attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique story of CHAOS RINGS unfolds based on the pairing of characters that the players choose. By experiencing the story lines of each pairing, the true mystery of Arca Arena will be unveiled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring a turn-based battle system, players are given the choice between &amp;quot;solo&amp;quot; moves, where they can enter commands separately, or &amp;quot;pair&amp;quot; moves, to execute actions as a team. Working as a &amp;quot;pair&amp;quot; allows the characters to concentrate their efforts for more effective power. Defeating enemy monsters allows players to obtain specific DNA information called &amp;quot;gene,&amp;quot; which players can equip to learn the monster's magic and special attack moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information, please visit the official CHAOS RINGS website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://dlgames.square-enix.com/chaosrings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://dlgames.square-enix.com/chaosrings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
