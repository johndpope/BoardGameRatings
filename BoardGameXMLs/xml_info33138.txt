							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Big Battalions</name>
									
			<description>A Napoleonic Game suitable for several brigades on each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be played with 28mm down to 6mm figures. Infantry are based on 40mm squares for 25/8mm and 25mm squares for 15mm down to 6mm. Units are battalions, squadrons or batteries. Games are usually up to a Corps per side with two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card driven with the numbers of cards and options available being dependent on the quality of the commander. Combat is abstracted in &amp;quot;DBx&amp;quot; style depending on the number of units involved and support rather than detailed firing and melee results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement and range measurement is also very flexible being determined by &amp;quot;bands&amp;quot; of distance (around 6&amp;quot; in a 25mm game) rather than micro measurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National characteristics and morale rules cover all aspects of the Napoleonic period. Designed for rapid action and big decisions rather than micro management. And no casualty removal so all those lovely 28mm figures that you painted stay on display!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
