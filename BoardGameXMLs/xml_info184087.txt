							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anarchy Role-Playing System Technical Manual</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical manual, released as HTML and ASCII text, provides instructions on how to build characters (using the supplied character sheet), enemies (using the supplied enemy sheet), and new weapon types (using the supplied weapon sheet).  It also provides the core mechanic of the game, in which any contested action is resolved with a dice pool roll against a target difficulty.  If the action is contested by another person then the target difficult will be the opponent's dice pool, otherwise the GM will assign a difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interestingly, the rules also include mechanics for &amp;quot;winning&amp;quot; the game, which the GM does if all the players are killed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document is supported by three single-page supplementary sheets, as noted above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
