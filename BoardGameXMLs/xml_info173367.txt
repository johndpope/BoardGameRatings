			<description>Doug, Doug, Goose, Caboose is a quick party game inspired by the children's playground game &amp;quot;Duck, Duck, Goose&amp;quot;. The game supports 3-8 players, and plays in about 10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer shuffles the deck of cards (one per player in the game), and deals one, in turn, to each player, calling out the card each time. Once both the &amp;quot;Goose&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Caboose&amp;quot; cards are in play, these player race to call out the other players names, going clockwise around the table. The winner scores a point. The cards are shuffled and the game continues until someone scores three points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait! There's more! The &amp;quot;Goose&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Caboose&amp;quot; players can get tripped up and have to start over if they don't say the names right, or if they don't call the other racing player &amp;quot;Doug&amp;quot;. Everyone else is in charge with keeping the racing players honest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
