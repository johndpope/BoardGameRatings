							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mogogol</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For eons the amphibious frog people common to the dismal swamps of the realm were known for malicious cruelty, greed, and cowardice-- acts that earned them the nickname bog-bullies. It seemed entirely unlikely that any good could come from these stupid and ugly muck dwellers, but something strange happened only two centuries ago that would dawn a new race of impeccable good. A curse, some say it was. An untherwise unremarkable family of bog-bullies, known as the Mogogols could do no harm. Driven by an insane desire to do good deeds, and lead by other manic tendencies, this race left the dismal swamps and embarked on a remarkable journey. When hard times befell other other frog-like races, the Mogogols were there to lend a flipper. Nearly two-hundred years later, the mogogols emerged as a unique race in their own right. Grab your sword and hop into action with this new PC race brought to you by Alluria Publishing. Ever wanted to play a swashbuckling frog, an amphibious acrobat, or a toadly priest? Then perhaps mogogol is the race for you!&lt;br/&gt;Published under the Fourth Edition GSL. Full racial statistics for a new PC race, feats, monster blocks, and much much more! Colorfully illustrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
