							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Assassin&#039;s Guide to Poison</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one was hell. It started out as 101 Poisons and Magical Diseases but at about poison #56 I realized I was very unhappy with most of what I had w ritten. I shoved it aside and completed 101 Mundane Treasures and 101 Arcane Spell Components before coming back to poisons. Then I went on a trip. And then I got sick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wrote about twenty poisons the week I was sick and then, the next week, I read them over and realized they sucked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I deleted them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And started over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter how much I slam my head against this thing it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work the way I want it to. So what I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do is just clean the poisons I&amp;rsquo;m happy with, throw in some previous open game content that would be of help to those using poisons, and release the thing as a free PDF on my site and RPGNow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
