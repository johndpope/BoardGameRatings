			<description>Dejarik or holochess is the holographic game played by Chewbacca and R2d2 in the film &amp;quot;Star Wars.&amp;quot; Although there are several fan-made rules sets that implement the game, this entry describes the game played using rules and figures from the Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Miniatures game &lt;br/&gt;The Masters of the Force expansion, which included miniatures of the eight creatures&amp;mdash;Ghhhk, Houjix, K'lor'slug, Kintan Strider, Mantellian Savrip, Molator, Monnok, Ng'ok. SWMGamers.com used these rules and organized a series of Dejarik games at the 2015 Gencon and planned a tournament there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a circular board of 25 regions, divided into three concentric rings. The outer and middle rings are each divided into twelve checkered &amp;quot;squares&amp;quot;, while the inner circle is a single area. Each player places their four monsters on squares on the outer ring opposite each other, and places the card with the monsters' statistics beside them. Every round, the players roll a d20 to determine initiative, then take turns activating the monsters. Each monster can move and attack once per round according to its speed, statistics, and special attacks as listed on its card. Once all monsters have activated, a new round begins. Play continues until all monsters on one side are destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
