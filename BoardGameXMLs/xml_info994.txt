							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Auf Trab im Sulkydrom</name>
									
			<description>Sulkydrom is Trap racing round a circuit, basically modern 'chariot' racing, popular in continental Europe and the southern US, but unseen in Britain. The eight horses are named from Atletico to Happy Days and you play either Horse or Position cards to allow each to move, with the leading horse going first. The cards show the lengths they may move from 0 to 4 including half lengths, e.g. 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 etc. Shifting lanes costs 1 length, but the Sulky only moves forward a half length. As with many such games, the inside lane has fewer spaces on the bend than the outside lanes. But if you are blocked in and cannot move, you miss your go completely. Taking the inside line therefore is quicker, but makes it easier for others to block you. Each player also has a Joker and Gallop card to help themselves and hinder others once in the game. The races are meant to be quick and the designer encourages betting on them, but doesn't give a method. A solid, colorful production with a jigsaw board, the game comes packaged in a large wooden box with sliding card lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
