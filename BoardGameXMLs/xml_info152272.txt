			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small farmhouse, built from the logs of the largest trees that have grown here, lies in the middle of a large clearing. Meadows for the few animals lie to the one side and fields of wheat to the other. A cart is parked behind the house and in preparation for the coming winter stacks of fire wood have been set up next to it. Soon it will be time to harvest the fields. Some other odd jobs remain to be done before winter arrives as well. Among other things a few of the wooden shingles, loosed by wind and weather, have to be replaced to make sure the inside of the log house remains warm and comfortable during the cold season.
