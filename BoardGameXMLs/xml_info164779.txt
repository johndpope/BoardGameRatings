			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city is a dark and dangerous place; loads of folks would just as soon kill ya as give ya the time of day. It's hard for any right guy or dame to keep sucking air, let alone make any headway in this town. Most of the time it's a toss-up, and it all comes down to The Coin's Hard Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Coin's Hard Edge is a Noir-themed Role Playing game which relies on a d2 (a coin toss) to determine the outcome of events. Fate is a fickle lady, and failure is always an option. Desaturate your gaming experience and take a walk down the mean streets with The Coin's Hard Edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
