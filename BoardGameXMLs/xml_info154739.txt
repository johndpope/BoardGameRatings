			<description>Carmen Sandiego's Great Chase Through Time is a 1997 rebooted version of the 1989 game Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?. The game was strongly influenced by the short-lived PBS Kids game show of the same name. It was published by Br&amp;oslash;derbund, which previewed the game at the 1997 Toy Fair in New York City. After Br&amp;oslash;derbund was sold to The Learning Company in 1999, the game was re-released with a minimal redesign (including being renamed to its current title) on June 1 of that year. The game is recommended for ages 9 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's narrative involves master thief Carmen Sandiego, who has used a time machine called the Chronoskimmer to plant her associates at key historical events, aiming to influence history by stopping these events from occurring. The objective of the game is to track down Carmen Sandiego and her henchmen by jumping through time tunnels that link historical periods together, and correct the course of history. The player visits well-known historical events, such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence and Lewis and Clark's expedition to the Pacific Northwest, and meets historical figures including Queen Hatshepsut, William the Conqueror, and Yuri Gagarin. In each segment, or case, the player must work out which items have been stolen and solve historical puzzles to stop Carmen's villains. By the end of case 18, they will have the tools to chase and capture Carmen in the final case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Carmen Sandiego's Great Chase Through Time&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
