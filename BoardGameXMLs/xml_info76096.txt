							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adventures of Lomax</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventures of Lomax (also known as Lomax) is a spin-off video game of the Lemmings series. The player takes the role of Lomax, a lemming character that has to save his friends and animals from an evil doctor. The game was released for the PlayStation and Windows in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game inherits the gameplay and style which was seen in Erwin Kloibhofer and Henk Nieborg's previous title, Flink. As Lomax, the player must navigate through four main worlds with three levels each, in a side-scrolling platform game. The enemies are brainwashed lemmings who have been turned into monsters taking the form of zombies, cowboys, and aliens. Like some other platformers, bumping into them kills the player's character. The player's main attack spins Lomax around, and can be used to both avoid being killed by bumping into them, and &amp;quot;kill&amp;quot; them. By effectively &amp;quot;killing&amp;quot; them, they are turned back into ordinary lemmings and leave in peace. There are coins scattered throughout the levels that grant additional lives when enough are found. Magic helmets can also be found, which can be used as weapons and grant Lomax immunity from one attack, after which he loses the helmet. In addition to the standard platforming, Lomax can also use several abilities featured in the original Lemmings (game), such as builders and diggers, as well as others not found in the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
