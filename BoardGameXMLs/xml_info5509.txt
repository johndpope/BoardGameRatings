			<description>Diangle is a race game of luck and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race to be the first to complete levels 1 through 6 and back again, in order on their triangular gameboard. Each player has a set of 6 custom dice. Each die is different, having a different face marked in red. Players can complete a numbered level by rolling 3 dice with that number, and then can move on and try to complete the next level. To win, you'll have to move fast,  as you work on the completion of 3 levels a time. The red numbers complete their level all by themselves, giving you the chance to race ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
