			<description>The game board shows a tree on which 2 to 5 squirrels run up and down, using a die to determine how fast. They can, however, also decide to jump from one branch to another by guessing whether their roll will be odd or even. If they guess correctly, they can jump, if not, they have to skip a turn. To win, they need to gather &amp;quot;nuts&amp;quot;, represented by cardboard ieces which are placed on the tree at the start of the game (there are different variants for this).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
