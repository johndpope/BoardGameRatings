							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Hats</name>
									
			<description>Yours is not an easy path. You are a Hatmancer, bearer of an ancient legacy. On your head rests great power and responsibility. Through your adornments you become great; through your ambitions, you become more than human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What will you do? Who will you be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where is your hat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Game of Hats, certain individuals tap into an ancient power known as Millinimancy. They call upon the dormant capabilities of their headgear and infuse it with life. With Millinimancy, a Hatmancer (as these individuals are known) manifests a hat&amp;rsquo;s archetype and embodies its strengths. Limitless power is at her command, but at what price?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hatmancer must take care to maintain her will in the face of temptation and alien intelligence. Hatmancers who rely too strongly on their hats find themselves overwhelmed by a foreign influence. Her weapons turn against her, instead possessing the Hatmancer&amp;rsquo;s essence and gaining control. Those unfortunate souls operate under the hat&amp;rsquo;s influence forever more, forsaking family and friends for the hat&amp;rsquo;s desires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should a hat grow too powerful and insistent, the Hatmancer may appease the hat with slight concessions. A truly great Hatmancer bears the burden of many such demands. Thus must a Hatmancer strike a careful balance. She holds on her head unimaginable power, but at what cost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A roleplaying game with style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
