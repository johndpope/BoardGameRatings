			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Battle between two rival Wizards. Each figure represents a Wizard or a Summoned Creature. Victory: Reduce the opposing Wizard to zero Hit Points.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with just their Wizard on the board. Summon Cards are played to summon monsters which are then controlled by that Wizard. The Wizards battle by using Spell Cards to attack their opponent as well as by making attacks with the summoned monsters. Card play determines how units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
