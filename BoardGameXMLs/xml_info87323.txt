			<description>From the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substitution Levels for Minor Valorous Organizations in Champions of Valor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champions of Valor discusses what it means to be valorous and heroic in Faer&amp;ucirc;n. The book introduces heroic ideals, as well as new feats, prestige classes, and substitution levels for heroes associated with the major valorous organizations. However, it does not provide any alternate mechanics for heroes belonging to all the minor valorous organizations in its pages. Some of these organizations are more suited for player characters than others, and several seem to cry out for some player character options. Thus, this web enhancement offers substitution levels for members of six minor valorous organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champions of Ruin, on the other hand, discusses what it means to be evil in Faerun, but it offers no substitution levels for any of the organizations that appear in its pages. To rectify this apparent oversight, substitution levels for the Zhentarim fighter and the Dark Moon monk are provided here as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, feel free to adapt the material presented here as you see fit to make it work with your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
