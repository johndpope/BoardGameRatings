							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Good Ship Freedom</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Kafkaesque metaphor about Seekers trying to escape the political, religious, economic and other illusions that entrap them, preventing freedom of Mind and Spirit. Captain K sails to a dark, but enticing Land to look for crew to help cross the dangerous seas to Freedom Island. Constant PATROLS make it difficult for the crew to gather documents &amp;amp; gear needed to make a boarding at any dock. Players are the Crew, seekers after Freedom, helping each other round up credentials which entitle them to board THE GOOD SHIP FREEDOM and avoid those feverish Patrols who never tire vying for your very Being. Courage be with you, Seekers after Truth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
