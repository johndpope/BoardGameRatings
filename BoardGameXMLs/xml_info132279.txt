							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spots and Stripes</name>
									
			<description>Match the spots and the stripes, playing one card at a time next to another on the table or the floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE DEAL: Spread out the whole deck, face down. Each player draws six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PLAY: Anyone begins by putting any card he has drawn face up. The next player (to his left) matches either end, by putting a card with the same number of spots or stripes beside the first card, in a straight line or at an angle. Or else you may use one of the Wild Cards. Tiger and Zebra match any number of stripes. Leopard and Giraffe match spots. Turtle in Cage matches anything. When you play a Wild Card, say how many spots or stripes it has, and with the Wild Wild Card, also say if it is spots or stripes. If you can't match from your hand, draw from the rest of the face-down deck, till you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WINNER: The first to use up all his cards, or the one with the fewest cards when the deck is used up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
