			<description>Al Djemma has a two-step objective to win the game.  The first objective is to move around the outer court until the player has an opportunity to move his token in safety through the treasure maze of any of his opponents with the object of landing on any one of  the opponent's 5  treasure circles, thus capturing an opponent's treasure.&lt;br/&gt;  The final objective of the game is TO MAKE AL DJEMMA.  This occurs when a player, having secured treasure pieces for his tokens, and having entered the inner court, succeeds in landing by an even throw of the dice on one of the three circles of his own color within the inner court .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
