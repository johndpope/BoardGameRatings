			<description>A telephone dial points to the brightly coloured picture which the child may &amp;quot;discard&amp;quot; if he happens to have the same picture in front of him. The child uses the dial to turn the colours indicated by the 2 dice he has thrown. If the arrow on the dial points to a picture that corresponds to a picture which the child has in front of him on the table, the child may turn it over. The first player to succeed in turning over the pre-determined number of cards is the winner. The game consists of a telephone dial, 72 cards and 2 colored dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
