							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kururin Paradise</name>
									
			<description>Kururin Paradise (くるりんパラダイス?) is the sequel to Kuru Kuru Kururin on the Game Boy Advance. It was released only in Japan. However, as the GBA has no region lockout, any GBA unit can be used to play the Japanese version. The menus in the Japanese version are simple enough so that they are easily navigable by a player with little or no Japanese language skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the events of the first game, everything became calm in Kururin Village, until a group of magicians announced that they were starting a live magic show. Kururin's family and Teacher Hare went to the magic show and they never came back. Kururin didn't go with them because he was asleep until he heard them calling his name. He rushed toward the magic show and noticed that no one and nothing was there. So he decided to rush back home to fly in his helicopter, the Helirin, and find them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kururin Paradise&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
