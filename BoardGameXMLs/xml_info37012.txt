							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Outdoorsman Game</name>
									
			<description>Background from the instructions:  The OUTDOORSMAN GAME was created by avid sportsman in a sparsely populated, wildlife rich area of Eastern Oregon.  When he discovered that many of his junior high math students shared his enthusiasm for outdoor activities, he came up with a way to make statistics and probability more interesting to them.  Drawing on his own experiences afield and information from fish and game departments, he developed a game that would involve fishing and hunting while teaching certain mathematical concepts.  When people kept insisting that the game  was too much fun to confine to the classroom, the idea was born of developing an activity that would challenge and entertain sportsmen when time, weather, or resources prohibited an excursion afield.  The OUTDOORSMAN GAME is the result of those efforts.  In the game, the species of fish, fowl, and big game, and the seasons and areas in which they are pursued, closely follow the actual events as they occur in Eastern Oregon.  We trust you will find the OUTDOORSMAN GAME to an enjoyable and entertaining activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
