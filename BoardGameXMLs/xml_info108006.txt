			<description>Trivial Pursuit Bite Size ... Our favourite game now doesn't take a day to play! You can ask and answer 600 questions about ingredients, fast food, techniques and utensils, fine dining, drinks and world food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is another in the &amp;quot;Bite-Size&amp;quot; range of Trivial Pursuit games. It is intended as a portable travel game. The game is packaged in a wedge (&amp;quot;piece-of-pie&amp;quot;) shaped box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &amp;quot;go for a wedge&amp;quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
