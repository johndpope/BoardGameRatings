							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terminus V: The Armageddon Vortex</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terminus V is an elaborate combination of actual and purely imaginary elements. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly hard to define where the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; ends and the &amp;ldquo;fictional&amp;rdquo; begins. For those of you who follow military and scientific matters, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to spot where reality meets fiction-although in some cases, you may not be able to clearly distinguish between these boundaries. However, it really isn't important where the lines blur a bit. The fuzzy area where reality and fiction intermix is intentional. The real fun is in the game itself and what you can (or can&amp;rsquo;t) make of it to be successful in your mission and/or goals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play T5 strictly as a miniatures game, a roleplaying game, or both simultaneously. As you will see, the Character Profile Log sheets can be filled out and set up to use either way, depending upon the amount of information you want to know, or need to have, about a character. The game can easily be converted into a dual miniatures/roleplaying game simply by choosing to play one character as yourself while the rest of your team (Strike Cell) is played normally as miniatures would be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T5 is excellent for present-day combat simulation gaming too! The unique and versatile Com20 game system mechanics give you everything you need to game battles taking place today--with no modifications necessary! See the T5 Action! page for additional details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
