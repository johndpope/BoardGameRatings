			<description>from the review:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;6 suits, with cards #'d 1-9 (Polaroid snapshots on cards of various 'stuff' - houses, cars, boats &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Each player also has 2000 Euros (also cards) to start the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each player is the 'Show-Off'... and plays against the table, ala Blackjack. The Show-Off is dealt 9 cards, which must have no more than 3 of one suit (re-deal if he does have more than 3 of one suit). Once the dealer has settled his hand, nine cards are dealt to the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three rounds ensue... the Show Off plays 3 cards (must be different suits) and (in game theme terms) challenges the other players to out-do him with their stuff. Players play 3 cards from their hand and must do one of 3 things to &amp;quot;keep up with the Joneses&amp;quot;: &lt;br/&gt;1. play 2 cards which match in suit, of which one of those cards are higher in rank (3rd card does not have to match)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. play 3 cards which do not match suits AT ALL, which the total value is higher than the Show-Off's 3 cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. play 3 cards which all match in suit, regardless of value&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once we've determined if any players have &amp;quot;kept up&amp;quot;, we throw out all the cards played and the Show-Off lays down another 3 cards (from his now 6 card hand). Same thing happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is followed by the 3rd round, which consists of everyone's remaining cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, to score this thing: &lt;br/&gt;if you can't match the Show-Off in the first round, you pay him 500 euro... if you get to round 2 but can't match there, 400 euro... round 3, 200 euro. If you match him in round 3, you get 200 euro from him for the two card match, &lt;br/&gt;400 euro for the different suit match, and 500 euro for the three card match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone gets to be the Show-Off one time (or more with fewer players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
