			<description>This is a memory game for Kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this game is to deliver as many toys as possible by collecting Wish list cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must take a Wish list card and find the toys which are on this Wish list card.&lt;br/&gt;If the toy revealed is on the Wish list card (and is the required one in the case of a specific list): the player leaves this Toy card visible and can continue turning over cards as long as he does not make a mistake. He can also choose  to let the player on his left take his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The toy revealed is not on the Wish list card (or is not the required one in the case of a specific list): the player must therefore turn the Toy card face down and loses his turn. The player on his immediate left now has a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last Wish List card has been won, everyone counts the number of toys on the Wish List cards that they won. The player with the largest number of toys wins the game.  In case of a tie, all the players concerned are the winners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
