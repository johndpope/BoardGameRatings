			<description>Star Wars Adventures is a series of novel-driven set-piece adventure games marketed for direct to home sales by Scholastic, Inc. and Lucas Books / Lucasfilms LTD. The game is generally structured along the lines of the 1970s-1980s era &amp;quot;choose your own adventure&amp;quot; (CYOA) novels, except using pregenerated heroic characters from the Star Wars universe, more linear story lines and an &amp;quot;adventure points&amp;quot; scoring system. Players risk losing points for making poor decisions and for bad die rolls, but unlike most earlier CYOA books, seldom (if ever) risk character death. While the adventures are designed for solo play, the adventure points system allows for competitive, partnership or cooperative play by several players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have different RPG-like attributes (name, life-form, allegiance, charm, knowledge, navigation, power, skill, stealth, strength, weaponry and talents). Devices and Powers that the characters might use are rated for accuracy in different circumstances. Similarly, Vehicles are rated by type, speed, distance, stealth and weaponry. Combinations of these attributes are used along with d10 or d20 rolls to determine &amp;quot;adventure numbers&amp;quot; during decisions and confrontations that, in turn, affect both the direction of the storyline and the adventure points score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Wars Adventures is packaged in a plastic carrying case shaped like a flattened Clone Trooper helmet. The base game includes a membership card, adventure poster, d10, d20, character cards, power cards, device cards, vehicle cards, an adventure guide, notebook, point pad, adventure novel and game book. Expansions include additional cards of all types, posters, novels, magazines and game books. Modules in the series are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Hunt the Sun Runner (Ryder Windham, 2002) -- This module is set in the period between Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. A ghost ship is on a crash course with a helpless planet. First you must find it. Then you must stop it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
