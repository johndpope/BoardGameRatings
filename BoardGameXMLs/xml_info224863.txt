			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This relatively simple game is an attempt to adapt game concepts from the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering to a tabletop roleplaying game, played in a more-or-less traditional manner.  The game assumes that players will derive inspiration and ideas from the cards of the collectible card game, but cards are not required to play.  The game is best suited, probably, to experienced roleplayers who like to tinker with rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are defined primarily by spells and talents.  Every spell and talent is aligned with a specific color of magic - the colors align with the card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you might guess from the name, the game was created as a collaborative effort in a sub-reddit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
