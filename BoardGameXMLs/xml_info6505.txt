			<description>Newtown is a city building game designed to be used as a modern teaching aid in leading university city planning departments. Students play individually or in teams. Players take turns buying land and building on it. Earn points for placing homes near schools and churches, factories near water routes and railroads. At the end of each round, town meetings are held to pay taxes and vote on the locations of community facilities (from schools to dumps)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A professional version for educators was published in 1967. A simpler commercial version (still with some educational material) was published in 1971 and a still simpler version in 1972.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
