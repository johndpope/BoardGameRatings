			<description>This is a simple roll and move game of the TT Races on the Isle of Man.  The players take turns rolling dice and moving around the board, a 'satellite photo' style representation of the TT Races course.  At various points they encounter obstacles that may slow them down or speed them up.  They may land on spaces that cause them to draw Race Situation or Pit Signal cards which can affect their progress positively or negatively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game components as listed on the rules card are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Board (TT Course)&lt;br/&gt;Eight playing pieces of different colours (small plastic motorcycles)&lt;br/&gt;One Throwing/Equipment Holder Box&lt;br/&gt;Two Dice&lt;br/&gt;Once Dice Cup&lt;br/&gt;Six sets of Lap Scoring Cards (each numbered 1 - 6)&lt;br/&gt;Sixty-six Race Situation cards&lt;br/&gt;Sixty-four Pit Signal cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
