			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the best ways to create a world that feels like it's alive and real is to sow it with stories and rumours of strange places and mysterious goings-on. Every town the players visit brings them new tales of weird and wonderful things; every city has its urban legends, its wandering ghosts that a friend-of-a-friend saw once upon a time, its crocodiles in the sewers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange Tidings allows you to generate over 20,000 rumours that your players might overhear on their travels. Each has the potential to lead to adventure, danger,and riches beyond sight; similarly, they might be nothing but stories, with only the slightest nugget of truth to them. However you choose to utilise them, filling your world with rumours and stories will make your games come to life, and make your world start to feel like a living, breathing thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange Tidings has now been updated to include a one page city adventure based on an idea generated with the tables in the main product!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
