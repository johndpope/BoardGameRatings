			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Realms, Four Evils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War horns wail and perilous realms cry out for heroes! Four settings, each detailed and mapped, ideal for novices launching their first campaign, or veteran GMs looking to challenge their players with terrible foes and foreign lands...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Wildland:The fall of the Bright Empire left warring factions in its wake. As savage barbarians and wicked humanoids roam the land, the last bastions of civilization cower behind their crumbling city walls. A dark age has come, and none may live to tell the tale.&lt;br/&gt;    * Southland: On the frontiers of the Great Kingdom, the nations of men, elves and dwarves join together against the wicked elves of Nighportal Keep and the Orcs of the Bloody Fist. A realm is yours for the taking, if you can carve it from the wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;    * Borderland: Two factions clash over war-torn fields, battling for dominance in a civil war that that has torn a once-mighty empire in two. When brother strives against brother, and blood runs in the streets, who will emerge to unify the broken land&amp;mdash;and at what cost, peace?&lt;br/&gt;    * The Swamps of Acheron: In the Outer Planes, amid fetid swamplands and ice-choked mountains, the fell god Sarrath holds court. In a realm where gods stalk the earth, will you dare to take a stand, or will you succumb to evil's siren song and take up the Serpent Banner?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tide of evil must be turned back, and heroes are few. Do your characters have the courage to rise against the coming darkness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
