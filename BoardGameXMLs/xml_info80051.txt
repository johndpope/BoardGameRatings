			<description>A windows version of Can't Stop, written by James Cobb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Boardgamegeek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Sid Sackson classic, there is a board with all the possible results of two six-sided dice: two through twelve. The object of the game is to move a little marker to the top of three columns by rolling that result, but you need many more sevens than you need twelves, based on the likelihood of each result. During your turn, you roll the dice and place temporary markers onto the board. You can continue moving these markers until either none of your dice match (your turn is over and all progress you've made is gone), or cut your losses and end your turn (placing a permanent marker in your rows). Nice light filler for opening or closing a session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
