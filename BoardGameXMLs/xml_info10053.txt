							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triple Up</name>
									
			<description>Triple Up is played with a mechanical contraption.  The device has a 4x4 grid at the top.  A metal rod goes through each column and a spring is mounted at the bottom of each rod.  A red ball rests upon each spring, and on each red ball is a 4-ball sequence, alternating in whites and blacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns to pull down a red ball and release it, launching the balls above into the grid, where some of the black-white balls remain, depending on the force used.  The goal is form a straight line (horizontal or diagonal) of 3 balls of a player's color.  The game ends when a player is able to do so, making him or her the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
