							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Moving Picture Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple but colorful game designed by Howard R. Garis (creator of Uncle Wiggily). The box cover has an illustration of people lining up at a movie theatre box office, which shows the day's feature as a Charlie Chaplin movie. The playing board is laminated to the bottom of the box, and is set up like a theatre, with 11 rows of seats and a centre aisle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are pasted on the inside of the lid, and describe a spin-and-move effort to weave through the seats all the way to the stage. The winner gets to shake hands with the hero and heroine of the movie, who have appeared that night in person. The 131-space track includes 13 seats with hazards such as &amp;quot;You sat in gum, lose 1 turn&amp;quot; and six seats with bonuses such as &amp;quot;Somebody eats peanuts, go to 48&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
