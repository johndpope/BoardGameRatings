							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Foxhole 2: Poland</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Jon Compton's tactical hex and counter game of WWII combat. This set focuses on Germany versus Poland at the start of the war.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex on the map represents an area approximately 100 yards across. Each playing piece represents about 40-60 men (a platoon) or half a dozen vehicles or towed weapons . . . For ease of play, the game scales are approximated. Time is also abstracted, thus turns represent several minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FOXHOLE system is simple to learn and fast playing that focuses on the invasion of Poland. Its a good diversion from the more heavy fair of historical board-wargaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOXHOLE SET 2 includes:&lt;br/&gt;-Ten new scenarios, six exclusively with this set, and four incorporating elements from Set 1.&lt;br/&gt;-Twenty-four unit cards&lt;br/&gt;-Over one hundred playing pieces -Tactical Battles Map A - and One rule book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
