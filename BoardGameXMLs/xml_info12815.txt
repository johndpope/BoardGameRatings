							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TSG I: Pro Football</name>
									
			<description>TSG I is one of two football Tabletop Sports Games produced by Gamecraft in the 1970s. It contains cards based on player stats for all teams in the 1975-76 NFL season -- the last season prior to league expansion from 26 to 28 teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the cards, this game contains its Great Teams of the Past printed on bond paper: '70 Colts, '71 Cowboys, '72 Dolphins, '72 Redskins, '74 Bills, '74 Steelers, '74 Vikings and '74 Raiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with other Gamecraft games of that period, this game was sent inside a generic mailing box that doubled as the game box. Dice were not included in order to ensure that the game could be mailed out within USPS &amp;quot;Book Rate&amp;quot; limitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
