			<description>In this FREE print &amp;amp; play, you can live the dream of being a Flip the Table panelist and play cheesy, weird, and obscure board games in your quest to be the first to score 10,000 POINTS! On your turn, you might buy cheesy games at Flip's Thrift shop! Or risk all your hard-earned quarters at The Professor's Lazer Arcade! Or possibly go to Jared's Wrestling Academy and fight for the world title! Or even use Chris's Editing Bay to manipulate time and space! Play the games and get the points, but until you sell them when you pass go, the points might be taken from you!  And as always, beware of Soviet Russia...because in Soviet Russia, TABLE FLIPS YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And did we mention it's a roll-and-move game? SURPRISE!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
