			<description>designer summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worra Realms is a revolutionary 2-6 player tabletop RPG that does away with character sheets and huge guide books. Players set off on exciting quests, delving into forests, caves and dungeons in search of danger, treasure and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game sessions can be setup in only a few minutes and last from 1-3 hours on average. Worra can be played with or without minis and is as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. It's a perfect game for new players and seasoned GM's alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Worra Realms site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first RPG with no rule book, Worra Realms is played entirely with cards that represent all aspects of the fantasy world where players live out their exciting adventures. This Game Master Kit includes Chessex polyhedral dice, 1 introductory adventure and over 200 cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
