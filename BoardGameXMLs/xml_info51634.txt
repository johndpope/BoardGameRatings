							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Friend in Need</name>
									
			<description>An entry for the Black Industries Scenario of the Year contest.  The scenario was published on the Black Industries website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Friend in Need can be set in any village or small town in the Empire. It is a short adventure, which can be played in a single session and is suitable for characters on their first or second careers. It includes some rules from Realms of Sorcery, The Old World Armoury and Sigmar&amp;rsquo;s Heirs, but the adventure can be played without any of the above books. The adventure revolves around the disappearance of the local apothecary, Jennel Zaubermann. She was last seen in her home, and no one saw her leave. Her house would appear to be abandoned, the doors locked and the shutters closed, but some of the villagers have heard noises from inside and seen lights moving about at night. They approach the PCs and ask them to enter the house and find out what happened to Jennel. Of course, the PCs might wonder why the villagers seem so reluctant to enter the building themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
