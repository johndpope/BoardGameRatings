			<description>Each player has four pieces (cups) with a ball (marble) in one of the pieces. Each player's pieces start in the row nearest to the player. Players maneuver their four pieces diagonally toward the other side of the board, backtracking when necessary, and passing the marble from one piece to another until one of their pieces with their marble reaches the opponent's starting row, winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
