			<description>The players are merchants and travel the game board to establish branches by moving through or to the red marked cities. Movement is determined by a die, but only the odd numbers count! When a player moves through the branch of another player, he takes posession of this branch. But the other player may take any one of the first players branches for compensation. When all branches are set, the players return to their sparting space.&lt;br/&gt;Winning Points are awarded for singele branches, 3 branches in an area, 2 or more nighboring areas with 3 branches und the order of return to the starting space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
