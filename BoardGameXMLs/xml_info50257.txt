			<description>In the Trenches: The Lost Generation is the second game of the In the Trenches series. Designed by John Gorkowski, this series enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulsed-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspire historically accurate play without forcing decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Trenches: The Lost Generation includes nine operations. &amp;quot;Probe into the Bois des Caures&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Coup de Grace&amp;quot; take place during the Battle of Verdun, while &amp;quot;Bangers and Mash&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Storming La Boiselle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;French Canadians at Regina&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Second Shot at Regina&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;From Delville to Flers with the Heavy Section&amp;quot; cover various episodes of the Battle of the Somme. Finally, &amp;quot;Polish Hill&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Counterattack at Polish Hill&amp;quot; is set during the Brusilov Offensive on the Eastern Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in In the Trenches: The Lost Generation are four 12&amp;quot; x 18&amp;quot; maps, 384 counters, one rulebook, guides for all nine operations, one referenced card, and two D6s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(source: Grenier Games website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
