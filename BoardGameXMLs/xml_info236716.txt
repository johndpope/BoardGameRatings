			<description>A Three-Part Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first round, the PCs embarked on a quest to locate and retrieve one of the above mentioned blades.  In the second round, the PCs journeyed through another dimension in search of the Mistress of Dreams, only to be thwarted by Ralishaz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our third installment in the Thief of Dreams Trilogy begins with the players waking from their first restful sleep in ages, only to once again find themselves thrust immediately into the service of a deity.  This time Boccob becomes directly involved with the players, but only as much as he must.  Since he finds direct involvement to be highly distasteful he communicates to the PCs through a third party, his high priest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
