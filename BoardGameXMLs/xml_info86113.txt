							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Band of Bugs</name>
									
			<description>The game is focused on turn-based tactical battles between groups of anthropomorphic bugs, with each player controlling a number of individual bugs. The game includes a variety of different bug types (as units), each serving in a different combat role (e.g., heavy infantry, archer, support, etc). As the title is intended to appeal to casual gamers (among others), turns are relatively quick and combats are small in scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to many turn-based games where either an entire side moves at once or individuals move according to some initiative value, units in Band of Bugs take turns. When sides have an equal number of units, each side moves a single unit at a time before ceding control to the other side. When one side has more units than the other, that side takes a proportionally greater number of moves at a time, e.g. two moves to every one of the opposition when one side has twice as many units as the other. The same unit may not be moved more than once per full turn, with a full turn ending after all units have acted. This system helps ensure that players do not spend an excessive amount of time waiting for their opponents to act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units vary in their statistics and capabilities, with most units having at least one special ability which can be used instead of a standard attack. Some bug types have multiple weapons or attack types (e.g., one ranged and one m&amp;ecirc;l&amp;eacute;e weapon) which can be switched between at the cost of an action. Lastly, some bugs can make use of magic, with various spells which can be cast a limited number of times per battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there are a limited number of items which can be picked up and used at a later point in time, Band of Bugs features no significant resource management elements above and beyond troop management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Band of Bugs&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
