			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thola is an agricultural community along a rail line on the planet Sirai. Six families live there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North District, where Thola is situated, was one of the final battlefields in the war that brought the CDU to power. That was a decade ago, and the district is still essentially occupied territory. There is an active insurgency. There are brutal countermeasures. It is the poor villagers in between who suffer the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you play the head of one of Thola&amp;rsquo;s households. You&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself caught in a war you want no part of. Your choices will impact not just yourself, but your family and community as well. What will you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A freeform tabletop roleplaying game scenario for 3-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
