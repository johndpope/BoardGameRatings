							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Concrete Angels</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Concrete Angels is a roleplaying game set in the grimy, gritty world of crime fiction (especially those found within Andrew Vachss' &amp;quot;Burke&amp;quot; series of novels and Frank Miller's Sin City). The City is a dark and dirty place where crime runs rampant. Hookers and junkies lurk in the alleys like rats, the Mob runs City Hall and the cops are either corrupt or burned-out. The characters are con men, pushers, thieves, call girls and hustlers. But being on the wrong side of the law doesn't make you a bad guy. It just makes you more careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Word on the Street:&lt;br/&gt;Concrete Angels first appeared as a free game called Sex &amp; Violence. I rewrote most of it to incorporate the mechanics of Matt Snyder&amp;rsquo;s game DUST DEVILS. The inspiration for that Sex &amp; Violence (and this one) is Frank Miller&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Sin City&amp;rdquo; and Andrew Vachss&amp;rsquo; Burke series of novels (as well as his other books and stories). Neo-noir and crime fiction may be popular genres but Miller and Vachss are two of its masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
