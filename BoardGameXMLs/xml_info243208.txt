			<description>A 'snap' style card game with a pizza flavour! A variant on the classic card game snap published by the early learning centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes their turn drawing a card from the top of there deck. When two matching cards are played, the player who shouts 'double topping' and slaps the pile collects the cards, when two matching cards are played separated by a single different card the player who slaps the pile and shouts 'pizza' takes the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also contains 6 'take away' card, by shouting 'take away' as soon as this card is played a player gets to collect the cards. It also contains 7 'pizza eater' cards - the player who turns over one of these cards becomes the pizza eater and can take all the cards in the centre pile unless they can be stopped, the next player takes three turns in succession - if they manage to get a 'double topping', 'pizza' or 'take away' the normal rules to claim the pile come back into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who takes all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
