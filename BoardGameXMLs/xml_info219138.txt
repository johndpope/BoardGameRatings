			<description>For hundreds of millions of citizens of the Sino-Soviet Union, Iosef Stalin is the Supreme Leader, whose wisdom will guide them to victory. For the enemies of the SSU, the name means death. Many of the SSU&amp;rsquo;s early heavy tanks were named after Kliment Voroshilov, the Defence Commissar. When it was time for a new and improved series, who better to name it after than the Supreme Leader himself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iosef Stalin super-heavy tank is armed with an efficient combination of weapons, each of which has been proven on other tanks. Its main weapon is a 183mm (7.2&amp;rdquo;) D-47T gun. Although not designed to destroy vehicles, the mass of this weapon&amp;rsquo;s round can knock out any tank, no matter how heavy. Its powerful explosive shell is overkill against infantry, but is death to bunkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The secondary weapon is an ATO-45B flamethrower mounted alongside the main gun. It is ideal for destroying infantry in buildings and strongpoints. That&amp;rsquo;s if there are still some in range when the Iosef Stalin gets there. Usually there&amp;rsquo;s only wreckage left, or the enemy has fled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
