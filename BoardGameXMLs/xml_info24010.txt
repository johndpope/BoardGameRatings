			<description>Overview and objectives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players try to get at least 9 art pieces from different museums in Barcelona, in order to build their own art collection, placing it in their own &amp;quot;shelves&amp;quot;. To achieve that, the players must drop pieces they don't want while trying to obtain the ones needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    54 tokens (square cardboard cards) representing 54 art pieces from different museums of Barcelona and surroundings. Each token is identified by a number, a color and a category. There are 4 colors and 4 categories.&lt;br/&gt;    2 tokens representing a thief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle all tokens. Each player draws 3 tokens from the pile with all tokens shuffled and keeps them in his hand. Then, as many tokens as players in the game are picked from the pile and put in front of them in the &amp;quot;showroom&amp;quot;. The players use one of their tokens for bidding for the showroom tokens: the one with the highest number chooses first which piece of the &amp;quot;showroom&amp;quot; he gets. The tokens used for betting are discarded. At this moment each player can add one of the tokens in his hand to his own collection &amp;quot;shelf&amp;quot;. Finally each player draws new tokens from the pile to have 3 again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The critical point is that the shelf can only be filled following a certain pattern: each token must be of the same color or the same category as the previous one, and to completely fill in the &amp;quot;shelf&amp;quot; the player must have, at least, one token of each color and one token of each category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete his collection of 9 pieces is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
