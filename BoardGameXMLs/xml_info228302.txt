							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cow Clicker The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players based on the Cow Click social network game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share two common decks: The Basic Cow Deck and The Premium Cow Deck. Each cow is worth a certain amount of mooney as listed on its card. Mooney levels are low in the basic deck and higher in the premium deck. Optional event cards can be added to the basic deck which take effect as soon as they are revealed and then immediately discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, 7 starting cards are separated from the premium deck and laid out face-up in &amp;ldquo;the stockyard&amp;rdquo; - the middle of the playing area. &lt;br/&gt;The basic and premium cards are shuffled separately into two decks. &lt;br/&gt;When shuffling the premium deck, 10 cards including the Cowmageddon card are shuffled separately and set to one side. This is known as the Cowntdown deck and comes into play towards the end of the game when the remainder of the premium deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws 3 cards from the basic cow deck and puts them in their &amp;ldquo;pasture&amp;rdquo; (the area directly in front of them)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising five phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Sale Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard a basic cow. The most basic cows you can have in your pasture is 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Buy Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If you have 4 or less basic cows in your pasture, you may draw the top card of the basic deck and add it to your pasture. You may only add 1 basic cow to your pasture this way per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Upgrade Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard 2 or more cows (basic and/or premium) to gain a premium cow, from the stockyard, with a mooney value exactly equal to the total mooney value of the cows you discarded. For Example: There is a 17 Mooney cow available as one of the 7 stockyard cows.  You have in your pasture a 5 mooney cow, a 2 mooney cow, and a 10 mooney cow. (5 + 2 + 10 = 17). You discard them to get the 17 mooney cow and put it in your pasture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Stockyard Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If there are less than 7 stockyard cows available, flip over the top cards of the Premium deck until there are 7. If one of these is the Cowmageddon card the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.  Out to Pasture Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Take the highest Mooney cow from the Stockyard and place it on the bottom of the Premium deck. If you are into the Cowntdown deck, skip this phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may trade (or Gift) Cows at any time. Trades (but not gifts) must be acceptable to both parties. The most basic cows you can have in your pasture is 5 and you cannot gift or trade someone basic cows if it would cause them to exceed their limit. You can have any number of premium cows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game ends when the Cowmageddon Card is revealed. Your score is equal to the total Mooney value of all your cows divided by the number of cows in your pasture. (get the calculators...)&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
