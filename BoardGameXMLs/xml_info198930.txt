It seems like they are spinning correctly. Wait why is one spinning the wrong direction?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Sudden shaking and then the walkway falls]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Augggh!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Warehouse Inspector&amp;rsquo;s last utterance before being engulfed by chemicals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandoned Chemical Warehouse is a pay what you want product of an interior map of a small abandoned chemical warehouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandoned Chemical Warehouse is intended for modern, horror, supers, and post-apocalyptic games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changing States: A chemical inspector clambered up a ladder. He stood on a walkway above the chemical vats inspecting the mixing machines that were spinning the chemicals in the vats. Two of the vats were designed to spin counterclockwise and one clockwise. The inspector&amp;rsquo;s eyes grew wide in apprehension as he saw the clockwise vat spin the wrong direction. Suddenly, an earthquake shook the chemical warehouse and the walkway he was standing on gave way. He screamed in horror as he tumbled into the vat with the walkway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemicals in the vat seeped into his body. First he was changed from a solid state into a pure liquid one as he was liquefied in the vat. Then then vat bubbled over and when it popped, he evaporated into a cloud of chemicals as a gas state. It was an odd feeling of transmogrification as he felt like he was looking at the process as a casual outside observer rather than as a part of it. He watched as his new body expanded and the chemicals in his new form washed over the employees in the facility, asphyxiating them and burning their skin horribly. Tanks ruptured and chemical drums burst spilling their contents on the floor. There was also the blood that spilled out of the dying as their skin finally peeled away. The windows became stained a permanent green color as he touched them. The chemical inspector couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel anymore, he was nothing but a cloud of ever expanding death just waiting to be released again to diffuse throughout the atmosphere if the chemical warehouse were to be opened up after the horrific accident.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
