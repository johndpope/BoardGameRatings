							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Underdelve Menace</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remote village of Yonderdell has harbored dozens of adventuring parties over the years, each passing through on their way the nearby entrance to the Underdelve--the endless complex of lightless subterranean passages. Now Yonderdell is plagued by a ruthless nocturnal stalker. Several of the townspeople have disappeared; one was found horribly murdered. Locals suspect a creature from the Underdelve, but the guards posted at the entrance have seen no sign of creatures from the night below emerging onto the surface. This simple village needs brave heroes to unravel the clues and stop the terror before more lives are lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Underdelve Menace&amp;quot; is an investigative adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that can be set in any remote forested hills. Presented for PCs of 7th or 8th level, this adventure also includes notes and statistics for scaling challenges to PCs of higher or lower level. The adventure contains several player handouts and a file containing 1 inch scale color maps of the encounter areas ready for printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
