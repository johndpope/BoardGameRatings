							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Club: DJ Set</name>
									
			<description>It's a Saturday Night in The Club and lonely hearts are still looking for love. This time the heart riot under the strobe lights can truly take place as The Club has hired the best DJ in town to help people get into the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; mood. Will the DJ's tracklist help you become the clairvoyant cupid who can join the right souls in order to keep The Club as the hottest place in town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DJ Set extends the basic The Club game, but it also comes with King &amp;amp; Queen of Clubs which is its own game using the same components as The Club. For the base game, there's also new stickers for tiles to ease the point scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
