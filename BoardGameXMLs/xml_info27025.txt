							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Joseph And His Coat Of Many Colors</name>
									
			<description>Joseph And His Coat Of Many Colors is a variation on the popular game of UNO with uniquely illustrated cards depicting the biblical character of Joseph wearing his colored coats.  Players are trying to empty their hands of cards by playing them to a common pile, matching cards by color, number, or action.  The deck is made up of 4 sets of differently colored cards with numbers from 1 to 6.  There are also Miracle cards (wild cards), cards that cause the next player to pick up 1 or 2 cards, and Skip cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This game is different from UNO in the following ways:&lt;br/&gt;- Instead of &amp;quot;Draw 4 wild cards&amp;quot;, this game contains some &amp;quot;Draw 1&amp;quot; cards.  This is in addition to the &amp;quot;Draw 2 cards&amp;quot; both games have.&lt;br/&gt;- This game has only a 35-card deck.&lt;br/&gt;- When a person has only one card left in their hand, they are to call out &amp;quot;Joseph&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
