							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">M12 Rules System: The Truth Is Out There</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the M12 Rules System, characters have four Psychological Characteristics (Attributes) and four Physical Characteristics - the two groups each have Strength, Resistance, Manipulation, and Agility.  Characteristics have a Dice Score of 2-6 (the rules support either pool purchase or randomization or array distribution).  Characters have other traits defined such as State of Mind, Field of Expertise (very roughly analogous to a Class), and Skills.  Skills have a Base Value which is a negative number that must be overcome before the character is considered &amp;quot;skilled&amp;quot;.  Skills are purchased from a large point pool resulting in highly skilled characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The M12 Rules System utilizes dice pools of D12 against a target number of successes.  The dice pool size is determined by the relevant Characteristic's Dice Score.  This is modified by the character's Skill rating (if appropriate) to find a resolution number which is compared against a Difficult Level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Truth Is Out There is a specific genre and setting for the M12 Rules System (apparently, the only one ever created).  It adapts the X-Files television series to table-top role-playing.  Characters are &amp;quot;Agents&amp;quot;, investigating paranormal phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
