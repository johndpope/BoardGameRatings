							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sudden Death: Ninja Attack</name>
									
			<description>A game for 2 players, simulating two ninjas dueling to the death in a bamboo forest.  Players use attack cards, action cards and withdrawal cards as they fight and withdraw until there is only one ninja left standing... or none.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 25 unique cards. Attacks are played in a rock-paper-scissors fashion, with Melee attacks countering Ranged, Ranged attacks countering Traps, and Traps countering Melee attacks.  Attacks continue until either one player cannot counter (they die) or an appropriate withdraw card has been played.  Play continues until at least one player is dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
