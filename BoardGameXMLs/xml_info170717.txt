			<description>Similar to past games, gameplay is divided into two components being Adventure Mode and Combat Mode. Adventure Mode allows players to explore different areas and play spots across the city including mini-games. The cities will also be significantly bigger than previous games, providing more areas to explore in the game and is said to feature the greatest volume of play spots across cities in the series' history. The change between the game's Adventure Mode and Combat Mode is also said to be more seamless then previous games, which involved a transitional change when encountering enemies whilst in adventure mode. Controls for the game have also been said to have been improved &amp;quot;dramatically&amp;quot; as with the tempo of the game's combat mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Yakuza 5&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
