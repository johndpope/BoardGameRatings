			<description>The City of Gears holds many secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the more persistent rumors is that a band of outcast engineers lives deep within the rusted bowels of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one knows if these mysterious souls exist to help or cause injury...or if they are nothing more than SHADOWS IN THE STEAM...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CITY OF GEARS expansion pack adds a thrilling new card mechanic to the gameplay. The expansion comes with 35 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, when a a player rolls the Production Dice at the start of his turn and end up with blank results, he may draw one &amp;quot;Shadows in the Steam&amp;quot; card. This cards have different effects that might benefit the player or hinder his opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may hold up to three cards in his hand and only one card can be drawn at a time, regardless of how many blank faces the player has rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
