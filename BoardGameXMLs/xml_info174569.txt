							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The One Gun Saloon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As mentioned in the description for Rodney's Cocktail Lounge, there is one universal truth about any gaming campaign &amp;ndash; they all need a bar fight.  This map takes it one step further though.  Inspired by the saloons of the old west, this establishment is not only a place to grab a drink, but it also acts as an inn AND a house of ill repute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The left side of the inn contains the rooms for rent, while the center of the map contains the bar and the dance area where the &amp;quot;entertainment&amp;quot; come out to perform for would be customers.  The right side of the map contains rooms where said &amp;quot;entertainment&amp;quot; live (as well as work when the situation arises), and a room with baths in it for the desperate wasteland survivor that just can't take one more moment of his or her own stench.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good for barroom brawls, this map also has plenty of places to find cover behind in case things go from fists to firearms too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    30&amp;quot; x 30&amp;quot; in size.  Perfect size for almost any gaming table.&lt;br/&gt;    Square, Hex, and No Grid versions.&lt;br/&gt;    Full Color Versions &amp;ndash; This is a printer intensive, full color version of this map.&lt;br/&gt;    Black and White version &amp;ndash; A black and white version, meant to be the least printer intensive.&lt;br/&gt;    Daytime lighting complete with shadows to give the map depth.&lt;br/&gt;    VTT Map - Includes a VTT version of the map for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
