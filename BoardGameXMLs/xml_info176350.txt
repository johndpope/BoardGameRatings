							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Spire (Issue 0 - Spring 2015)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Spire online magazine, which we hope will be your premier adventures periodical for the 5th edition of the world's most popular role-playing game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are just a few of the reasons we'd like you to give The Spire your time and attention:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A regular dose of 5th edition adventures! Currently, there is a dearth of adventures for 5E. While previous editions were supported by printed magazines, those days are over, leaving a void that many gamers feel. Although we're unable to resurrect dead magazines, we can offer something new that fills a similar niche. The adventures that fill the pages of The Spire will form campaigns that will unfold over time, though each adventure will also be designed to stand alone just as well, with little or no modification.&lt;br/&gt;     At the helm, we have veteran game designer, Darrin Drader, co-author of the 3.5 Book of Exalted Deeds, Forgotten Realms: Serpent Kingdoms,Forgotten Realms: Mysteries of the Moonsea, D20 Apocalypse, and many, many other titles for numerous RPG publishers. He brings with him fifteen years of professional game design experience, both in the tabletop RPG and MMO industries.&lt;br/&gt;     The Spire is also produced by Robert Blezard, and Patric L. Rogers, both of whom have produced thousands of pages of high quality RPG material, much of it freely available over the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
