			<description>*  The letter-acting pair spin the spinner to select a phrase category, and select a card from either the pre-1990s or post-1990s card set.&lt;br/&gt;    * The two letter actors move their bodies together to shape each letter individually to spell out the entire phrase.&lt;br/&gt;    * All other players secretly guess each letter being acted, and write the letters on their word sheets.&lt;br/&gt;    * When the first player in the audience correctly guesses the entire phrase being spelled, he or she yells it out.&lt;br/&gt;    * The first player to guess the phrase correctly wins a point; the two letter-acting players win points.&lt;br/&gt;    * Bonus points are earned for being the first player to yell out the bonus answer on the back of the card:&lt;br/&gt;          o the name of the actor who played the famous character&lt;br/&gt;          o the name of the character who said the famous quote&lt;br/&gt;          o the artist of the song title&lt;br/&gt;          o the title of the song the song lyric is from&lt;br/&gt;    * The first player to score 10 points wins .&lt;br/&gt;    * The Trivia Question category has a little twist - the letter-acting players must spell out the answer to the trivia question without discussing what the answer is! There is no bonus point for the Trivia Question category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
