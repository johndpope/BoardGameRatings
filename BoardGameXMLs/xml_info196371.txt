							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The End</name>
									
			<description>The End is a game of self-discovery for teens which integrates strategy, puzzles and philosophical questions into a world which explores death, philosophy and science. The game takes the player on a metaphysical journey, recording their interactions in the world to reveal their attitudes towards mortality. These views are presented alongside their friends and some of the most important thinkers of our time, such as Gandhi, Descartes and Einstein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set across three worlds &amp;ndash; Mind, Body and Spirit &amp;ndash; the player must use a unique shadow &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; light mechanic to solve physics-based puzzles, answer questions and battle the world&amp;rsquo;s Guardians. The ultimate prizes are the Death Objects, ranging from a memorial diamond to a human heart, which deepen a player&amp;rsquo;s contextual knowledge of death and help them progress through the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
