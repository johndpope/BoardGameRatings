			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OtherWarp is a tabletop roleplaying game set in our world gone wrong... maybe. Because a lot of the way time and cause and effect and other fundamental rules of the universe seem to have changed, nobody (at least no humans that we know of) is entirely sure about that. Players take on the roles of ordinary human beings - at least ordinary for this new world - that have joined together in one of the small groups of humans that have come to be known as &amp;ldquo;Searchers&amp;rdquo; - people looking for the truth. What truth exactly they&amp;rsquo;re looking for, and why, and what they might do with that truth if and when they find it is something that varies from group to group and from person to person. Sometimes, people may even join a group specifically to undermine what [the group is] trying to accomplish. Sometimes, everyone who joins a group joins for that reason, not realizing that everyone there is trying to sabotage something that no one in the group is actually trying to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play requires the use of a rather large custom deck of cards.  These are detailed in a separate document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
