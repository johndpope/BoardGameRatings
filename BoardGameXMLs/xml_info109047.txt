			<description>A replay game of grand prix motor cycle racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control all motorcycles in a motor cycle grand prix race. The game includes statistical data for every circuit raced in 1984, and for all classes of motorcycles, like 80, 125, 250, 500c.c. as well as sidecars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you have decided which race to run, you set up all the drivers (represented by cardboard figures). For every racer you turn up a card from a deck of race cards and compare the individual driver's rating with a table printed on each card. The card now tells you if the racers stay in the group of motorcycles they are currently in, if they fall back to the previous group, overtake other drivers within their group, or even catch up with the group in front of them. Mechanical troubles as well as possible accidents are also covered by the results of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a number of draws, depending on the racing course and class of motorcycles chosen, the race is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lets you replay any single race from the 1984 season or even the whole championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
