			<description>The field is laid out on a 30 by 21 grid. Play alternates between the Offense and the Defense. The ball is advanced by passing dribbling and heading. When a defensive man is within specific distances from the ball and attempt can be made to tackle or intercept. The result is determined by throwing a die, but strategic placement of the men can affect the odds. Goal tries are similarly determined by die throws adjusted to the positioning of the goalkeeper and other defensive players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Designer's Notes:&lt;br/&gt;KICK-OFF Soccer has been developed to follow as closely as possible the real game of soccer.  The strategy and tactics are the same, as are most of the rules.  Soccer is not a complicated game.  There are very few set plays, these mainly arise on Corners, Free-Kicks and Throw-Ins.  The game is played through with the skills, flair and innovation of individual players working together as a team.  And so with &amp;quot;KICK-OFF&amp;quot;, by using simple Basic Moves, the flair and innovation has been left up to the individual player.&lt;br/&gt;After playing one or two games of &amp;quot;KICK-OFF&amp;quot;, the method of play becomes easy and only brief reference is necessary to player and ball movement, and die throws.  The die throws do not determine the outcome of the game, they merely simulate the chances played in real soccer.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;KICK-OFF&amp;quot; has been play tested by enthusiastic &amp;quot;youngsters&amp;quot; aged from eleven to adult.  For the young enthusiasts, some adult assistance was found advisable at first, but once advised, they were at home with &amp;quot;KICK-OFF&amp;quot; as they were on the real field!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
