			<description>Favor of Olympus is a deck customization game similar to deck building games. The game differs from others in the genre in that where a player plays his cards is important, there is a larger level of player interaction and that a player can grow or shrink his deck's size easily. Players start with 12 card decks but have the flexibility to lower the deck size to 0 cards or raise it as high as 20 or more cards. Players try to obtain the most victory points to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in mythical Greece, each player takes the role of a city ruler that must try to appease Zeus and his siblings. Each player utilizes followers and recruited heroes, each which have special powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with the same deck of cards. Players choose to play their cards to wage war, recruit allies, sacrifice, go on legendary quests, increase their worship and battle powerful heralds of the gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design incorporates ideas from several games including Dominion, Twilight Struggle and 7 Wonders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
