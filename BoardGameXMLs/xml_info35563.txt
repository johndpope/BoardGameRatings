			<description>Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 Special die&lt;br/&gt;     32 cards to make two boards in 4x4 grid&lt;br/&gt;     instructions&lt;br/&gt;     cloth drawstring bag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made exclusively for Starbucks Coffee stores. Bingo Bunch uses 2 special dice with pictures of cartoon heads and bodies that when rolled match 75 cards depicting the various combinations of the dice.  (25 combinations are possible, with each card repeating 3 times for a total of 75 cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each deal out 16 cards in a 4x4 grid in front of them, and by rolls of the dice try to be the first to get four in a row for a bingo, or turn over all the cards for a blackout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played more simply for younger players using 9 cards in a 3x3 grid, or more difficult using 25 cards in a 5x5 grid (which limits the game to three players based on the number of cards in the deck).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bingo Bunch are the characters when heads and bodies match correctly: Allie Astronaut, Sammy Snorkel, Regina Ballerina, Eugene Unicycle &amp;amp; Glorp, a one-eyed purple alien.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with a small travel pouch, so the game can be easily taken on the go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
