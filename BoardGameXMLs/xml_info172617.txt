							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Psychic Overlords</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghezakai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its peak, the civilization of the Albufandi was a wonder to behold. The adventurers who come from all over the universe to loot the ruins can see that much from them still, even in their disrepair. Of course, the reason they come is to scavenge for pieces of wondrous technology that has not been seen since this society collapsed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the climate changed, the Albufandi were masters of all they surveyed. But when that world disappeared, it was replaced in an instant with ash-choked skies and dirty snow covered lands that had previously never known winter. Perhaps if this change was the only disaster, things could have been saved. But then the Ghezakai came&amp;mdash;what the Albufandi called &amp;ldquo;the death that comes from below the ground.&amp;rdquo; These alien race of insectoid monstrosities had been in hibernation for centuries, locked inside the ground. The change in temperature and air quality awoke them, and the end came for the Albufandi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghezakai now make their lairs within the ruins of the Albufandi cities. They build giant hives that look like hills, swollen bulges in the earth that spill bugs when intruders come near. They have already destroyed one civilization, now they guard the treasures of the dead from scavengers, for they hate all human life, no matter where it comes from. Luckily for explorers, they have little in the way of society beyond the hive. Each Ghezaka overlord rules her own hive, surrounded by her spawn and minions, and it is rare to see two overlords cooperating instead of feuding over territory and resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This slight flaw is the main reason it is possible to raid the Albufandi ruins in the first place, for the Ghezakai are indeed a fearsome pest. As they grow into giant overlords, their psychic abilities grow exponentially, such that they can dominate the minds of lesser creatures, create convincing illusions, and manipulate the emotions of humans&amp;mdash;and they are not the least bit shy of using these powers to destroy intruders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
