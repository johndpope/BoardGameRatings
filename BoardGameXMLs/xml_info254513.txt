							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grimm Masquerade</name>
									
			<description>The Beast has invited you to his castle for a Masquerade. When you enter, you are magically transformed into the identity of another character from The Grimm Forest! The Beast enjoys his antics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be outed if they are given 2 artifacts of their bane, but can win the magical masquerade if they are able to collect 3 artifacts of their favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beast loves to watch the characters try and oust each other. Each player will draw 2 artifacts, keeping one for themselves and giving 1 to any player at the ball. This reveals a lot of information on both players. Why did you keep that artifact? Oh excuse me Snow White, I see you have 2 mirrors does that oust you as the Evil Queen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turning in 2 Artifacts activates special actions as well, timing these well have great benefits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't worry if you are outed early, you take on the role of a Ghost, you get to guess what character you think will win the magical masquerade and if you are correct, you win along with them! You also take a turn handing out Artifacts to characters to try and sway the ball to your favor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 3 Artifacts of Favor or to be the last player remaining will win. All other players will be given a token in their defeat. When someone has 3 tokens, that triggers the end of the masquerade and we see which player was the best!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
