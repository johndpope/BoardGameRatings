			<description>A free single-player print-and-play, this game is less about actual rock-paper-scissors and more about being in a crooked Rock-Paper-Scissors (Roshambo) tournament!  Exploit your opponents' weaknesses while working around your own crippling disadvantages. When that doesn't work, cheat or bribe the officials!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game PDF is available in the files section, or can be downloaded from here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;In this game you generate some simple stats for yourself, then face opponents like &amp;quot;The Copycat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Randomizer&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;The Cheat&amp;quot; in a simulated blind ladder-style elimination.  Which opponents are dangerous and which ones are pushovers will be different every game.  When the going looks too rough, either cheat to give yourself an edge or bribe the officials to change the lineup and hope the opponent you dodged gets eliminated before they match back up with you.  But don't get carried away... you don't have enough money and sneakiness to fix every match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
