			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shox is a Rally Car racing title in the EA Sports BIG franchise. The game features a wide range of cars and courses to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only 1 single player mode &amp;ndash; Championship. This game mode is comprised of 30 different races spread through 5 leagues. In order to progress to the next league, a player needs to rank 1st in their current one. The leagues each have three different terrains that racers must contend with &amp;ndash; snow, sand, and jungle all have a unique effect on a car&amp;rsquo;s maneuverability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shox shakes up the races with the inclusion of Shox zones. These zones, three of which are present in each race, are timed segments that will give gold, silver, or bronze ranking depending on how fast a player completes them. Higher Shox zone rankings yield larger cash bonuses after a race. Secondly, if a player achieves a gold ranking in all three zones during a race, they will unleash a Shoxwave that, when caught, provides a steady stream of income while it is kept up with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides Championship mode, players can race against their friends in 4-player free-for-alls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
