			<description>From Publisher's Web Site:  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.kenzerco.com/product_info.php?cPath=25_94_99&amp;amp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.kenzerco.com/product_info.php?cPath=25_94_99&amp;amp&lt;/a&gt;;products_id=708&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Though decorated for a festival, the village atmosphere seems ominously muted. Vendors relax in the shade but seem preoccupied with inner thoughts, showing little interest in you or the coins you might spend on their wares. You see no dancing and hear no song, and small groups of people only mutter as you pass, staring back at you with sad, deadened or suspicious eyes. You wonder what recent troubles hang heavy over this place...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Realm of the Elm King is a new HackMaster Basic adventure featuring a variety of challenges designed for four to six 1st to 2nd level player characters (with options for higher level PCs included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as detailed NPCs, monsters, maps and a battlemat, this adventure also includes a variety of hooks to draw PCs in from the village of Vew (White Palette, Ivory Horns), the mountain stronghold of Frandor's Keep or any other desired location. This allows the GameMaster to use In the Realm of the Elm King by itself or as part of an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
