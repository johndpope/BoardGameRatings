			<description>&amp;ldquo;The chariot was an effective weapon during the Bronze Age. In Egypt they favored a light, highly maneuverable chariot from which the rider could fire arrows at the enemy. The Hittites used a heavier chariot designed to drive into the enemy, delivering a heavy blow at close quarters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The two empires came into conflict over the rich lands of Syria, which lay between their respective spheres of influence. Pharaoh Rameses II was the first to arrive at the strategic city of Kadesh. He settled into a fortified camp to await the arrival of the rest of his army. Only he didn't arrive first. King Muwatallish was camped near by, with his entire army. The Hittite king sent a stong force of chariots to attack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame of the Battle of Kadesh (1300 BC) intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures, with foot units mounted two per base and chariots mounted singly. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. There is also a print-and-play shield wall which may be used to represent the boundaries of the Egyptian camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units portrayed in the game include Egyptian Infantry, Archers, and the Sherden Guards of Pharaoh Ramses II, as well as the Hittite and Egyptian Chariots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
