							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Dinosaur Adventure</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;    The Great Dinosaur Adventure* is billed as &amp;quot;an educational game of creation and Bible knowledge&amp;quot;. Player's tokens are multicolored rubber dinosaurs and, by rolling a dice, they are moved around a board decorated with locales from the prediluvian world described in Genesis. While traveling, players can land on spaces marked either &amp;quot;Event&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Take a Card&amp;quot;. When landing on an &amp;quot;Event&amp;quot; space, players take a card containing flavor text that affects their placement on the board (&amp;quot;Stampeding dinosaurs chase you into Babylon. Move your player piece to the Babylon space&amp;quot;). When landing on the &amp;quot;Take a Card&amp;quot; space, players draw a dinosaur card and have to answer trivia questions to acquire it. The first player to collect 6 different cards is able to take the nearest path into the Ark. The fate of the remaining players is not specified but probably grim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
