							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Children of the Harvest (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blight is a dark place. Children disappear all the time, especially those of poor. The Harvester of Cribs, one of the city's strange local gods, is blamed for many of these disappearances. Typically ,  these disappearances arc random, isolated instances, and in many cases, Harvester has nothing to do with it all, merely being a convenient explanation or alibi for some other nefarious activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time, however, 36 children have disappeared from their homes&amp;mdash; all in a single night&amp;mdash;and many of them were not from the houses of the poor.  Not even jaded folk of City-State of Castorhage will stand for this  (especially not a prominent Justice and a guild leader who have each lost a child in this rash of disappearance). Now is the time for a call to action. Now is the time for heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Children of the Harvest is a stand-alone adventure set in The Blight for 4&amp;mdash;6  7th- to 8th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
