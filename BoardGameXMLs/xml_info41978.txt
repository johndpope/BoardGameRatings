			<description>Rum Jong the new game with a 5000 year old tradition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rum Jong is a game derived from its similarities to Gin Rummy and Mah Jongg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rum Jong characters are easier to learn than Mah Jongg characters, and the rules of the game are simpler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with Mah Jongg, the game of Rum Jong has its roots in China and is comprised of 124 carved tiles of different suits and symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles are collected and discarded by players one by one as they try to build sets, much like Gin Rummy, until one of the players acquires a winning hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may join or leave at the beginning or end of any hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rum Jong is a fast and exciting game than can be played between 2 to 6 players and appeals to all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be a family game, a teen game, an adult game, or solitary pastime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a family game to be played by old &amp;amp; young alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
