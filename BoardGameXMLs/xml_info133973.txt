							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fictive Hack &quot;Matt&#039;s Rule&quot; Abridged Version</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fictive Hack is designed to be low-prep, improvisational, reactive, cinematic, and fast-paced. Character advancement is based on the kind of game the players and DM want, and how they reward each other for playing in that style. (The game can be silly and over-the-top, or focused on tactics, or serious with emphasis on character development, etc.) Decide what is awesome, and that decision drives the game. A few interlocked systems (Awesome Point economy, weapons and arenas, armor, inherent abilities and talents) express a wide variety of action. Characters should be able to easily develop to about 20th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition focuses on human-only templates ideally suited for picaresque play, dungeon crawling, investigation, or questing. The material here may be supplemented from the web site for more choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
