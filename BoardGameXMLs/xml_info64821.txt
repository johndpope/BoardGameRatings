			<description>A game of ancient civilizations in conflict over the European continent and surrounding territories. &amp;quot;For 2-4+ players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players choose to play as one of 12 ancient civilizations of the region. Each civilization starts with two traits, such as arts, metallurgy, ship building, religion, etc. Traits provide certain resources or benefits. Traits can be developed and improved during the Research Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each territory on the map is marked with a type of resource. The distribution of the resources is randomly determined each game. Resources are used for various purposes, including supporting your civilization, building cities, and supporting research attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a free, online rules set which describes the components that you will need to create in order to play. Components include an area movement map of Europe, a set of six tokens for each player (Armies, Fleets, Villages, Cities, Monuments, and Resources), a resource chart for each player, a common resource pool card, and six-, eight-, and twelve-sided dice. An area movement map is available for download from the Warp Spawn site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
