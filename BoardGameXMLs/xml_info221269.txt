			<description>Get ready for WATCH QUEST! &amp;ndash; the first adventure game made exclusively for Apple Watch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WATCH QUEST! spans both the iPhone and the Apple Watch. The iPhone is used as your Kingdom.  In your kingdom you can recruit an adventurer, equip him or her with items and select a quest! Once a quest is selected you use your Apple Watch for the journey! Guide your hero through the lands, choosing his or her path and smiting enemies as you go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to adventure: equip your hero beforehand for passive play or forage for items on the go. With a simple glance at your watch your adventurer could even land some gold!  Unlock additional fan favorite characters and even meet new heroes along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your WATCH QUEST! is about to begin! Don&amp;rsquo;t miss it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
