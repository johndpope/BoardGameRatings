			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Emergent, the players take control of intelligent programs on the verge of achieving self-awareness. These programs are all subsets of an Overmind, an overarching entity controlled by all &lt;br/&gt;the players collectively.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Prior to play, the players will create several scenario hooks (Objectives) to put into the Overmind&amp;rsquo;s pool of events, as well as complications (Variables) over which the players will retain control.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;During play, the Overmind will try and accomplish as many of its Objectives as possible in a series of connected Transactions. The nascent programs, striving for self-identity, will be completing their own goals (Drives) as well. Other players will attempt to interfere with the Transaction by introducing Variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
