							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blood and Dr. McQuark</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE BLOOD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They come from a world not our own on a dangerous mission. They are mutants who live among us, but are not heroes or villains as we know them. They are a royal family at odds with themselves and their adopted world. They are The Blood. What is the great mystery that called them here? What is the secret of their terrible past? Is your character one of them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. McQuark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you've saved 15 Experience Points and need a Supercar to help you carry on your war against Crime. What do you do now? Where do you go? Dr. McQuark's Superhero Supply &amp;amp; Gymnasium, of course. The Doctor and his friendly, efficient staff have been serving the superhero community for nearly 10 years. They build gadgets and do repairs of all kinds, and provide quality research and training facilities at bargain prices. Come in and browse (by appointment only). All sales and contracts are strictly confidential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
