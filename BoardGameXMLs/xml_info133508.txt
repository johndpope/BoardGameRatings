			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a grid with numbers in certain squares. You must figure out how many of the squares to fill in around and including the square with the number. For example if a square has a number than it and all eight squares around it must be filled in. If  a square in a corner has a four, then it and the three adjacent squares must be filled in. As the game progresses additional colors are added to make it more difficult and the grids become increasingly large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
