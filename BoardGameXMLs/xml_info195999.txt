On his birthday, the boy had no presents nor sweets. He got so upset he decided to leave home for good. Before he left, his mother gave him his grandfather's cane, some cheese and three pieces of gold. Hans walked into the forest in search of adventure. Soon it was night and the boy was really scared, so he tried to go back. But then, a quaint kobold happened to cross his path and Hans decided to follow him to a castle. The kobold told him he would inherit great wealth if he passed a simple trial... guessing his name. Trapped in the castle, Hans will live a spooky mystery, fantasy and horror adventure to become the new Count Lucanor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Exploration: Walk the Tenebre Castle and place candles on the ground to light up your path.&lt;br/&gt;Conversation: Talk to NPCs to get important clues to uncover the hidden history of the Count Lucanor.&lt;br/&gt;Stealth: Hide under tables and behind curtains to go undetected.&lt;br/&gt;Puzzles: Use the items you found wisely in order to progress.&lt;br/&gt;Skill: Avoid traps and enemies in the castle by anticipating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
