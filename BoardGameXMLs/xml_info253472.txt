			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;An arcade action game where the player runs to the right on a edge-wrap screen, and throws spanners up into the ceiling at stalagtites, trying to crush them before they, as the ceiling gradually falls down, crush him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;The intrepid explorer Orangeman is having a really bad day!  Not only is the roof of the cave he is exploring collapsing but he is being chased by a massive boulder as well!  Luckily he brought a bunch of tools with him which he can hurl at the cave roof to smash the sharp stalactites that are descending towards him.  Can you help Orangeman escape from the caves before he is squished?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Ovine By Design: original design&lt;br/&gt;Stuart Collier: code (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Trevor Storey: graphics (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Richard Bayliss: music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
