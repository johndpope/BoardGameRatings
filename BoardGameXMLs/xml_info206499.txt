			<description>Story:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Lords are at the King's Castle preparing for War. Each Lord has brought Seven Knights, all of whom have, for whatever reason, decided to make some poor decisions the night before the battle. All of these knights have found themselves in one of three places: The Tavern, The Inn, and the Armory. The Lords, having heard of the shenanigans going on throughout the castle, have dispatched messengers to each of their seven knights, instructing them to finish up whatever they are doing, and return to the barracks at once. To make things interesting, the Lords have offered handsome rewards to the knights who return best prepared for the ensuing battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race is on for the Knights to return to their Lord's Barracks, ready for battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novice Knights is a Victory Point game, kind of like Settlers Of Catan. The goal is to gain 17 Victory Points in the 4 player variant, and 19 Victory Points in the 2 player variant.&lt;br/&gt;The game play itself consists of three areas: The Inn, The Tavern, and The Armory, each with its own unique game mechanics and ways to earn Victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tarvern is a simple &amp;quot;Roll the Dice and Advance&amp;quot; board game, kind of like Chutes and Ladders. There are separate symmetrical paths for each player to follow, with danger along the way. For each Knight that successfully navigates his way out of The Tavern, the player earns Victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inn is a basic tile choosing/flipping game, like a simpler version of Carcassonne. Players select tiles without knowing what is in store for them on the other side. Both danger and glory await behind The Inn's tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final section, The Armory, holds the most dangerous and challenging section of the game. This Card-Based section, reminiscent of Munchkin offers the Knights the opportunity to suit up before the battle. The only problem is, several Dragons have made their home in The Armory, and it's dangerous to go alone (Take this!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
