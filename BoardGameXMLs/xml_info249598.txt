			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons have doors. They are used to block entrance to areas and keep them separate. They are quite an important element for splitting dungeons up, but they are often neglected. Often, all doors have a standard description, or sometimes no description, with only important doors being described otherwise. Which makes important doors easy to spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To further dress a dungeon and to make it more difficult for players to realise which doors are truly important, here are 100 different descriptions of doors. Some doors are not, strictly speaking, doors, and others no longer block passage due to damage. If a GM mixes up the descriptions a bit and uses other materials, even more doors can be described. Players will end up finding many doors that appear important, because they are described in detail, but are actually not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These iron barred gates can easily be seen through. The bars are made from 1/2&amp;quot; thick black iron spaced 3&amp;quot; apart. A few small patches of rust mar the gates but otherwise they appear to be well maintained. A large-linked steel chain passes through the gates, holding them shut with a large iron padlock. There is a bit of give in the chain, allowing the gates to move slightly, but they will only open about an inch without the chain being removed. (hardness 10, 60 hp, chain Break DC 20, padlock Disable Device DC 20)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover, one page the front matter, one page the Open Game License and one page is ads for other supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is also available in a system neutral version. The latter is a bit shorter and doesn't have the Pathfinder stats for some items. You do not need to buy both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
