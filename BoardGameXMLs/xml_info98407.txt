			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Chronicle Companion for Werewolf the ForsakenTM in Four Parts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Thirteen chronicle kits, which modify, emphasize and defy your expectations of what Werewolf the Forsaken can be. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Ideas for chronicles set in ancient Sumer, in the trenches of eternal war, and with urban fantasy romance.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Every kit contains tools for players and Storytellers alike, with ideas to integrate them into existing chronicles as well as new ones.With Volume One, we took away from the Forsaken and left them alone against the world. With Volume Two, we give to them new structures to experiment with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've taken, we've given. Now, with Volume Three, we seek to spin Werewolf the Forsaken on its heels, to make it something completely new and change your perceptions of what the game can be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunting Grounds: Ancient Sumer has the Uratha of modern nights in a parallel chronicle with the mighty Ur-Sag, dog-headed heroes of the ancient Sumerian city of Bau. No longer Forsaken, the Uratha take places as god-kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oath of the Moon explicitly forbids mating between the Uratha. Such deviance has terrible results. What if we remove that, and instead focus on interpersonal, romantic and otherwise sexual relationships with werewolves? We have Everything You Ever Wanted, focusing on a more urban fantasy take on the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packs United assumes a higher structure amongst the Forsaken. There's a hierarchy beyond a local pack, and grand Conclaves of Forsaken rule over the race. Experience a new level of blood and politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
