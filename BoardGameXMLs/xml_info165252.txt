							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Narrows</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a defiled shrine at the Moonshield Narrows there&amp;rsquo;s a plot brewing. If it succeeds, demonic hordes will be home free, free to stream in and rule the world. The party is doing maximum counterplotting, but they need help. Screw up your courage in #66 and pit yourself against alchemist Amish and his dangerous concoctions. He&amp;rsquo;s a charlatan and only in it for the excitement, but don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled. He&amp;rsquo;s dangerous. And beware Mogtail and Bestrian, dangerous women in love with dark powers. Maybe worst of all? You&amp;rsquo;ll face spider goblins. Opposable thumbs give you an edge, you say? Try facing goblins with six of them! You might be thinking the world you live in is dark, but now get acquainted with dark.  #66 is dark- the Moonshield Narrows seeded and warded with Merosakkan Stones. Nothing pretty here. This is about slamming the gates of hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
