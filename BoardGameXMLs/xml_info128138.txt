							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiger Tom</name>
									
			<description>The game has markers for each player and a spinner with the values 1-6. From the game board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions for the game on &amp;quot;Tiger Tom&amp;quot; No 4660&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiger tom is lost. Who will find him? Each player chooses the side he wishes to play on, and the one who spins the highest number starts the game. The spaces between the cross marks count one. The player has to follow the black line until he reaches the center where he will find Tiger Tom. The one who arrives there first finds Tiger Tom and wins the game. If a player lands on No. 1 by exact spin, he must go back and start again. If a player lands on any of the black spots by exact spin, he must go back five spaces. If he lands on a red spot, by exact spin, he may advance three spaces. A player may pass another but if he lands on the same space, he must go back to where he started and lose one turn. If four wish to play, two start from each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
