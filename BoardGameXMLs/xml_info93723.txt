							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The God of the Dell</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware the whisperings in the dark. When you feel the shiver up your spine as you step onto the dusty road, for the sake of your life and your sanity, listen to it. For at the end of that road is the Dell, and that which lies at the center of it is hungry . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The God of the Dell is a fearful glimpse into the warped hamlet of Greengages-in-the-Leigh, a once peaceful community that has somehow escaped the predations of the Shadow. What could possibly keep the minions of the dark lord at bay but something that is darker than they? This setting material is appropriate for GMs who want to run a mystery or horror-style one-off adventure, whether for Midnight or another campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
