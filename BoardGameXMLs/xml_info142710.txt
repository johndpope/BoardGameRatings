							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Featured Creatures: Golems</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a well known and popular fact that most monsters tend to really only have one schtick. That essentially makes an entire bestiary a source of a couple hundred schticks, despite the massive pricetag attached to it. Featured Creatures takes a different approach. Imagine, if you will, some simple statblocks with equally simple rules for the addition of a bunch of newfangled abilities. Say we start with a dinosaur. One breathes fire. One provokes fear. One has these nasty little pus sacs that randomly burst with a chewy baby dinosaur center from time to time. The point is this one creature is fulfilling multiple things without the need for a new entry. The idea is modular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Featured Creatures: Golems  introduces the Filigree Golem. Built to also fulfill the role of decorative item, the filigree golem presents a stealthy, modular chassis that can range anywhere from CR 2 to CR 11, depending on which special abilities you slap onto it. For ease of use, the statblocks for this creature from CR 2 to CR 6 are included, and simple rules are presented for further advancement all the way to CR 11. Presented as sidebars are four variants on classic golem types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Filigree golem with 10 modules&lt;br/&gt;     2 clay golem variants (The Divisible Clay Golem and the Unbaked Clay Golem)&lt;br/&gt;     2 flesh golem variants (The Acidflesh Golem and the Gasbag Golem)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
