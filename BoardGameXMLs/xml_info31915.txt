			<description>In Angel in the Attic, players take the part of the Willowby family, who must search the house to find the missing pieces of the nativity set on Christmas morning. The children in the family liked to play with the nativity set so the pieces are scattered throughout the house. Players must use logic to correctly discover which piece was the last to be found, which room it was found in, and who found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Christian Family game, which uses a mechanic similar to that of Clue (the cards players try to identify are placed in an envelope under the board), but without the murder theme. There are variations provided in the rules to make it more or less challenging depending on the ages of the children involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a miniature nativity set and distinctive art on the board, box, and player tokens. The game also came with an offer from the publishers to order new custom drawn player tokens of your family based on a photo you mailed in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
