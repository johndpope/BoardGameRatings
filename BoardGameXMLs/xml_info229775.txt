			<description>They is a competitive resource management strategy game where you command a flying saucer and your task is to gather food for your dying planet. Disseminate feeding tubes to terrestrial sites and harvest food from various sources. Upgrade your saucer and improve your food production. Fill up your craft with nutrients and be the first to be awarded the Honor of the Mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your turn consists of moving your player token on the Mothership and taking the corresponding actions.&lt;br/&gt; The Mothership is constructed from 2 concentric circular discs each with 8 sectors each containing multiple action symbols. This means that each spot on the circular track has 2 corresponding actions. The inner disc may also be rotated to change the makeup of the actions for each sector.&lt;br/&gt; Move your player token on the Mothership up to 3 spaces clockwise on the circular action track and take the actions of that space.&lt;br/&gt; The actions include scouting new sites, placing feeder strings onto a site to retrieve Nutrients, and assembling Cargo Tiles from Nutrients and adding the tiles to your saucer to fill up your ship. The requirements for each Cargo Tile is specified at the Foundry Ship, and can be modified during the game. Upgrade your saucer for efficiency, unique abilities, and extra VPs. You can also collect entire sites of different type to get lots of VPs.&lt;br/&gt; Then the turn passes to the player on the left, and this continues until a player fills up their ship with cargo, or one of the other end goals is triggered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
