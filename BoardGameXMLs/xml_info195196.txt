			<description>A Snow From Korea Variation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nihon, the summer is long, and dry, and hot, and all the men are abroad, seeking snow to cool the brows of their wives. But the courts are not silent; the halls are not still. The samurai ladies and the retainers of the daimyos are still about, weaving secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters in Whispers in the Door are samurai ladies whose husbands and lords are abroad; in the absence of the men it falls to the wives to hold together the power of a clan, through deft manipulation of people, even men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is your job as a player to make sure your samurai retains the family's honour and assets, and to gather Secrets, which are the strongest avenue to power in the courts of Nihon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
