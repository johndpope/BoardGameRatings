							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tektolio</name>
									
			<description>Players explore the strange island Villa of Tektolio where you have become stranded. There, you find all sorts of objects such as point-earning items from a special card deck, as well as random other things. Other card decks send you to different parts of the board, or cause gains, losses, or trades of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll encounter some uniquely odd characters and be plunged into some bizarre and possibly life-threatening situations. You have to use the items you find to build &amp;quot;Kontraptions&amp;quot; that will remedy the situations (the more card items you use, the more points you get). The first player to reach 500 points (or any prearranged victory condition that players agree to) wins the game and may leave the island...if the other players allow it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
