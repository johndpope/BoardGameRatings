							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alfred the Great: War in the West Country 876AD</name>
									
			<description>Mark Sheppard extends his coverage of this famous monarch with his game on Alfred&amp;rsquo;s decisive 876 campaign. Not only were the Saxon king and his followers contending with more Viking incursions, but with a rebellion among the native Britons, who sought to take advantage of the King&amp;rsquo;s woes by seeking to carve out their independence amidst the mayhem. Players familiar with the first volume of the series will be able to quickly get into this game. Each copy of Alfred the Great, Volume II is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 11 by 17 inch hex map&lt;br/&gt;Two sheets of 286 single-sided, un-mounted counters&lt;br/&gt;Three cardstock Battle Boards (one Briton, one Saxon, one Viking)&lt;br/&gt;One Players&amp;rsquo; Aid Sheet&lt;br/&gt;8 pages of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
