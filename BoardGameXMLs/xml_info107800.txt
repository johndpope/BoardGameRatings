			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pax Galactum.  There's nothing so peaceful as a dead alien.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where once Rome conquered a world, now you can conquer a universe.  Imagine an expanse of 50 solar systems.  You are master of a planet whose resources can be allocated for construction of warships and transports, planetary defense, armies, industrial complexes and research.  Against up to three players, human or computer, you strive to increase the population of your superior race and amass power through negotiations or war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design your own legion of starships ranging from explorers to battleships that can ravage and entire planet.  They are rated for different weapon systems, defense and evasive capabilities, armor, speed and size.  Your ships must be maintained lest they deteriorate.  Each warship in your fleet can be individually monitored and repaired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you discover an independent world, you can try to convince it to join your empire.  Should diplomacy fail, there is always brute force.  The combat options include: fighting ship-to-ship, either alone or against the planet's defenses, bombing the planet using a &amp;quot;hit-and-run&amp;quot; tactic, or even purging the planet of all life and civilization.  If you choose to conquer instead of annihilate, you must dispatch ships to transport your armies to the planet's surface.  You'll need your troops to not only subjugate the populace, but they must also suppress any subsequent guerrilla resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as Julius Caesar once forged the Roman Empire, you'll now struggle to control the stars and create...the IMPERIUM GALACTUM!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Paul Murray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
