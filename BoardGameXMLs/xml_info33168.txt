			<description>This game has solid wood playing pieces. It's very similar to Jenga. The difference is this game has a question printed on every block. The questions are like those that you ask in &amp;quot;truth or dare&amp;quot;, although all of these are &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; questions. Examples on the box are: describe yourself in three words, what is your biggest pet peeve, and who would play you in a movie of your life?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
