							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Libram Novus #05</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the 5th issue of Libram Novus. Inn this issue, we start off with a large article called Playing with Skill that covers both many types of Crafting and Herbcraft. Additionally, we add a new type of magical item, Herbal Elixirs, that is also created using herbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next up, we introduce the concept of Training Paths. These are goals that players can use to unlock Talents and other benefits. We have given a sample mages Guild, with 4 different levels of Training Paths, and another Training Path, this time for Martial Artists and Monks as examples of how Training Paths could be built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
