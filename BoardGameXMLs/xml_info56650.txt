Add to that the 14-page role playing appendix that contains useful universal record sheets, character and campaign suggestions, and you have a truly useful guide to all things pirate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Handbook was originally produced as a children's teaching tool for the New Jersey Renaissance Kingdom.
