			<description>This game is part of a series (&amp;quot;#4 of a series&amp;quot;)-- see Keeper of the Castle for #1 of the series. The rules on the box are rather difficult to understand, though they are brief. Figuring out what these rules mean would require attempting to play the game without understanding it at all. From the box, but really incomprehensible (grammar and spelling mistakes in the original!):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;2. - Player may take any item to start with but not jump or land on any item from then on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. - When an item lands on 'C' square player draws a card:&lt;br/&gt;  A. If own item place face up in front of player.&lt;br/&gt;  B. If an opponents item, give them the card which they place face up in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;  C. If card from position not being played place face down in discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;  D. If a Missed Payment card take item back to start.&lt;br/&gt;  E. If a Paid off Mortgage card take item to finish position. Home!&lt;br/&gt;  F. If you draw an opponents Open House card give them the card and you get 3 rolls of the die. (3 extra turns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. - The only time an item is safe is when the player has the card face up in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. - The exact number must be rolled to get into the Bank as well as Home and if all items reach finish position before player has all their cards, they draw a card on their turn until they have all five cards. If a Missed Payment card or  Paid off Mortgage card is draw, disregard and place in discard pile. If you draw an opponents card rule 3B applies and if an opponent draws your card Rule 4 applies and the item starts over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. - If all the cards are used up and there is no winner reshuffle the cards, place back in the Estate and continue following the above rules until there is a winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
