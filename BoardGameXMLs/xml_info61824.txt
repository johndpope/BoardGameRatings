							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wolfmond</name>
									
			<description>A remote village, deep in the mountains, is ruled by fear. Each night, another one falls prey to bloodthirsty horrors lurking in the dark. On every midnight a howling is proof of the curse which has befallen the village: werewolves. The scared villagers are angry and torches are lit, a stake is piled up. Is it possible that one of their own has fallen victim of the curse? Distrust creeps into the hearts of the villagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolfmond is a game suitable for large groups. It ropes the players inevitably into the eery atmosphere of a cursed village. There they will find themselves in the roles of the villagers, which not only have to fear the werewolves but their own betraying peers as well ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game displays some sort of a theater play, in which each player plays a role to bring life in the forgotten village somehwere in the woods, which is plagued by Werewolves. Some players are the hidden werewolves which &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; villagers each night. The villagers (including the Werewolves) vote each &amp;quot;morning&amp;quot; who is the suspect and &amp;quot;burn&amp;quot; him for venegance. During the &amp;quot;night&amp;quot; several characters affect the gameplay by using their special powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolfmond is a game set up in the Middle Ages, but the mechanics are based on the game Mafia from Dimitry Davidoff. The game contents various characters with different powers, as the Totengr&amp;auml;ber, Meuchelm&amp;ouml;rder, Medicus and the insane Jeremias which give the game a complete different gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 30 cards with many tattoo-like illustrated characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
