			<description>This text is from a promotional flyer included in the game, which was part of the [gamedesigner=4] collection auctioned off on November 16, 2002:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The excitement of a cable car ride, a shopping spree around Union Square, elegant dining in a famous restaurant, and a tour of the Bay Area's famous landmarks -- all these are a part of the San Francisco Scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to own Grant Avenue, the Oakland Raiders, Sausalito or Walnut Creek? Now is your chance by playing the San Francisco Scene!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will by and sell your favorite local properties; become either a labor leader, an attorney, a politician, or a membership chairman of an exclusive club; and bargain with the other players to receive a Connection Card which will permit you to develop your properties and thereby collect increased rent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
