			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To play the game, suspects (called players) make their getaway beginning and ending at Rockington Estate. Unlucky players will wear the disguise or go to Da Pokey. The lucky player landing on the Outrageous Journalist (sticking his microphone out of a manhole) will collect $10 grand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The player collecting the most evidence wins, and in this game evidence can be bought and sold.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple and colorful boardgame was meant to satirize the many court trails which fueled a media frenzy in the early nineties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
