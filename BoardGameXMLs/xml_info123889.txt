			<description>In Legacy you will strive to become the new leader of the people of Ilyenashae &amp;ndash; a continent upon which the people have risen up and overthrown their previous governments in fear for their safe future. You will campaign to become the leader of the continent&amp;rsquo;s territories and then create a new infrastructure by building developments in the territories, like citadels and universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you have two actions which can be any combination of: campaign for a territory by playing campaign cards or your hard won influence so the people side with you rather than any other player; progress, where you develop your territories so they produce more or help to defend them from other players; support, where you call on your followers and patrons to provide you with more influence and cards to play; and enlighten where you can play ideology cards like liberalism, utilitarianism and pioneering or even nihilism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of the ideologies you play shows what form your new government style takes they also give you advantages which will help you to win over the people. Territories and ideologies both give you points which represent the support of the peoples of Ilyenashae. The winner is the one who reaches the tipping point of territories held and ideologies played that convinces the whole continent to follow them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy gameplay is a mix of strategy, resource management and civilisation building driven by area control and card play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- - -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This was already our second chance. We do not dare hope for a third but we must try, or else accept the end of everything. In our desperation we have rid ourselves of all self-serving princes, casting them down the mountain. We now look to those men and women who rise from the flame and ash still flying banners of hope, still urging us on despite the pain and devastation. We now turn to these heroes for new leadership and new ideas on how we should live and rule ourselves for the betterment of all. One of them will forge a new society that will unite all the peoples of Ilyenashae to stand and face our trials together. Our future will be their... Legacy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
