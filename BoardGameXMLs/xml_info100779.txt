			<description>In your search for treasure and glory you find yourself trapped in a tomb infested with zombies! Plunge deeper into the tomb each day and use the treasures you've found for upgrades. Watch out for bats, floor spikes, snakes and ...of course... zombies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Dash is a game of survival! Use the trackball to navigate through the tombs collecting treasure as you go. Each day you need to find the key that will let you pass into a safe zone where you can purchase items to help with your survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you get caught by a zombie you will need to cast a magic spell to fight it off. Trace the spells on the screen as quickly as you can to avoid infection. Shake off bats, bash the snakes and step your way off of the floor spikes as you go deeper into the tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
