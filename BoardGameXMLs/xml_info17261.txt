							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Math and The Beanstalk</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a unique activity that incorporates basic math drill, using addition and subtraction facts with the growth and development of a bean! Players solve problems correctly and use markers to cover various plant parts including the root, seed, shoot, stem, leaves, and flower. Using addition facts through 9+9 and subtraction facts through 10-10 players become familiar with parts of plants while mastering addition and subtraction facts. The player who covers all sections of his or her plant wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
