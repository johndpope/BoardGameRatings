			<description>Skate It is a skateboarding video game developed by EA Montreal, Exient Entertainment and EA Black Box for the Nintendo DS, Wii, and iOS. The game is a spin-off of 2007's Skate, and the developers have stated that it is not a port or sequel but rather an original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skate It is set in San Vanelona, the same fictional city as the original game, although several mysterious disasters (identified as earthquakes in Skate 2) have caused widespread damage and a mass evacuation of the city, leaving the player free to skate alone and undisturbed. They will, however, be able to travel to other cities in the world later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Skate It,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
