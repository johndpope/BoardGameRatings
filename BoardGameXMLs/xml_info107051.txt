							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reversi (ZX Spectrum)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the board game of the same name, Reversi is set on an eight by eight grid. Your objective is to envelope the computer's black pieces between two of your own. It goes without saying that you must avoid the same being done to your pieces. The game was offered along with March 1982 issue of &amp;quot;Computer &amp;amp; Video Games&amp;quot; magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
