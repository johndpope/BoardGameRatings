							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triple Flips 4: Sci-Fiction</name>
									
			<description>Triple Flips 4 includes Save the Earth, Time Warp, and Robot Attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Save the Earth is a 1-player game that seems to be inspired by Missile Command.  Four missiles are bearing down on Earth, and you make straight, orthogonal moves based on the die roll, trying to hit the missiles before they reach Earth.  Each turn, the missiles advance - although, if you are blocking a missile's path downward, it will wait until you are out of the way to advance.  You essentially have 9 turns to fly around frantically to destroy the four missiles - well, 7 for two of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Time Warp is a simple elimination game for 2-4 players, comprising two concentric, rectangular tracks - past and future - interconnected at four points by time machines.  That is the gimmick.  Roll, then move one way or the other, trying to land on an opponent to eliminate her.  If you land on a time machine, you may use it to switch tracks and go again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Robot Attack is a 2-player game, which seems related to Hnefatafl.  One player tries to traverse the passageways, by orthogonal moves from her die roll, to her spaceship, which conveniently lies behind the opponent's four robots.  The robot player tries to trap the other player with his robots, by splitting each roll among however many robots he wishes.  Not only are the robots inherently &amp;frac14; the speed of the spaceman, but they also are unable to move backward, toward the ship.  As a result, the robot player must be attentive in his move choices.  Fortunately for him, most of the board has four or fewer chokepoints to cover at any given vertical slice; unfortunately, players are neither allowed to waste pips from their die roll, nor retread a space on the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
