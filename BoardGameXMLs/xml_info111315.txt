			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings, agents. There is a crisis underway in Colombia. At approximately 1400 hours local time, six barrels of S&amp;uuml;sser Tod 17, a chemical weapon developed by German scientists during World War I, were detonated outside of Cartagena in the heart of a sprawling refugee community. S&amp;uuml;sserTod 17 was never used in the war, and the remaining antidote, Panacea, was immediately airlifted to help the victims. Unfortunately, further tragedy has struck. The plane disappeared before it could reach its destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is clear: recover the antidote and get it to the victims as soon as possible. Keep in mind that time is of the essence. We estimate that those infected by S&amp;uuml;sserTod 17 have less than nineteen hours to live. Due to the urgency of this situation, you are instructed to complete this mission by any means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will remain in contact with you throughout the operation, providing whatever aid we can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heaven help you, and those who depend upon your success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This serial booster pits a team of rookie agents against the hostile forces of man and nature in a violent landscape of open conflict and secret agendas. The clock ticks forward without mercy, and the lives of hundreds of innocent people hang in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
