By the time the alchemist died, the students were but shadows of their former selves, but Khor was reborn into the body of a homunculus, albeit one tainted by death and alchemical poisons. Though he still lives, he is but a shell. His former apprentices are now the true danger&amp;mdash;warped by strange alchemy and their minds driven mad, they lurk in the tomb, continuously reborn and reshaped by the powers locked within&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Among the Trees:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    For use with ATLANTIS: The Second Age roleplaying game&lt;br/&gt;    An epic battle across the Atlas Mountains&lt;br/&gt;    A better life through Alchemical Chemistry&lt;br/&gt;    Chaotic Combat scenarios&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
