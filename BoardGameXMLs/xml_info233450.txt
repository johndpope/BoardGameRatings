			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duo is a puzzle game by Bruno Freitas. It's about two abstract puppets dressed for wedding, walking at at each other while collecting the flowers on the floor. When they meet in the middle, they kiss and you made 1 of the 30 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick is that each move you make, is done by both characters. As they face each other, taking a step to their left you'll see one move left and the opposite to the right. And the correct step for one could be the step off board and failure for the other. Luckily there are a few walls to use as stoppers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nice touch is at the start of the game you can choose your couple, so the traditional male-female combination is just one of the 3 possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
