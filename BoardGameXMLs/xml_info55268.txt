							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Coast Campaign Book</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item was never released as a physical product but instead was made available was either plain text, or rich text format files zipped together and downloadable from the publisher's website. The way the book however has been written and refers to itself indicates that this was intended to be released as a single book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to THE SAVAGE COAST, TSR#2521, the first product from the AD&amp;amp;D ODYSSEY line, and TSR's first fully online product!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction of the product:&lt;br/&gt;The RED STEEL campaign had received a lot of support and gotten some very favorable reviews. So we decided to do a relaunch, offering the lands of the Savage Coast as a full line of products. You hold the results of that decision in your hands, a book that combines all the material from the original RED STEEL campaign set and the Savage Baronies supplement, along with some new material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
