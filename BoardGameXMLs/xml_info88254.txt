			<description>User Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fruity Bugs is a game from the Tesco Junior range for 2 to 4 players aged 4 and up.  The game includes one clockwork, strawberry board, 4 worm cards (1 blue, 1 green, 1 red and 1 yellow) and 20 green worms with coloured tail ends, 5 worms in each of the 4 colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You set the game up by randomly placing the worms in the holes in the strawberry and then each player selects a colour.  The aim of the game is to be the first player to get all 5 worms in your colour.  There is a lever at the top of the board, pull it and release to make the worms start wiggling (you'll have to repeat this frequently throughout the game as it only lasts for 10 seconds or so).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once started players take it in turns, beginning with the youngest player, to grab a worm from the strawberry.  If it matches their card they keep it, if not they put it back and then the next player goes.  You keep going around until one player gets all of their 5 worms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very simple kids memory game with a dexterity element as you try and grab the wiggling worms as they move up and down in the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
