							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Meditations of the Imperial Mystics (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meditations of the Imperial Mystics brings together the sublime secrets of joining mind, body, and spirit with the study of magic as recorded by the revered masters and their fanatical acolytes in ages gone past. Though fragments of their unattainable wisdom have survived in bits and pieces, the true original sources are accounted as great treasures among those who hold them. Rarely have their mysteries been unfolded, but gathered together they wait for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Body Outside Body, a teak-covered tome whose inscrutable diagrams unfold the mysteries of ki auras and their connections to knowledge, wisdom, fate, and the mind.&lt;br/&gt;     The Instructions of Yin-Blood and Thundering Yang, a unique inverting scroll that read forwards explicates the malleability of cool, yielding yin while read in reverse exposes the eruptive possibilities of fulminant yang, and the proper channeling of each power.&lt;br/&gt;     Prayers of Empty Flesh &amp;amp; Undying Ki, recorded on an infinitely unspooling prayer wheel that draws the mind and soul more deeply the more its chant is intoned, unveils the secrets of straddling the borders of life and death, of making transcendent spirit master base flesh.&lt;br/&gt;     Seven-Ghost-Needles, an academic and clinical treatise on the inner flows of ki through the body and mind and how to focus and channel it through the dantian centers of jin, shen, and wuji.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this 21-page product you will find 18 ki-related feats, from Mindworm and Recenter Flow to Dream Travel and Aura Absolution, as well as 6 new spells, from paradox to steal dying breath. In addition, these tomes contain unique ki training and ability enhancement rules through the study of esoteric texts of the ancient masters, broadening the powers of qinggong while exploring the deeper connections of ki, magic, and mysticism, including supernatural acupuncture, internalization of extreme yin and yang, linkage of mind, spirit, and fate through spirit-auras, and the mortification of the flesh to span the threshold of life and death. This product is compatible with and expands upon the ki rules introduced in The Way of Ki but does not require that product for use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Clinton J. Boomer and Jason Nelson with the Legendary Games design team of Matt Goodall, Jim Groves, Rob Lazzaretti, Neil Spicer, Russ Taylor, Greg Vaughan, Timothy Wickham, and Clark Peterson, with fabulous art by Frank Hessefort, Meditations of the Imperial Mystics is jam-packed with the kind of amazing rules content you have come to expect from us. Who better to provide you with innovative new rules concepts for your Adventure Path campaign or homebrew than the very writers of not only those adventures but also the hardback rulebooks for the game itself? Answer: no one. Legendary Games' Adventure Path Plug-Ins supplement and enrich your campaign experience, offering adventures and supporting products that incorporate and expanding upon unique concepts, themes, and rules subsystems introduced in the Adventure Paths while filling in the background characters, items, and locations that make those adventures come alive in delightful (and often dangerous) detail. Legendary Games comb ines stellar writing talent with innovative layout and product design and top-notch artistic values that we think will bring you back again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out this Asian-themed rules accessory and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
