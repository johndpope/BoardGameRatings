			<description>One child alone will enjoy playing the game as a puzzle by trying to match up the small cards with the pictures on the boards. This type of play will help develop one of the basic skills necessary in learning to read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOR GROUP PLAY... each child takes one of the boards. The small cards are mixed up thoroughly and placed face down in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The child to the left of the one who mixed the cards is the first to go and picks any card in the pile. If the card matches a section of his board, he places it over the matching illustration and has the privilege of picking the next cards also. This same player continues to pick cards until he reaches on that does not match his board. If one of the other players needs this card, he calls for it and also continues to pick and match as did the previous player. If no one needs the card picked, it is turned face down again and the child to the left of the last player is the next to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play continues around the group until one child has all the sections of his board covered with the matching cards and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before playing a new game the boards are interchanged among the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
