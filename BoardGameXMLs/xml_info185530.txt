			<description>Bubble Tanks Arenas (BTA) is a spin off of the traditional Bubble Tanks series. We created it to develop and test out some powerful new features that someday will be implemented in the upcoming Bubble Tanks 3!&lt;br/&gt;Rather than being able to move freely around the world, in BTA you can fight in Arenas, series of Bubblefields filled with enemies. That&amp;rsquo;s alright, but what makes it awesome is that you can create your own tanks and arenas! You can design your own avatar tanks, enemy tanks, and arenas as well as search to see what other players have created. If you&amp;rsquo;re worried about quality, don&amp;rsquo;t fret: Hero Interactive will constantly be making new Arenas for you to try out!&lt;br/&gt;This game has been long in development and a massive undertaking- by far the largest game we&amp;rsquo;ve ever coded. We hope you all enjoy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
