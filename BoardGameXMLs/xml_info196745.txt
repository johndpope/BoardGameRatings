			<description>Mythic Wars: Clash of the Gods is a card-and-dice game for 2-8 players, aged 12 to adult. In the game, each player takes on the role of advocate for a faction of four gods and/or goddesses. Each round, the advocate chooses which god or goddess to invoke and bring into the battle, and what attacks (or other actions) the active deities (and any supporting entities) should perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each entity has 3 scores: Attack, Defense, and Energy. Attacks (and other actions, such as Clashes) are resolved by comparing the appropriate score for each opposing entity, and adding a die roll from their respective advocate. Taking damage reduces an entity's energy points, and when they run out of these points, that entity is considered defeated and out of the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, most of the gods, goddesses, and other entities have abilities that affect the game in different ways, but their abilities only remain active until they are defeated. Once each active entity in the battle has been empowered with a chance to perform an action, the round ends. After four rounds, all of the deities have been invoked, and the battle continues until only one faction remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
