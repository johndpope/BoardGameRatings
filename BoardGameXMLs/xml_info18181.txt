			<description>OUTWORDS is a simple word game for 2 - 6 players aged 10 and over.  The box contains pads, pencils, a die, and a pack of over 250 cards each of which has 6 words of between 5 and 10 letters long on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to be the caller.  The caller takes a card and rolls the dice to see which word is going to be played (the words are numbered from 1 to 6).  The caller then announces the number of letters in the word and a letter from the middle of the word (i.e. not the first or last letter of the word).  The other players mark this information down on their score pad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going clockwise round the table players may ask for a letter to be added to either the immediate right or the immediate left of the starting letter (or chain of letters as the word develops).  The word therefore grows outwards from the original starting letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At any time from the giving of the first letter any player may try to guess the word by calling it out aloud.  If the guess is correct then the player scores 1 point for every letter as yet unexposed.  If incorrect the player loses 1 point from his score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score 20 points or more is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
