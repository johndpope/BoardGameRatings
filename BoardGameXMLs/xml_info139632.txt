							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warlords of Rhaemar</name>
									
			<description>In Warlords of Rhaemar your Warlords face off against other mighty Warlords. Choose your equipment wisely and you may just come out ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a card based equipment strategy game. You draw or draft your Warlords and then draw from the 4 equipment decks. Each round you choose a Warlord to play and then equip them with mighty artifacts or lash out at your foes with horrible curses. Surviving warlords are scored at the end of the round and a new round takes place until every player has been starting player. After the final round, the player with the most victory points is the Ultimate Warlord!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
