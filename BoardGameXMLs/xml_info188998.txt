			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harry Potter: The Roleplaying Game adapts the series of Harry Potter novels to tabletop role-playing.  Characters are students at Hogwart's school.  Characters have Attributes (Strength, Vitality, Nimbleness, Perception, Bearing, Intellect, and Magic) which have numeric values that are either randomly generated by 2D6 or assigned from a standard matrix (10, 9, 7, 7, 5, and 4).  Characters also have several Secondary Attributes which are derived values.  Characters next select a Heritage (Muggle, Muggle-born, Half-Muggle, Pureblood, or Non-magical Wizard/Squib), join a Wizard House, and select Skills.  Skills are placed in Skill Groups and Skills also allow for Specialization (sub-categories within a Skill).  Character creation completes with the assignment of Traits (either Edges or Flaws - or both).  Magical characters will also select Abilities, roughly analogous to spell abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution pits 2D6 plus modifiers against a Target Number.  Routine tasks have a Target Number of 5; Impossible tasks have a Target Number of 25.  Modifiers are either situational or based on innate Skill or Ability.  Combat functions similarly but uses a wide variety of special maneuvers and situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
