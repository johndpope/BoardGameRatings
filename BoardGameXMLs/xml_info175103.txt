							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Call My Bluff</name>
									
			<description>Call My Bluff is designed for up to six individual players or two teams. Insert a cassette into the game console. Stand by your button as the emcee announces each question. The first player to hit the button gets to answer. But listen carefully - is it a bluff? Should you challenge? It's up to you. You'll get points if you're right, lose points if you're wrong. The digital display automatically registers each player's points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call My Bluff is a trivia game that involves a large console with a cassette tape player. Special cassettes indicate to the console how many points a player gets for answering the question correctly (as some of the questions are worth more points than others.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game was published by Charan Toys, the cassette technology was licensed from Words of Wonder, the company responsible for the hugely successful Teddy Ruxpin series of toys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
