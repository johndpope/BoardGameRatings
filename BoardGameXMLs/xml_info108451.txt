							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Captain Novolin</name>
									
			<description>Captain Novolin stars the eponymous superhero who has type 1 diabetes. The game became available to the public in 1992 and was sponsored by Novo Nordisk, makers of the Novolin brand of insulin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Novolin is the only one who can stop such evil aliens as Blubberman and rescue a diabetic mayor who was kidnapped by evil aliens. Throughout the game, Captain Novolin needs to avoid the alien invaders who have the appearance of junk food items while eating healthy meals to keep his blood glucose within a safe zone.  Players can earn bonus points by correctly answering questions that relate to diabetes. In addition, the game has a feature whereby a diabetic player can specify the frequency of their real-life insulin injections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Captain Novolin&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
