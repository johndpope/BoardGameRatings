			<description>Quatre Bras&lt;br/&gt;Stalemate on the Brussels Road&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crossroads of Quatre-Bras was of strategic importance because the side which controlled it could move south-eastward along the Nivelles-Namur road towards the French and Prussian armies at the Battle of Ligny. If Wellington's Anglo-Allied army could combine with the Prussians, the combined force would be larger than Napoleon's. Napoleon's strategy had been to cross the border into the Netherlands without alerting the Coalition and drive a wedge between their forces and subsequently to defeat the Prussians before turning on the Anglo-Allied army. Although the coalition commanders did have an overview of French pre-war movements, Napoleon's strategy was initially very successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle cost Ney 4,000 men to Wellington's 4,800. Although a tactical draw, the allies had been unable to send forces to the aid of the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny. Wellington's Anglo-Allied army, upon learning of the Prussian defeat, was forced to retreat north along the Brussels road further away from the Prussians, who retreated north-east towards Wavre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been much debate of what would have happened if d'Erlon's I Corps had engaged at either Ligny or Quatre Bras. As he did not, Napoleon chose to follow Wellington with the bulk of his forces, and two days later met his destiny at Waterloo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quatre Bras is part of the Napoleon's Last Battles Quadrigame.  It was also sold separately as a folio game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Folio version includes rules, a 17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; map and 100 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
