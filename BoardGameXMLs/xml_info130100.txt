			<description>From Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&amp;rsquo;s Resource by Ben Kent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set along the mouth of the river Saran, Roake is a pleasant, prosperous village, famed for the animal husbandry talents of Liaka Frost, a local ranger. Wealthy visitors frequent the village, coming to either purchase her tamed beasts or visit their estates dotted throughout the surrounding area. Adventurers also regularly pass through the village, stopping at the Prince &amp;amp; Pauper to rest their weary legs and quench their thirst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind its above average prosperity, however, Roake conceals a troubled past that yet hangs over the village. As the villagers&amp;rsquo; decade-old deception begins to wear thin, the village youth have begun to question their true origins, much to the dismay of their parents...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
