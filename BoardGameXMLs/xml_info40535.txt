			<description>Dale's Woodcraft has manufactured a visually appealing wooden folding game board with 6 rows of 12 columns numbered 1 - 12 with each of the 6x12 intersections a depression to fit the marbles.  The game stores 24 marbles (12 each of 2 colors), 4 dice, and 4 scoring pegs.  Each round consists of 12 points and first to win 2 rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the roll of two die, the optional use of a decreasing &amp;quot;reinforcement&amp;quot; number, and the management of the lower non-scoring columns to absorb part of the roll, each player moves a combination of marbles across the board towards and into the opponent's territory scoring points along the way and eventually blocking the movement of their opponent (unless the opponent blocks them first!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game involves luck of the dice along with the management of a reinforcement number and non-scoring columns to enable a strategy of movement for a fast moving game that is simple to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
