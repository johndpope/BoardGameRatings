			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;A diceless game in which all but one character will die.&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the GM determines one character to be the Survivor. As long as that character makes an effort to survive, they will. All other characters will meet their demise at some point.&lt;br/&gt;The only other factor is that each character is good at four things, and bad at two. Everything inbetween is freeform and diceless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
