							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Godling</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The godling is a new character concept designed for use with the Pathfinder RPG. The godling is presented as both a base class (suitable for 1st level characters) and a prestige class (requiring characters to be higher level before taking it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The godling is a mortal hero in whose veins flows the blood of a god. Cut from the same cloth as classic ancient heroes such as Theseus (fathered by both a mortal father, Aegeus, and a divine father, Poseidon), Memnon (son of a half-nymph mortal father and the titan/goddess Eos), and Helen (the famous beauty who was the daughter of Zeus), most godlings are the offspring of a god and a mortal humanoid who drew the god&amp;rsquo;s eye. Godlings are not demigods&amp;mdash;at least not yet&amp;mdash;for their birth on the material plane prevents them from being classified as outsiders. Initially bound to the dust and earth of their birthplace, godlings are nonetheless more than mere mortals. They have inherited divine powers that, with time and experience, grow and allow godlings to rise and become powerful and famous heroes. (Of course there are many other possible origins of godlings&amp;mdash;see Godlings in Your Campaign at the end of the product.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Godlings are blessed (or cursed) with lives of adventure. They are thrust into dangerous quests and major events at a young age and often spend their entire adult lives moving from crisis to crisis, sought out by those who need their help, and hunted by those who wish them harm for no reason other than to spite their godly parents. Many godlings are made aware of their inherent power early in life, and are taught to respect both its origins and the responsibility it conveys. Others have no idea why they are able to perform feats that other mortals cannot, and may think themselves to be freaks or monsters (or some odd kind of sorcerer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Godling Base Class:&lt;br/&gt;The godling base class is for characters that begin play with their deific heritage a known and active part of their lives. These characters know they are scions of the gods and are out to prove themselves worthy heirs by engaging in adventures in the mortal world. The godling base class actually contains two subclasses&amp;mdash;clever and mighty godlings. These options are treated as different iterations of the same class, so a character cannot multiclass as two different kinds of godling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Godling Prestige Class:&lt;br/&gt;Not all godlings realize who and want they are at the beginning of their adventuring careers. Indeed, some receive no special powers until their divine parents acknowledge their relationship. The godling prestige class is presented as a way to allow characters to undergo a deific metamorphosis later in their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
