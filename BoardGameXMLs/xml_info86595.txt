			<description>Jumping Flash! 2 is a platform game released in 1996 for the PlayStation. It is the direct sequel to Jumping Flash!, which was released the previous year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Robbit foils Baron Aloha's plans to take over Crater Planet (events from the first game), Aloha flees for his life and return to his home planet, Little Muu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While planning his revenge, however, Aloha's turn to face the fear of having his planet attacked comes. A gigantic alien invader known as Captain Kabuki descends upon Little Muu and starts taking it apart, piece by piece, just as Aloha himself had once tried to do to Crater Planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aloha flees the onslaught in his space pod, and lands on an asteroid far away from Little Muu, where he swallows his pride and calls for help from his sworn enemy, Universal City Hall. Once again, Robbit is dispatched to help, and manages to free the parts of Little Muu which Kabuki has taken, and ultimately faces Kabuki one-on-one in mortal combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jumping flash 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
