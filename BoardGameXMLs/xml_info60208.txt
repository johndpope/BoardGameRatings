			<description>Mathematics is considered by most students to be a frustrating and pointless experience. A board game was chosen for this subject mainly as a motivator for the students. Games are considered to be a good means to break the routine of traditional forms of teaching. This is especially true for the teaching of mathematics. An art theme was chosen to engage another part of the student's mind while practicing the fundamentals of algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to practice the rules of algebra by solving several dozen different problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game The player who completes their design first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One magnetic game board&lt;br/&gt;     Two boxes of algebra problems (500 cards total)&lt;br/&gt;     Four playing tokens (1 of each color)&lt;br/&gt;     One die&lt;br/&gt;     72 art cards&lt;br/&gt;     400 magnetic colored art bits (100 of each color)&lt;br/&gt;     One hourglass timer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other items required but not included with the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Four pads of scratch paper&lt;br/&gt;     Four pencils&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
