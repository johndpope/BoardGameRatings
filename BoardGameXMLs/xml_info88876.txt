			<description>From the back of the box: &lt;br/&gt;The luck of a dice roll with the strategy of a challenge!&lt;br/&gt;Build enough sets of 4 and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's fast and furious so the cards lay on the table. When you see the cards you need, you're in luck - SHAKE'M &amp;amp; TAKE'M. But watch it! Your opponent might be luckier. Make another challenge. Shake 'm and OOPS! You lost. Next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's plenty of action and risk when you SHAKE'M &amp;amp; TAKE'M. Cards go from player to player, back and forth. Dice roll with each challenge. And wild cards add to the fun as part of the strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are attempting to acquire a number of sets of 4 cards each by challenging other players to a dice roll off. Players set down their hands face up in front of everyone. On your turn, you may challenge a player for some of their cards. You both roll a die and the higher roll wins the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
