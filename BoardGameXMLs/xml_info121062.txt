			<description>GM: OK, before I forget &amp;ndash; Robert, make your disease save to prevent damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: (Rolls dice) Yes, 23 - a success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: You don&amp;rsquo;t take any damage from the disease today. Out of curiosity, was the save in the last game a success or failure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: I don&amp;rsquo;t remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Because if it was a success then you&amp;rsquo;re healed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disease - it can be a major hazard to any adventurer and can leave even the strongest warrior a husk of his former glory. Mired in confusion and disliked by many players, often this danger is ignored by game masters. However, we at Healing Fireball Publication are here to shed light on this often-overlooked facet of fantasy gaming with our latest product Combat Cards: Diseases. In this set of cards you will find both the traditional Combat Cards style cards that explain the various rules involved in the use of diseases in your game. But this set contains so much more one card for each of the diseases listed in the SRD. As an added bonus to this set we also provide a blank disease card to add your own diseases to the set and a Disease Save record card for game masters to keep track of the diseased characters in their party's save record. So as always never stop to search through a book again - with Combat Cards the rules are at your fingertips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Publisher Blurb]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
