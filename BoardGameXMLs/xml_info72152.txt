			<description>User summary: When more than three play, the players form teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card represents a number of electoral votes. To win the card (and get the votes) a player must roll the number on the card on either die or total of both dice. A player who gets the plurality of votes in a state wins the entire state. The player (or team) that gets the plurality of electoral votes has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
