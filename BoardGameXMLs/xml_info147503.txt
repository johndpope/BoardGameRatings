			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Architects of War is proud to present the American Uncivil War, straight out of the pages of History AND the silver screens of Hollywood! Inspired by the films of John Ford and classics like Gone with the Wind, The Horse Soldiers, The Great Locomotive Chase, and Shenandoah, American Uncivil War captures the spirit of these films with miniature games staged on the fringes of the American Civil War. Spies, raiders, foraging parties, missions behind enemy lines, bushwhackers, deserters and a host of other scenarios can be played out. Its a role-playing skirmish game with figures overflowing with character and it puts a whole new spin on gaming this period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules utilize a card activation system for initiative, command and control. Unit size ranges from single character models to platoons and even larger companies. Characters have special attributes like Influential, Dead-eye shot, Heroic, and Despicable, all of which bring to life the untold story of the American Uncivil War of both history and Hollywood myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So choose your side, raise your flag, and prepare for action and adventure in the War Between the States!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rulebook is 128 pages and comes with a 68 card activation deck. Full color throughout with 76 model scene pictures, actual civil war photos from the National Archive,  12 table/scenario maps, 12 scenarios including seven that can be linked and four historical stand alone scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rulebook includes Basic rules, advanced rules, pages of attributes for your characters, a complete guide to narrated games, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
