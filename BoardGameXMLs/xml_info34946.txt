			<description>C.O.W. or Cybernetic Omni-tasking Workcow is a board game that is similar to a 1980's computer game called M.U.L.E.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Players start by purchasing a land of out of a pool.  They can also buy workcows to farm the land to produce the resources.  During the market phase, players buy or sell the resources to other players or the store to make profit or simply to keep their farm running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must also deal with random events that may effect their production and at the same time, they must be cunning enough to survive the brutal market manipulation by other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the first player who reaches a specific wealth wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
