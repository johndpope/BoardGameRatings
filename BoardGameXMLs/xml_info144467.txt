							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eight-Year Resistance War</name>
									
			<description>Eight Year Resistance War is a solitaire strategy game covering the Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 &amp;ndash; September 2, 1945), which was a military conflict fought primarily between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan from 1937 to 1941. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the war merged into the greater conflict of World War II as a major front of what is broadly known as the Pacific War. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century. It also made up more than 50% of the casualties in the Pacific War if the 1937&amp;ndash;1941 period is taken into account. Although the two countries had fought intermittently since 1931, total war started in earnest in 1937 and ended only with the surrender of Japan in 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you, the player, lead China&amp;rsquo;s Army (KMT Central Army) to fight against Japanese invasion. Major battles and historical events are represented by event cards which may be executed chronologically as the history (see the Historical Game option in 17.0), or randomly so as to make youself unprepared for what will happen in the next turn. You have to use your limited resources (limited number of actions, and event cards beneficial to you) to avoid Japanese capture of your Capital, Chungking. To do so, you need to gain support from Western Allies and the help from your unreliable temporary ally &amp;ndash; Chinese Communist Party&amp;rsquo;s Red Army, which will get the final victory (China) from you if you allow them to expand and gain sufficient political support among generals, soldiers and civilians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Errata: Page 9, [15.1] &amp;quot;i)...&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;the KMTPS level &amp;lt;=20.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;Map file Page 3ï¼Œstep 2: Only the first &amp;quot;2&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(You are always welcome for any comments or suggestions.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
