			<description>Which animal belongs to which stable? Little explorers find out according to the shape of the wooden pieces. Two different games boards and the additional die game ensure variety and long lasting interest, as well as lots of fun. A tremendously fun sorting game for 1-4 animal lovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the boards is placed over the bottom of the game box (one corner is cut so that it is lined up correctly). The boards have different shaped cutouts that correspond to the shapes of the animal pieces and the shapes on the die (star is wild). Players have to match the corresponding pieces to the different cutouts, which go into different (walled) areas of the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several options for play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(For two players) With the green board in place, give each player a set of the animal pieces, so each player has one of each animal. On their turn, a player rolls the die, and fits the piece shown on the die into the matching hole. When a star is rolled, any piece may be selected. The object is to put all of the pieces into the holes. When the board is lifted, players can see that all pieces are in the correct stable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(For two players) Place the blue board on the box. Rules are the same as the green board rules, above, except when the board is lifted, the animals are not yet in the right stalls. The second phase begins. The players win if they can sort the animals into the correct stalls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components can also be used in more open-ended play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(For several players and one adult) Only the game box is used, no board is placed on it. The adult tells a story, and the players must do what the story tells them (&amp;quot;The chicken goes to the chicken coop&amp;quot;). The instructions provide ten examples, and more can be created by the adult. For more advanced play, the story can give a sequence of moves (&amp;quot;The cow jumps from the stable to the gardens&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(An adult and a child) The boards and wooden pieces are not used, only the box. Questions are asked about the scenes on the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Who lives in the garden? &lt;br/&gt;- Where are the two chicks? &lt;br/&gt;- What color are the animals? &lt;br/&gt;- How many beets are in the pigsty? (2) &lt;br/&gt;- How many apples are in the basket? (4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
