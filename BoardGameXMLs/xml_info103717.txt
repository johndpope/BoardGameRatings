			<description>From the publisher's web page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tools of Ignorance are the mask, pads, and shin guards a catcher wears to protect themselves from injury. It is also a roleplaying game about baseball players and their lives - how they work as a team and what makes a team successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike in most roleplaying games, the characters in ToI don't face combat, or terrors in the night, or magic. Instead they have to fight their battles in the ritualized form of baseball, where they give everything they have to catch a ball, risk career ending injury to block a runner, choose whether to take performance enhancing drugs to prolong their career, or fade away into a footnote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a full-on baseball simulation in ToI, covering everything in the game with flexible, extensible rules. You can create a team, create players, play out a game, a series, or a season. There are rules for deciding games with one roll, if you don't want to play everything out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ballplayers have lives off the field as well , - marriages, divorces, cheating, children, prying reporters, and everything that comes with an immensely well-paying but intensely high pressure career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
