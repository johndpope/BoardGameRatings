							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deckmatch: The Unofficial Quake 3 Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a do-it-yourself card game based on the computer game, Quake 3 Arena.  It can be played with an ordinary deck of cards, but works best if you have a way to create cards with the correct graphics (weapons) on them.  To find the rules, try doing an internet search for 'quake deckmatch'.  The game is a fast paced, turn-based simulation of a first person shooter, where the objective is to kill (or 'frag') your opponent, by reducing his life points to zero, as many times as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
