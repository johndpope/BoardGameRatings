			<description>This is a word game whose object is to come up with ten words, each beginning with a specific letter, that match the category given and are not duplicated by someone else.  Each player has their own copy of the clue card and an answer sheet.  Game length is adjustable by the number of rounds played.  There are bonuses for words that begin with less frequently used letters (like Y, V, K, etc. - they're listed in the scoring summary).  There are also bonus points for getting 7, 8, 9, or 10 out of 10 words in each timed round.  The game also lists several variants on play, like coming up with words that end in the chosen letter, or coming up with two words, an adjective and a noun, each beginning with the chosen letter (like &amp;quot;Delicious Dining&amp;quot; for example).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
