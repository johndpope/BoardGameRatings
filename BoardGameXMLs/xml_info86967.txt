							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D&#039;Ah Rien</name>
									
			<description>From Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As races become more advanced, some choose to use their growing power for conquest. Others view their role as guardians and teachers. Fortunately, the latter is true of the d&amp;rsquo;ah rien.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, the d&amp;rsquo;ah rien were a tribal race of efficient swampland hunters. As their bodies developed, so too did their minds. In time, the race developed powerful psionic might. D&amp;rsquo;Ah Rien civilizations spread throughout the swamps, gems of learning amid the mire. The d&amp;rsquo;ah rien continued to advance while other emergent races rose and fell. The d&amp;rsquo;ah rien had lesser allies during this time, but no equals. The race observed an interesting effect of this lack of peers: their own advancement had begun to slow. After much contemplation, the d&amp;rsquo;ah rien realized their advancement could only continue if others were brought up to their levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the d&amp;rsquo;ah rien actively spread knowledge through any cultures they encounter. D&amp;rsquo;Ah Rien learning missions can be found in most metropolises and many smaller communities. The race is particularly interested in cultures relying on arcane might. The d&amp;rsquo;ah rien feel that these cultures understand self-improvement, and are ready to begin developing their minds in place of their arcane crutches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
