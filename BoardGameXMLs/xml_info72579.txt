			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In early 3061, Prince Victor Steiner-Davion returned from the Clan  homeworlds triumphant&amp;mdash;but to an Inner Sphere that was radically different. The entire Ghost Bear population had relocated to the Inner Sphere; the St. Ives Compact was under siege; Katrina Steiner-Davion was sitting on the throne of New Avalon. Even with the overwhelming threat of the Clan invasion defeated, the Inner Sphere is still poised precariously between peace and war. Who will light the spark that will set BattleMechs  marching and worlds aflame once more?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on information from five scenario packs, seven sourcebooks and more than a dozen novels, Shattered Sphere represents the ultimate guide to the people and places of BattleTech, as seen through the eyes of the characters who live there. Offering a brief, comprehensive history of the universe and an in-depth look at events from the Truce of Tukayid through early 3062, this update is a must for any BattleTech fan. Shattered sphere also includes detailed maps showing the current state of the Inner Sphere and the Clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
