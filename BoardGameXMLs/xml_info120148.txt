			<description>In YerTurn! each player, one at a time, draws a 'create' card and attempts to mold the object featured on the card with modeling dough. Other players attempt to guess the object the creator is molding. The player who guessed the object and the player who created the object will advance on the board. Special 'turn' cards are drawn when a player lands on a YerTurn! space; these cards include actions (double up, smash, lose a turn, etc) for use immediately or to save for later. Play consists of moving through the spaces on the board and being first to the final space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
