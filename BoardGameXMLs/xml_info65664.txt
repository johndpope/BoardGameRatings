			<description>&amp;quot;The battle of Chippawa (1814) was a landmark victory for the US army, marking the first time it defeated the veteran British regulars in open combat.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When Winfield Scott's grey jacketed 1st Brigade was first seen the British may have mistaken them for militia. Watching them under fire, however, it became obvious that they were in fact well trained regulars. The US and British lines faced each other at close range, exchanging musket and cannon fire. After both sides suffered terrible casualties it was the British that withdrew.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base (except for Commanders, who are based singly). Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These streamlined &amp;quot;fast play&amp;quot; rules encompass unit formations, charges, commanders, morale, and terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
