			<description>Blood in Space is a micro but complete set of rules for solitaire or co-op skirmish game, set on a sci-fi background. &amp;ldquo;Micro&amp;rdquo; refers to the small set of rules, the small time required to complete one game session and the small number of miniatures required (4-10 figures being a common range).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes eleven Scenarios covering iconic sci-fi scenes like exploring the planet surface, attacking an enemy base, searching an abandoned starship, freeing prisoners. Event markers placed on the Map will create the needed Fog of War and randomize the placement of enemies, events and of course loot! Terrain rules allow to quickly create different planetary conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios can be played individually or as part of a Campaign game: in this case a flowchart will (randomly) determine the next mission; as an example, after a &amp;ldquo;Exploration&amp;rdquo; mission a bad roll could send your characters on the &amp;ldquo;Ambush&amp;rdquo; scenario. Characters on a Campaign will be able to improve their characteristics, but with the improvement of the Reputation Level of your Crew, your enemies will also become stronger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activation of units (friendly and enemies) is managed with a pool of activation markers, but you can never be sure that every unit will be activated. When an &amp;ldquo;Enemy&amp;rdquo; marker is drawn by the pool you will roll on the ENEMY ACTIVATION table in the current Scenario to determine the unit to activate and its orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
