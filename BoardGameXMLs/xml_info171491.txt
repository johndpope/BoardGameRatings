			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTHING COMES EASY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every shadowrunner knows the fear that comes with the words &amp;ldquo;milk run.&amp;rdquo; Anytime something is supposed be easy in the Sixth World, it&amp;rsquo;s guaranteed to come with unexpected headaches and danger, and that holds especially true for Chicago. Lothan the Wise, an egotistical troll mage who is extra irritating because he has the skills to back up his braggadocio, says he has a simple job. There&amp;rsquo;s no question that things will get more complicated than he expects&amp;mdash;the only question is how things will go wrong, and which of the dangerous denizens of the feral sprawl will leap up to cause trouble. Runners will have to be fast, flexible, and able to think on their feet&amp;mdash;but isn&amp;rsquo;t that part of the basic job description anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liberation is the latest adventure in Shadowrun Missions&amp;rsquo; fifth season, and it has everything needed to throw players into the wilds of the Chicago sprawl and see if they can come out on top. Whether players are at a convention, in a game store, or playing a home game, Liberation has the plot, the details, and the game mechanics needed for an exciting run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SRM 05-04 Liberation is for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
