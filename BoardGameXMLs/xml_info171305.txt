							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anno Domini: Mixed Edition</name>
									
			<description>A regular Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small expansion set Anno Domini - Mixed Edition was a free giveaway by the publisher. It only contains 12 event cards out of 72 mixed cards without a common theme. Since this is not enough for a real game, it only comes with a brief summary of the gameplay. Those six different bags of cards can be recognized by the number of each of the first card in a bag: U001, U013, U025, U037, U049, U061.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&lt;br/&gt;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly. Anno Domini is a blast to play, it is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Anno Domini series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
