							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Age of Camelot: Trials of Atlantis</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trials of Atlantis was the second retail expansion for Dark Age of Camelot. Besides three new races, it also added a lot of end-game zones and content, notably Master Levels and artifacts. At the time, a segment of the playerbase felt this expansion added too much &amp;quot;grinding&amp;quot; to the game because players without Master Levels and fully leveled artifacts were at a disadvantage in the popular Realm vs Realm (RvR) PVP combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also included another upgrade to the graphics engine and added the ability to swim underwater rather than just along the surface of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
