							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Wuxia!</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;Wuxia is a very broad genre of Chinese fiction focusing on the adventures of martial-arts heroes. Many modern kung-fu movies trace their origins to Wuxia. The heroes are usually independent, living as wanderers or rebels, following a code of honor to protect innocents from oppression. Most are martial-arts masters and some have quasi-mystical powers. Supernatural beings and evil sorcerers are present in many Wuxia stories. In short, these are the Eastern equivalent of swords &amp;amp; sorcery or the picaresque novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional Wuxia focuses on common people of great skill, following the warrior's code to defend helpless innocents from evil overlords, crime bosses, vile sorcerers, and unnatural monsters. Often, a tangled soap-opera-like web of enemies, allies, and departed lovers envelops the hero, pulling him or her into adventure from multiple angles. A recurring theme in Wuxia is the conflict between love (or other personal relationships and goals) and duty (acting honorably and for the cause of good), so select Hindrances that play into these contradictory motivations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules presented here provide a modern, cinematic kung-fu experience. They are meant to encourage energetic, mobile combat, and to balance unarmed and weapon styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
