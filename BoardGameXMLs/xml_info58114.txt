			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do a perfectly ordinary and normal insane asylum, a secret, subterranean cavern infested by evil spirits and the gateway to Hell have in common? They're all in this book! And they're all lined up, ready and waiting to scare the living bejabbers out of your Players. &amp;quot;Script Crypt Volume 4: Very Bad Places&amp;quot; is a collection of four adventure scripts for &amp;quot;Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible Roleplaying Game&amp;quot;, featuring an (un)healthy spread of fiendish and sinister locations for your gaming pleasure. Each site has a dark secret, a terrifying foe or some other just plain nasty feature that qualifies it as an *official* Very Bad Place and will undoubtedly maim, kill or drive insane any who venture into it. With places THIS bad, your Players will be DYING to go back over and over and over! Each Script is a complete adventure, including all the classic Horror Rules elements: Story, Bad Guys, Cast, Walk-Ons, Chain of Events... even Mood tips and Plot Pushers! Also, with expanded Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists, each haunting and sinister Script becomes FOUR Scripts - that's 16 times the horror! It's enough dark corners, creaking floorboards and lurking menace to reduce even the hardiest Player into a sobbing, shattered heap... and with Horror Rules, they'll never have more fun getting there! Packed with all the wacky scares, edge-of-your-seat action and pee-your-pants thrills you've come to love, &amp;quot;Very Bad Places&amp;quot; is a sure hit and a must-have supplement for horror enthusiasts and gaming fans alike. So for those who dare, four Very Bad Places await. Enter at your own risk...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
