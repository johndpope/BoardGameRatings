							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alwen&#039;s Run</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Alwen'Besson the message had always been his life. From the moment that he had dug his way out of the dry earth of Gorgoroth he had been trained as a Messenger, and in that role had given everything he had to his duty. Such was the reputation of Alwen amongst the Masters of House Besson that he had risen above all others to find favour as the personal Messenger of his Dominus. It was a position he took pride in, for there was little that any Morg could look to with pride, and unlike most of his kind he took his responsibilities very seriously indeed. There came a day however, when a crue of Hresh Scouts captured him in the foothills of the Hadaras Mountains and with no regard for his mission decided to have some fun. Throwing him into an abandoned mineshaft they laughed as he fell; his small, emaciated body tumbling into the darkness. Such should have been his end, but for Alwen it was only the beginning of a legendary adventure, one that would forever be known amongst the Morg of Arborell as Alwen's Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
