			<description>D.D. Dogma is a party-style card game simulating the back-and-forth dialogue between roleplayers and the game master in an RPG session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a team of heroes from the available line-up, then receives six quest cards and a number of play cards that signify dice numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns, players ask an opponent for a quest; that player unveils one of his quests, then the asking player tries to solve the quest by rolling as many dice as he has heroes, activating their abilities to generate resources such as &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;thievery&amp;quot; and so on. Each quest has its own clear requirements, and if the player manages to generate the correct resources, he gains the victory points the quest generates; if not, these points go to the quest owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the dice roll, players can adjust the values of the dice by playing cards from their hands, either elevating, lowering or re-rolling the dice rolled. After this is done, the dice are applied to the lineup of heroes, activating different abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
