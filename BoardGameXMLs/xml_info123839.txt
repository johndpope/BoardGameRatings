							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1066: Year of the Comet</name>
									
			<description>The appearance in the sky of the Great Comet (Halley's) foretells much bloodshed; battles will ravage the land when three kings lay claim to the throne of England!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1066 - Year of the Comet is a block wargame covering the crucial campaigning months of 1066, the year Britain was invaded twice, first by the Vikings and later by the Normans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map covers all of England proper. The Viking player invades  the eastern shores, while the Normans invade from the south. Favorable winds for one invader means the other must stay in port. Once ashore, invaders are faced with the prospect of fighting pitched battles or a guerrilla style campaign, depending on the English player's response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a strategic level treatment. All of the 1066 campaigning season is represented. As such, the battles of Stamford Bridge and Hastings will not necessarily occur. It is up to the players to determine when, where, and how they fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a low complexity, three player wargame playable in an hour or two. Contains rules, map, battle board, and 56 blocks in three colors. Rules include invasions, mustering Fyrdmen, pitched battles, skirmishes, routs, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salient features include: buckets o' dice combat resolution, a battle board, a relatively small number of blocks... and no cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is provided &amp;quot;as is.&amp;quot; Although the designer has enjoyed many plays of 1066, the game has not been through a blind playtest. In a sense, this is the blind playtest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any problems with the game should be noted in the General forum, but the designer makes no guarantee that they will be addressed. Players should feel free to explore patches, and if they find something that works, please mention the fix in the appropriate thread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
