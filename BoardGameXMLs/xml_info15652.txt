			<description>This is a simple card game themed on the animated character Strawberry Shortcake. The cards (25 recipe and 10 Purple Pieman) are shuffled and dealt into 3 stacks in the middle of the table. On your turn, you draw a card from any stack and place it face up in front of you. If it's a Recipe card, you may either keep it by turning it face down, or you may continue drawing until you either decide to stop, or draw a Purple Pieman card. If you draw a Purple Pieman, you lose any face up recipe cards you have in front of you. The game ends when there are no more cards to draw. The player with the most Recipe cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
