							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chancer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are gamblers of all kinds across the many worlds, but a Chancer is something different. Lady Luck is not a god, she is something more and less, though she is embodied by and in many gods. Sometimes she reaches out and touches people with her blessing. For every unlucky person whose life is one of ruin and endless misfortune, there are others with blessed and lucky lives, raised or damned by her fickle favour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chancers are gamblers who have been touched by The Lady. Their abilities can be random and unpredictable, but their luck, itself, is predictable. Things tend to go right for them, not always, but often enough to make them, and those around them, supernaturally fortunate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also contains gambling rules, magic items and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having a Chancer in your party can easily mean the difference between success and failure and if you&amp;rsquo;re relying on luck, they&amp;rsquo;re essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chancers are assets, making things easier not just for themselves but for everyone around them. The randomness of some of their special abilities can disrupt and disorder an otherwise ordered battlefield, usually to your benefit, sometimes to your detriment. They&amp;rsquo;re good in social situations and can raise money quickly, since they&amp;rsquo;re far more likely to win games of chance or bluff than anyone else. The trouble with that of course is that it makes enemies who don&amp;rsquo;t like being cheated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifth Fantasy is intended to be a short series of alternative character classes, which are supposed to emulate the kinds of characters and roles found in classic JRPG and Anime games. As such they are most suited to high-magic games, and games which play up to the style of anime, manga and Japanese computer games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No world is explicitly described, but the character class books will also contain magical items and some background material that will build an implicit setting - which may be detailed in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
