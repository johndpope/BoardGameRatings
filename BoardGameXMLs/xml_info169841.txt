			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Pok&amp;eacute;mon Tabletop United, a pen and paper roleplaying game where players play the role of trainers in the world of Pok&amp;eacute;mon. It is best played with a group of 2-4 players creating Player Characters, or PCs, to act as their avatars in a game world created by their Game Master, or GM. We&amp;rsquo;re going to presume if you&amp;rsquo;ve found us that you&amp;rsquo;re probably familiar with most tabletop roleplaying terminology or have at your disposal someone who can quickly explain the basics to you! Pok&amp;eacute;mon Tabletop United is designed to handle a variety of different ideas for Pok&amp;eacute;mon tabletop RPG campaigns. You can use the system for a traditional game where the players take the role of young Trainers receiving their first Pok&amp;eacute;mon from a Professor as they prepare to leave town for the first time and conquer the Pok&amp;eacute;mon League. Or you could play a campaign about Pok&amp;eacute;mon in Space or a Wild West frontier exploration game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
