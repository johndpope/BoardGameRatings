							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS Maxim Gorki II: The Siege of Sevastopol 1942</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATS MAXIM GORKI is from prolific designer Mark 'Tank' Porterfield. Mark brought you the fruits of his massive military library and penchant for research with Panther Line + Berlin 1 and Berlin 2 (not to mention the Monster Berlin versions), all set on World War II's Eastern Front. Before that, almost 20 years ago Tank brought you Pointe du Hoc, with a healthy on-site assist from Steve and Rob Pleva, plus map work (and on site research too) by Phil Nobo. The TANK is back and this time he is modeling another uniiqe Festung, the Sevastopol bastion of Stalin's Soviet Union and this is a MONSTER MODULE to do his work justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the interesting details you'll receive: Russian Naval Infantry, German demolition AFVs including Kettenkrad and Bren Carrier Demo vehicles; massive Naval Gun Turrets; Concrete Trenches; German Engineers, Fortress rules; and so much more. Plus a large map with healthy-sized hexes, more terrain variants, all using official ATS nomenclature for the SSRs while avoiding 5 point type and eye-watering verbiage bloat in what will be the largest Engineer-operation ever gamed at this scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
