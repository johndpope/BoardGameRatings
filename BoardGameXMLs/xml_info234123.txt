			<description>There are many things buried in the sands of the new Old West, just waiting to be discovered and claimed. But the sandstorms are coming; they always come. They have long since swallowed the city, and no matter how much you uncover, they will continue their malicious barrage. They strike fast and without warning, unless you have the right equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As prospectors in Lost Vegas, you seek to dig up what the desert has reclaimed. You can move from location to location collecting money and valuable artifacts. Barricade your locations from the storms, or you'll find yourself having to uncover what you've already worked to find &amp;mdash; or get ahead of the game and use your radar to see where the next storm is coming from. After the storms have passed, the prospector who has the most money and treasure (points) from the locations they occupy wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
