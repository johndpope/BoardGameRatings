			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Good Graphic Simulation of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a disk orientated program written in Basic with a machine language subroutine. It follows the real game quite closely. As supplied it has 17 holes, with provision to construct different or additional holes as required. Each hole is played on a map of the course with symbols indicating the features associated with each hole. Up to four players may take part at the same time. Strokes are made by indicating the club and the angle of the stroke required. Eleven clubs are provided, divided into woods, six irons and three wedges. Course terrain and weather information is continually available. Provision is made for penalty strokes, wind consideration and the inevitable water hole. Each hole is selected randomly by the computer, you may only play each hole once in a round. We found this to be an enjoyable game requiring a high component of skill. Overall, we felt that the author of GOLF has been successful in balancing the inevitable restrictions of a computer game with the live enjoyment of an actual game of golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
