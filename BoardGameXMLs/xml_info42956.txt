			<description>The game consists of six dice and a kind of plate on which they can be placed. The goal is to reach either a very high or a very low number or five-in-a-row. The sixth die is a risk-die with which one can determine whether the result is multiplied by a high, low, or negative number. Rolling is resolved in a classic way, first one rolls all dice, then puts out at least one of them and rerolls the rest (up to five times all in all). The first player to reach 100 points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
