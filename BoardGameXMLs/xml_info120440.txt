							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ape Quest</name>
									
			<description>Ape Quest (also known as Sarugetchu: Piposaru Senki in Japan) is a role-playing video game spinoff from the Ape Escape series by SCEA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of the prince and travels across various areas, meeting Ape Team members, fighting monsters, earning Chips (the game's currency) and carrying out quests. The player must choose from predetermined routes consisting of turns, in the way of a board game. The player traverses across these routes, but once chosen, the player cannot move or stop. On each turn, the player can open the menu, which allows the player to save, equip items and perform other actions (this can be done at the end of each route as well). Turn-based battles and minigames can also occur randomly. Battles rely on the equipment used and strength. Minigames, on the other hand, are entirely based on skill (these can deduct hit points, or &amp;quot;Guts,&amp;quot; as well). The player can also visit towns and dungeons as well as members of the Ape Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ape Quest&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
