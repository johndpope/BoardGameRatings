			<description>Pawns Crossing is an abstract game that combines a requirement for tactical skill with a modest luck element. Players race to move tokens to their destinations over a tile and domino board. The game incorporates three separate movement mechanics which players must choose between at the beginning of each turn: a) Tokens move along the surfaces of dominoes and tiles, b) pawns move between holes that exist in the board at domino intersections, c) The rows and columns of the board shift. A complete game typically takes 20-40 minutes. The game may be enjoyed by two to four players but a 2-player game feels different from a 4-player game. As with many multi-player abstracts, the 2-player version is more strategic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires a piecepack and a set of double six dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
