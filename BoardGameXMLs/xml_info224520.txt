							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Talislanta: The Savage Land</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talislanta: the Savage Land is a prequel to the original Talislanta setting. It takes place just a short time after the Great Disaster, which the inhabitants of this era refer to as the Fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talislanta: the Savage Land is a game of survival in a hostile world ravaged by centuries of sorcerous warfare and a terrible disaster. This period is like a nightmarish version of the Dark Ages. There are no nations, no laws, and no civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead, tribes of warriors, nomads, slavers, and refugees struggle to survive in a hostile wasteland torn by incessant warfare and a chaotic magical maelstrom known as the Gyre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inhabitants of this age are mostly illiterate and ruled by superstition. Maps are nearly non-existent and much of the world is now unknown. All knowledge of spell-casting has been lost. Though tribal shamans still practice a handful of primitive rituals, their abilities pale beside those of the old Archaen sorcerers, whose potent magical artifacts can still be found among the ruins of past civilizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current rulers of the Savage Land are tribes of warriors, hunters, nomadic traders, and the remnants of peoples displaced by the Fall. They fight, forge alliances, barter or steal. Some seek to recover what was lost and one day build a new civilization. Others want only to pillage, enslave, and destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is the way of things in Talislanta, the Savage Land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
