							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pinky</name>
									
			<description>I'll seek some clarification on this, but here is what I can glean at present:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pinky is a large pink plastic pig that looks like a traditional piggy bank.  Set in Pinky's back is a slot which has a switch and a speaker, so that the game counts when players put in coins and occasionally &amp;quot;oinks&amp;quot;.  It seems from the rules that players are putting coins in Pinky from a communal stock, but on a certain die-roll get to shake the pig to get coins back out; the coins that come out are a player's score pile for the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
