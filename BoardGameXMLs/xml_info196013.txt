			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She flies on wings of pure spite&amp;hellip; Blackwing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 11 Rogue, Blackwing is empowered with a mysterious force that propels her through the air at hypersonic speeds! Blackwing is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackwing&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;quot;Gold&amp;quot; to indicate her powers are the result of genetic manipulation. A lifetime of aggressive competition led Blackwing to a fateful decision, a decision to be transformed into something more than human. She is master of a strange psionic field manifesting as a flaming black aura which increases her own vitality at the cost of her victims. Unable to accept even an unknowing rival, Blackwing will seek out those who seem faster than her and holds grudges against anyone who defeats her. She never forgives, and never forgets. Will your heroes be quick enough to take her down?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
