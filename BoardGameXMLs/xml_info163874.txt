							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Secret Treasure of Raguoc in the Acirema Dungeons - Player&#039;s Book</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This is the players book for Acirema containing rules of the RPG and only a little background information on the fantasy world where Acirema mountain is situated. The book also contains a short solitaire adventure to get to know the RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book and the gamemaster's book were published for free PDF distribution on the Obscure RPG Appreciation Day 2014 with a permission from the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Prologue:&lt;br/&gt;This roleplaying game is partially based on first game of the same name. However, this game is different enough that the rules and tables of this manual cannot be used when playing the first Acirema. It is advisable to learn all of the new rules and continue playing with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended number of players: 2-7 persons&lt;br/&gt;Average game time: 2-4 hours&lt;br/&gt;You also need paper, pens, rulebooks, 12-sided die etc. to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We do not take responsibility for damage caused to themselves or others by players who immerse too deeply into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
