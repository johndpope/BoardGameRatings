			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle For Manhattan: Boardroom Backstabs 3 (Adventure)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO: Willing recruits&lt;br/&gt;FROM: The people who can pay you&lt;br/&gt; Come to Manhattan. We will pay.&lt;br/&gt; We won&amp;rsquo;t bother with appeals to patriotism, or to your best instincts, or to anything the least bit noble. Come to Manhattan because there is a fight breaking out. Fighting is what you are paid for. Fighting is what you were born for. Come because there is money to be made.&lt;br/&gt; You don&amp;rsquo;t need to pick a side. Sides shift, sides change. In the end, the only consistent thing is that you are the only one you can count on. You fight for yourself. That is something you should be used to. That is how you live.&lt;br/&gt; Come to Manhattan because the corporations are spoiling for a fight. Most of the time, we&amp;rsquo;re good at keeping our spats clean and civilized. We lie, we cheat, we steal, but we do not engage in anything as vulgar as open street fighting. Sometimes, though, we can&amp;rsquo;t help ourselves. Sometimes, the tension gets to be too much, and it breaks, and it bursts into the open.&lt;br/&gt; That time is coming.&lt;br/&gt; Bring your skills, bring your wits, and definitely bring your guns. You&amp;rsquo;ll need everything you got. We are anxious to take advantage of what you have.&lt;br/&gt; Come to Manhattan. We&amp;rsquo;re waiting for you.&lt;br/&gt; The Battle of Manhattan is the third in the Boardroom Backstabs series of adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More publisher blurp:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition; offers the character statistics, setting information, and plot points needed for gamemasters to take players on the third in a series of adventures that develops one of the classic Shadowrun themes&amp;mdash;corporate machinations and double-crosses. This adventure presents both danger and opportunity to the player characters as corporate intrigue spills into open fighting in the streets of Manhattan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selling Points:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Brings runners to Manhattan and involves them in ever-increasing corporate tensions that threaten to erupt into violence.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Puts the runners in situations that will test the limits of their abilities, including a daring mid-air extraction.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Ratchets up the tension of the first two adventures in the series and tests the runners&amp;rsquo; ability to succeed in a hostile setting.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Builds on plotlines, characters, and situations covered in previous books such as Corporate Guide and the Missions living campaign while developing plotlines that will be expanded on in future books.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Can be played alone or as the start of the Boardroom Backstabs series, which will have ramifications in the ongoing Shadowrun plotline.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Provides complete non-player character statistics, player handouts, and all other information needed to let players dive into the adventure immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latest publisher blurp:&lt;br/&gt;Come to Manhattan.
