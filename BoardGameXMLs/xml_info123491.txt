			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zahia as sports minister? Igor and Grichka for culture? Karl in the foreign office? Genevi&amp;egrave;ve as home secretary?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you are head of state and must form a government made up solely of the right people. Make the right decisions as there are 42 candidates and you have to choose the most competent for each of the six ministries. Your goal is to make your popularity increase faster than that of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Si J'&amp;eacute;tais Pr&amp;eacute;sident... (If I Were President...) is a simple, fun game with six game modes posing various types of challenges: shuffling cabinets, cracking the whip, enduring hung parliaments, etc. Let loose with your choices and the whole country will soon be head over heels in love with you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
