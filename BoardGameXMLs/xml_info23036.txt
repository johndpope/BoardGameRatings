							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Ground</name>
									
			<description>High Ground is a hex-based expansion for Risk that takes place on a particular battlefield of the American Civil War. At the beginning of the game, each player gets to place 3 cities and 3 hills on the board secretly. The cities are not only the recruitment centers where new troops enter the board, but they also are the means of generating troops. The more cities you own, the more troops you receive each turn. The hills provide defensive bonuses and range increases for artillery. Four hills come preprinted in the rear of the battle field. &lt;br/&gt;This game includes a 17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; hex map, 6 City hexes, 6 Hill hexes, 8 Flag hexes, and a set of rules.  Playing pieces are not included - the newer pieces from Risk (infantry, cavalry, and cannons) are required for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
