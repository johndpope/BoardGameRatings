			<description>Consists of a large plastic playmat with railway tracks printed on it. A die is rolled to move a player's engine along the tracks, aiming to stop at a station to pick up passengers and transport them to the end. Short-cuts are possible and there are some spaces which lose passengers or have other effects. Passengers are picked up in the form of cards which have a variable number of points so it is not known who is winning until the end. There is a bonus for the first player to reach the final station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copyright is held by Britt Allcroft, the company with the rights to the Thomas the Tank Engine trademark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
