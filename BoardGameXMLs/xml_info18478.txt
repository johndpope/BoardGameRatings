			<description>An Ahoy series game, published in England. The general idea of the game is to pick up and deliver as much cargo as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the capital gained you buy more harbour facilities, thereby collecting greater harbour dues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player having most capital, which includes face value of the port cards held, value of cargo and cash in hand at the end of the game is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any time during the game a player loses his ship, he may re-purchase it for 10,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This may entail selling some of his ports, which can be done by auctioning them among the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If he is unable to raise the necessary capital, he retires from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 x Game Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 x Playing Pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 x Plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money in Four Denominations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 x Pack of Met Report Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 x Pack of Owners Signal Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 x Pack of Lloyds Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 x Pack of Port Cards (or chips)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bullion Cards (or chips)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cargo Cards (or chips)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 x Dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 x Set of Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
