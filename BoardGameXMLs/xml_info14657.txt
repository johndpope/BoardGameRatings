			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;Travel across Canada and the United States from East to West.  Follow the traffic rules all the way... Have a good time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rather simple game using where players race across North America from the east coast (starting at St. John's, Sydney, Charlottetown, or Yarmouth) and ending at the west coast (Prince Rupert, Vancouver, San Francisco, or Los Angeles).  As players travel, they make choices as to which path to take.  Green stops on the path affect the players (Engine overheats, miss a turn&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Finish at this San Francisco&amp;quot;.  Players may not pass another player on a route unless a player is stopped on a Red (actually Orange on the board) stop which represents a major city, or a player has been penalized by a green stop.  The first player to the west coast wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include a foldable gameboard with a map of North America on one side marked with the various routes and stop points, 4 pawns, two dice, and a single rule page that includes both English and French instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
