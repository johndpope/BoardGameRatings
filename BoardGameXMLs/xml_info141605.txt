			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Book of Rings to Rule Them All&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rings are supposed to be one of the most exciting, special, and downright magical of all the magic items that adventurers can get their hands on. Somewhere along the line however, it seems like they&amp;rsquo;ve mostly wound up in two categories: overpriced novelties that no one ever bothers to pick up, and boring, straight-forward utilitarian items, like a ring of protection +1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With The Ebon Vault: The Power of Rings, we aim to give rings the same kind of treatment that The Ebon Vault series has already provided for staves, orbs, swords, and armor, making a variety of new and exciting rings with fun and interesting powers, while also aiming to make rings more affordable and accessible at a variety of levels. With over 50 new types of magic rings, as well as six new intelligent rings with fully-fleshed out personalities, backgrounds, physical descriptions, and unique powers, there will be a ring in here for everyone. Beyond that, though, there are 20 multi-purpose physical descriptions for rings of any type, which can easily be used to add a little flavor to something as hum-drum as a ring of sustenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So whether you&amp;rsquo;re bored of existing rings and want something new, or are just looking for a few more options when outfitting your latest character, or even if you&amp;rsquo;re a GM who wants to make the next treasure hoard contain something really memorable, this book has something for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
