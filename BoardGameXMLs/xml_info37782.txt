			<description>&amp;quot;Spanish American War 1898. Card Game for 2 players. One player gets the American deck. The other player gets the Spanish deck.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a unique deck of 32 cards. There are seven types of cards in each deck: Infantry Units, Artillery, Leaders, Morale, Equipment, Terrain, and Special. Each card is rated with a force value from 0 to 5. The cards represent elements of the historical campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts for eight hands. Each hand the players are trying to play cards having a higher total force value. The object is to be the player who wins the most hands. &amp;quot;If both win 4 hands, the game is a draw, and history unfolds as in the books. If The Americans win 5+ hands, then they take the hill with fewer casualties. If the Spanish win 5+ hands, the Americans suffer a military disaster &amp;amp; retreat.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
