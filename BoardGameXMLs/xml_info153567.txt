							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zingo! Word Builder</name>
									
			<description>Zingo! Word Builder works like other Zingo! titles from ThinkFun in that it has a chunky plastic device that spits out two tiles at a time for players to use. In this game, players try to use the letters on the tiles to complete the three-letter words on their individual cards. Fill your board first, and you win. The game includes two levels of play to support both beginner and more experienced readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
