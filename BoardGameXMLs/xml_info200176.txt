							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New York World&#039;s Fair Children&#039;s Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This very simple children's card game was published as a souvenir sold at the 1964/65 World's Fair in New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 36-card deck features photographs of some of the fair's pavilions and exhibits. Players deal out the deck face down on the table and take turns turning over two cards. Cards that match are captured; those that don't are turned face down again. Winner is the player to capture the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
