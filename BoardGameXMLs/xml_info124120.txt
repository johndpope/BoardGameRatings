			<description>&amp;quot;SparkSeed, the powerful source of energy we human being once had, was all missing, with just a spark left now. To find back the power we lost, you need to rejoin with your missed part lost in the new planet. By controlling the red energy ball, the missing energy blue ball will move in a different direction. Balance these two energy balls to collide them, meanwhile paying attention to lasers, springs, delivery gates, and props including intriguing floats and stings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One would probably admit that controlling one bouncing ball in the air is not easy, yet it is even more difficult to balance two balls simultaneously that are moving in exactly two opposite directions! At such moments when these bouncing balls pass each other, will your brain get stuck? This game presents an ultimate challenge to coordination between the right and the left hemispheres of your brain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights of Rejoin:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 30 challenging and varied levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Physics based platforming action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; You can personalize or customize the way of collecting stars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Challenge of coordination between the right and the left hemispheres of your brain!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
