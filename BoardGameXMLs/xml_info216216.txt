							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninja All-Stars: Clan Ijin</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clan Ijin is a clan expansion for Ninja All-Stars which contains enough miniatures to build a complete Ijin-themed team. Clan boxes feature dynamic and unique sculpts for players&amp;rsquo; favorite teams. They also introduce two powerful new troop types to players&amp;rsquo; existing collections: large-sized Oni and a fearsome clan Hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clan Ijin value strength above all else.  Composed of leaders who won their positions in hard fought battles of martial prowess, all in Clan Ijin are intense, fierce, and even a bit intolerable of others. This reputation precedes them, as many clans refuse to to travel to their lands out of fear of attack or imprisonment. While the Ijin can be cruel and rancorous, outsiders that can match their mettle with the might of their clan earn the respect of all and are granted the privilege to treat and trade with the clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
