			<description>A game published with the support of the Government of the City of M&amp;uuml;nster, Germany, with the aim of learning about the city. During the game, players have the opportunity to learn about some historical and touristic aspects of the city and its shops. On each turn a six-sided dice is rolled to determine how many spaces the player&amp;rsquo;s pawn may move along a game-board depicting a simplified map of M&amp;uuml;nster. At certain spaces, cards of the shops can be acquired or the player can go sightseeing by following the instructions written on the back of a card. Such instructions can be only a mere historical/touristic information, sometimes you need to pay or you may earn some money. The game ends when the last player reaches the final space and the winner is who has acquired the most sightseeing and/or shop cards.&lt;br/&gt;Since the game idea was developed by an advertisement agency, other German cities were focused in other similar games (for example, the game related to the city of Paderborn can be found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/25735&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/25735&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
