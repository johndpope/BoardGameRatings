			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HERESY! Brothers, we are concerned with the growing influence and power of heretics - these so called mystic warriors. The common folk hold them as saints and heroes. Our very church has been infested with a number of these corrupt individuals. Do not think for a moment that these abominations are not dangerous to our very foundation. They dare to tap into their own souls for power, rather than look to the gods. Their schools are spreading like a plague. We must root these treacherous villains out and show them to the world for what they really are, HERETICS!&lt;br/&gt; Brother Cristoff d'Angiou&lt;br/&gt;Sermon to the Faithful, All Father Festival&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunted and feared by the Pantheon. Praised and revered by the commoners. In the world of Gothos, there are hidden sects and secret schools where the most powerful arts of war are learned and perfected. Great masters have studied the most ancient ways of fighting, passed down through the ages, and tied it the most powerful source of energy, the very spirit and soul of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this d20 supplement book, twenty schools of Mystic Warriors are presented, each with its own unique history and abilities. These special prestige classes can easily be adapted to any campaign setting as well as the schools of the Mystic Warriors themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
