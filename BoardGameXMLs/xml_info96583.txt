							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Behind the 8 Ball</name>
									
			<description>Finally a game of Pool that fits in your pocket and won&amp;rsquo;t damage your rec room walls &amp;hellip; If you play it right &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind the 8 Ball is a simulation of Pool played with a standard deck of Cards. Players make shots by pairing up two cards from their hand (by adding or subtracting) to come up with a value matching one of the Pool Balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of the shots that miss (don't match a ball still on the table) are carried over to the opponent and must be added to their next shot.Thus it is possible, even in missing to put your opponent in a bad position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for making trick shots, scratches, and incorporating rebounds into your shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
