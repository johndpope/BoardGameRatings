			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to play as your favorite monster in Pathfinder, but could not due to unbalanced abilities, the campaign being too low level, or worried that every town guardsman would attack you on sight?  Did you ever wish that the more iconic monsters had more interesting societies than primitive &amp;ldquo;kill or be killed&amp;rdquo; social orders?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Playable Monsters Vol. 1: Fantasy Iconics &amp;amp; Mythology has what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for!
