			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dawning years of the last wars, back before anyone knew that these conflicts would destroy human civilization, the Explorer-class ship NFH Bulbar left the solar system. Its mission was to investigate Tunnicliffe, a rogue neutron star that was travelling past Sol. To accomplish this trick, it was equipped with an experimental star drive which would allow it to break the light barrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NFH Bulbar was escorted to Saturn&amp;rsquo;s orbit, activated its drive, and streaked into the inky-black cosmos. The groundbreaking technology of the star drive promised to bring the ship back in three short months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The star drive did not deliver on said promise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two weeks ago, however, a new point of light appeared outside the orbit of Saturn. NFH Bulbar is terribly late, but it has finally arrived. Of course, it finds a solar system drastically changed, teetering on the brink of starvation and civilization-wide collapse. And as one might expect, not all is well on board, either&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NFH Bulbar is a level five derelict written for five players. As with any other derelict, the level is trivial to shift up or down. To make a derelict a higher level, add dice and squares to damage tracks; to lower the level, remove them. Exactly how many to add or remove can be found in the NPC R&amp;uuml;l in R&amp;uuml;ls of the Void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
