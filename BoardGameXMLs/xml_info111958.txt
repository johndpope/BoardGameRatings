			<description>Drawn to Life: SpongeBob SquarePants Edition is a video game for the Nintendo DS. It is a spin-off of 5th Cell's 2007 DS hit Drawn to Life, and is based on the Nickelodeon animated comedy series SpongeBob SquarePants, specifically the episode &amp;quot;Frankendoodle&amp;quot;. The game was developed by a Japanese game company, Altron and published by Play THQ. The game was released in North America on September 15, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the game, the player creates their own character and populates the world of Bikini Bottom. Players can also create their own customisable home in Bikini Bottom. The player has the ability to modify enemies and turn them into friends or allies, after stunning them. The game features a two-player VS. mode. There are over 20 levels in total. Unlike the original game's bosses, the hero now needs to stun the boss and wipe the boss' shadow goo with the stylus to inflict damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Drawn to Life: SpongeBob SquarePants Edition&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
