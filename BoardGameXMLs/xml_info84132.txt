			<description>This 4-dimensional chess variant, using the standard 16 chesspieces and pawns, is played on a 4x4x4x4 board. (A printable 2D version of the board is provided, with coordinate numbers in each square.) This printable gameboard is laid out as a 4x4 arrangement of 16 &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot;, each level being a 4x4 2D chessboard. Alternatively, 4 3D 4x4x4 gameboards set up in a row are usable. The game is available on Zillions, in a version by L Lynn Smith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piece moves are translated as directly as possible from 2D to 4D, with some adaptations for play balance. So a rook now can move not only north-south and east-west, but up-down and side to side, too, for a maximum of 8 possible directions. Bishops move diagonally within each level, and may also move diagonally from level to level, which simplifies the move somewhat, changing the bishop from a fully 4D piece to one that is 2D+2D. This change makes the game much easier to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knight, on the other hand, rivals the queen in power, because it is the only piece in chess that already moves in 2 dimensions. On a 4x4x4x4 board, it can reach up to 2 dozen spots. The queen combines the moves of rook and bishop, and the king is a one-square queen in movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pawns are the most changed, moving 1 square &amp;quot;forward&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;sideways&amp;quot; - 6 locations in all, and capturing as it moves. This allows 2 pawns to support each other, a useful feature on &lt;br/&gt;a 4D board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by checkmate, which with the held king rule, can be achieved in the standard fashion, or it can be forced on a bare king by a king and 2 major pieces, from any legal positions on the board. The held king rule allows a king moving onto the other king's current &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; to pin the enemy king in that level. This solves a major problem in higher dimensional chess, that of mating the opponent on a 4D board, which has so many ways to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
