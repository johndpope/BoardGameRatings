			<description>Get rid of your cards by finding words that start with the same letter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two teams of players face each other and play at the same time. Players must place cards like dominoes. Each card has 4 drawings. A card can be placed next to another, provided that the 2 drawings that face each other correspond to words that start with the same letter. For example, a tractor next to a television: &amp;quot;tractor - television!&amp;quot; The first team to have played all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
