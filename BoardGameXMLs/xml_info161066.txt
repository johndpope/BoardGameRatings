			<description>Over 40,000 sold. Published in Shanghai, in Chinese, with English names and slogans as an added-on educational element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Car racing game using cards. Three different games using the same cards: a two player card 'duel', lasting 10-30 minutes; a 2-10 player moving-around-the-track game for younger players; and a combo of the two, a 2-10 player moving-around-the-track game using the cards to interact with the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backs of the cards represent a straight section of track. Fronts: left and right wide and left and right tight curves, an S-curve, a finish line, a dry/wet tire card, a sun/rain weather card, a thick perforated card with 5 two-sided cars, and 45 playing cards, in 26 types and 4 different colours representing maneuvers, special ations and anti-card actions. Also included is a handy 14-page full-colour fold-out booklet with all the rules, illustrated examples and a list of the game components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the accompanying website (now defunct) the games could be played substituting pictured cards for the real ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
