			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is locked in a huge mansion filled with deadly traps. To escape, he must find the keys to unlock all the chests in the house while avoiding starvation by finding food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of going back and forth between rooms looking for keys, food and ways to dodge each of the many clever traps. The game features dozens of ways to die (starved, impaled, burned alive, cut in half by a laser, crushed by gigantic cogs...), all shown on-screen with graphic details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Amstrad CPC port was the second game developed by Eric Chahi for Loriciels. The music was written by Michel Winogradof, a member of Le &amp;quot;grand orchestre du Splendid&amp;quot; (famous French 1980s band).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
