			<description>Funstir, an expansion for Frigiti, plays much like the base game: In a round, the active player rolls all ten dice &amp;ndash; seven of which have consonants on all sides, and three of which have only vowels &amp;ndash; then creates a word by using at least three dice. (This word cannot be real, and if anyone claims it is, reroll the dice and try again.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Funstir adds to the game are marketing slogans, and players are now trying to create brand names to match those slogans, along with an explanatory phrase. Once players read off their phrases, everyone will then each distribute three tokens to the answers they thought best, with one of those tokens going to the player's own answer. (This self-congratulatory vote aids in the scorekeeping process.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each person has been the active player once, the game ends and the player with the most tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
