							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wolves of Oxenfjord</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small town of Oxenfjord, has been having trouble with a local pack of wolves. Normally the wolves just kill a few livestock, and the farmers go and hunt down a wolf or two, and go back to life as usual. However, recently the wolves have been far greater in number and have become far more aggressive in their nature. Where before, it was just the occasional lamb or young calf, now packs of wolves have been taking down larger livestock, and even attacking farmers and their stable hands. Due to this threat to the lives and lively hood of the denizens of Oxenfjord, the local leader of the Cattlemen's guild, Reisig Duncanson has put out a bounty on wolves. Reisig is offering a 2gp reward per wolf pelt brought to him, as payment for helping the community of Oxenfjord with their wolf dilemma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
