			<description>LINE OF BATTLE: Tactical Capital Ship Combat, 1912 through 1924. A Tactical Study&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Fisher started it all when, in December of 1905, he approved the laying of the keel of Dreadnought, the first of a type of line of battle ship that would make everything built before it obsolete and whose concept would dominate the big gun ships of major navies for the next 40 years. By the eve of the Great War full fleets of these vessels faced each other across the narrow European seas, ready to fight for domination of the open ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an integrated combat system the game covers shell strengths, immune zones, armor placement, gun ranges, and angle of incoming shot without resort to complicated calculations. Detailed rules on movement, command, and other vital factors complete the game. 400 unit counters are included to cover every European, American, &amp;amp; Japanese dreadnought of the period.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios include Dogger Bank, Jutland, and hypothetical battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Line of Battle (second edition)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
