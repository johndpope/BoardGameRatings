			<description>Strike Price: The Options Trading Strategy Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rule book: &amp;quot;The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player. Players try to increase their wealth by buying and selling stock, puts and calls in response to various events, tips, and other players' activities&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three versions of the game - the Basic Game, the Advanced Game and the Advanced Game with Optional Rules. The Basic game includes put, call and stock purchasing. The Advanced Game adds borrowing, short selling, and the writing of option contracts. The Optional Rules are available for those players wishing to add even more realism at the expense of playability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
