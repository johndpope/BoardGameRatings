			<description>From the Inlay (ZX Spectrum Mastertronic Release):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stranded in the middle of the jungle after a terrible plane crash, your child has been stolen by a tribe of Amazon Warriors, who want to raise her as one of their own. You must fight your way through the jungle past Amazons armed with clubs, swords and axes avoiding the many arrows, in order to rescue your daughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You [sic] goal is to fight your way through the ten zones and rescue the stolen child. The Amazons will do their best to stop you. They will fight you one at a time, though they constantly fire arrows at you which you need to avoid by jumping or ducking. As you progress through the game the Amazons will get more intelligent and harder to defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a limited time to complete each zone, if you fail to reach the end of the zone before your time runs out you lose a life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend of the Amazon Women was originally released by SilverTime Inc and later distibuted in Europe by U.S. Gold. It was written by Simon Ffinch, Daniel Lucas and Ed Ringler (the ZX Spectrum edition attributed to Simon Ffinch alone).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
