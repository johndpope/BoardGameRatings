			<description>One in a series of &amp;quot;Little Raven&amp;quot; games published by Klee - WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS LITTLE RAVEN? is a children's game for 4-12 year olds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comprises 48 tiles representing pictures of the little raven and his friends. They can be put together in sets to form complete pictures in series of 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 tiles - the series to which a tile belongs being indicated by a number shown on the tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to draw two tiles one of which must be drawn from a face down pool on the table and the other either from the pool or from another player (with various rules describing what may or may not be taken).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to put these pieces together to form as many complete sets of pictures as possible. The player who, once all the pictures have been completed, has used the greatest number of tiles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
