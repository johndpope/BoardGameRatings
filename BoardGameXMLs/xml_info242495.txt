							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tournament of Daolu</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortune and Death Await in Daolu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daolu is a city where corrupt officials and crime lords rule. Deep in the heart of the Empire, Martial Heroes come at great risk to test their mettle and gain glory at Daolu&amp;rsquo;s tournament platform and in its gritty streets. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s secret police can pounce from every shadow, but the prize is the much-coveted Chariot of Du Qian, and it is well worth the danger. The city abounds with opportunity as well. Some come here to make their fortune; others die in a pool of their own blood. If you have the cunning and strength, it is possible to rise high in Daolu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tournament of Daolu is an adventure and setting supplement for Wandering Heroes of Ogre Gate. Inside is a complete description of the city, a time-bending scenario through the chronicles of history, and many more opportunities for adventure. Also included are two maps of the city of Daolu: one from the present era and one from its dark past during the reign of the Demon Emperor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
