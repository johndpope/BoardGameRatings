			<description>Draughts for 3 players, as recorded in the files of the British Museum in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 10 pieces. Each player starts from one of the flat sides of the triangular board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can capture pieces from both of his two opponents and this is carried out as in normal Draughts (the rules do not say that jumping can only be in one direction, i.e. you cannot jump a piece by doing a move rather like a knight in Chess). Each piece can be moved in three directions, straight ahead, or to the right of 'straight ahead' or to the left of 'straight ahead'. Crowned pieces can be moved in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces can be 'crowned' by reaching the back starting row of his opponents. This is precarious because at either end of your side of the board, your opponents' back row is only five hexes away from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over if there is only one player left or if two players are so hemmed in that they cannot move any more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
