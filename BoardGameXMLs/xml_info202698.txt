			<description>DOC models the initial alien of Earth set in Southern California in the mid-20th century.  The mission of the alien player is, of course, to seize control of Earth.

The defenders organizations are based on period tables of organization and equipment and include the 1st Marine Regiment, Combat Command &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; of the 40th Armored Division, California Army National Guard, and the 153rd Regimental Combat Team, Arkansas Army National Guard as well as the unorganized militia of the United States.  The Aliens consist of up to 9 powerful Alien Fighting Machines equipped with directed energy weapons and defensive shields.&lt;br/&gt;Can the humans discover the alien weaknesses and mass enough forces to prevent the enemy&amp;rsquo;s domination of Earth? &lt;br/&gt;There are seven scenarios, covering the independent assault of the enemy landing craft, a campaign covering the first critical 72 hours, an attack of a full strength Alien unit, and defense against a Human Counterattack.&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 2 counter sheets, 4 11 x 17 maps depicting the terrain around Corona, CA in the mid-1950s, 6 player aid cards, a rules book, and Human and Alien Operations Orders (as shown below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
