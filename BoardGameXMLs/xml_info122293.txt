			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a new collectible RPG in a Golden Age Superheroes vein: to play, you just need any set of the playbooks, with at least one per player. Each playbook gives you a pre-made character and all the rules needed to play them or to run the game for others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive story: the Secret Origin of...The Seraph!&lt;br/&gt;Aaron Anderson, professor of Archaeology, began his amazing double life the day he unearthed a mysterious sword in a medieval tomb! Blessed with ancient divine powers, it became his burden, charging him with the duty to defend the weak and show mercy to all mankind! With the sword in his hand, he becomes the Seraph, Winged Wonder of the World!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
