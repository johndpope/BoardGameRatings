			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paradise Caf&amp;eacute; was the first and only Portuguese game for the ZX Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an adult game in which the player would interact with different characters, from the corner prostitute, to her pimp and police. If you manage to work your way around you would earn money to spend, and if you overspent you could count that eventually a big guy named Reinaldo would interact with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
