			<description>Predestination is a 2 player cooperative trick-taking cardgame.  It is a companion game to the 2 player competitive trick-taking cardgame Foreknowledge, with both being inspired by Romans 8 in the Bible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the dealer player will be dealt a set of cards from the deck and then allocate the cards between themselves and the non-dealer player.  The dealer then arranges the cards in order they will play them, and play proceeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object for the round is to make exactly the number of tricks that was revealed at the start of the round.  Play continues a set number of rounds, with each round consisting of a different number of tricks that need to be won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced version, additional rules are added and change each round, to mix things up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
