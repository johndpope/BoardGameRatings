			<description>Two to four (or more) players represent one of ten world civilizations (Middle East, North Africa, India, China, Meso America, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each civilization is rated for ten attributes (Conquest, Trade, Culture, Science, Agriculture, Religion, Sea, Government, Equestrian, and Engineering). The value of each attribute is randomly determined by rolling a die at the start of the game, with each civilization receiving a second cumulative die roll for a specified attribute in which that civilization excelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay involves drawing and trading cards in order to play melds. Playing a meld adds to a player's victory point total and increases the value of an attribute of the player's civilization. Playing a meld also conveys a specific bonus (such as stealing cards or victory points from other players) depending on the type of meld played. The winner is the player with the most victory points after twelve rounds have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free, online rules set describes the components that you will need to create in order to play. The components include a custom card deck made up of twelve types of cards with nine copies of each card. Six-sided dice are also required for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
