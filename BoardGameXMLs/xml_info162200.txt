			<description>Patrick - The Hipster&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;God, I'd kill for a soy bean caramel peppermint latte right now.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Settling in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood with 1.3 cafes per block and a vibrant arts scene, Patrick set about renovating his brownstone apartment.  Wearing thrift-store shirts and stonewashed jeans, listening to the latest prog rock bands, and sipping lattes to his heart's content, Patrick lived an idyllic existence until the zombies came.  He found inner reserves of strength he didn't know he had protecting his beloved neighborhood from the dead.  It was a losing battle and soon Patrick was forced to leave, joining other survivors in their desperate struggle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patrick is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Season 3 Kickstarter campaign.  A Zombivor version is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
