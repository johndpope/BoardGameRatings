							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secret of the Swamp Giant Steward</name>
									
			<description>From the Forward:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a wilderness adventure. Though it is designed for mid to upper level characters it is unforgiving to those players that behave rashly, or assume too much. While some groups may think they are too powerful for such a simple scenario the possibility of losing half the party is not only likely, it is eminent, should the group underestimate its dangers. And&lt;br/&gt;while many might think it is full of contrivances placed simply to diminish the full powers and abilities of such groups, and characters, it is worth noting that from time to time groups need reminding that the natural world is just as dangerous as a fantastic one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACKNOWLEDGEMENT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the last adventure in a tribute to Gary Gygax's Giant Series, it is hoped that those that read and play it will find some sense of enjoyment from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
