							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I Found What In My Bag of Holding?</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have never seen a player use their Bag of Holding only for good stuff. They toss every scrap and bit into there, so it's out of the way. So why would the previous owner be any different? Here is a quick little chart to give a bit of variety as to what they may find inside...Some of it's useful some of it's useless. Some of it's potential plot hooks for quick thinking GM's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system-neutral product consists of a process and supporting random tables.  Results are unusual and occasionally humorous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
