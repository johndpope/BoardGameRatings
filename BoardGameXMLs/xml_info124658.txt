							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Greek Gods</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greek gods. The mere mention of them immediately conjures images of Zeus hurling thunderbolts, Hermes speeding through the lands on winged boots, Aphrodite entrancing men with her beauty, and even Hades ruling the souls in the Underworld. They are the essence of immortality. The conquests, epic struggles, loves, losses, and lore that surround them fill volume after volume of tome and are passed down among each generation of the mortal races that worship the gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greek mythology is rich in history and tales of gods, heroes, women, and monsters. Sages have recorded their exploits while bards have sung of their deeds and tragedies, the two greatest being Homer and Hesiod. These tales have captured audiences for ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
