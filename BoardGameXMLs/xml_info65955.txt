			<description>French game from the 1970's. The players travel around the world (depicted on the board) with a civilian airplane. The players can choose to start either in Paris, New York or Tokyo but they have to through each continent to obtain five different visas. To do this the players receive a set of cards at random in the beginning of the game. Each card has connections between different cities on them. Each turn a card can be played to move a pawn to another city or a card can be exchanged for another one. The player who gets the five different visas first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
