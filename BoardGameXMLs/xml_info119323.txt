							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OnLive Game System</name>
									
			<description>The OnLive Game System consists of an OnLive Wireless Controller and a console, called the &amp;quot;MicroConsole TV Adapter&amp;quot;, that can be connected to a television and directly to the OnLive service, so it is possible to use the service without a computer. It comes with the accessories needed to connect the equipment, and composite video users can purchase an additional optional cable. The MicroConsole supports up to four wireless controllers and multiple Bluetooth headsets. It also has two USB ports for game controllers, keyboards, mice, and USB hubs. For video and audio output it provides component, HDMI, TOSLINK ports, and an analog stereo minijack. An ethernet port is used for network access, which is required to access the OnLive service. Pre-orders for the OnLive Game System began to be taken on November 17, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Onlive&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
