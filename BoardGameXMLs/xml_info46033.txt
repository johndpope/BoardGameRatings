			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Rage Against The Dying Of The Light!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Tarth was a bright and shining jewel. The Great Race Wars were long over, the people were free, and true evil had been scattered to the dark bowels of the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King of Valusia sat upon his throne and ruled his peaceful valley and its honest citizens with a firm yet fair grip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future of Tarth was bright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until they came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the light went out forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evernight is a very different kind of dark fantasy setting. This 144-page hardback book provides a complete scripted campaign, from before the arrival of the mysterious and terrifying Masters to the epic and bloody finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player characters start as Novices in a familiar fantasy world of elves, dwarves, orcs and men. They finish as Heroic adventurers in a land draped in eternal night and overwhelming horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evernight contains new Edges &amp;amp; Hindrances, spells, weapons and magical items. The Game Master has a complete scene by scene campaign ready to run, the truth behind Tarth's murky past, and a host of new and mysterious monsters!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
