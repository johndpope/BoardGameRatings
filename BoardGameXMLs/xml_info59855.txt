			<description>From the kid with his nose pressed against the showroom window to the discerning traveller with a mission in mind, here is the stuff of transportation dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb: &amp;quot;Space is very, very big. There is several billion times as much empty space as there are stellar bodies hanging in the blackness. Just as the first explorers thought the sea was eternal, space was daunting to those who first set their sights on the heavens above. The first rockets that broke away from their planet's gravity and soared into the vast sea of stars were the first infants of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The industry of space travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Over the millennia countless starships, rockets, saucers and other craft have been constructed to traverse the spacelanes. Some have been sleek and aesthetically attractive; others have been bulky, ugly and mean. Just as different as the races that made them; the ships of the Babylon 5 universe have run the gamut of designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This book is a collection of many of their number that could be found in the era of the 23rd Century, when the turning of an age took place. Separated into their various governmental or political factions, this is the ultimate guide to the spacecraft of Babylon 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There will be a few ships that only existed for a short time. Many will be commonly found for decades, or even centuries. They have been included to give every Games Master the opportunity to use them accordingly in their own Babylon 5 chronicles - or to base their own.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
