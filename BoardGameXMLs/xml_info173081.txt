			<description>Players are collectors during the Era of Taisho(1912-1926), collecting the seven kinds of the animal cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are a cat, a dog, a snake, a fish, a tiger and a elephant. They are three types, rarity, normal and variety.&lt;br/&gt;There are two rules variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is the trick taking game.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt three cards as hand. At first of the round, the turn player deals one card to each player. The turn player starts to choose to change the revealed card to the handed card or to keep it.&lt;br/&gt;The trick is started as a &amp;quot;must follow&amp;quot;. If the player has the same type of the lead card included in the opened card on the front of the player, the player must play the card or keep the opened card. When the player play the card, the opened card is added to the player's hand.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player(s) played the different card against the lead card. The player get one card from the opened cards.&lt;br/&gt;The rare and variety card have the special effect when following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two is the bluff game.&lt;br/&gt;The preparation and the object are same. And at first of each round, one card is dealt to all players. The turn player plays one card with face up. Other players play one card with face down.
