			<description>Each player has a set of chips numbered 2-9 which start in the circles bordering the edge of the grid.  Each grid square has a pair of numbers, each shown twice so as to be easily read by all players.  Played most like Chinese Checkers, the twist in Chekker Math is that a playing piece must be a factor of at least one number on each square on which it lands.  Thus, only a player's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 chips may be played on the square showing &amp;quot;30&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;64&amp;quot;.  The 7 and 9 chips may not be played on that square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
