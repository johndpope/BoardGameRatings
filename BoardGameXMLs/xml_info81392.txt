							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Treasure</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have gone places where no sane man would go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have carried your sword into forgotten castles and labyrinthine caverns below the earth, and there it has tasted the blood of men and dragons and foul creatures of the dark, and won you free again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And your sword has brought you rich treasures. Your horse and your armor are the best that money can buy. Gold and silver coins are stacked high in your iron chest, and your belt is bright with jewels. Is is whispered in the town that enchantment lies on your blade, and on the protective  amulet around your neck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should count your gold, and be content. And yet...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An yet you are not content; for you have read in The Book of Treasure, and you know that there are prizes far richer than gold and jewels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
