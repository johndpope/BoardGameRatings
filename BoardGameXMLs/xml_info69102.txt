			<description>The Atari 130XE is a member of the Atari 8-bit family of computers.  As one of the later models, it is capable of playing almost all Atari 8-bit games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 130XE is essentially an Atari 800XL with more memory (128KB), an Atari FREDDIE chip, support for Atari BASIC version 3, and sleek new casing.  It also had a new Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI) port, which was partly compatible with the old PBI port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User summary (walkie), info from Wikipedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
