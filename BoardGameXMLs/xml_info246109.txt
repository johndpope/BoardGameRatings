							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Handler</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You've escaped, and you think the world's a huge place, and you can hide anywhere, right? I'm here to tell you... that world? I own it. Your world is getting smaller by the second. And you can't hide anywhere from me. Every database, every security cam, and every police band has my fingerprints on it. Every moment you're out the noose pulls tighter&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team is on the edge of defeat, their foes close the circle as your hands move so fast they become a blur. You embolden your friends, restore their strength, snatch your enemies weapons and strengths from their claws and steel your party with invaluable knowledge about what they face. Bolstered by your spells, and armed with your information, they strike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Handler is a new complete playbook for Dungeon World. Inspired by characters such as Oracle, Mei Ling, Merlin, Alfred and others, this character is an expert at providing research and remote assistance to the party in the field, able to weave complex magical constructs, unravel alchemical traps and find out anything, about anyone. Present with the party only as a symbiotic projection of your true self, you operate entirely from a mystical sanctum, full of your powerful tools. The playbook has options to play as a technologically advanced cyber-god, or a powerful mage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sheet is unlike most other DW characters, in that you are not physically present with the party, and you must also stick with a Host for the game, another character who agrees to carry your projection with them. You share your health with this character, and several moves revolve around the symbiotic nature of your relationship. This sheet works very well with couples or siblings or any other players that like to be joined at the hip with a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
