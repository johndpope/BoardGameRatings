							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magical Circle</name>
									
			<description>The game is involving pattern recognition &amp;amp; building. Players act as students of the school of magic and wizardry, who compete with one another to learn new magic.  Each player will join three different magical circles, and determine the number of times of path conversion made within the time limit, to quickly change the magical element into the correct magical circles.  It is a game where speed of thought is contested.&lt;br/&gt;The number of times of path conversion is controlled by cards, so players need to be aware whether or not there are suitable cards to use, or if one thinks too fast but lacks a usable card, he or she will have a small price to pay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
