							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chapter &amp; Verse</name>
									
			<description>Chapter &amp;amp; Verse requires players to connect hexagonal tiles they have drawn to tiles in the play area in a manner similar to Dominos. To connect tiles players must match the numbers on the edge of the tiles played with the number on the tiles it will be connecting to. Some of the tiles have olive branches on their edges instead of numbers. Olive branches must connect to other olive branches. Since there are many olive branches, they make it easier to connect tiles.  There are also wild tiles that have edges that may count as any number or an olive branch. One other way tiles can be matched is if the player is able to combine the tiles to create one of the three verses on the Message Card he was given at the beginning of the game. For example, a player may have the verse Matthew 5:16 on his message card. He could connect a tile with 16 on one of its edges to a tile that has Matthew in its center and 5 on one its edges to create Matthew 5:16. &lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is for the players to create all three verses on their message cards and use the clues in those verses to guess the secret word on the other side of the card. The first player to create all three verses and guess his secret word is the winner. Even if a player can guess the secret word before they complete all three of the verses he must complete the other verses to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following is from the back of the box - An archeologist, Dr. S needs your help to decipher and uncover secret words. He needs assistance sifting through ancient tiles and linking them together to gain clues to a message. Dr. S has started a Log Book detailing the links between the tiles. According to the legend, when you recreate the messages using the ancient tiles you will uncover clues to a secret word(s). Find the tiles, build the links, read the writings and claim your reward of wisdom, one word at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
