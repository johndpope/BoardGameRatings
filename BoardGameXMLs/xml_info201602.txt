							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gadgeteer Accessories</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gadgeteer accessories can get as big as sorcerer bloodlines if they're the weird, modular sort. This racks up quite a word count, and reviewer Endzeitgeist believes that the 35-page Gadgeteer Base Class doesn't pack anywhere near enough of them. Class Expansions: Gadgeteer Accessories helps to alleviate this with three new accessories for the gadgeteer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1: Aerosol Sprayer - The gadgeteer has a whale oil flamethrower and a specialty syringe gun. Now, she's got the world's nastiest tube of pepper spray!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2: Hat-a-Rang - Never be without a custom weapon again. The hat-a-rang is a returning throwing weapon that can slip past guards and accepts custom weapon gadgets while taking up an accessory slot. Versatility is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3: Projectile Parasol - First presented on the Interjection Games blog, the projectile parasol has two progression tracks. First, it acts as a mortar for acid, alchemist's fire, tanglefoot bags, and so on. Secondly, it acts as a passive defensive option for anyone, not just the gadgeteer. Soak the umbrella in chemicals to make it help resist acid and fire damage, strengthen its spine to make it a viable club, and so on. It's a shield, a weapon, and a gun all in one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
