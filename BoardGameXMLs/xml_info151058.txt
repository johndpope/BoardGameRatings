							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reverse Charades: Canadian Edition, Eh!</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Hysterical fun from &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;zed&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O Canada! Get ready to show your Great White North pride as you face-off against your fellow Canucks for some big-time laughter. Reverse Charades is a hilarious twist on the normal charades game you know-where one person acts out the words for the team to guess (boring)! With Reverse Charades, your entire team has 60 seconds to act out as many classic Canadian-themed words as one guesser can guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's fast-paced, fiercely-fun team competition-a strange brew of action-packed hilarity sure to have Canadians from sea to sea raising their hockey sticks and jumping on their chesterfields to celebrate! You'll have such a blast that no party, game night, family gathering or team-building event will ever be complete without Reverse Charades (ok, and Nanaimo bars, too)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
