Get out of the lab before you die of age or get caught by other experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age at will&lt;br/&gt;You have the ability to modify your age, but be careful you also have a timed lifespan so don&amp;rsquo;t waste it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your way&lt;br/&gt;You can go through the lab areas in different ways, and it will have different sets of enemies, collectibles, and story fragments.
