			<description>On Guard is a simple dexterity game made by Parker Brothers in 1967.  It can be played by two players, or 4 with players working in teams with the goal of being the first player or team to score 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game table is a fairly heavy plastic construct, with large springs mounted beneath each of the rectangular board's 4 corners.  Players depress the springs, moving a steel ball through the obstacles towards a goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real point of interest is that the two scoring areas feature both goals, side-by-side.  So attempting to score can be very dangerous indeed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components: Plastic game table, metal ball, instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
