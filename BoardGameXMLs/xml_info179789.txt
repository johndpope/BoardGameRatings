							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Covert Ops: Berlin</name>
									
			<description>Tabletop, 1-6 player spy game set in 1941 Berlin that combines classic mystery elements like Clue, but with a defector.&lt;br/&gt; Setting. At the height of World War II, spies from around the world descended on Berlin, Germany to gain intelligence on military operations. Allied forces from countries including United States, England, and Russia engaged in dangerous clandestine operations, code breaking, and subterfuge. The secrets they obtained thwarted military advancements into Western and Eastern Europe. Now, you, the agent behind enemy lines in Berlin in the early 1940s, seek to decipher the enemy plans, avoid being caught by the Schutzstaffel, and uncover the double agent among your peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay. Operation Berlin is a mystery board game with a defector. The goal is to determine which military operation Nazi Germany is planning through process of elimination. Players move as spies through Berlin obtaining information and avoiding hindrances in the form of roadblocks, security guards, and Schutzstaffel. As an added challenge, players may be double agents trying to prevent the other agents from discovering the German plans. This game combines the mystery style of Clue with the player interaction of Resistance to create a unique and intriguing replaying of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery Element: There are 9 possible missions characterized by the country of attack and type of attack. One of the missions is selected at random, unknown to the players, and placed aside as the actual secret mission. A tracking sheet assists players in eliminating possible missions when they find or trade information on what cards are not in the secret mission pile. First player to accurately guess the secret mission wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defector: Based on the number of players there may be 1 or 2 double agents. By randomly drawing the agent and double agents cards at the beginning, no one knows what side the other players are on. This adds a covert element that will have players interacting, accusing, and defending until the truth is known. Double agents may choose at any point in the game to reveal their secret, allowing them to play as the German forces. If the double agent remains incognito, all players may accuse a person of being a double agent and force them to be uncovered. But if they guess wrong the game ends in a German victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
