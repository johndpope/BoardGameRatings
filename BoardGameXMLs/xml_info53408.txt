							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blink Solitaire</name>
									
			<description>A cross between what's recognized as the Windows Solitaire game (aka Klondike), dominoes, and Blink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a single-player game where players lay down cards where the shorter width ends of cards touch the longer length sides of cards (Blink standard deck) and all touch only where there is at least one of number, color, or suite match.  Going off the edge of a table to match cards legally is a lost game, as is not being able to place a card next to other existing cards that match on at least one attribute for all edges that touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game may take 40 minutes with a single deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
