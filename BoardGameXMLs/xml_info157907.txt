							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kakuro: Das Spiel</name>
									
			<description>This abstract game is based around the Kakuro puzzle rules (basically, a crossword with sums as questions/tasks and the solutions limited to numbers 1 - 9, one per square and no duplicates within a solution).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During setup, players place the potential solution numbers onto the empty 8x8 grid as they see fit. Each player also gets a number of partially randomly selected action tiles that can be used to replace numbers later in the game, swap two numbers or allow to create a solution with one duplicate number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a random sum tile is drawn. Players then simultaneously try to create a solution for that sum on the board, using only their own action tiles for any changes to the numbers on the board and placing beginning/end markers for solutions. Numbers already used in previous solution can not be altered in any way. The player who comes up with a legal solution first scores points equal to the length of the solution and the solution is applied to the board. If the sum was odd, all players draw an additional action tile after the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the players fail to find a solution for the third time. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
