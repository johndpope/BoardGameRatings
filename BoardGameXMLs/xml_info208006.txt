			<description>Which? is a game to get conversations going, get to know others and stepping into the minds of those you're playing with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Which? cards are drawn which have have a number of options as answers to a would-you-rather question. Two dice are rolled to select answers and then the active player secretly selects which option of the two they would pick. Players then take turns to vote which they think the active player has selected and then score points if they are right. First to ten points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
