			<description>A dark wooded is divided into 11 x 11 squares separated by grooved lines. Each player has a steel pawn and 21 steel fences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pawns are placed on the middle square at opposite ends of the board. Each player has to move his own pawn across the board to reach any square on the opposite side. Each turn a player can either move his pawn one square, or put a fence to close two square sides. When a player runs out of his own fences, he can only move the pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed fences can not be removed. The only limit to placing them is that you can never totally close the enemy pawn: you have to leave a way, no matter how long, to reach its goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was been licensed to Gigamic for an international edition under the title of Quoridor. Differences are a smaller board, 4 wooden pawns (for 2/4 players), 20 wooden fences total (10 each in a 2-player game, or 5 each in a 4-player game) and the abolition of diagonal movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Blockade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Quoridor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
