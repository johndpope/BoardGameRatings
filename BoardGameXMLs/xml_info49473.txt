			<description>From the back cover...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A little information is a very frightening thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundred of years ago, the elves and the goblinkin fought for control of known space in the Unhuman War.  Though the elves won that first campaign, they know the goblinkin are clamoring for a rematch.  Recently the elves commissioned a few good adventurers to infiltrate the base of a new race of advanced orcs known as the scro.  They were hoping to gain information on thier enemies' number and plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The news they found was far worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scro have discovered a weapon of awesome destruction, one that can lay waste to entire worlds.  But the key to unlock its power lies lost and forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even now the scro are searching for it.  When they find it, they will wreak destruction and revenge on the inhabited planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elves are looking for an adventuring team who can win this desperate race, and find the key first.  Your PCs may be the only thing that stands between known space and doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heart of the Enemy is a 96-page adventure set in the Second Unhuman War.  The second of a two-part, it can either be linked with the previous Goblins' Return or it can be played as a stand-alone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heart of the Enemy is designed for four to six characters 8-11.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
