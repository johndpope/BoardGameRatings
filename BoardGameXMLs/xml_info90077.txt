			<description>Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wanpaku Graffiti opens as Jennifer weeps over Rick's grave. Lightning strikes, hitting the grave, reviving Rick, who is still wearing the Terror Mask. Lightning strikes again, hitting the grave next to Rick's and revives the Pumpkin King, the game's main antagonist. The Pumpkin King kidnaps Jennifer and Rick must go save her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After fighting through several levels of super deformed monster parodies, Rick finds himself in the office of the Pumpkin King. Upon defeating him, it is revealed to the player that the whole game was merely a movie. A director congratulates on his fine acting, Rick removes his mask, and they leave. Once everyone has left, the mask comes to life, revealing its evil nature. After that, you see a picture of Rick waking up on top a hill with Jennifer, proving that everything that happened in the game was a dream, then next you see them approaching the West Mansion during a storm which revealed that this game is a prequel to the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the other Splatterhouse games, Wanpaku Graffiti focuses more on platforming elements than Beat 'em up gameplay. Instead of using punches and kicks, Rick wields an axe and can pick up a shotgun with limited ammo during certain levels. This game also features an experience point system. By defeating a certain number of enemies, Rick's health bar grows. The number of enemies needed is seen at the top of the screen. New to the series is the password system, which allows players to enter stages through four digit numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If both of the crystal orbs are collected during the game, a shot at the end with Rick and Jennifer approaching the West Mansion like in the original Splatterhouse will be revealed. The ending would suggest that Rick was possibly dreaming all the events of this game when he is seen on the hill with Jennifer. The dream may have been a warning about what was going to happen in the West Mansion in the next game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
