			<description>MythWars: Clash of the Gods is a CCG (customizable / collectible card game) for 2-4 players, aged 12 to adult. A typical two player game takes less than 20 minutes, while four player games have been known to last over an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player controls a team of 4 gods, goddesses, and/or other entities, each with a different ability: some abilities may help their teammates, or hinder the opposing teams; others grant special attacks, or bring in extra reinforcements. New gods and/or goddesses are revealed as the game progresses, and each one in play gets an attack each round. Attacks are determined by comparing the attacking entity's Attack score (plus a die roll) to the defending entities Defense score (plus a die roll). Similarly, two entities may Clash, comparing their Energy scores (plus die rolls), with varying results. Entities remain in play until they run out of Energy points, at which point they are removed from the game, and the winning player is the last one with any gods and/or goddesses left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gods, goddesses, and other entities come from various mythologies, and are grouped together by their culture of origin. Each culture has eight Entity cards (gods and goddesses), and each &amp;quot;Battle Set&amp;quot; has two cultures, for a total of 16 cards per set. Battle Set 1 (Greeks vs. Norsemen) was released as a print-and-play game on August 25th, 2012. Battle Set 2 (Egyptians vs. Japanese) will be released similarly on September 9th, 2012. Battle Set 3 and 4 are slated for early and mid-2013, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself has a deck building element, as any four gods or goddesses can be brought together for a team, and some combinations are more useful than others. There is also an element of luck, as dice are used in determining attacks and Clashes, and which is amplified by the game's Critical Roll system (wherein a roll of 6 &amp;quot;almost always&amp;quot; wins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full rules and the card information (including the card images) were publicly released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
