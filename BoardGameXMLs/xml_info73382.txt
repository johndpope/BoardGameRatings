			<description>&amp;quot;During a storm your ship was blown off course and you were shipwrecked on a deserted island. There are 3 other islands across the sea, but beyond that you can see nothing but ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you start to gather materials to make a campfire, you realize that you will need to build a raft to sail away to freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even when you have gathered enough materials to build a raft, you will need to prepare for what the island has in store for you; there are snakes, sharks, cyclones, tsunamis and much more to contend with! This paradise island is anything but paradise&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raftaway is game for 2 to 4 players and takes between 30 to 60 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has been stranded on one of 4 different islands, which neighbour each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to build a Raft and have enough Health and Energy to sail away from the Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Print and Play game. All you will need to supply is 8 plastic markers (2 per player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
