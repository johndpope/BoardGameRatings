			<description>&amp;quot;The Five Elemental Energies of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water encompass all the myriad phenomena of nature.&amp;quot; -- The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wu Xing Rummy is a rummy game inspired by the Chinese concept of states of change, also popularized as the five elements of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water, as well as the seasons of the year. This game was originally designed for Cate108's rummy design contest here on BGG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in regular rummy, players may meld suits and play layoffs on existing melds. There are also special action cards similar to those found in other designer rummy games. The final score each round is adjusted based on the relationships between the elements in play, with each elemental suit enriching one matched suit as well as possibly depleting a different one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
