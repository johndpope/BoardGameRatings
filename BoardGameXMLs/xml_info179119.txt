							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For the Emperor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroism and Glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Stands:  The Adventures of the Last Stands do NOT share a common story. The only thing that they have in common is that someone somewhere is making a final stand. These are epic adventures of individuals who are sacrificing themselves for a cause greater than them. Few will survive, maybe none. But whether they survive or not, these individuals will become legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Emperor: On the eve of victory over the barbarian horde, the Emperor is betrayed, attacked by those sworn to protect him. Only a few of the Imperial Guard remain loyal. Those few, surrounded on all sides by traitors, must fight to secure the imperial family. Somehow, at least one of the imperial family must survive this woeful day. These loyal few will ensure that this happens, though it cost them their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
