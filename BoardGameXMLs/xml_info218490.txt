							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Give and Take: The Game of Soil Building</name>
									
			<description>This is a spin-and-move affair published in 1928 by the National Fertilizer Association. The square board is divided into quadrants, each with illustrations and spaces related to a different kind of farm: Dairy Farm, General Farm, Grain Farm and Truck Farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reward and penalty spaces in each quadrant have distinct explanations. In the Dairy Farm, for instance, C = &amp;quot;Turned cattle in pasture too early in spring. Lose 1 Spin, while on the Truck Farm this space reads &amp;quot;Soil very acid; limed adequately. Go Ahead 1, Take 1 Spin.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a separate booklet that provides more detailed information about the good and bad practices flagged on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 16&amp;quot;-square board itself is lavishly illustrated, although on plain beige cardboard, with images related to each kind of farm. The game was distributed in a plain brown envelope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
