							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galedon: A Theran City</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthdawn is what sword and sorcery games were meant to be, high fantasy in the finest tradition. The course of the world can be changed by a few staunch heroes in the right time at the right place. Complex politics allow for intrigue in a grand style. What follows is a detailed description of the Theran City of Galedon. Written as a manuscript for FASA and passed over. The Empire of Thera sourcebook was released after this location was fleshed out. Because it was not included in the Thera sourcebook the author saw fit released it on to the net as a free resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the destruction of Geocities web domain by Yahoo the original home page has been lost. The Reocities group is attempting to save the old Geocities content. For the time being this manuscript is available there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Campaign location created in the best manner; it maintains no rules for any particular edition of Earthdawn and therefore can be easily used across all the editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
