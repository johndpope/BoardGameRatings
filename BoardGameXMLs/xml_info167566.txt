							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jiku Kansho</name>
									
			<description>Jiku Kansho is a game about controlling the future by affecting the present and the past. Players choose and keep special properties which potentially affect the future. These properties would bring you more properties, avoid an unexpected future, or block your rivals. When the farthest future is reached, the player with the most valuable properties wins the game. However your aim isn't just to have more and more properties. The value of a property will be chosen by the future. So, choose your future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's the meaning of the title Jiku-Kansho?&lt;br/&gt;The direct translation of the title is 'Interfere of Time and Space'. Jiku = Time and Space, Kansho = Interfere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
