			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dark times after the fall of the Old Republic, the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s forces begin to push deeper into the Outer Rim Territories. Those who resist ﬁnd themselves helpless beneath the crushing weight of oppression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rebel Alliance &amp;mdash; little more than a loose coalition of bickering resistance groups &amp;mdash; struggles as much with dissent from within as with the growing might of the Galactic Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now, word spreads of an Imperial weapon capable of destroying entire worlds in an eyeblink, a weapon called the Death Star...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galaxy Guide 13: Rogue One is an unoﬂicial homage to the classic West End Games Star Wars Roleplaying Game, and features artwork, game statistics, and character histories of the key Rebel characters in the feature ﬁlm Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. May the Force be with you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years ago, I was a freelancer, then editor, then line editor, for West End Games' Star Wars roleplaying game line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An illustrator friend, Darren Calvert (who I have wanted to work on something with for more years than I care to count), recently sent me some portraits he'd drawn of the Rogue One primary cast and asked if I wanted to &amp;quot;stat&amp;quot; them in the style of the WEG Star Wars RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He'd drawn them very much in a style reminiscent of the WEG material, and as I began to hunt for reference material to begin writing up the characters' game stats, I thought it might be fun to not just post the stats, but to lay the whole thing out like an old WEG product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That led to a week of design necromancy &amp;mdash; trying to remember the approved font choices, the paragraph styles, and so on, in order to create a faithful reproduction (though I did tweak some things that always bugged me, including the &amp;quot;opening crawl&amp;quot;); it's close, but some of it, by design, authentic enough without being a straight up reproduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It occurs to me: Much of what I know about page and logo design actually came from sitting in the West End art department, peppering the guys in there with a million questions, so thanks (for many things) are due to Tom O'Neill, Brian Schomburg, Tim Bobko and Stephen Crane.&lt;br/&gt; Thanks are also due to Darren, who is a hell of an artist and a great guy into the bargain. Thanks for reaching out, my friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I should also point out: these are NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; or approved in any way&amp;mdash;I researched the entries just as I would've back in the WEG days, by culling through what official material is available publicly (notably the movie adaptation novel, and the Rogue One visual guide). But I have friends at Lucasfilm, so I want to make sure there's no confusion here. This ain't a real thing &amp;mdash; just some goofy fun. It's not for sale, Darren and I don't own the characters, we're not challenging the copyright, we're not using it to make money, and speaking purely for myself, it's not intended as a resum&amp;eacute; piece &amp;mdash; it's just fan-work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully, it will amuse any of you old-school D6-system fans out there.&lt;br/&gt; There are two versions of the PDF available: a &amp;quot;mint condition&amp;quot; one, and a &amp;quot;vintage&amp;quot; one that's been digitally weathered and &amp;quot;aged.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
