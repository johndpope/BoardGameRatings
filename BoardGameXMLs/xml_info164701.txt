			<description>From the box: The Baseball Game is a computer generated, mathematically pure game that enables you to replay Big League baseball games by transferring the performance records of Big League players from the playing field to playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Pitcher's card is divided into strikes, balls or spaces where the Batter hits the ball.  Each Batter's card is divided into four columns that match the Ground Ball, Fly Ball, Line Drive and Long Drive spaces on the Pitcher's card.  Simply go to the matching column on the Batter's card and roll the dice to find if the Batter is out, hit safely or reached base on an error.  After the Batter hits the ball, each play is completed by referring to the simplified Fielding and Base Running Charts on the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is licensed by Little League Baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
