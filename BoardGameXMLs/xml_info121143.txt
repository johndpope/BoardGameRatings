			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, James Butterfly, have been chosen to be the test pilot for the F49, the latest NASA prototype, a fighter capable of escaping the earth's athmosphere. The test flight is going fine, until you blacked out and the F49 vanish from the NASA radar screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you wake up, you're lying in the snow, next to your crashed experimental plane and the body of your co-pilot. Picking up the few salvageable items you find (a first aid kit, a sidearm, a portable cassette player), you set out to explore the icy wilderness surrounding the crash site. Soon you encounter a group of people wearing primitive clothing and weapons. They take you to their leaders who hand you a tape. The tape is an audio recording of a prophecy foretelling your arrival on this strange world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alive is an icon-driven adventure game, with light RPG elements (the character's health must be monitored as it's possible to die from hunger or dehydration).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
