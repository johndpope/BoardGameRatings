			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pack of Lies takes place in a &amp;quot;noir fantasy&amp;quot; world that is based around lies and deceit. Each player is on a grim quest to clear their name. They must gather a gang of characters that will either use treachery and deceit or bash some skulls until they get to the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Pack of Lies lets players choose to either work with or against other players to clear their name throughout the game; whatever best suits their purpose at any given time. The characters in the game can also help out a number of players at once. Be careful though &amp;mdash; the fate of a character within the game is sure to affect multiple players in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work with or against the different factions within the city including The Church, The Cops, The Syndicate/Mob, Enchanters, and Dragonclan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
