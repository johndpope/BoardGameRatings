After they elected Willard Maypoll to be their first mayor, crime decreased and trade began to flourish once again. However, nearing the end of Maypoll&amp;rsquo;s second term, there has been a spike in crime with local merchants facing extortion from an unknown group and a local business owner murdered by their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the town gripped in fear not known since the days of Lord Ilin, local merchant guild headmaster Trina Hearth makes a call of adventurers to investigate the group behind the violence. Little does Trina know that she may be just asking for herself and her investigators to be victims of a tyranny of greed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed investigative adventure with many twists and turns&lt;br/&gt;    New organization: The monastic order of the United Voice&lt;br/&gt;    New monster: The blood sucking garbage barnacle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
