							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What The Dub?</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hilarious team based party game, inspired by The Whisper Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with two teams, max ~16-18 players. One team will draw a total of three &amp;quot;Dub&amp;quot; cards to create a sentence. The words on the cards are completely random and can be arranged in any order (ie &amp;quot;Kanye West&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Spaghetti&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Pubic Hair&amp;quot;, etc.) to create a &amp;quot;Dub&amp;quot;. Once the Dub is created, they will tell it to the other team where a player will read it to their teammate to guess, who is wearing headphones playing loud, awful music. 4 points for guessing the Dub in 90 seconds, 8 bonus points for scoring in under 45. The entire Dub must be said without interruptions to score points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
