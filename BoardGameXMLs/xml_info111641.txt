							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">5star</name>
									
			<description>5star is a racing game for 2 players in which the number 5 on the dice serves to allow new stars onto the board. After this it's a race to the finish. The first player to get 5 stars over the finish line is the winner. Stars can be captured by both your own stars as well as by opponent stars. Whenever a star is on the fifth or tenth position on the track, it's prone to capture the oppenent if he/she moves a star to the same rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple games can be combined to allow for more than 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5star is designed by the mother-and-daughters trio Linda, Isis and Nova.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
