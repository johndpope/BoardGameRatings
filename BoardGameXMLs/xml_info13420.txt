			<description>This game is based on the Jungle Cruise ride at Disneyland. Starting at the dock and using a spinner, players move their boats along the rivers (arrow paths) of the ride. Each player has three pink cards depicting various animals or landmarks that they need to photograph. When a player lands on a Camera Space, he draws a white card, and, if its picture matches one of the pictures he needs, he has taken a successful photo and keeps the card. The first player to take all three of his photos and return to the dock wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
