			<description>Merry Yard is a simple and funny card game. Players are farmers trying to call to their farmyard the best and nicest animals. Each turn, players can draw new cards or play an animal card, making the sound of each animal, and using their unique effects in order to outwit their neighbour.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the animals on the yard will provide players some points, as the cards left in their hand are subtracted to the total. Are you ready to build your Merry Yard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
