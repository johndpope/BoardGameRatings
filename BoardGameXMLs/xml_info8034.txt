			<description>A game designed to give young adults an overview of the corporate world of climbing the ladder of success through blue-collar jobs up through white-collar jobs to CEO of the top corporation through the use of query cards with multiple answers to choose from, the correct answer advancing the player, the wrong answer sending you on an alternate path and trying again.&lt;br/&gt;Game lends itself to building moral character and leadership skills.  A good family game but not a game involving skill or strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
