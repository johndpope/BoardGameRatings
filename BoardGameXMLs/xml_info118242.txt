							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shufflin&#039; Feet: Put Your Best Foot Forward</name>
									
			<description>Shufflin&amp;rsquo; Feet is the funny game that takes unexpected twists on every turn! The players compete to win chips by playing higher valued cards than their opponents. On every round players place one card down in front of them and pick a player to roll the cube. The cube has three number sides and three action sides. If a number is rolled, players bet that number of chips, flip the card in front of him/her and the highest valued card wins the chips. Actions consist of trade, slide, and chip. Each action moves cards around the table to an opponent. If an action is rolled, complete the action and pass the cube to the next player. Play stops when a number is rolled. Quick wits and a little luck can leave any player in position to win on any turn. It depends on which direction the feet shuffle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
