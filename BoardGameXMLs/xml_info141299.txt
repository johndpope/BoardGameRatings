							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Do Your Job</name>
									
			<description>Do Your Job is a fast, family fun game. It comes with two different variants. One is a collecting game (similar to Gin Rummy or Spoons) with a twist and the other is a mind-bender with a betting mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the original game variant, each player will attempt to obtain all the elements needed in order to complete their job from the card piles at the center of the table; they will need to find a Job card and the necessary Job Item card(s) during the game. Each turn players will draw a card from the top of a deck, discard a card face up onto a deck, and move a card from one deck to another (you may do these actions in any order, but you must do them all). If you successfully have all the cards necessary to Do Your Job at any point on your turn, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jobs are not so easily done, though. The corporate world is a cruel mistress, and the player must try to figure out the other players' jobs in order to thwart jobs being done. If people realize what job you are trying to do, desired cards can be buried within one of the decks during other players' discard or move action since you can only draw from the top of a pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Treachery game variant, each player tries to win the most points. They will accomplish this by first betting for the round. Then players will play a job card (either the Pirate or the Dwarf) and a number card face down. The pirates will then flip their bet (positive to negative or negative to positive) and switch number cards with the other players according to the arrows. Whoever has the highest number will win all the bets and play will repeat in this fashion. Be wary though, for if each person plays the Pirate, the bets will be flipped, but everyone keeps their number card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
