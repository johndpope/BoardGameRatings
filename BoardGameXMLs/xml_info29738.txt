			<description>Sic bo, also known as tai sai, dai siu, big and small or hi-lo, is an unequal game of chance played with three dice, and of ancient Chinese origin. Grand hazard and chuck-a-luck are variants, and of English origin. The literal meanings of sic bo, tai sai and dai siu are dice pair or dice bowl, lucky dice and big small respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sic bo is a casino game, popular in Asia and widely played (as dai siu) in casinos in Macau. It is played in the Philippines as hi-lo. It was introduced into the USA by Chinese immigrants in the early 20th century, and can now be found in most American casinos. Since 13 May 2002, it can be played legally in licensed casinos in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
