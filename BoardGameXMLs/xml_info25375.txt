			<description>Wargame for two players, originally included with issues no. 728, 729 (the regular 6-sided die) and 730 of Italian magazine &amp;quot;Panorama&amp;quot;, in spring 1980.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules' sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Il Golpe, a bespoke creation for &amp;quot;Panorama&amp;quot;, is a war game based on a hypothetical military coup in Italy.&lt;br/&gt;The game's flow simulates the typical putsch's mechanics: mutiny of military units, assaults against TV broadcasting stations, airports, nuclear plants and naval bases, riots in the streets.&lt;br/&gt;The game represents a single day of war, consisting in 8 phases of 3 hours each. At the beginning of the game the &amp;quot;rebel&amp;quot; player secretly compiles a list with the opponent's  units that will mutiny, then the &amp;quot;government&amp;quot; player places his army and only after this stage is the list revealed.  At the end of the game the total value of the &amp;quot;strategic goals&amp;quot; achieved by the &amp;quot;rebel&amp;quot; player is calculated, and if his total score is higher than the &amp;quot;government&amp;quot; player's one (the sum of the objectives still under his control) the coup d'etat is successful.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt;Map of Italy (84 x 39,5 cm) with reference charts embedded;&lt;br/&gt;107 cardboards chits;&lt;br/&gt;1 dice;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
