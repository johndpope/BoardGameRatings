			<description>Subtitle: The Rosicrucian Covenant Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brotherhood of the Rose Cross&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rosicrucian history is relatively brief, not quite eight hundred years, but it has been eventful. They have come closer to defeating the Combine than any other organization, and closer to complete destruction than they like to admit. They have spawned one of the oldest and most powerful Dark Covenants, but are now one of the most pure organizations in the world. They believe in responsibility, and the centrality of magic, but recruit primarily from those who have had mundane power handed to them on a silver platter. They require absolute obedience to orders, but hardly ever give any.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are You Ready to Join the Elite?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power and Privilege: The Rosicrucian Sourcebook is a supplement for the WitchCraft roleplaying game. In it, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Extensive background information on the current affairs and attitudes of the Covenant.&lt;br/&gt;     Character creation tips and hints for Rosicrucian Cast Members, and some words of wisdom from members of the Covenant.&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed history of the events that shaped the Covenant from formation to the present.&lt;br/&gt;     Varied discussion of potential Rosicrucian-based Stories, as well as both broad and detailed Story plotlines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
