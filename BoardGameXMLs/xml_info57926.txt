			<description>Board game celebrating the second biggest city in the state of Pennsylvania.  The pieces move along prized properties and utility centers.  The board game is designed to somewhat mimic the topography of downtown Pittsburgh with the merging of two rivers and bridges connecting the downtown area with the North Side and the South Side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment includes 28 Deed Cards, 32 Picnic Basket cards, and 100 Skyscraper Units.  Paper money denominations go from $500 to $100,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is decided by the result of rolling two dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build on properties and charge rent to other players, and sometimes have to pay taxes and other fees to city or utilities.  After all properties are taken, game ends, and player with most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has squares for Property (corporations), Transportation (bus, ferry, train), Entertainment (music concert halls, civic arena), Park (known municipal parks), Fuel Shortage (a legacy of the 1970's rationed gas), Bridges, Occupation Tax (it's a tax that all Pittsburghers know about and complain about it), Pennsylvania Lottery, Mellon Bank (the financial manager for all players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
