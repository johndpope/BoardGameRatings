			<description>One may still be able to remember the last Grand Prix season with it's dramatic finale, but who can tell what has happened in the seasons 50 years ago? The game has 165 cards with more than 1000 questions in three categories: Cars and Technology, History and Drivers, Grand Prix Aktuell. The players roll a die and move forward accordingly . For each roll of the die he must pay with chips, also for wrong answers. For correct answers a player receives up to three chips, for overtaking another player 1 chip. If a player has finished one round (or more, if wanted), the player with the most chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
