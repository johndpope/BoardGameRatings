			<description>Outer Gods and Interlopers is a social deduction game where Cultists are performing rituals to the great and powerful Outer Gods.  A few investigators have attempted to infiltrate and subvert the rituals from within but the Cult Leader has becoming increasingly weary of this and has taken to sacrificing those within the cult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective as a cultists is to successfully get Rituals to pass and as the investigator team to sow enough discord that the cult will fail in their task of bringing upon certain doom to the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the ritual phase the cult leader will reveal the top ritual from the deck, it will have one or more components required for successful completion.  It will also have one disruptive component that if added to the ritual will bring discord to the cult.  All other players will commit a component, from their hand of three cards, face down to the ritual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players will have a hidden background that may force them to play a certain way, ie. if you are the Madman you must play any offering components you have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cult leader will then shuffle and reveal the committed components and if the necessary requirements have been met the ritual will succeed and favor from the outer gods will be gained.  If the ritual does not succeed the investigators will add more discord and get one step closer to winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a unique moderator role that makes decisions with the game, as well as unique player abilities that provide many opportunities to either sniff out the Investigators or sow discord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
