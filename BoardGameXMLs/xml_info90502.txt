							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earth Unmasked</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth of 2025 is filled with promise, fear, potential and impossibilities, hidden behind a layer of masks, deceptions to hide truths from those whose minds could crumble if they were exposed to the light, deceptions to protect the mask makers from the wrath of those who would react violently if they discovered they had been looking at a mask at all. The masks are beginning to slip, to be discovered, to expose things below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You shall portray a persona born of this world, one who has crafted their own mask or who has used the masks others have made for them. Or you might be a seeker, one who wishes to know what lies behind the masks and believes that their mind, spirit and body strong enough to face what lies behind the mask. Once you begin the journey there is no turning back, though you may find yourself having wandered onto the wrong path and going someplace you never expected. This is the price for being who you are, of knowing, imagining, acting and choosing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not the world you live in, it&amp;rsquo;s the world of your persona, your character, which you have gathered together using the Cosmic Synchronicity rules and the additional information to be found in this book. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily the same future your world faces, nor are things exactly the same as you your are expecting. Its an alternative Earth, similar yet different in ways both subtle and obvious. This book cannot tell you everything, if it did it would be an encyclopedia. Your GM will add details beyond here, we simply deal with the over view and those details needed for the creation of your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the book will deal with the world, the second part will deal with those mechanical things needed for your character creation process. Its recommended you at least skim thru the first part before getting to the creation process so that your character will fit better into the scheme of things (or stand in opposition to them, if you wish).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is NOT a complete work - GMs and players must place effort into making this setting come alive. It cannot cover all possibilities, it is intended as beginning stage to build upon, expand and develop into your own exploratorium of creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
