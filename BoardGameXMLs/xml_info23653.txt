							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tournament Stadium Checkers</name>
									
			<description>Tournament Stadium Checkers differs from Stadium Checkers in that it is a larger stadium with more rings and more marbles. The goal is now to score the most points. A player scores points by moving his marble to his goal and by capturing opponents marbles. Some of the rings have half circles. When two appropriate rings are lined up, a marble can be dropped into the formed pit and captured. A capture is also created by dropping an opponents marble into the wrong goal. The game is over when a player's marbles are all out of play. Each player scores 50 points for a goal marble and 30 points for a captured marble. High score wins. Tournament Stadium Checkers can be made more challenging by rotating the center goal indicator to a different orientation. Thus, making it harder to move a player's marble into the correct goal. Tournament Stadium Checkers is a more challenging game than the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
