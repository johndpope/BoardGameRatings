							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pizzeria Boss</name>
									
			<description>Pizzeria Boss is a set-collecting and hand management card game with just a little bit of a &amp;ldquo;take that!&amp;rdquo; element (let&amp;rsquo;s face it, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s fun to stick it to your neighbor). With limited resources can you complete more pizza orders than your competitors before the end of the game? Need some help along the way? Great! You can bring in managers and even The Boss to help out! Let&amp;rsquo;s just hope that they don&amp;rsquo;t get fired before they serve their usefulness. To win, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to play the right cards at the optimal time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with two decks of cards, the &amp;ldquo;Boss deck&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Order deck&amp;rdquo;. The two decks work in conjunction with each other. The &amp;quot;Order deck&amp;quot; determines what toppings you need on your pizza. The Boss deck provides the toppings and all the little things needed to help your business along the way.  If you play your cards right you might even disrupt your competitors. Once you order is prepared it must be cooked.  Be wary--until that order is done and the money is in your pocket that customer could still decide to cancel. That's just how pizza life goes, right? Health inspectors, cancelled orders, not having what you need in stock - these are all possible disasters that could happen. But there is also the good things - helpful managers, a boss willing to lend a hand or customers who pay for their order early. Explore all these things and more in Pizzeria Boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
