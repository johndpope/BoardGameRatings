			<description>Yes you are a Zombie! You will never be at rest. You &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; to make sure nothing else does. Everything must die, if it moves it must die. How did you get in this arena? It does not matter&amp;hellip;Look! There is something moving over there&amp;hellip;it is time to KILL once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zombie brings Squishy Flesh and Arm-O-Rang to Sen So.  If you like not having to think about what to do or being able to take a hit, the Zombie is perfect for you.  The Zombie is a single player set that can be played against any of the Sen So variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sen So game system uses a unique set of octagon cards and card holders. Players have to set (program) actions before their current action is revealed. All players reveal actions together. This provides fast play for even large numbers of players.  Game scoring provides balance and keeps the leaders on their toes. Players are required to choose their weapons and abilities for each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
