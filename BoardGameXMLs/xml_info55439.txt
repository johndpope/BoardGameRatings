							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tunnels &amp; Trolls 5.5 Edition</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls is designed primarily as a fantasy role-playing game set in a somewhat medieval alternate-universe, in the tradition of the hero tales of Greece and Rome, the Norse Sagas and the Eddas, childhood fairy tales, and in the more modern traditions of the heroic fantasy of JRR Tolkien and Robert E. Howard.&lt;br/&gt;        The fundamental framework for adventuring in Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls is the concept of an underground tunnel complex wherein dangerous traps and deadly monsters guard undreamed-of treasures, where magic and high sorcery meet sword and shield, in alliance or as violent opponents. Those who survive to regain the surfacemay be considered &amp;quot;winners&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; until the next time they venture into the depths, risking all for their glory, gold, and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;        The rules to play Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls are complete within the booklet in your hands. You need never purchase anything else, and you will have the entire game available to you. On the other hand, there are numerous back-up services &amp;mdash; among them, solitaire dungeon adventures, miniatures, and a magazine dedicated primarily to T&amp;amp;T &amp;mdash; but these are meant to augment the game. Here is all you'll need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        In 2005, Flying Buffalo released &amp;quot;version 5.5&amp;quot;.  This IS the fifth edition, with some bonuses.  This version has 32 new pages including the complete Buffalo Castle solo adventure, plus Ken St Andre's &amp;quot;Chronology of Trollworld&amp;quot; plus new optional rules from Ken such as &amp;quot;Character Creation&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Half Breeds and Unusual Character Types&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Combat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Spite Damage&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Many-dice Problem&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Style of Play&amp;quot;, and  &amp;quot;The Money of Trollworld&amp;quot; AND Michael Stackpole's &amp;quot;Skills in T&amp;amp;T&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Pulling your Punches.&amp;quot; It also includes the complete version 5.0 of the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
