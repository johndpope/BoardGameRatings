This is a world where block-headed blonin are secretly building a weapon of the gods, where humans are scarce and on the edge of extinction, where a cataclysmic event of the past has sewn together the various realms of creation to forge a nexus point on a fantasy world known as Far Away Land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far Away Land is a rules-lite fantasy role-playing game that uses six-sided dice. In mixes fantasy, sci-fi, and apocalyptic elements to create an immersive and rich world full of history and adventure. It is easy to learn and a perfect game for new (young) gamers as well as verteran gamers. All of the Far Away Land books contain colorful artwork, humor, and rules that allow gamers and GMs to pick and choose the level of crunch they want in their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Companion Rules are a set of optional rules that feature worldbuilding games and guidelines such as The Gods of Far Away Land, Historians of Far Away Land, and Architects of Far Away Land.
