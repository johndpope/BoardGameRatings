			<description>An official Scout endorsed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lives of nine people are in your hands. Do you have the resourcefulness, the ability to remain calm and take swift, effective action in the face of a crisis?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out how many of the nine would survive if you were their guide in a battle of wits, through five action packed zones: jungle, desert, marine, arctic and disaster.&lt;br/&gt;Some challenges will ask for a verbal solution - others will ask you to demonstrate with actions.&lt;br/&gt;It's exhilarating, it's fun, it's adventure. Best of all it's informative, because it pits you against real life obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;Learn it, love it...one day you may have to live it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
