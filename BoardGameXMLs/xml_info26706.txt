							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">IceFloe</name>
									
			<description>IceFloe is a piecepack game designed by Tim Schutz.  It was a runner-up for the Changing Landscapes design competition sponsored by Mesomorph Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IceFloe uses a piecepack set, piecepack pyramids, and a candle (or another easily accessible incendiary device) for its components.  The game board consists of piecepack tiles that are placed suit-side up; each representing an ice floe.  One player is selected to be the torch bearer and is given the candle.  Game play is broken up into phases.  During the movement phase, starting with the torch bearer, players take turns either moving a game board tile, or moving one of their own pyramids.  After movement, a voting phase takes place, accompanied by a comment period that allows some limited negotiation.  Players vote on which floe is to be blown up by the torch bearer, with the torch bearer being the tie-breaker.  Any pieces on the selected floe are removed from the game.  Often, multiple players will have pieces on a single ice floe, so short term alliances may form during voting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete rules are free to download from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://piecepack.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://piecepack.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with:  Ice Flow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
