			<description>Space Brew is a drinking game played with cards.  The game has a retro sci-fi theme and the object is to gather enough pieces of salvage to repair your ship. This is done by battling space monsters using various quantities of alcohol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment can be won from monsters to help your cause and you can hire mercenaries.  There is also a range of space sicknesses to endure and currency cards to coax away other player's mercenaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
