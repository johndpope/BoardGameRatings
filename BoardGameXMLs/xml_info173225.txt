							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chambers Island</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chambers Island was originally a Cthulhu influenced island located in the middle of the swamp. Because of space I had to expunge most of that text, but I may revisit it. It would have been nearly twice as long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure includes a nasty creature I don't think I have ever used before, a spirit naga. It will make a formidable opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've included the PDF of the adventure, a detailed GM map and a blank players map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I developed this adventure around an old keep with out buildings. The image of the players approaching the island with a crumbling tower with a batch of buildings in various states of decay. Include the corpses hanging from trees and I really wanted to capture as much of that as I could.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
