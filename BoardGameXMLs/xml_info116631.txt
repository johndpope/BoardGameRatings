							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frisch&#039;s Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>Promotional game made by the Frisch's Big Boy chain of restaurants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two panels to cut out and you can make little cards for them. Once you have your cards, you can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the cards and draw one, to determine what the batter does: One team is called Big Boy and one is called Buddy Boy. The instructions say to use a button or small token as the batter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that is it, draw a card, determine the result, move your button player marker if needed. I have seen games with a little more skill!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
