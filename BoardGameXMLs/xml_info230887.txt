			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are robots for if not competitive combat? Take the role of a master builder and square off against fellow scientists and engineers in a battle of robo-supremacy in KILLBOTS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a small catch though...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each robot has a positive and negative action. Every time a robot attacks it could deal damage, heal a fellow robot, or even steal another player's cards. But maybe something will go wrong and your robot will attack you, or switch sides, or simply explode. Robots are unpredictable - they're more of an art than a science, really. This element of chance keeps the action dynamic and unpredictable, as well as leveling the playing field a bit for new players. Players able to better manage their robots in play and anticipate these events will ultimately come out on top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Killbots is a competitive tabletop card game for 2 to 6 players where each player builds and controls an army of imperfect killer robots. The functions of each robot are determined by a custom 8-sided die - effectively making all moves calculated (or uncalculated) risks and keeping gameplay fresh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
