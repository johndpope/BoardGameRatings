							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jenga: Chicago Cubs Collector&#039;s Edition</name>
									
			<description>Take the Cubs to the top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Jenga a fun new way with Chicago Cubs blocks and Cubs dice that add excitement to the game! Its the same great game with a Cubs twist. Build your tower with Cubs blue and red blocks. As the tower builds so does the difficulty. Custom Cubs Jenga rules throw each player a curve ball and make the game even more challenging and fun! Roll the dice and make the play. Safe reverses the direction of play; Single allows you to remove any piece and an RBI means you remove only a red block. The last player to remove a block without tumbling the tower wins the game. Game comes complete with 54 Cubs hard wood Jenga blocks, 1 custom die, custom Cubs baseball rules and a loading tray for assembly. Its Cubs Jenga, for edge-of-your-seat fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
