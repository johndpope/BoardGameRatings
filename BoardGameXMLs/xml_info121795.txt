							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sopranos: Road to Respect</name>
									
			<description>The Sopranos: Road to Respect is based on the HBO series The Sopranos, which aired from January 10, 1999 to June 10, 2007. It was released on November 7, 2006.  The game's storyline takes place between the fifth and sixth seasons and centers around Big Pussy Bonpensiero's illegitimate son, Joey LaRocca, as he makes his way through the family business.  Any further plot synopsis would only include spoilers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is able to take missions from the main characters of the series at certain points in the game. Road to Respect differs from other mob-influenced games in that it is in a linear, story driven action game as opposed to Grand Theft Auto's open-world type gameplay. However, players are able to play Texas Hold 'Em with members of the Family and visit Bada Bing. Unlike the TV show, the game focuses almost exclusively on the Mafia aspect of The Sopranos rather than the blend of family/business/therapy that Sopranos fans have become accustomed to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Video game cast members include James Gandolfini returning as Tony Soprano, Michael Imperioli returning as Christopher Moltisanti, Steven Van Zandt returning as Silvio Dante, Tony Sirico returning as Paulie Gualtieri, Joseph Gannascoli returning as Vito Spatafore, Vincent Pastore returning as Big Pussy Bonpensiero, and Robert Iler returning as A.J. Soprano. David Chase continues to write for the most part. The main character is voiced by Christian Maelen as Joey LaRocca, who was David Chase's second choice to play Christopher Moltisanti. Other noted actors Monica Keena as Trishelle and Robert Costanzo as Angelo Buscetta. Anthony DeSando, who played Brendan Filone on the series, voices an entirely new character as LaRocca's (Maelen) partner in crime, Reggie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Sopranos: Road to Respect&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
