			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POWER KILL is a roleplaying metagame. It is not a game unto itself - it is instead a layer of &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; that you add to whatever Normal Roleplaying Game (NRG) you are currently playing. POWER KILL has no particular rules system unto itself; just use the regular rules of the NRG you're playing as normal. POWER KILL only comes into play at the beginning and ending of each Regular Game Session (RGS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POWER KILL works hand-in-hand with your favorite NRG. Whether you play Vampire: The Masquerade or Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, POWER KILL is there for you to use, seamlessly integrated with your usual play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of POWER KILL is to add an additional level of Fun And Excitement (FAE) to your NRG sessions. You'll play your NRG as always, but the addition of POWER KILL mini-sessions at the beginning and ending of your normal session will add a lot to your gaming experience. It'll give you all the entertainment you've always sought from RPGs, only now it's stripped down to the bare essentials with no distracting genres to get in the way. POWER KILL is a pure distillation of the roleplaying hobby - one hundred percent pure fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 1996 HTML release of the game was freely available prior to the commercial PDF release of the game which was substantively revised and expanded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
