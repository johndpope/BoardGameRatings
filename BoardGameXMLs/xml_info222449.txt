			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mage Spamlet the 13th was, like his previous 12 ancestors, known for his interest in the Old Ones. He was the last in his line to live in a small underground family keep. Upon his death, the keep was abandoned and the doors sealed. Recently strange fish-like and tentacled-creatures have been seen at night near the keep, causing a bit of concern amongst the surrounding population. It is said that Spamlet&amp;rsquo;s spirit is trapped in the keep and is summoning Old Ones to do his bidding. Anything a party of adventurers could do to help banish Spamlet&amp;rsquo;s spirit would be, um, helpful. Also, rumor has it that limitless wealth awaits the brave soul who destroys the mage&amp;rsquo;s spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
