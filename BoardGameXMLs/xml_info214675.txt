			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the premier dwarven nation of the Flanaess. Here you will find yourself tested every day in our war torn lands. Our great nation stands against the greatest foe the Sheldomar Valley has ever seen. The Pomarj, a humanoid nation, has carved out a large country for themselves at the expense of our own lands. During the Great War with Iuz the Old to the north, we supplied those great nations opposing him with our best troops. During that time, Turrosh Mak and his humanoid scum struck at us from the east and forced us to retreat back to the Lortmil hills. Having lost all of the lands from the Lortmil hills to the Jewel River to this plague of humanoids has caused our nation to focus on rebuilding our strength. We have fortified our position in the hills to stanch the flow of humanoids into our country. Join us in the fight to retake our disputed lands and to destroy the plague of humanoids that have infested the eastern half of our country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
