							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Farmer Olaf</name>
									
			<description>After a fall of the greatest dwarven city - Arar - almost all dwarves left the Valley of Three Passes many years ago. And now, Olaf&amp;rsquo;s farm - last one in the valley, has been struck by an earthquake. Dwarf Olaf sends for you - his grandchildren - to help him rebuild his farm and find lost animals. He promises to reveal the biggest secret of the fallen city to the one that help him the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farmer Olaf is the first no.table family tabletop game. This means it can be played comfortably on a big, small or with no table at all. Playable anywhere, even when walking. Unique box design allows discarding and storing cards while holding it in one hand or being attached to a belt. Other advantages include starting/stopping game in seconds, quick save/quick load game ability, burst card dealing, quick independent release and storage of an instruction that doubles as a displayable cheat sheet. Maximum number of players is determined by game boxes used (4 players additional players per each game box).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Farmer Olaf, players perform 4 farming acitivites to gather green cards with points. Player with most points at the end of game wins. Farming activities include sowing and harvesting a field, milking a yak, making wool from alpaca and making ham from a boar. Each player receives 5 cards in the beginning and 1 card in each subsequent turn. Players try to collect appropriate cards for farming actions. For the most time there is a shortage of buildings and animals needed for production. This means that in order to increase chances of winning a player needs to engage in trade with others. There are no limits of how to structure trades: from traditional 1-1 card exchange to more exotic deals like leasing or deferred payment. Game is carefully balanced, for example best cards that are steam machines can be used only to sow and harvest a field. However to do that one needs a fertilizer that can only be obtained by cleaning boar pen or cowshed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational values: negotiations, assertiveness, being pro-active and helping others increases one's chances of winning, business creativity, business theory (competitive advantage, optimizing capital structure, sunken costs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple rules and design (no text and no numbers on cards) allow children aged 5+ years to participate in the game when playing with adults. The most demanding part is being a game master and managing cards in the box, thus overall 10+ age rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
