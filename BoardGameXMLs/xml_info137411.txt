							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dog Walker</name>
									
			<description>Dog Walker is a family board game where players are competing to earn the most money by walking the neighborhood dogs and returning them to their owners in clean condition (and empty of bladder).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dogs that players walk around the board are represented by cards, each card features a photo of a real dog (living or passed on submitted by fans).  Each dog card has a bladder value and one or more sniff symbols.  Boy dogs have more pee to deliver but will also stop more often to sniff things than girl dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You earn a point for every dollar earned earned and for having your dogs &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot; (pee on) the fire hydrants around the board.  However, only three pee markers can be on any hydrant so if a fourth one gets added, the pee marker on the bottom of the stack goes away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next element of fun come from the action cards. Every time a dog stops on the board to sniff its required symbols, everyone gets to play one action card, such as &amp;quot;tangled leash&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dirty paws&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;squirrel!&amp;quot; providing additional hindrance to their opponents or cards such as &amp;quot;romp &amp;amp; play&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;overactive bladder&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;holiday bonus&amp;quot; to benefit their own cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
