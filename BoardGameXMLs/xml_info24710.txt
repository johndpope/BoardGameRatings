							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scarecrow Target Game</name>
									
			<description>The original 1965 release comes in a very large 19&amp;quot; x 18&amp;quot; x 8&amp;quot; box.  It features a plastic scarecrow (which is almost as large as the box) with various scoring targets - hat (5 points), crows on arms (10 or 15 points) and a 50 point target on the scarecrow's coat which, when hit, causes the scarecrow's coat to fall off in pieces.  A dart gun with three suction-cup darts is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of firing all three darts at the scarecrow from a pre-agreed distance. If a player causes the coat of the scarecrow to fall off, 50 points is scored and their turn ends, regardless of the number of darts in reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate 300 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game was re-released in 1975 in a very slightly different box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
