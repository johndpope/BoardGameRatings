			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A traditional point-and-click, third-person adventure game set in an ancient eastern environment. Players assume the role of either Jazz (a smuggler), or Faust (a sea captain) and embark on a quest for riches. Each of the two characters has a different storyline with unique objectives, problems, and puzzles to solve. Two plays (one as each character) are recommended for the full experience. The game environment spans three different worlds with 90 locations in beautiful 3D graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
