							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Top Championship Golf</name>
									
			<description>Table Top Championship Golf is as close to real golf as you can get with dice and paper. Using a grid matrix system, each Championship golf mat has over 550 possible landing locations for your ball. Never before in a golf board game has the player been able to use so much of the hole. Coupled with a wind modifier, frustratingly placed hazards and plenty of trees this game is bound to bring you just as much joy, and sometimes frustration, as the real thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play by yourself just to pass the time, or play with some friends. TTCG can be played with a full foresome and has many different game modes such as Stroke Play, Skins, Scramble, Best Ball, Fourball and more. Have your own favorite method of play? Play it! Want to make up a new game type? Give it a shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 32 hole options, there are 471,435,600 possible course combinations to choose from. Have a favorite hole? Play it more than once. Don't have time for 18? Play a quick game of 9 hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've included 18 scorecards with the game, if you run out, we've provided a link on this page to print out more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
