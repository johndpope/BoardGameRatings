			<description>Tiddlywink style game where small plastic rings (flying saucers)are place on a launcher at an angle. The ring is pressed down with a flat disc to propel the ring into a playing board set at an angle 2 to 3 feet away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is that players shoot at the board showing the moon and planets. Players score points for landing on the moon, in moon craters, on moon mountains or on planets. The first to reach 250 points is declared to winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not dated but would be a 1960s game based on graphics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warren Built - Rite game, No 8600, Lafayette, Indiana, USA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
