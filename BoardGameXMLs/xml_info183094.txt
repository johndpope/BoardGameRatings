			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;たねまき (Tanemaki) is a card game from Hoy Games that bears similarity to Bohnanza in theme and scoring, but the basic gameplay is significantly different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The similarities are:&lt;br/&gt;Players are farmers growing different crops in up to two fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When these crops are harvested, they turn over into coins (Hoyer) according to the distribution on the crop. The design of the cards looks similar to Bohnanza in this respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difference is the way cards are distributed. The active player draws a hand of cards from the draw deck, drawing the number of players plus one. They choose an opponent and pass them a seed card face-down in secret. That player has three options: to either plant it face-up in their own field, or place it face-up in the Storehouse in front of the active player, or pass it face-down to another player who is still in the round (who then has the same options but cannot pass it back). Once a player plants a seed card in a field, they are out for the round. Eventually, all the other players will have planted a seed card, or added the seed card to a field with that crop. The active player is left to choose their seed card from what is left in their hand or what is in the Storehouse (which can store 2 cards). The remaining card is discarded. The turn passes left to the new active player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has their two fields occupied, and has to plant a seed which does not match the two crops, they must harvest one crop. As well as the seed cards, there are manure cards which act as Jokers. Planted cards are staggered to show how many are in a field, so any Manure cards go at the back of the stagger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play ends when the active player cannot draw enough cards to distribute. The player with the most money winds, ties are broken by owning the most of the rarest plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So whilst Tanemaki has obvious connections to Bohnanza, the game play is calculated and based on hand management from the card draft, and no bartering is involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd edition includes English rules. The differences between the 1st and 2nd editions are:&lt;br/&gt;- Redesigned the box&lt;br/&gt;- Reduced card size&lt;br/&gt;- Improved card quality&lt;br/&gt;- Redesigned the back of the cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher summary:&lt;br/&gt;プレイヤーは農家となり、野菜の種を集めます。&lt;br/&gt;種が必要な量までまかれたらお金を得ることができます。&lt;br/&gt;一番お金を多く獲得できた人が勝者となります。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a farmer, who's trying to grow vegetables.&lt;br/&gt;Collect the seeds, plant as many as possible and then harvest them for coins.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most coins wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
