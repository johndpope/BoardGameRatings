							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A More Perfect Union: The Struggle to Ratify the Constitution</name>
									
			<description>This 2-player game simulates the great public debate over the ratification of the Constitution that took place across the United States from 1787-1789.  The game employs the popular card-driven mechanics of such well-known games as Twilight Struggle and 1960: The Making of the President. Representing the Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the players pursue strategies to ratify or defeat the Constitution.  The Federalists win if nine states ratifiy the Constitution.  The Anti-Federalists win if five states refuse to ratify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game places a premium on hand management and strategic planning by providing players with the tools to build powerful hands of cards over consecutive turns.  After players become familiar with the deck of cards, playing time should be around 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
