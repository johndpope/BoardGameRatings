							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Card</name>
									
			<description>This game is played with a special deck of 64 cards (40 are used for 3 players, 52 for 4 players, 64 for 5 players), numbered from 1 to 16 in each of four suits (blue circles, green squares, red triangles, purple stars). All but 4 cards are dealt to the players; the top card of the remaining 4 is turned up to determine trumps. This is a trick-taking game. One player leads to the first trick and may play any card in his hand. Succeeding players must follow these rules (in order) when playing: (1) Must play a card of the same suit that was led; (2) If player does not have the suit led, she must play a trump card; (3) If player cannot do either rule (1) or (2), he may play any suit. In addition, once it is determined which of the three foregoing rules applies to a player, she, if possible, must play a card that has a higher numeric value than the highest-valued card already played to the trick. If she cannot play a higher card, then she may play any card that follows the applicable rule. When all players have one card left in their hands, the round ends. Each player&amp;rsquo;s score is the number of tricks he caught times the numerical value of the &amp;ldquo;Last Card&amp;rdquo; remaining in his hand (thus the title of the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
