							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninchen Lotto</name>
									
			<description>This is a lotto or bingo game that can be played on two levels, depending on the child's age. &lt;br/&gt;There is the standard lotto, with tiles getting turned over one by one, and the first child recognizing it as being on his board claiming it; or the memory version, &lt;br/&gt;where the cards are spread out face down, and the children take turns turning up a card. If it matches a picture on her collecting board, she keeps it and goes again. &lt;br/&gt;If not, she puts it back face down, and play proceeds to the left. &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to fill his board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artwork by Dick Bruna, the Netherlands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
