			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a new store at the mall- and it looks pretty cool. It's about time! It is filled with all sorts of clocks- and a mysterious storekeeper named Chronos. He's a wizard who says he needs your help in diffusing a time bomb which- if it explodes- will stop time ... forever. But you'd better watch out-a bunch of thugs- called the Time Police- just burns in with some nasty-looking weapons. Do you try to help Chronos or run away? If you stick to the wizard- you'll be transported to another time wrap where creatures from the zodiac are on the prowl. If you bolt- you'll face the fierce looking Time Police who looked pretty ticked off- at you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
