			<description>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale miniature figures or paper 25mm figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules. Each British base or stand represents a formation of 100 men while the French are formed in bases or stands of 150 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The battle for Quebec 1759 was a part of the Seven Years War in North America between the England and France. The British General Wolfe sailed up the St Lawrence River with over 250 ships and boats in late June of 1759 from the fortress Louisbourg. The British knew very little about the City of Quebec, which they sent General Wolfe to attack, other than that the city was the capital of New France.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When General Wolfe and his soldiers landed on the Isle d' Orleans they discovered that the City of Quebec sat on top of a 350 foot cliff over looking the St Lawrence River . . . On September 13th General Wolfe made the amphibious landing that led his soldiers up to the Plains of Abraham. The whale boats and flat bottom barges took Wolfe's 4,800 men over in two trips. When General Montcalm woke in the morning he found out that the British were just outside the City on the Plains of Abraham.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer&amp;rsquo;s foreward notes: &amp;ldquo;Not all of the rules listed below apply to this battle. These rules were written to be a general set of rules to cover the entire musket era of warfare.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The battle for Quebec can be looked at in three different view points. These three view points are the campaign for Quebec, the greater battle for Quebec, and the lesser battle for Quebec. I have chosen the lesser battle showing the center wings of both sides forces where the main and decisive fighting took place at the Plains of Abraham on top of the rock.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
