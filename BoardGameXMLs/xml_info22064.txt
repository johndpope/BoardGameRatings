							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roy Morgan&#039;s Ultimate Survey</name>
									
			<description>A game which aims to educate about the value of collecting social and consumer statistics.&lt;br/&gt;The object is to earn the most votes by guessing opponents' responses to questions posed on the survey cards. When a player reaches the finish all players' vote are tallied, the winner having the most votes.&lt;br/&gt;Players gain votes from betting on opponents' survey answers. When a player lands on a poll space he undertakes a survey, picks up a survey question card, reads it aloud and secretly chooses a response card (1,2 or 3) corresponding to the multiple choice answers provided. The other players each then choose a response card which they think the survey player has chosen and wager on their response being correct. There is no limit to the wager. Players who guess correctly double their wagers. Players who incorrectly guess lose their wager. The survey player receives 10 votes for each player who correctly guesses their answer.&lt;br/&gt;Players also gain and lose votes from the action spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
