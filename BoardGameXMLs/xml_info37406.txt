			<description>Power Checkers is an expansion of the traditional game of Checkers. Game play is similar to the original game with the same movement, jumping, and kinging rules. The major difference comes in the expanded board, which allows for more maneuverability and the ability for special &amp;quot;Power&amp;quot; moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with their pieces in special territories outside of the regular 8x8 board. To get Power Checker status, the player must get his or her piece all the way through the opponent's home territory to special Power spaces. Once there, the piece may move in any direction, transport to special Power Space Courts outside of the normal play area, and return to their home area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is playable with 2-4 single players or team play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
