			<description>This is a 2 player game on the battle which occurred on the 12th &amp;amp; 13th September 1944 around the town of Dompaire in France using the final iteration of the Blood and Steel series rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After breaking out of the Normandy Bridgehead in July, the Free French 2nd Armoured, triumphantly entered Paris and advanced across the French country side, intent on liberating the province of Lorraine. Desperate to stop the Allied blitzkrieg and recapture the vital railroad center at Nancy, Hitler placed General Von Rundstedt in command. To support the counter attack, emergency reinforcements were ordered up to the Western Front that included new and improved models of Panther tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle saw the Free French 2nd Armoured Division, led by General Jacques Leclerc, pitted against the counter attacking German forces of the 112th Panzer Brigade. The armored clash at Dompaire confirmed that the French had learned the lessons of war well, and that Allied victory in the West was now at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
