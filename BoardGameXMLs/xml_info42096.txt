							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Confusion Flats: an Exploration Game</name>
									
			<description>A petroleum exploration game developed by a geology professor (James H. Fisher) from Michigan State University. Used to teach students in petroleum geology, and the interaction of geologists with other team members including land-men and petroleum engineers. Published in the Bulletin of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Volume 61, Issue 1, January 1977.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes two maps: one for the students to base their exploration program on, including leasing, shooting seismic, and drilling wells; and the other being the &amp;quot;solution map&amp;quot;, which shows the depth to a key horizon, structures such as anticlines and stratigraphic traps, and where the oil and gas fields are located. Also includes a &amp;quot;stratigraphic column&amp;quot; of rock formations from surface to the deepest depths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base map includes lease blocks such as a National Forest, a Navajo Reservation, a State Park, other federal lands, and private (&amp;quot;fee&amp;quot;) land blocks such as farms or ranch property. The rules, included in the journal article, for drilling costs, leasing, drilling results. The rules list the oil price as $3 per barrel, with no mechanism for price fluctuation, indicating how long ago the game was designed, and how it would need to be updated for today's world. Nevertheless, this game was/is effective at teaching the principles of oil exploration in a fun setting that students really enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
