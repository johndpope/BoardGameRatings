			<description>Double Fun Game uses two decks of cards to play several games that gradually teach a child how to read. In the first game, players place a Store Card (Grocery Store, Pet Store, Toy Store and Hardware Store) in front of them. On your turn you draw a picture card from the deck, and if it matches an item on your Store Card you keep it. The first player to collect all 6 objects in his store wins. The next game is played the same but the deck is flipped over and players must match the word on the card to an object in his store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games gradually add more reading elements with the last game finding players competing to create an entire story (similar to Mad Lib) using the word cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
