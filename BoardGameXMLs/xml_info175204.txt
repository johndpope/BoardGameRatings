			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dream Quest is a roguelike deckbuilding game. Choose a hero from one of 13 classes and explore randomly generated dungeons, earning achievements and points that will allow you to unlock abilities for later plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is performed with a card-based system. The abilities, spells, and attacks you master make up a &amp;quot;deck of cards&amp;quot; that you will modify and enhance as you level up. For example, a Thief might begin with some Action cards, like Slice and Backstab, while a Wizard would begin with a Spell like Frost Bolt and some Mana to cast it with. Deciding which cards to add to (and remove from) your deck is the heart of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;13 different classes&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Over 300 cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;70+ monsters and Bosses&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;No in-app purchases: everything is unlocked ONLY through play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
