							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NFL Fever 2002</name>
									
			<description>From the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many NFL-based video games, but there has never been a game with the look and feel of NFL Fever 2002. You are about to play a game that merges more than 70 years of NFL history and intensity with 21st century technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are a few of the things that make NFL Fever a unique gaming experience:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dynasty Mode: You can dive deep into the details of running a franchise for up to 25 seasons. NFL Fever's Dynasty mode boasts a ton of individual and team stats, and unprecedented record tracking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Total control for the way you play: In NFL Fever, there's no lag time between your thumbs and what you see on the screen--your players react instantly to every command. And you'll get the same level of control over your team's future in Dynasty mode. Be a &amp;quot;hands-off owner&amp;quot; who lets the CPU worry about the details of team management, or a &amp;quot;micro-manager&amp;quot; who directs every personnel and lineup decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Warehouse-like storage: NFL Fever takes full advantage of the Xbox hard disk. You will have no trouble storing and retrieving single games, Dynasties, and replays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dynamic Player Performance: In Dynasty mode, your players' ratings will go up or down, from week to week and season to season, based on how well you play. Check your players' progress at the end of each week of the season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All the teams and stadiums: NFL Fever has all 31 current NFL teams and stadiums. As a bonus, we created more than a dozen teams you won't find anywhere else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
