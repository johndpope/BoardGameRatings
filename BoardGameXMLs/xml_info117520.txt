			<description>Energy Airforce: Aimstrike is focussed strictly on being an authentic flight simulator. All the aircraft are existing or prototype aircraft flown by the U.S. military and all the weapons used are existing weapons used by the U.S. military. The aircraft all carry a realistic load of weapons and fuel (although chaff and flares are unlimited) and can be viewed from outside or from a realistic cockpit view; when yawing the aircraft the relative pilots leg will depress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay follows a generic storyline and could be considered to be parodying the Gulf War of 1991. A small sandy desert country (whose capital is &amp;quot;Ad Barath&amp;quot;) has a military coup d'&amp;eacute;tat (Hinting to the Ba'ath Party) and gives birth to a militarized dictatorship. The country then uses its air superiority to invade a peaceful neighbor to the south (which denotes Kuwait). At this point, the player's organization steps in to combat the dictatorship and restore freedom to the besieged country. This involvement result in the city of &amp;quot;Ad Barath&amp;quot; falling in the final mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the previous game (Energy Airforce) where the player was stated to be a mercenary and only ever has a single wingman, but could have his single wingman fly a range of jets, EA: Aim strike! gives the player command of up to three wingmen in strike mode, two wingmen when flying a carrier-based story mode mission or three wingmen when flying a non-carrier-based storyline mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Energy Airforce Aim Strike!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
