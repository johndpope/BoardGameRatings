			<description>Card game consisting of 52 cards featuring 5 sets of eight Citizen cards and four sets of three Vehicle Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle them together then deal out an equal number of cards per player and everyone places their cards face-down in a pile in front of them. The game is played a little like Snap, but with a twist. As players reveal a card in their turn, &amp;quot;Safety First&amp;quot; must be called if two exposed cards match each other. However, if a vehicle card is exposed on any players' stack, then &amp;quot;Safety First&amp;quot; cannot be called, as the 'street' has a vehicle on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are urged to learn their Kerb Drill slogan;&lt;br/&gt;Halt at the kerb.&lt;br/&gt;Eyes right, Eyes left, Eyes right again&lt;br/&gt;If the road is clear, quick march.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is interesting that this advice was on children's TV 50 years later. Same advice but rebranded as the Green Cross Code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Citizen cards illustrated by Harry Rowntree, the brilliant children's book artist. I have never come across any other game with a Harry Rowntree credit. NOTE: The artist was Harry Rountree but Jaques spelt it wrong on the box of this game. Now he is known with the Jaques spelling on some internet sites but Wikipedia confirms the correct spelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
