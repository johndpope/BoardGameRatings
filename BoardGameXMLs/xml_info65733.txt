			<description>Politics and revenge are a dangerous mix!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life in the spacelanes is hard, and spacers have to go where the money is. In this case, that means tracking down the kidnapped daughter of a senior member of the powerful Galactic Trade Assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the explosive energy crystal world of Kerexi IV to the gas processing spacestation known as Dante and onward to a secret starship controlled by a powerful criminal fraternity, the heroes are plagued by vicious bounty hunters led by the ruthless and cunning Pandit Morg, an alien psion armed with a very deadly weapon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While avoiding the hunters is hard enough, the stakes are raised when it becomes clear who the kidnappers work for&amp;mdash;the much-feared Shandarma Brotherhood. Say, didn&amp;rsquo;t someone steal one of their ships? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll get lucky and they&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten you, or maybe revenge is high on the Brotherhood&amp;rsquo;s agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daring Tales of the Space Lanes #2 also contains a system for creating your own space pulp planets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
