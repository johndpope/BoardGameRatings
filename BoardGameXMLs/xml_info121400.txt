			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No dragon to defeat, mystery to solve or treasure to find in this graphical adventure game. Sylvie Linott left you four months ago, but you're still in love and can't get her out of your head. You resolve to go and talk to her. Easier said than done as night is falling, she still lives with her parents, and her mother has made it perfectly clear how much she hates you. Can you find sylvie's room without waking up her mother?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
