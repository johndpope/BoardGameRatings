			<description>Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D  features several contrasting modes of gameplay, including side-view platforming, top-view, and horizontal shoot 'em up. It follows Jim Power in Mutant Planet as a different title, but at the same time reinterpreting the original game by taking many basic elements and levels from it. The soundtrack was composed by Chris Hulsbeck of Turrican fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D is often considered by gaming aficionados to be one of the most difficult games ever made. Despite its name, it is an entirely 2D game, although the game uses many layers of parallax scrolling backgrounds moving in opposite directions to give a great sense of depth. Together with the 3D glasses that were packaged with the game, designed around the Pulfrich effect, this provided a unique &amp;quot;3D&amp;quot; experience for the time when polygonal 3D graphics were rudimentary and too expensive to implement. The 3D feeling could also be related to the overhead stages, showing rotating effects in the same vein than those depicted in similar games like Contra III: The Alien Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
