							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Irrelevant Notes and Letters to Bamboozle Players</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will often come across various notes and letters that are important and useful to whatever quest they are pursuing. However, if only important notes are detailed, it becomes pretty clear which ones are relevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, then, are 100 different notes, letters, demands, lists, reports, threats, evidence of conspiracies or the ravings of madmen that all look like they might be important, but have no actual meaning - unless, of course, the GameMaster decides otherwise. These can be used to answer the question, &amp;quot;What do we find?&amp;quot; with some misleading answers. Alternatively, they could be used as a source of adventure hooks or ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two tables. The main one is the list of actual notes and there is a supplementary one that gives 12 different conditions for the notes to be found in (a thirteenth is naturally neither damaged nor unusual).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the notes are suitable for any setting, including modern and futuristic. Some may need tweaking to remove references to magic or supernatural creatures. Names and places can be added or changed to be more relevant to a setting or adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had to do it didn&amp;rsquo;t I? I thought my skills would easily be sufficient for the task - the prize was so great after all. A treasure of vast worth, one which would enable me to retire to a life of permanent luxury. How mistaken I was. Even now I can feel the foul magics I accidentally invoked coursing through my body, gradually destroying it. I do not have much time left now. Do not go after the treasure yourself; you will only come to regret it, as I have, for what little will remain of your life afterwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter and one is the introduction and ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
