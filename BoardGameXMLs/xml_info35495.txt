			<description>A promotional board game issued with the Video release of the movie.&lt;br/&gt;The rules are listed on the game board itself, as well as a note that you need to provide your own die and counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game board:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Help Westley to rescue the beautiful Princess Buttercup from the evil clutches of the kidnappers.  All you need is a dice, counters and the bravery to outwit the monsters and win the battles in your quest.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple roll-and-move game, with the odd square providing bonuses such as &amp;quot;Win the fight with rodents of unusual size.  Go forward 3&amp;quot;, and the occasional problems such as &amp;quot;Delayed by torture, go back 3&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
