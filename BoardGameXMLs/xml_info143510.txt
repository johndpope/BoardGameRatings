			<description>The main item in Town Center: Manhattan is a T-shirt printed with a Town Center game board that's been designed for solitaire play. The game board in question features Manhattan's Central Park and surrounding blocks, and if multiple people own the shirt and components, then presumably they could play competitively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Town Center: Manhattan was first offered as a funding perk for the Indiegogo campaign for the 3rd edition of Town Center It was also included in the Town Center (fourth edition), funded via Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
