			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are defined by Skills and Traits.  Skills provide modifiers to die rolls, and usually have values of +1 to +4.  Traits include a variety of other abilities, relationships, or specialties.  Action resolution uses a modified die roll applied to a Skill and compared to a target difficulty known as The Ladder (similar to the mechanic used in Fudge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most unusual aspect of the game, however, is the focus on product marketing and business income.  While the game does contain some physical confrontation, play typically focuses on developing products and taking them to market in a dystopian near future society somewhat like a &amp;quot;cyberpunk&amp;quot; setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was submitted to the Game Chef 2013 Competition in two formats - an original format and within a few days a revised format (the original was withdrawn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
