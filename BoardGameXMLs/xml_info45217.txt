							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caverns of Chaos</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return to the most famous caves complex of the RPG history!&lt;br/&gt;Caverns of Chaos is an expanded version of the dungeon where all of us have cut our teeth in the early days of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;copy;. These maps can be assembled to form a huge map (25,5 x 22 inches) or used individually. Each map contains one or more dungeons, which can extend in other maps and in other dungeons (secret doors divide these dungeons, so it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to decide if these doors exist or not). The Caverns of Chaos contain 19 different dungeons divided in six sheets. Small hints for adventure in these dungeons follow (the product contains the complete list from A to U):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A - Den of Kobolds: A dangerous tribe of kobolds is said to dwell in these caves. It is rumored that the kobolds worship some sort of monster hiding in a pool of murky water within their caves.&lt;br/&gt;B - Abandoned Tomb: This is an undead-infested old tomb. It is said that a strange water-driven mechanism is the sole way to open the ancient sarcophagus in the tomb.&lt;br/&gt;C - Troll&amp;rsquo;s Lair: A fierce couple of trolls dwell in this dungeon. Adventurers report that the trolls have found some magical item that made them smarter than usual. Other magical items might be found in the dangerous caves.&lt;br/&gt;D - Ogre&amp;rsquo;s Lair: A single old-looking ogre lives in this small dungeon. People report he&amp;rsquo;s not hostile but helpful of information about the caverns.&lt;br/&gt;E - Goblin&amp;rsquo;s Lair: Dangerous goblins calling themselves &amp;ldquo;the cracked skull tribe&amp;rdquo; dwell in these caverns. They are well organized and always on guard.&lt;br/&gt;F - Hobgoblin&amp;rsquo;s Caves: This large complex houses a powerful hobgoblin clan. It&amp;rsquo;s rumored that their leader, a muscled white-haired hobgoblin, draws his power from a mysterious giant statue found in their caverns.&lt;br/&gt;G - Stalactites Caves: These caves are mostly empty, but an old adventurer swore to have seen a stalactite encrusted by precious gemstones protected by a huge serpent with woman&amp;rsquo;s head.&lt;br/&gt;H - Lair of the Summoner: It is said that these caves are home of Umanus, an old wizard who turned to evil and found refuge in the caverns when the people of the keep banished him. Rumors report that the evil mage has gathered (or summoned) many monsters that now dwell with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
