			<description>The Dutch game association Ducosim publishes the game magazine Spel!. With this magazine they will publish several 'Spel!enkaarten' (gamecards). These are games which fit on a A5 card. #0020 is 'Maurice vs. Niek', and was published for the 40 year anniversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an area enclosure game by Martyn F for 2-4 players. Each player controls 3 committee members on a 12x9 board. Each turn, a player moves one of his committee members in a straight line, and then places two blocking pieces (Ducosim members) on a spot where two of his committee members could move to. A player controls an enclosed area if he has the only committee member there.&lt;br/&gt;The person with the most enclosed squares (most are worth 1, some 11) wins the game when a player can take no more moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
