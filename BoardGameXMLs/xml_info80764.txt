							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Empire Fights Back</name>
									
			<description>From the game inlay card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Three intergalactic wars during the past Millenium  have weakened the Empire which is now fighting to regain it's power and status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rebel colony of mutants have taken over an old warship and are seeding the galaxy with deadly space mines in an attempt to gain control over the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been selected to pilot the miniature space craft 'Air Wolf 2000' and must enter the massive space mines to disable their control cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, you have limited energy, so during your trips to the space mines try to avoid contact with the meteorites and stay on course (centre of the radar scanner).  Inside the mines you must control your own robot and can only survive by understanding the movement patterns of the service drones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select which of the five mines to tackle first but beware of the fifth, it is linked to the other four and you need to conquer these first to open all channels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
