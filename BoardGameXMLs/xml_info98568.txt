							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Postmodern: Iconic Combat Feats</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have more fun in combat-- with this pdf of 129 feats for your Modern d20 game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Postmodern: Iconic Combat Feats expands on the core combat feats from the d20 Modern roleplaying game-- building on such favorites as Power Attack, Point Blank Shot, Bull Rush, Combat Expertise, and so on-- to present 108 dynamic new feats guaranteed to give new life to Modern games by taking the tactics and abilities of the feats you know and creating a whole family of complimentary feats for each one. The strategies and mechanics you thought you knew become more applicable and more useful as your game progresses into higher levels, making Modern d20 characters more potent and interesting than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond those 108 iconic feats, 14 unarmed fighting style feats add granularity and flavor to the d20 Modern roleplaying game's generic martial arts material, while potent new applications for action points and 7 action point related feats further expand the possibilities for dramatic action and cinematic excitement in any Modern d20 game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
