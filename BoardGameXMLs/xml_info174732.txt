							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imbroglio</name>
									
			<description>Imbroglio is a fun, fast-paced tile laying game where the players are racing to escape an ever changing maze full of mythological beasts, natural disasters, and a handful of colorful characters who are also trying to be the first to escape. Each time you play, the game is quite different with custom characters, a lot of strategy, and a dash of luck.&lt;br/&gt; Imbroglio is a game for 2-7 players and has multiple styles of play, from player vs player to players vs board.  An average game can be played in 45-60 minutes, but with possible expansions in the future, games could be expanded to almost any length.  The basic mechanics of the game are a mix of tile laying, resource management, and dice rolling.  &lt;br/&gt; Our original thought would be that the game would be targeted toward families or gamers who like mythology, strategy, and 'sticking it' to other players.  That being said, the game is quite modular and could accommodate many different game genres!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
