			<description>&amp;quot;Wargame for 2 or more players. Fantasy Northern theme. Victory: Destroy all enemy units.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chess board or other 8x8 grid. Map tiles are randomly distributed in the center 49 squares, the border squares being considered sea spaces. The terrain tiles come in eight different types: tundra, glacier, water, villages, forest, mountains, peaks, and hills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with one Hero unit placed on a Village tile. The players must recruit units and build armies. Units that may be recruited include Norsemen, Barbarians, Viking Ships, Northern Dwarves, White Dragons, Frost Giants, Polar Bears, Ice Witches, and Yetis. A deck of Spell Cards is used to determine the capabilities of units that have magical powers. Players can augment their forces with relics (Magic Axe, Druid's Staff, or Banner) which increase the power of certain units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
