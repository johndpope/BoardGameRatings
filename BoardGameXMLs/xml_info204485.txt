			<description>(publisher's blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to NeoNihon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese colonization ship landed on the extra-solar planet of Shi Tateyama in 2236. Like the other corporate nation-states fleeing old earth, Japan used remote planetary surveys to target their colonization efforts. This planet seemed to be just what they were looking for; a paradise with abundant water, a comfortable climate and a vibrant biosphere. Once the colonists awoke from their decade-long cryofreeze, they found the planet was far less pleasant than planetary surveys indicated. It was a planet of extreme mountains, nearly boiling sea-level temperatures and harsh, corrosive tempests. The rain corroded most metal and unusual electromagnetic characteristics at sea level fried most electronics. The Colonial Board of Directors made the decision to settle on the cooler, dryer, and safer mountain peaks, with each corporation founding their own colony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planet was poor in metals, with the rain dissolving most of the natural ore deposits. Earth-born livestock couldn&amp;rsquo;t survive and the only arable land was in the harsh lowlands. The scientists produced genetically engineered humans called henomin to labour for the colonies. These henomin were sent down to the lowlands to grow rice, extract protein from the seas, and grow iron-hard black bamboo. Wandering, devout androids delivered messages between villages, shrines, and great colony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
