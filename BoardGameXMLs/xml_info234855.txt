							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Karth: Deathmatch</name>
									
			<description>The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Karth: Deathmatch is a fantasy deck-building card game based on the Heroes of Karth book series. Choose 2 hero cards to lead your unit cards! Arm yourself with spell and treasure cards!! Then hire and position your cards onto the battlefield, with victory coming to the first to collect 40 unspent gold or 25 kill points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try and outwit their opponent&amp;rsquo;s strategy in a tabletop game where the cards are the game pieces and players use gold to spawn additional cards onto the battlefield. Balance between using gold to hire units, mercenaries and heroes and saving your gold for the win condition. Utilize a wide range of strategies including ranged or melee classes, spells, pets, magic items, traps, poison, stealth units, healers, totems, and the undead curse. With over 200 cards rendered with stunningly beautiful original artwork, the deck-building choices are unlimited. Play a deathmatch where the careful management of resources and placement of your cards can make the difference between winning and losing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From deep in the bowels of the Mines of Taas to the human kingdom of Hathaway, the Curse of the Undead is spreading across Green Valley like the vilest of plagues, wiping out all life in its path. Employing his army of shades to drain their life energy, Xeon the Undead Shadow Dragon has destroyed thousands of worlds throughout the millennia, and the world of Karth is next in his path of destruction. A chance meeting between Llythwain, autistic son of an elf Ranger and Killian, an undead shade has altered the familiar pattern of events, sowing the seeds of a monumental clash between the living and the dead, between good and evil, between the Allegiance and the Shard and Xeon's ferocious undead army. &amp;quot;The Undead Curse threatens Green Valley! The human necromancers are to blame!&amp;quot; With the utterance of those words by the Elven Lords, the Allegiance pact between humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and barbarians weakens, just as that of the Shard races grows in strength. By uniting the ogres, goblins, spiders, orcs, kobolds and hill giants under one banner, Xeon has awakened ancient hatred between the two mighty factions and the Shard is ready for war. A group of heroes, a human, gnome, and two dwarves led by an elf mage must gather the strength and courage to unlock the secret of the Undead Curse, but their time is running out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
