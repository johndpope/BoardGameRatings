			<description>Blitzkrieg Challenged: The Battle of Dinant: May 12-15, 1940, is an introductory level game of the battle between the French Armed forces and Germany&amp;rsquo;s Wehrmacht on May 12th through 15th, 1940. The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The German&amp;rsquo;s 5th Panzer Corps drove the Belgian and French screening forces through the Ardennes forest, then sought to cross the Meuse River near Dinant. A breakthrough here, as well as further south at Sedan, would split the Allied forces in two. A protracted and bloody battle was not in the German war plans...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the third game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series, covering the battle at an operational scale. Designed for 2 players, taking on the roles of the French and German commanders, the game is suitable for solitaire play as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Flying Dice Games edition features all new graphics by Bruce Yearian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implementation of Rommel in France, Dinant, May 1940.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1.5 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 1 miles / 1.61 kilometer&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion to Regiments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 11x17&amp;quot; full color map&lt;br/&gt;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (224 1/2&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&lt;br/&gt;One 6-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Three Player Aid Charts (TEC/CRT)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
