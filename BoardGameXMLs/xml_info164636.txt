			<description>The game is played with cardboard figures, called UPUP figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPUP figures lost their identities! They must find out who they are but only by asking each others questions.&lt;br/&gt;Players hold two UPUP figures in each hand facing towards other players so that they can't see the identities of their own figures.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns in clockwise order and do one of the two actions:&lt;br/&gt;(1) ask any one player if he/she sees any specific color OR letter in everyone's left OR right hands;&lt;br/&gt;(2) claim one UPUP figure's identity (both color and letter must be correctly identified)&lt;br/&gt;The player who manages to identifies both his/her figures wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
