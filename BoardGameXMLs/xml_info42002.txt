			<description>Auction Blocks is a bidding game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  Stonehenge is being dismantled, and everyone wants a piece!  The thirty stones of the outer ring are auctioned, one at a time, and then the five trilithons.  Players place blind bids for a stone, but the bids utilize the trump rule of a trick-taking game.  Additionally, a player may include a trilithon card with their bid to nullify that trump rule, making that particular auction a standard blind bid.  The winner of an auction gets the stone, which is worth points equal to however many of that stone she now has (&amp;times;2 if the new acquisition is a trilithon).  The winner of the auction gets no new cards, and the lowest non-zero bid gets two new cards; everyone else, one.  The first player to 20 points wins; or, if the last trilithon is auctioned with no one getting there, the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auction Blocks is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
