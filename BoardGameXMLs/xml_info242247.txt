			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to save the galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to 8-Bit Adventures! Do you yearn for a simpler time, when video games scrolled right and you only had to deal with 2 buttons at a time? An era where blocky, colorful, vaguely recognizable shapes made up heroes that battled odd and often confusing villains with little to no context? Then Fat Goblin Games has you covered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product line is designed to take a nostalgic look at the iconic video games of the past and bring those adventures to life in your campaigns in the Starfinder Roleplaying Game with all new options. Each volume will include creatures, magic items, and maybe more! The names have been changed, but the flavor remains the same to ensure that the references are easy to see. Each volume will describe a different game world, each inspired by a classic game sure to inspire nostalgia in even the most hardened of veterans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume covers the assault of Mother Mind on the Union System. The A.I. has an army of space pirates and genetically engineered creatures at her disposal, ranging from the lowly alien jelly up to Mother Mind herself. Most of the aliens presented here include optional variants to help encompass the vast array of foes found across the many landscapes of the Union System. These foes provide a wealth of options to challenge parties of any level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for the poor people of the Union System, the Bounty Hunter isnt available. This means that your PCs are going to have to step up and help out! Luckily there are a variety of helpful items available, from the red nova plasma pistol and cryo-missile, to the powerful mech suit and Hunter-Class Gunship. Everything you need to include these flavorful items into the Starfinder Roleplaying Game can be found in this volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these pages you'll find 8 Iconic Creatures and 1 Boss Character, 9 new feats, 4 themed spells, 8 Iconic Equipment Items, Starfinder Animal Companions and Familiars, 5 Part Campaign Kit, and 1 Map to add a little vintage flair to your campaign. Whether you use a single alien or run a whole campaign against the legendary Mother Mind, youll be sure to find a memorable foe within!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
