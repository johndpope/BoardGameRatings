							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AWE: Antediluvian Wars â€“ Extermination</name>
									
			<description>Antediluvian Wars - Extermination, &amp;quot;AWE&amp;quot; for short, is a tactical card game for 2 - 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWE is non-collectible but very much expandable. The base set will consist four pre-built decks, 30 cards each, so it is playable right out of the box and thus non-customizable. However new, additional sets will add deck customization as an option as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In AWE, each player assumes the role of a mighty god ruling over one out of four fascinating factions, the goal of the game being to breach the opponent defenses and destroy all the opponent guardians in order to &amp;quot;dethrone&amp;quot; their god. An undefended attack will lead to the destruction of one guardian and if there are none left, a direct attack dethrones the opponent god, spelling defeat for that opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWE is set in a historically not at all accurate prehistory, where four advanced, lost civilizations - Atlantis, Hyperborea, Lemuria and Mu - vie for ultimate domination. The game will feature awesome and fantastic untis you can send into battle such as Raptor and Pterodactyl Riders, Zombie T-Rex's reanimated by black magic, advanced Vimana aircraft, War Mammoths and much more, as well as a pleasant mix of unique and exciting mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a collaboration between talented Indonesian artist Widodo Pangarso and Austrian Game Designer Andreas Propst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
