							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snowdonia: Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel</name>
									
			<description>Printed on a postcard-sized, er, postcard this promo station card was given away free with Lookout Games's magazine Neues von Ausguck (Winter, 2014); it may also be available with purchases from their online store (while stocks last!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place a track card and this station between Llanberis and the Pub.&lt;br/&gt;When you excavate, you can choose this track card or the track going up the mountain. The game does NOT excavate, or Build, towards/on the Hotel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever you build in Pen-Y-Gwrd, move your Surveyor along one Station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;The Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel was originally a simple farmhouse dating from 1811 and would, later, become an Inn. The hotel's most notable mountaineering connections are largely due the first successful Everest expedition in 1953 and the Kangchenjunga expedition in 1955, where training and testing of oxygen equipment for those expeditions took place, at Helyg near Capel Curig. On the right at the hotel entrance there is a Tyrolean style Stuberl with the signatures, written on the ceiling, of the team that did the first ascent of Everest in 1953 and of the successful first ascent of Kangchenjunga in 1955, these include Sir Edmund Hillary, Tenzing Norgay, Sir John Hunt, Charles Evans, George Band, Joe Brown, John Angelo Jackson, Wilfred Noyce, Tony Streather, Tom Mackinnon, Norman Hardie, Neil Mather, John Clegg and others including Noel Odell from Mallory's 1924 expedition and Chris Bonington of later successes. There are many photographs and exhibits provided by the original team members in the main bar and guest lounge. In the past each year, now every five years, Pen-y-Gwryd hosts the Everest and Kangchenjunga reunions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
