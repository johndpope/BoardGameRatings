							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Masters of Gettown</name>
									
			<description>In a world where humanity has fled from a dying solar system and colonised an alien planet, there is only one fast way to untold fame and riches. Each year, the mega city of Gettown plays host to a gladiatorial arena match like no other... 'The Tournament'. Combatants with powerful abilities and high tech weaponry, fight to the death to win wealth, fame and, the ultimate position of Master of Gettown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masters of Gettown is the world's first 'full contact dice' battling game. To that end, each game sees all players throwing combat dice in to a three dimensional acrylic arena, trying to end with the highest combat score each turn to either deal damage or defend themselves. During the game, players are encouraged to throw their dice at their own or other player's dice in order to physically change their value as well as activate character or combat abilities via the custom 'ability' die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this new 'full contact dice' combat mechanic, interchangeable arena bases (covered in various effect areas to aim for and avoid), a plethora of different characters and futuristic weaponry to equip them with, no two games will ever be the same. Also, with the inclusion of both easy to learn 'beginner' rules as well as 'experienced' rules, players can quickly get to grips with the practice of throwing their dice at other dice and then move on to advanced aspects of the game like bidding hit points and equipment drafting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
