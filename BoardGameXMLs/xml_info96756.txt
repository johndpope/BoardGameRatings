			<description>From the manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Chivalry, an exciting new concept in computer board games for 1 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King is held captive at The Castle of the Black Knight, on the lower right side of the game board. The players assemble at The Fair Castle, on the upper left side of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nobles travel the path as directed by the computer (Basically Roll-And-Move 1 to 3 spaces.), bravely attempting the tasks given, playing games, following advice, and making decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are more than 20 seperate games contained within Chivalry. Some, like the shell game at The Witches' Brew Inn, need no explanation. All games can be played by following the general instructions (in the manual).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first noble to reach the Black Knight and defeat him will rescue the King and be named the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
