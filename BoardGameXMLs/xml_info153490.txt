							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Desert Town</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 40 x 40 inch Battlemap of a Desert Town, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scale is slightly over 5ft per inch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you sure we should do this Stu? We could just evacuate with everyone else&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desert Town is a single external view map of a ruined desert town with two roads with a single intersection splitting the town into four quadrants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desert Town is intended for use in modern or post apocalyptic games. The map can also be used as an abandoned town on a planet with a low technology level in a near or far future science fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Remnants: An earthquake hit the small desert town. But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t close to the worst of it. The earthquake caused a nuclear meltdown at a nearby nuclear power plant. The desert winds picked up the radiation and started spreading it towards the town. The town was ordered evacuated. Not everyone made it out of town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stu had always known this day would come. Rather than evacuate, his family holed up in his perfect bomb shelter that he had built underneath his house when he heard the nuclear power plant was planned near the town. Unfortunately for Stu and his family, the earthquake had caused cracks in the foundation of the bomb shelter. The radiation from the fallout seeped into the bomb shelter through the cracks. Stu and his family started to mutate gaining claws and slowly losing most of their senses except for an acute sense of touch. They began to have the urge to escape and used their claws to burrow through the bomb shelter and break into the earth. The earth felt good to move through and they found they could hold their breath for a long time now. Stu and his mutant family only surfaced for air and meals, feeding on anything they sensed moving above them. People and animals alike became food to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivors who have banded together have decided to put an end to this family of creatures that has been killing them and their pets as well as what is left of local game to eat. They hire the player characters to track and kill the creatures. The group tracks them back to the desert town where they lair. Killing the mutants in territory they know intimately will be no easy feat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
