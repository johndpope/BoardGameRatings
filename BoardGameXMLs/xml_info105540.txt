			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dastardly robber band led by the notorious rogue, Rex the Reaver, has stolen the precious Datestones from the ducal calendar of Ryn. Your mission is to recover the Datestones before Rex and his cutthroats slip away in the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're working against the clock to retrieve the stolen treasures. You must finish your quest before the sun sets! In the Datestones of Ryn, the real time action keeps you on the edge of your seat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the hero, Brian Hammerhand--a mercenary at large--as you explore the cave complex where the robbers have taken refuge. But watch out for the other inhabitants! Especially the deadly slime!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Datestones of Ryn is a fantasy role playing adventure with more than a dozen real-time play options--and they're all easy to use single-key commands. Fight or flee, parry or thrust, heal your wounds or speak with monsters. The choice is always yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Datestones of Ryn has a built-in competitive scoring system that lets you measure how well you do in successive playings and allows you to test your prowess against that of your friends. Can you snatch every last Datestone from the robbers grasp? Remember, you've only got 20 minutes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your computer draws a map of the Dunjon, keeps track of the number of Datestones and other treasures you find, and handles all the rules, so The Datestones of Ryn is easy to learn and fun to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you emerge the victor, carrying the Datestones and the head of Rex the Reaver? Or will you meet defeat--pierced through by a cold steel blade from the shadows?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Superb graphics! Computer-generated map. (With the Apple and Atari you get high-resolution color and sound!)&lt;br/&gt;     Real time&lt;br/&gt;     A race against the clock!&lt;br/&gt;     Competitive scoring system&lt;br/&gt;     For ages 10 through adult&lt;br/&gt;     Complexity: Introductory&lt;br/&gt;     Playing time: 10 to 20 minutes&lt;br/&gt;     For one player &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
