							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hope Prep #3: Field Trip (ICONS)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The freshman class goes on a field trip to explore the research facilities of Lieder Industries. While on the trip, the PCs are accidentally sent through a dimensional portal to the Twisted Earth that invaded during Hope Prep #1: The Substitute (ICONS). Worse yet, they soon discover that their parallel versions are back on their Earth &amp;mdash; potentially creating a social nightmare for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field Trip is a scenario in the HPS Freshman Year story arc. It may be played as a standalone, or it may be used with first-year characters who are already established in the Hope Preparatory School setting. A map of Lieder Industries and a range of NPCs provide everything a gamemaster needs to run the scenario and experience a day in the life of a metahuman student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario also provides background and game information on Lieder Industries. This company is responsible for many of the amazing advances that propel metahuman life in the world of Hope Preparatory School-and a few of the complications as well. Their &amp;quot;Plumbers&amp;quot; are highly trained in repairing leaks in the fabric of reality, and in dealing with the consequences of those leaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hope Prep School Freshman Handbook provides additional details about the HPS setting used in this scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
