			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story - One day in Feudal Japan, Kid Niki, the most radical of ninjas, is training at his Ninja School. Suddenly, a passing bird is struck down by an arrow and lands at Niki's feet. Attached is a note explaining that Niki's girlfriend, Princess Margo, has been kidnapped by the evil Stone Wizard. With the cry of &amp;quot;Will help you!&amp;quot; Niki bursts through the wall of his school and sets off on his quest to save Margo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay - Kid Niki is armed with the Spinning Sword, which according to the game's manual, &amp;quot;has been passed down from generation to generation from the School of Chirin.&amp;quot;  In addition to the spinning sword, Kid Niki can gain extra offensive power by collecting Bells. The Golden Bell allows him to launch a projectile every time Kid Niki spins his sword, and the Silver Bell creates a spinning force field around him. Both of these power-ups last for a limited amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
