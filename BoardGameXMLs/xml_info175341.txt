							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Average Modern Shopping Mall</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob was out of breath as he staggered through the automatic door to the mall. His lungs were on fire and his muscles ached, but he knew that he couldn't quit now. He started the day with six full clips of ammunition, now only one round remained in his ASPs pistol. He had decided to save that one in case he guessed wrong and there was no ammunition available anywhere in the Ambry Square Mall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob glanced back at the automatic doors and expected to see a mass of undead flooding through the opening, but there was no movement and nothing but eerie silence. Ahead  he spotted one of the mall's directory displays. He chaotically scanned the directory . &amp;quot;Beautiful Brains  and Games...no,&amp;quot; he said absently to no one in particular. &amp;quot; &amp;quot;Up In Arms&amp;quot; - Floyd Toastmaster's Survival Gear &amp;amp; Armory..promising, Silver Gryphon Games...no, Rohan's Chainsaw and Dynamite Emporium..okay, but not exactly what I'm looking for, Juv-N8 Health Spa...nope, Sizzled Wyvern Tavern...later maybe, Sapper Joe 's Wargaming &amp;amp; Toys...no, Fighting Pirannha Graphics, no.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, Jacob smiled and thrust his fist into the air. &amp;quot;Schott's Guns...now we're cookin' with gas!&amp;quot; Just as suddenly, Jacob heard the doors to the mall slide open and saw several shambling figures enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the full-scale map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave. Grab a copy of Modern Floorplans: An Average Modern Pool Hall today, and keep an eye out for future releases!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map is a 2-story 100 store mall that is over 1.5 million square feet. Provided are 9 repeating store floor plans and one detailed anchor store. In addition, the surrounding parking lot, food court and children's play area have been detailed. Also two sheets of fixture icons have also been provided, which will allow users to either use repeating floor plans or detail a space themself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the size of this structure, the map has been broken up in to several large-format vignettes that players can print out and throw on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
