			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to &amp;quot;Whispers in the Dark&amp;quot;, the first campaign supplement for Supers20! In this street-level campaign model, the PCs are gifted with magical abilities, recruited and trained by a mysterious sorcerer to combat the cult of an elder god that is spreading its worship throughout the world like a cancer.&lt;br/&gt;While the people of their home city go about their daily lives, a war for the very safety of their dimension is being waged in secret, from the glittering skyscrapers high above to the dank sewers beneath their feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wars between the servants of light and the servants of the elder gods have been waged for millennia and are the source of countless &amp;ldquo;war in heaven&amp;rdquo; myths, including those found in Babylonian, Christian, Greek and Norse religions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
