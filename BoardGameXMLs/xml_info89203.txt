			<description>Divine is a game for 2 to 4 players in which you assume the role of a Deity trying to spread their religion in ancient times. You can use your divine powers to quickly gain followers or deviously attack your competing religions. Priests, Zealots, Prophets, and Avatars are your pawns of strategic influence in a developing city which you must control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board consists of 9 tiles that are randomly placed at the beginning of the game to represent an ancient city. Each tile consists of a 36 square grid that depicts various special locations within the city. Players start by controlling a single temple that allows them to train either Priests or Zealots. Priests can preach to gain followers based on the population of each spot on the game board; however, they are vulnerable to be assassinated by an opponent's Zealot. Priests can also establish new temples throughout the city, which can also be desecrated and destroyed by an opponent's Zealot. Unit movement is dictated by multiple dice rolls equal to the number of temples you control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can use divinity cards from their hand to change the outcome of certain scenarios. More powerful units like Prophets and Avatars can only be created by using specific divinity cards. By taking control of special spaces on the board players can also receive additional bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game players must carefully choose a win condition to work towards. A player wins the game if they are the first to 1) amass 100 follower tokens or 2) capture all 4 tower spaces or 3) be the only remaining player with a temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
