			<description>Each player drives a taxi cab that they use to pickup passengers from locations determined by dice rolling to a destination determined by a dice rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Payment is determined by the route taken and the distance traveled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intersections can provide an advantage or a disadvantage to each player. Intersections can be clear, have lights or be completely blocked, which changes the route chosen by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also get in each others way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
