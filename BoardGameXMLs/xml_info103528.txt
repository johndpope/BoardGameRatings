			<description>From the Designer's Announcement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MOST AWESOME THING YOU'LL NEVER SEE!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one posts on Tuesdays, so I'm posting. They should have thought of that when they told me to post all those Monday meeting notes a couple years ago. Let's call this &amp;quot;Bax's Inside Awesomeness,&amp;quot; because what's inside me is, in fact, awesome (even if Brian says what's inside of me is mostly smelly cheese).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ethan and John talk about what it's like to be a developer, but no one talks about what it's like to be the little guy, the one whose ideas and dreams get stomped on because someone else doesn't like it. I busted my ass for weeks on this project, and no one thinks it's awesome. I mean, how can it not be awesome? It's got booze and vikings and breaking shit in it! IT IS MORE AWESOME THAN CAN BE SAFELY CONTAINED IN ONE PLACE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever. I don't care what matt and Ethan and Rich and Kelley and everyone else says. My ideas are cool. Sexalted would sell like hotcakes, and so would Shadows of Iceland. So screw it. Here's a link for you guys to see what could have been, a sample of my ideas cut down in their prime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I still have some ice wine to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
