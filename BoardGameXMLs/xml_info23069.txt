			<description>In Monogramz, 30 lettered dice are shaken into a tray which divides them into 15 sets of two. Each player's objective is then to list names of celebrities with the same initials as each 2-letter monogram. When the hourglass timer runs out, the lists are scored and unique names earns the player points.&lt;br/&gt;Special symbols on some of the faces of the dice denote the following categories that the celebrities' names must belong to: Authors &amp;amp; Artists; Entertainers; Athletes; and World Leaders. Although these symbols restrict the choice of category, regarding letters they act as wild cards. There is also a further symbol denoting &amp;quot;Wild!&amp;quot;, meaning any letter, any category.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a set number of rounds, or when a player reaches a set number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
