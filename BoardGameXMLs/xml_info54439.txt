							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Primer of Practical Magic</name>
									
			<description>From title page:&lt;br/&gt;Spells and artifacts from the Dying Earth, made available for use in D20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;The Primer of Practical Magic is filled with extraordinary spells and items and new powers for the magicians in your campaign.  Whether you wish to spin your enemies to death with Phandaal's Gyrator, or control them like a puppet with Clambard's Rein of the Long Nerves, this is the libram for the discerning wizard's library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Primer contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 100 spells of all levels and schools such as Shabat's Obliging Demon&lt;br/&gt;     34 carefully wrought cantrips&lt;br/&gt;     22 magic items, including the Cloud of Knives and Laccodel's Protective Rune&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for growing henchmen and creatures in vats&lt;br/&gt;     New rare ingredients for magical research&lt;br/&gt;     New character classes such as the fearsome Diabolist and feats for different abilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these magical tidbits find their way to you from The Dying Earth RPG, but you don't need to know the Dying Earth RPG to use and appreciate the powerful sorcery within.  The Primer has been carefully balanced and playtested to work with the latest rules, and provides a subtle but distinct advantage to those possessing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
