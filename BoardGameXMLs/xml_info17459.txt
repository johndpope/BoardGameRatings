			<description>The Game of Travel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel the world with Lufthansa. Whether you plan your course strategically or react spontaneously to the game, your challenge is to defeat both your opponents and chance. Buying the right to fly to an airport is the key within the game because such rights, like in real life, are rare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is in the box (German):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Spielbrett&lt;br/&gt;1 W&amp;uuml;rfel&lt;br/&gt;100 Spielmarken in 5 Farben&lt;br/&gt;42 Ortsnamen-Karten&lt;br/&gt;70 Markierungsst&amp;auml;bchen&lt;br/&gt;5 Flugzeuge&lt;br/&gt;10 Sonderflug-Karten&lt;br/&gt;32 Linienflug-Karten&lt;br/&gt;18 &amp;Uuml;berraschungs-Karten&lt;br/&gt;Spielgeld&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is essentially a 1d6 Roll-and-move game where card-driven routes are assigned. Routes are assigned by 1st drawing from the 10 Sonderflug Charters) cards and, when they are exhausted, from the 32 Linienflug (Scheduled) cards. Each connected city uses 1 'movement point'. When the move ends on a city the player pays a 'Landing Fee'. Most fees are 500 but a scattering of 10, 15, and 20 are purchased by the additional payment of the landing fee (a la Monopoly properties). Multiples of these will eventually allow doubling or tripling of fees for the other players.  The only need for reading German is for the 18 Uberraschungs (Surprise) cards. Plays continues until all but 1 player is bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
