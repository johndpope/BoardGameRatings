			<description>From the Core Book's Forward&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to an epic, millennia-spanning, strategic roleplaying game where you claim your birthright, rally loyal followers to your cause, and forge a dynasty to stand the test of time. During a RED AEGIS campaign, your decedents, called scions, will lead successive generations from the setting's ancient past to the far future from axe-wielding savages to planetary soldiers packing gravity hammers, and everything in between. Choose your flavor of dominance through aggressive conflict, crafty subterfuge, or spiritual supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RED AEGIS is about making difficult choices. These decisions will impact not only your tribe's future, but also the fate of your descendants and the world they inhabit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stories that emerge from playing RED AEGIS are a direct result of your unique exploits while traversing through time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We would like to give a special thank you to our cadre of associate game designers. They have been instrumental in ironing out the kinks in the alpha version of this document. Each of them is a great asset to this team and their input has been invaluable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Core Book's Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RED AEGIS is a game that at once feels both familiar and unique indeed, it is a curious fusion of traditional tabletop roleplaying and 4X turn-based strategy games. In RED AEGIS, players assume the role of clan scions the would-be champions of their age. Together, the players must unite the disparate clans into a cohesive tribe to thwart a looming peril that threatens to scour their civilization from the history books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RED AEGIS combines the fast, tactical gameplay of a boardgame with the narrative storytelling and worldbuilding of traditional roleplaying games. The campaign plays out over nine game sessions, each set in a time period more advanced than the last. By the final session, thousands of years will have passed, seeing your tribe advance from primitive hunter-gatherers to a spacefaring civilization colonizing the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reflecting back upon your campaign, you'll discover a vibrant game world, its unique history and cultures designed entirely from the imaginations of you and your fellow players. That's the real secret of RED AEGIS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
