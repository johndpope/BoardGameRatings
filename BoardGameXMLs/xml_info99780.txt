			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to another installment of Modern Dispatch, a supplement for Blood and Vigilance detailing the Keystone Knights. The Knights are a Pennsylvania-based superhero team formed with the cooperation of the U.S Government and USHER. Designed by NPC-guru Paul King, the Keystone Knights can be allies, foils or even (with a dark-mirror personality change) a group of villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dispatch has seen a lot of submissions for RPGObjects' modern superhero game, Blood and Vigilance, and we hope you enjoy the love and care our favorite d20 Modern-with-a-supers-twist sourcebook is getting from our monthly contribution to the best Modern e-zine around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The governor or Pennsylvania, seeing the rise of super-powered villains, wanted to have a group that was dedicated to the protection of the commonwealth. With the aid of U.S.H.E.R., a group was founded. They took the name &amp;quot;Keystone Knights&amp;quot; because Pennsylvania is the Keystone State and they were chartered to serve and protect the citizens of Pennsylvania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
