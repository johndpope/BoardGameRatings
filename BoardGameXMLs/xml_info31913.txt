			<description>This Gabriel-Nealey Co. game is played with smooth 7/8&amp;quot; plastic chips on a 15x15 grid. The published game board has squares that are about 15/16&amp;quot; each side. The object of the game is to be the first to get 5 chips in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It is the same game as Go-Moku.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the edges of the game board are decorated with various configurations of chips, these are basic patterns from which the game may be won. Gabriel-Nealey Co. also published the 60-page booklet &amp;quot;Onino Basic Plays&amp;quot; by Henmar Ruskin, copyright 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
