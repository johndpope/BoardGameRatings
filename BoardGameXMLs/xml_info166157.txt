							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume X</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume IX, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 19 mythic spells, from gate to helping hand. A mythic gate allows you to restrict which creatures can and can&amp;rsquo;t pass through it, and, with the expenditure of additional mythic power, can open to other locations on the same plane, and be held open for hours. They can even be used as weapons, slicing into the fabric of reality in the middle of creatures or objects and rending them asunder. A mythic gentle repose is actually capable of undoing the damage decay has inflicted on a corpse, or, when augmented, can forever preserve the corpse in miniature form. Mythic ghoul touch not only lasts longer and has a wider-reaching stench, but with extra mythic power, it can become contagious, spreading from creature to creature. This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
