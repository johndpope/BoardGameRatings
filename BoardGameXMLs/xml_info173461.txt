			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;マネキング (Manekingu) is a Japanese game first published in 2014 in time for the Osaka Game Market. It was quickly re-issued in time for the Tokyo Game Market in Autumn 2014, with English included on the cards and rules, and named in English as The Mimic King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be quick to strike a pose and shout a sentence determined by a die-roll. The slowest person is out of the game. The last survivor will be honoured as The Mimic King!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of word cards and pose cards are formed in a circle, with each combo numbered from 1 to 6. After the dice are rolled, players race to identify any numbers that were not rolled, and must strike the correct poses, and shout the correct phrases. The slowest player is eliminated each round, until one player remains to be crowned Mimic King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a download pack for 'Period Drama' poses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher summary:&lt;br/&gt;サイコロを振って、出目によって決まる「ポーズ」と「セリフ」を、いち早く決めよう。一番遅かった人が脱落。最後の一人「マネキング」まで生き残れるか？&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
