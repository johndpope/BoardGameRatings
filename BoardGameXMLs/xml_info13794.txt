			<description>The object of this word game is to get rid of all your letters. Each player receives 10 letter blocks to start the game. On a turn, you must play at least 2, and no more than 4 of your letters to form a word. The word formed must connect to at least one word already played on the table (except the first word played). If you have no play, you must discard 1 of your blocks and draw a new block from the draw pile instead of playing. When a player goes out, the other players add the numbers printed on their blocks to their scores. When a player's score goes over 100 points, the player with the LEAST amount of points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
