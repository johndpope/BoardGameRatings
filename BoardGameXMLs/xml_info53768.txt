			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seemed to Fafhrd that mirages of all those unknown cities and places filled the brightening horizon. &amp;lsquo;Travel, love, adventure, the world!&amp;rsquo; he shouted, hugging Vlana to him with his right arm while his left slapped the horses with the reins. &amp;ndash; The Snow Women&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This essential book contains the expanded details on the wide world of Nehwon, adding to the information presented in the main Lankhmar book, which primarily dealt with the City of the Black Toga and the possible adventures therein. It is part-appendix to that first tome and part-expansion. Ilthmar, with all its filth and poverty; Quarmall, with all its dark and hidden sorceries; the northlands, where the temperature falls with each step north &amp;ndash; these realms are revealed in greater detail between the covers on this book, combined with the first part in a multi-scenario adventure that takes characters from Lankhmar across Nehwon and back again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, taking up the latter half of the book is the scenario Swords Across Nehwon. This scenario is designed for characters to leave the walls of Lankhmar behind them and travel the length and breadth of the wider world in their quest for adventure. It is also designed to link directly into the forthcoming scenarios such as Swords Against Sorcery, serving as the first steps on a much longer path. A number of story hooks and plot devices that occur in the adventure here tie into later scenarios, allowing Games Masters to connect the tales in one epic campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with Lankhmar, the Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
