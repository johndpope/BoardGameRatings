			<description>A 2-player territorial game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials&lt;br/&gt;A hex board having 6 hexes to a side and a supply of White and Black stones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;Each player has an allocated color (Black or White).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is initially empty. Using ABBAAB turn order. Black places a stone in an empty cell. Then White places two stones and then Black does the same; finally, White places the last stone in an empty cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;Black plays first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing two stones on empty cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You cannot place a stone that forms a triangle of three adjacent friendly stones, and you must place next to a friendly stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until both players pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;An area of empty cells encircled by both colors, and/or including the edge, counts for the player with the most stones bordering it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Areas encircled with an equal number of Black and White stones are not counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player encircling the greater number of empty cells is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special thanks to: Alain Curato, Christian Freeling, Joel Fox, Pablo Schulman, Russ Williams, for their invaluable help correcting my awful rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
