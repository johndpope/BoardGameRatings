			<description>From Magpie Game's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Epyllion, you&amp;rsquo;ll work with your friends to tell the story of Dragonia and the noble dragons who live there. You&amp;rsquo;ll get a chance to play those dragons, and contribute directly to the story your group tells. While you play, you&amp;rsquo;ll talk to each other about what you want your dragons to do, building on what each of you adds to the story, and exploring the history of Dragonia for yourselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, the armies of Dragonia drove back the Darkness and rescued the land from evil. Now the Darkness has returned, creeping into the places once thought of as safe. In this game, you are the sons and daughters of the Dragonlords, mighty rulers who need your help to investigate the rumors and discover the truth of the growing evil. Along with your fellow dragons, you will protect Dragonia and discover the true value of friendship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
