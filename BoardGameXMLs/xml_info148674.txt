			<description>Templar Queenie 2: The Secret Letters, The Tapestries &amp;amp; The Lamps, a mini-expansion for Templar: The Secret Treasures, consists of three modules that can be used individually, together, or in combination with any other modules for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Secret Letters: Each player has one secret letter tile that he can discard to replay a (valid) character that's already in his discard stack. If unused, the secret letter tile is worth 3 VP at game's end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Tapestries: Each player has one tapestry tile that he can place in a room. When Remigius awards points in a room, anyone with a tapestry in the room scores twice as many points as normal, then all tapestries in the room are discarded. If unused, the tapestry tile is worth 3 VP at game's end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Lamps: Each player has one lamp tile that he can place in a room. When Remigius or Severus ends movement in a room with a lamp, the lamp's owner scores 2 VP, then reclaims his lamp, which can be placed again on a future turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
