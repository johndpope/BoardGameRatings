							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultima 1: The Boardgame</name>
									
			<description>A remake of the original Ultima 1 computer game by Richard Garriott but in Print &amp;amp; Play boardgame format. For [1] player/solitaire gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will consist of all [4] map board continents with each map containing four quadrants printed on 11x17 sheets, which allows you to play on one board at a time or put them all together for one big gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play as one of four character types: THIEF, MAGE, FIGHTER or CLERIC who adventures across the lands of Sosaria, ie gameboards, to accomplish goals, gather gold, gather gems, weapons, armor, spells and scrolls, travelling aids, and equipment.  Adventure into Dark Dungeons, Castles, and Towns for Supplies, Equipment and information. Speak with Kings to gather information about the location of all four gems, Fight wandering monsters and evil individuals, open chest to find riches, plus level up and increase your characters abilities and win the game by discovering secret information, finding lost treasures, and defeating the evil overlord &amp;quot;Big Boss&amp;quot; Mondain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the fun of the original Ultima 1 but with more challenges, more monsters, more riches, and more fame... plus in a Print &amp;amp; Play board game format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've taken some liberty with the game since a board game can't do everything a computer can do but should keep the original play as close to the PC game as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you who have played through the original PC game, you will find that this board game will be similar experience with you traveling, searching, and fighting your way across Sosaria.  Just remember that you are now the computer and will be tracking all your stats and information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will also try to add as many random elements to the game so each time you play it will be the same Ultima 1 but with a little different experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
