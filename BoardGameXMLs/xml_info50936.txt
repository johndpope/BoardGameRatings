			<description>From the author, Robin Laws: &lt;br/&gt;Hard Helix is the first supplement for Mutant City Blues, the super-powered police procedural game. The book is an anthology of four scenarios further illuminating the genetically altered near future of the MCB setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Hard Helix: A controversial researcher into mutant powers Sidney Dorris is found murdered the evening before his scheduled announcement of a stunning scientific breakthrough. What was his secret, and who was willing to kill him for it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Vanishers: The squad&amp;rsquo;s intervention in a jewelry store robbery leads them into an operation against the new school, mutant-bolstered forces of organized crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Super Squad: A sudden death at a mutant-related riot leads the unit into the twisted world of the Super Squad, an elite policing group who work the city&amp;rsquo;s toughest streets- and have, in the process, gotten more than a little dirty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cell Division: The detectives confront a homegrown terrorist threat from a previously unknown group of mutant supremacists. Can they uncover the truth behind the Mutant Revolutionary Front- one that remains shrouded even from its own suicidally indoctrinated followers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
