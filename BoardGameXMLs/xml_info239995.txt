			<description>Super Party Battle is a college-themed card battle game in which players try to throw the best party on campus. It&amp;rsquo;s an age-old campus battle between the Jocks, the Greeks, the Hipsters, the Nerds, the Freshman, and the Evil Faculty? Yeah, we're intimately familiar with that. But this time, we're putting our gaming skills to work, and keeping score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Super Party Battle University, you and your friends will battle it out to see who's really the coolest and the most fun clique on campus. Put your party skills to the ultimate test as you fight, drink, brawl, dance, use trivia, and even sing to gain total domination over the other groups. Play wacky combos, one-off classes, and expand your party into other campus buildings to take over and throw the most epic party this school has ever seen. The game includes 4 shot glass counter cups to help you keep score, and waterproof cards so you don't have to worry about your partying ruining the party. Party on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
