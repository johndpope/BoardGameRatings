			<description>[from Publisher]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teamwork is crucial in this exciting word game. Build words with your partner. The longer the better. But be careful! Unlocked words receive no points when the round ends. Use special cards to double or triple word point values or freeze opponent's words. A great game for groups and parties!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best played with 4, 6 or 8 players in teams of two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After dealing 7 cards to each player, each player attempts to make words with their cards (with help from their teammate when it's their turn - who sits opposite) No more than 5 active words can be in front of any player at any given time. A word can be frozen or &amp;quot;locked&amp;quot; (turned over face down) and no more letter cards can be placed on that word(s). Teams work together in creating more or longer words. The longer word, the more points. Always at the end of each player's turn, he/she draws back up to 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special card in the deck including Wild (any letter A-Z), Double and Triple cards the double and triple the value of those words, Freeze which can lock an opponents word and Unfreeze which unlocks your own word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special instructions in the game for 2, 3, 5, or 7 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
