			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this primer you'll find a taste of Kata Kumbas, the Mediterranean fantasy setting for Savage Worlds! Whether you decide to play the role of a sly monk, a boastful knight or a mysterious hedge wizard, a world full of light-hearted adventure awaits you!&lt;br/&gt;In the full book you'll find a detailed setting based on medieval Italy, rules for Heirlooms and Mentors, dozens of new Edges and Hindrances, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? Prepare to step through the Gate and enter the magical world of La&amp;igrave;tia!&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Hunt Free Adventure: What is the terrible monster lurking in the fogs of the Sea of Emmar, bringing ruin and trouble to everyone? The dreaded Pillarone dragon, of course! And only a Dragon Hunter could end such a threat!&lt;br/&gt;Misunderstandings, treacheries and an enemy from far, far away await the heroes in this scenario!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kata Kumbas (KK) is probably the oldest Italian RPG, published in 1982 by Massimo Senzacqua and Agostino Carrocci. Its name means, in ancient Greek, &amp;ldquo;near the caverns&amp;rdquo; and it is a fantasy game, set in an alternate Medieval Italy, in a country called La&amp;igrave;tia (an anagram of &amp;ldquo;Italia&amp;rdquo;). Light-hearted in tone, it is infused with classical culture. If you have ever seen the movie Brancaleone or read The Name of the Rose, well, you know what Kata Kumbas is about. In 2015 Kata Kumbas was published again in Italy, totally reworked and redesigned, as a Savage Worlds setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of KK is that you play as yourself; connecting Earth and Rarte (the alternative Earth where KK takes place) there are magical Gates, through which people like you and me can pass. Visitors to La&amp;igrave;tia are welcomed by Gate Keepers, who cast upon them the Integration Spell, a special magic which &amp;ldquo;transforms&amp;rdquo; them into La&amp;igrave;tians, granting them the capacity to speak the local tongue, and making them knights, alchemists, rogues and soon, but keeping the memories and the identity of the player. These types of characters are called Integrated Ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
