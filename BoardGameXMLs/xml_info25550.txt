			<description>Age of Iron Expansion Rules - Navies in transition 1865-1890 is an expansion for the Age of Iron - Naval Combat in the Civil War  . It includes additional rules that can be applied to the original Age of Iron rules, but is also a stand alone rules set for naval miniatures wargaming in the 1865-1890 period (ie: Age of Iron - Naval Combat in the Civil War is NOT required).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One turn represents from 3-5 minutes. Game scale is 1:3000 (1 inch = 22 miles). This miniatures rules set will require ten-sided dice, a ruler or tape measure, and miniature ships. Reference charts, a protractor and turning templates are included, as are templates of each ship with their game characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules themselves are very similar to Age of Iron - Naval Combat in the Civil War, different values are used and special rules have been added (some that can be applied to Age of Iron - Naval Combat in the Civil War). The rules include an extensive list of naval vessels from 20 countries, virtually all navies over the world of the time. This rules set covers an obscure, but colorful, period of history that is represented by very few games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
