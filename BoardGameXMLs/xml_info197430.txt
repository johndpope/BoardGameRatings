			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you and a bunch of friends take on the roles of newly-dead souls, now finding themselves damned to an eternity burning in the fires of Hell, but given one chance to make things right. The Big Light Far Into The Darkness, the one you saw when you died, said that you could take one last gamble to save your soul. You are being sent back in time 24 hours, in spirit form, and it is up to you and your friends to find a way to stop your living selves from doing whatever it was that you did and that damned you all. You are going to have to &amp;lsquo;wear&amp;rsquo; the bodies of the people you loved the most in order to interact with the world. Oh, and just when you thought you got a sweet deal, here is one more catch: you must make sure that your deaths still happen before the deadline, before those 24 hours run out; this much cannot be altered. Keep in mind that the stakes are high, if you mess this up real bad, you could be erased from history, just like you have never been born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
