							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TyrAnt</name>
									
			<description>TyrAnt is an ant-based Real Time Strategy game that teaches players how ants eat, communicate and reproduce within a diverse and delicately balanced ecosystem. Now in its third major iteration, the game is sticking to its nature documentary roots. A voiceover adds drama and depth by narrating the story of the colony&amp;rsquo;s struggle, while rich and detailed environments provide a range of challenges. Resources are plentiful in the damp and leafy park but out on the desert road, competition is fierce for the limited supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players decide how best to develop their colony, choosing the balance of Foragers, who collect valuable food resource, and Soldiers, who defend territory. Mastering the game means mastering the true-to-life dynamics of ant life. For example, as ants navigate between leaves, they lay a pheromone trail so other ants travel more efficiently along the same route. Soldier ants from competing colonies threaten the player&amp;rsquo;s chance of reaching the all-important nuptial flight and the chance to reproduce. Through genetic mutation the player&amp;rsquo;s colony becomes increasingly specialized, improving their chance of completing the toughest difficulty setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
