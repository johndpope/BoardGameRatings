			<description>Meet drowsy Moonboy. Blown out of bed by a big lunar sneeze, he sleepwalks through dreams. Moonboy needs your help to reach his bed. Guide him safely through various traps, clear obstructions from his path, and shift his surroundings to create a safe passage to the cozy bed. Solve environment puzzles in a fantasy world, find multiple pathways through the game, and collect stars and crescents to experience the beauty of Sleepwalker&amp;rsquo;s Journey fairytale atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;You are Moonboy&amp;rsquo;s only guardian, and your imagination is the key that shapes the dream, as you lead the boy to his beloved bed. You are the dream creator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
