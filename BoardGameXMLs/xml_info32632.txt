			<description>A game for the piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A three-player game in which one of the players (the 'Victim') attempts to get to the four Secure Bases on the board and then return to the start position (the 'Safe House') without being eliminated by the two other players (the 'Assassins'). If the Victim is eliminated, the Assassin that eliminated him becomes the new Victim. Play continues until a Victim reaches all the Secure Bases and returns safely to the Safe House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
