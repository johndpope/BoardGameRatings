			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roleplaying game explores technology through humanity, supporting players to develop stories about the increasingly complex relationship between machine and human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take the role of machines, isolated, discarded and possibly obsolete. Information about their character and environment is initially limited, a deliberate device (for as a machine what expectation have they that they will be told anything more than what they need to know to perform their task?) but also intended to encourage players to engage creatively, develop details which will evolve as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players know the finish (appearance) of their machine and its Primary Function (a guiding approach), which they can choose to ignore by spending resources, highlighting their free will while also provoking drama and tension when the characters interact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each machine was built by a team of people, and the link between creator and creation is a central part of the game. As the game progresses, the machines experience fragments of memory from their human creators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
