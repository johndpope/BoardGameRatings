			<description>(from the back cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruins of the Red Moon is a solo module for use with the First Edition Advanced game system and is fully compatible with the OSRIC rules system. This adventure uses the Pacesetter Games &amp;amp; Simulations SoloSystem for enhanced individual gaming. The scenario is designed for a single, fourth level player character (PC). Any character class may successfully navigate the dangers in this module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure starts with the PC making his way through a desolate mountain range. Late fall has given way to a frigid winter. now and freezing temperatures threaten the PC with death by exposure. A blizzard is near and the PC must find shelter to survive the night. As he enters yet another barren valley, a massive and strange structure blocks his path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module can be played a a solo dungeon as intended or run a a standard adventure module with a DM and single player or multiple players. If used with multiple player characters, the PC level range should be reduced to first level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
