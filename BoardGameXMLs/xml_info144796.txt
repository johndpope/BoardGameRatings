			<description>Everwind - Jeksey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galwyndor's Oldest Strategy Game&lt;br/&gt;Match wits with your opponent as you strategically maneuver your Messenger to the other side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A forgotten game from a forgotten time, Jeksey was invented as a cover for a secret cipher. The ancients would use the gameboard and a key to transmit encrypted messages to one another, which is why the object is to get your Messenger deep into enemy territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It plays like chess, but there are only four types of pieces, so the rules are simple. Using five Wards, four Cavals, three Litus pieces, and one Messenger, you must outwit and outmaneuver your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the game appearing in the Everwind Series of books by Janden Hale. Game designer: Janden Daniel Hale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/everwind-jeksey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/everwind-jeksey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
