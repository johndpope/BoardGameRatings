			<description>Children&amp;acute;s trivia game about Pippi Longstocking and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives eight tiles with pictures from the books. Players lay them on the table in front of them and memorize the order of the pictures. Then they turn their tiles face-down. Players are then ready to take turns rolling the die and moving on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they land on a red spot, the game master picks up a red card and reads a quote from a story. The text is associated with one of the pictures on the players&amp;acute; tiles. The first player to turn up the right tile gets a freckle painted in her face - a make-up stick is included in the game! As you know, Pippi is proud of her freckles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they land on a yellow spot, they get one freckle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they land on a green spot, the player answers a question from a card. If correct, the player gets one gold coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to land on one of the blue spots gets the coin that was placed their before game start. No new coins are added during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the finish gets three coins. The winner is the player with most points (total of freckles and coins!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age 5 years and up. Children will need someone to read the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
