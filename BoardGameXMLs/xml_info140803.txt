							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomes of Ancient Knowledge (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In horror campaigns, any book with a name is guaranteed to be dangerous beyond imagining, but aren't you just the least bit tempted to see what lies between the covers? Power beyond imagining? Terror beyond comprehension? Look inside this product and discover four fell tomes steeped in malevolent magical malignancy, including new simplified sanity rules, connecting magic and monsters alike to Lovecraftian alien mythos, four new metamagic feats, and 20 spells, 12 original creations and 8 familiar spells corrupted into something wholly and awfully other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Jason Nelson and Clinton J. Boomer with the Legendary Games Design Team of Neil Spicer, Greg A. Vaughan, and Clark Peterson. Who better to provide you with alternate magical books, spells, and rules for your Adventure Path campaign than the very writers of those adventures themselves? Answer: no one. Legendary Games' Adventure Path Plug-Ins supplement and enrich your campaign experience, offering adventures and supporting products that incorporate and expanding upon unique concepts, themes, and rules subsystems introduced in the Adventure Paths while filling in the background characters, items, and locations that make those adventures come alive in delightful (and often dangerous) detail. Legendary Games combines stellar writing talent with innovative layout and product design and top-notch artistic values that we think will bring you back again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside these Tomes you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The blood-stained Sarkulis Shards, a compendium of corrupted witchery graven on the crystallized blood of familiars long dead.&lt;br/&gt;     The Palestone Analects, a mad poet's elegy to the melding and molding of flesh and stone as one.&lt;br/&gt;     The dusty Xanthutep Tablets, divine pharaonic inscriptions concerning the unbinding of the fundamental forces of reality.&lt;br/&gt;     All Flesh and Form Made Ash, a smoldering divine panegyric to the glory of burning, from ignition to cremation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out this gothic-themed magical accessory and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
