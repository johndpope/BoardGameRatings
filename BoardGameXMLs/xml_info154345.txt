			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Templar is a campaign role playing campaign of fantasy horror. Evil pervades every part of the land of Lenor, and with the setting of the sun each day the common folk become hostages in their own homes. Only the brave and tragic members of the Ancient and Holy Order of Templars stand against the darkness that is slowly choking the world. In the land of Lenor the dead do not rest easily, and the one thing people fear more than dying is returning from the dead&amp;mdash;their souls forever lost to the Glory of the Light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this campaign all the characters are Templars. They have suffered greatly at the hands of evil creatures or ghosts, which has granted them the strength of will to do battle with the demons of the Taint and the Darkness.  And demons there are a-plenty; ghosts, specters, werewolves, vampires and more inhabit the realm of Lenor. But the most vile of all creatures are the dark magicians&amp;mdash;madmen that traffic with the very fabric of evil in order to bend the world to their own will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer's website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The land of Lenor is engulfed in darkness and besieged by evil, only the Templars can bring the Light to the Darkness. This is a setting for a campaign I ran back in 2005. Detailed enough for casual campaign play. It was originally written for D&amp;amp;D and I am contemplating re-fitting it for True20. This document has no system info &amp;ndash; it is all fluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
