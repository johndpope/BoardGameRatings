			<description>Outnumbered! is an educational computer game designed to teach children mathematical computation and problem solving. The player must navigate through the Shady Glen Television Station and collect clues to find the Master of Mischief, while avoiding the walking television Telly and the electrified Livewire.&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the player has 9 minutes to find out where the Master of Mischief is hiding in one of the studio rooms (the clock shows three hours from 9:00pm to midnight). Time is paused when doing problem solving in studio rooms, but not when using a zapper against Telly. For every set of problems solved against the robot, or the main problem in one of five studio rooms, a clue is given to determine where the Master of Mischief is hiding.&lt;br/&gt;After each successful scenario, the points are accumulated and put into the total score and the game is played again. This happens until the player has successfully scored 300000 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;OutNumbered!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
