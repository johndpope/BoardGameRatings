			<description>The board is numbered from 1 (Start) to 100 (London) with 101 and 0 after 100. The winner is the one who lands on 100. If a player lands on 101, he must leave the game as he had been killed. If a throw takes a player to 0 or beyond, they must return to compartment 86.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Motor Tour may be taken part in by as many players as there are motors/markers. Each player starts at number 1 and plays in turn and must go on to No 2, that is, throw 1 before he/she can get a motor to commence the tour. The towns meed not be called at, but if fall on a town the player misses a turn to view the sights. More than one motor can be on the same division at the same time, and motors can pass and re-pass each other. &lt;br/&gt;If fall on division marked with penalties or advantages, follow the instructions stated on the divisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
