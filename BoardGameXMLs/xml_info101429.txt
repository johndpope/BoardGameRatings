			<description>The game features four separate modes of play: Stroke Play, where the player embarks on any courses unlocked in the game; Match Play, where the player engages in a matchplay against a computer opponent of a chosen difficulty level; Free Round, where the player is free to take on any hole on any particular course he has already unlocked; Championship, where the player progresses through a series of tournaments in order to unlock other courses and progress through the ranks, from a Rookie to a Junior, then Senior and finally Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features a Golf Shop which sells golfing equipment (separated into clubsets, golf balls and golf shoes), and, depending on the player's progress in the Championship, restocks its inventories with more advanced equipment until the player has completed the Masters Level Championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite it being named as a realistic golf game, players could utilise their clubset's skills to power up their shots, deliver more spin to the ball, or curve the ball more, which would decrease a Power Meter that gradually charges up over time as a player advances through the golf course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of fifteen courses to unlock, the last three which are basically extremely windy versions of the first three courses the player would encounter in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;True Swing Golf&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
