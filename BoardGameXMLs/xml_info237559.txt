			<description>The objective of Stellar Express is to gain the most victory points by completing missions. The game ends once a set amount of victory points is achieved during game play. Collect missions at star bases and transport resources from those star bases to planets. Reach the planets before you run out of fuel. Expand your fuel and other ship&amp;rsquo;s needs by hiring crew and purchasing ship modifications. Every round of turns triggers the orbit of the planets. Calculate the distance in your head, creating strategies to get to your destination in time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
