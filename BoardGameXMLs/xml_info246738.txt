			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to $1 Adventure Frameworks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$1AF makes sweet mini adventures - or more accurately what I like to call &amp;quot;Adventure Frameworks&amp;quot; - stand alone, drop in adventure 'skeletons', made to facilitate sandbox style play - for $1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure framework is set in a generic medieval or ancient fantasy location, with enough meat to enable the GM to improvise details and adapt to player choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System wise, these adventures use the Low Fantasy Gaming RPG (an old school/modern mix d20 based game; free PDF - Link), but are easily adapted to any d20 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what do you get for your dollar?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Framework 25 Revelry in Northgate consists of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A downloadable, bookmarked PDF (8 A4 pages, excluding cover &amp;amp; credits, in both parchment and white backgrounds).&lt;br/&gt;The Core Adventure (from small side treks to medium sized dungeons), that will occupy 3-8 hours of session time with Minimal Prep.&lt;br/&gt;Rumours &amp;amp; Hooks suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;Quality B&amp;amp;W Illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But don't take my word for it - google 18 Halls of the Dwarf Lord and 16 Delecarte's Carnival of Wonders to download two free examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, there's a few things AF's don't come with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxed Text: Every time a GM reads boxed text, an ad-lib fairy dies, and I've got too much blood on my hands already. Paraphrasing and natural speech from the GM keeps players guessing what's pre-planned, and what's off-the-cuff-I-totally-planned-that awesome. And we wants that awesome, precious. We wants it.&lt;br/&gt;Colour Art: AF's are currently produced using old school B&amp;amp;W line art. Maybe one day I'll move on to colour pics. Maybe.&lt;br/&gt;No Grid: Maps, where provided, don't have grid lines. It's easier to add a grid than to take one away. If you prefer a grid or hex, you'll need to add it via Roll20, GIMP v2.8, etc.&lt;br/&gt;US English. I'm in Sydney Australia, so my work is in UK English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed with a handful of Adventure Frameworks, you can sandbox like there's no tomorrow. Browse through your library of AF's, throw out a few hooks, and let the players bite where they may. Whatever direction they take, you'll be ready to handle it with aplomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope you enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: A truncated version of this AF is included the Midlands Low Magic Sandbox Setting book/PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
