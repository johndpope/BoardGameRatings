			<description>From the publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplemental deck for Masks: A New Generation.  The Deck of Influence includes 55 Influence and Condition cards, each with full color art and rules to make playing your next game as easy as possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck includes 30 Influence cards in five different sets, one for each PC at the table. When someone has Influence over you, you can just hand them one of your cards, and they&amp;rsquo;ll have a special reminder with cool art and all the rules they need in an easy to reference form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are 25 condition cards, reflecting each of the five conditions in Masks: Afraid, Angry, Guilty, Hopeless, and Insecure. Each kind of card has its own art and rules for using conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
