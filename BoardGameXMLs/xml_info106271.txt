			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twinbee: Rainbow Bell Adventure is a platform game developed and published by Konami for the Super Famicom in 1994.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twinbee: Rainbow Bell Adventure is a departure from the rest of the Shoot 'Em Up style Twinbee games in that it is an action/platforming game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The background for the game is that there are seven Rainbow Bells that keep peace in the galaxy. The evil Dr. Warmon has stolen the Rainbow Bells in an effort to take over the world. The Twinbees must stop this from happening!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three characters to choose from, each with their own unique abilities: Twinbee, Winbee, and Gwinbee. The player must guide these characters through seven areas to get the Rainbow Bells back from Dr. Warmon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
