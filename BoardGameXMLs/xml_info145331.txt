							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirate&#039;s Booty</name>
									
			<description>It is the Late 1600's in the Age of the Pirates, deep in the Swashbuckling heart of the Caribbean! Grab your friends and don your Pirate hat as you set forth as Captain on adventures across the hazardous Caribbean islands to Plunder Booty from the Rich Ports and Ships of the Spanish, English and French. Explore the Ancient Ruins of Lost civilizations and encounter the Native cultures and the secrets they hold! Square off against your friends as you set a Voyage for fun and BOOTY! For only the pirate with the most Booty will go down in history as the greatest scourge of the Age of Pirates!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have the highest Plunder total of all the other players of either Ship, Ruin, Port or Native in order to take the Plunder. Cards can be played at any time, allow for fast paced rounds as you try to outfight your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 2 decks, the Pirate Deck and the Plunder Deck.&lt;br/&gt;The Pirate Deck contains all the ships, sailors, treasures and tactics that you will use on your long journey. Many of these cards will go directly in play and will form the bulwark of your fleet on your voyage. These are called Voyage cards, they have defensive abilities that will protect you against your opponents machinations, or be powerful enough to steal or destroy your opponents Voyage Cards. The Voyage cards are also vital in that they have Plunder Total, the values you use to win the Plunder currently being fought over! Your other cards will be the action cards, one use cards that are swashbuckling tactics that are quick and efficient and will get the job done in a pinch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Plunder Deck is comprised of famous locations and vessels. They are divided into four different types, Ships, Ruins, Port and Native. These Plunder types tell you what values on the Pirate cards are necessary to win the booty! Some of the more valuable cards even provide bonuses that remains in effect for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is a divided up into voyages, where each captain will put forth a Plunder Card from the deck and fight back and forth to try and take the Plunder! The unique thing about this game is that once you put a card into play, another captain can immediately play one of their own cards to counter it. This is meant to keep the game quick and cut throat to force you to think on the fly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kickstarter Link&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1640472770/pirates-booty-the-card-game-of-plundering-your-fri?ref=bggforums&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1640472770/pirates-booty...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
