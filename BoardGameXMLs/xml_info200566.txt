			<description>A toyish surprise-o-rama without text nor characters, where an object shapeshifts as the player spins it around, revealing the underlying story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The different objects and their relations create a virtual map, a web in which the player can move around, sole structure of the game. These objects are put in the forefront as both visual elements and narrative devices - they hold the theme and meaning of the game. The symbolism of each item, as well as its place in the sequence of objects, sets the mood and topic: it creates, step by step, conceptual spaces for the player to navigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
