							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wizard of the White Hills</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short encounter &amp;quot;mission&amp;quot; that is systemless and scalable for about any level of PCs in any OSR-style game. The design is deliberately vague in several areas to make it easy to &amp;quot;tweak &amp;amp; toss&amp;quot; into your current campaign. Perfect for when the party goes &amp;quot;left&amp;quot; when you expected them to go &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;, any GM/DM/Judge can easily drop this into the current campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea behind this Tweak &amp;amp; Toss is that the party really needs the answer to a difficult question. Their best bet is to seek out a Sage who might be able to research the topic and get them the vital information they need. Fortunately the Wizard of the White Hills is available! All the party needs to do is make their way deep into the mountains, navigate some rapids, locate the White Hills, and find the Wizard. Should be easy...right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is intended to print this file two-sided and fold in half, zine-style. Just select &amp;quot;booklet printing&amp;quot; and make sure that you have duplex set up on the short edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF download consists of three pages of content (map, encountes, and basic set-up). There are a couple of hotlinks within the file taking you to some additional resources, one of which is the Patreon site where you can download better versions of the maps if you so desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
