							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zitadelle</name>
									
			<description>(from the introduction:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Citadel was the name given by the Wehrmacht to their summer offensive against the Soviets in 1943. Zitadelle is a simulation of that strategic turning point of the Second World War on the Russian Front. This came to be the final major campaigning season for the Wehrmacht before the growing might of Soviet arms became overwhelming. Within the scope of the Europa series of simulations from GDW. Zitadelle attempts to allow gamers to explore the military possibilities open to both sides using components largely available. A number of major additions to the standard Fire in the east / Scorched earth (FITE/SE) rule set have been made, most of which should be seen as experimental and considered optional by anyone playing the scenario. &lt;br/&gt;These include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Operational headquarters for armies/fronts &lt;br/&gt;    Attack supply effects. &lt;br/&gt;    Special effects for German non-div. mot. and Soviet cavalry &lt;br/&gt;    Limited intelligence rules &lt;br/&gt;    Completely revised air system. using the same counters &lt;br/&gt;    Complete optional naval system &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Rules (18 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Axis and Soviet Order of Battle (13 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Army/Corps display (Axis: 3 pages - Soviet Union: 5 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    Ship Status Charts (Soviet Union: 2 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    3 Port Charts (3 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    1943 Front line maps (2 pages)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
