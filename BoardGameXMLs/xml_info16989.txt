							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chilkat: The Indian Warrior Game</name>
									
			<description>Chilkat is a Canadian game about Native Americans and is played on a replica of the ceremonial blanket of the West Coast tribes.  Represented on the blanket are 10 symbols which North American Indians used as clan or family crests.  These crests were usually inherited or gained by conquest.  The more crests, the greater the prestige of the family or chief who displayed them; consequently these titles were very jealously protected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using strategy and luck, together with their chiefs and warriors, players will roll the dice for positions, move warriors for offense and defense, and challenge opponents in &amp;ldquo;fights to the finish&amp;rdquo; for possession of the symbols on the blanket.  The winner is the one whose chiefs control all 10 symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
