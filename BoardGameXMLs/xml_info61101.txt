							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Inaugural Celebrity Pro/Am Crawl</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reach for the stars...and team up with them for your next adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inaugural Celebrity Pro-Am Crawl is about to debut, and you've been invited as one of the teams. This is your chance for fame and fortune. Or at least the opportunity to hob-nob with fame and fortune as celebrities from every walk of life take their turn inside the arena for this charity event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And since it's being done for charity, you shouldn't expect anything tough. After all, these folks aren't trained the way that you are. They can't handle the extreme dangers that appear in a standard crawl. So, this should be a cakewalk, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and just because there is a new DJ making her debut--an ex-celebrity named Carley Danger--that's no reason to worry, is it? Everything is going to be just fine...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hang on...it's going to be a bumpy ride...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
