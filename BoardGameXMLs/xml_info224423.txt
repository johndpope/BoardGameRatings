			<description>Description from the designer:'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hunt for Blackbeard's Treasure is a family friendly game where players have to roll dice and move around the board to accumulate resources (buying &amp;amp; stealing from other players) in order to leave harbour and set sail to Hammerhead Island (the supposed resting place of Blackbeard's hidden treasure).&lt;br/&gt;Once there, they follow their own chosen treasure map around the island to where the map states that they can now dig up the treasure chest and find out if they were lucky to discover the treasure and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
