			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moneytime is a basketball card game that aims to deliver the sensations of a basketball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays a team and plays each basketball possession to try to score baskets, and playing defense and offense alternatively (like basketball).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By playing his offensive cards against the defensive cards in the possessions, the player playing offense will try to build an advantage to score using basketball actions with the ball, and without the ball wisely to avoid turnovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple and fast paced, Moneytime is designed around the notion of time, where individual highlights and simple collective mechanics are key, while shots at the buzzer and crazy end games are not rare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound from a basketball perceptive, it remains true to the spirit of the game and reflects how basketball is to be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typically a two players game, It can also be played by up to six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
