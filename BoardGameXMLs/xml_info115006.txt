			<description>Cybermorph is a free-roaming 3D shooter developed for the Atari Jaguar. The cartridge was included as the pack-in game for the system when it launched in 1993. Two versions of the game were released with minor differences. The earlier version (copyright 1993 on the label) is a 2 MB cartridge. The later version (copyright 1994 on the label) is a 1 MB cartridge which excludes introduction and ending animation sequences and has fewer voice samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a 3D shooter, with the player piloting a space ship from a third person perspective. There are five levels, each with several planets for the player to explore, with a boss at the end of each level. The player's objective is to recapture lost pods spread out across the different worlds.&lt;br/&gt; The player is accompanied on their adventure by a bald-headed, green female computer guide named Skylar, who, whenever the player hits a mountain, says &amp;quot;Where did YOU learn to fly?&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cybermorph&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
