			<description>&amp;lsquo;Dillos in Austin: A simulation for 2 to 4 ground-dwelling armored dasypods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You think road construction is bad in your town? You should try living in Austin. Even without road construction, the signage is confusing and the drivers are absolutely nuts. The only thing that could make navigating the city more challenging is if the roads actually shifted and changed while you&amp;rsquo;re driving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Get from your home to the capitol building in the middle of town without getting captured by the &amp;lsquo;dillo hunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two 6-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;     A city map. (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;     Road pieces. (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;     An opaque bag or other container.&lt;br/&gt;     five pawns of different shapes or colors &amp;ndash; one for each &amp;lsquo;dillo and one for the &amp;lsquo;Dillo Hunter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, roll two dice. If you roll doubles, the player to your left moves the &amp;lsquo;Dillo Hunter the amount shown on one die. If a pawn enters a space occupied by a stop sign, it must stop moving. After the &amp;lsquo;Dillo Hunter moves (if it moves), choose one of the dice you rolled. Look up that number on the Action Chart (Twist, Swap, Push, or a combination of these) and take the action indicated by your chosen roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on the capitol in the center of the board, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
