							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">INTERNET Deck</name>
									
			<description>The learners will be able to identify legitimate INTERNET command sequences. The game will focus on basic VAX Notes, Telnet, and e-mail commands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two variations to the INTERNET Deck. The first is a competitive game played like Rummy with the following variations. Players receive one point for each card in any trick that they lay down. Players may pick up more than one card from the discard pile. Players can void tricks laid down by other players by placing a &amp;quot;Disconnect&amp;quot; card on the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second variation to INTERNET Deck is facilitative. It is meant for students who are not yet familiar with INTERNET commands. This variation is played like Rummy with the following variations. The dealer is always the instructor. All cards are shown face up. The instructor and other participants help the current player figure out if there is a legitimate sequence in his or her hand. Score is not kept. Only a few hands of this version should be played before switching to the competitive version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
