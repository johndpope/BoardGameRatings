			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Role-Playing in a Rome that never was...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In AD 7, Vesuvius erupted and buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum under tons of ash.  In our world, a young boy decided to stay at home and was killed in the disaster...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of FVLMINATA, that boy lives to discover the substance that changes the course of history: an explosive black powder that he names Terra Fulminata, or 'Earth armed with lightning.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FVLMINATA is a historical fantasy role-playing game set in a world not quite like our own.  It is AD 248, exactly one thousand years after the founding of Rome.  The Imperium Romanum is in no danger of crumbling, but governs in strength from Hibernia in the east to the Parthian border in the west.Gladiators battle for their freedom; Senators scheme for political power; Merchants prosper under the Pax Romana; Magi plumb the secrets of the universe while Legionaries defend the frontiers with an almost invincible weapon...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FVLMINATA features extensive research of the ancient world and unique game mechanics designed to capture the flavor of adventuring in the Roman Empire.  Special eight-sided dice, known as TALI, sold separately, are needed for play, although this book features guidelines for using standard 8-siders in their stead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
