			<description>English title:  Heaven and Hell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publisher's annual downloadable game for 2001 depicts the eternal battle between Heaven and Hell, played out on a 10 x 3 square grid. Each player's forces are represented by dice and their movements limited by player action points, the number of points available being dictated by the number of dice the player has in the play area.  Dice gain strength by winning conflicts, but may may voluntarily reduce strength in order to move faster.  Conflict is resolved by a combination of dice strength and cardplay.  The player who manages to get the strongest dice into his opponent's home area wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
