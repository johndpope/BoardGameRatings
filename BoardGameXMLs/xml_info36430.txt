			<description>&amp;quot;A band of Elven adventurers have got it into their heads to have a competition, to see who is the most talented Treasure Hunter of the lot. To this end, they decide to infiltrate the nearby troll caves, known for the ample treasures within, and filch the treasures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Completely unaware of the competition, the trolls are obviously surprised by the band of elven intruders swanning about in their caves, and understandably they are a little miffed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is a race against time to amass enough treasure and get out before the trolls clobber you into oblivion!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the first player to find five treasures and get out of the troll caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: game board, a playing piece and stat card for each elf, a playing piece and stat card for each troll, an eight-sided die, 49 wound tokens, 24 arrow tokens, 24 mana tokens, 6 wall pieces, 2 magic door pieces, 3 sorcerer markers, 3 quiver of arrows marker, 3 magic potion markers, and the Search Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
