							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pulverheksa tr√•r til: Det magiske pulveret</name>
									
			<description>You are walking around in the world of the Witch Pulverheksa. (Can be translated into the Powder Witch). Your mission is to find powder that Pulverheksa need to make good things like cake, sweet bread (Called &amp;quot;bolle&amp;quot; in norwegian) and soda water. But look out for the thief who want to stead your powder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by rolling the die and moving in the ring around the edge. When you land on a Pulverheksa space, you draw a Pulverheksa card. If you get a powder card, you add it on the hand, but if you draw the thief you must put one powder card on the thief house. There are other space as well, such as the dream prince (Nothing happens) and small trolls (Miss a turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the Soup Cockoo space (All the names make perfect sence in Norwegian and cannot be translated) you can move to the Pulver house. There you can roll the spesial visit die to see if Pulverheksa is home. Here you can meet the police aswell. The police give you all the cards placed on the thief house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Pulverheksa is home you can trade 3 powder for soda water, sweet bread or cake. When you got all of these you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the childrens books by Ingunn Aamodt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
