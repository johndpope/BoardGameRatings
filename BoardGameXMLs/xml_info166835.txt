							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sector 28</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exploration of &amp;ldquo;Unexplored Space&amp;rdquo; continues with Sectors 28.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sector Twenty-Eight is one of the largest sectors in &amp;ldquo;Unexplored Space,&amp;rdquo; although the eleven species have not done much to colonize the sector.  There are quite a few dead colonies from ancient species, and some other unexpected mysteries in some of the systems.  Most importantly, however, is that this sector is home to the Mosicans, a species that has only recently gained interstellar travel.  So far, they&amp;rsquo;ve only colonized a few sectors, and they&amp;rsquo;re yet to meet any of the other eleven species, but they certainly will at some point in the future.  You will also meet the Taurins, a species that is on the edge of interstellar travel, and is close enough to the original six species that once they achieve interstellar travel, they will quickly meet the original six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
