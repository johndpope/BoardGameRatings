			<description>&amp;quot;Linie&amp;quot; is played on a unusual board: 4 spiraled lines in 4 colors lead from every edge of the board to the center. These 4 spirals are intersected by 4 straight diagonals leading from the center to the edges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 3 tokens per color/player, 1 die of each of these colors and 2 neutral white dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is very unusual again, since a player can move any token on the board! During a turn, a player rolls 5-6 dice and each die roll allows the move of 1 token, using the white dice as jokers, who allow the movement of a token of any color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captures are possible on the diagonal lines only and the player who is the first to reach the center with all his 3 tokens is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
