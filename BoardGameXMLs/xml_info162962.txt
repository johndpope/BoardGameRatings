			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEDTIME STORIES TO INSPIRE NIGHTMARES...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feary Tales is a collection of twisted retellings of classic fairy tales and nursery rhymes that spilled forth primarily from the sharp pen of writer/artist Steve Ditko in his pre-Marvel Comics days, as his career was getting underway. In this day and age of spooky TV shows using fairy tales as their jumping off pointr, these stories are as fresh as they were when they were first published some 60 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to six timeless horror fairy tale classics, Feary Tales features an all-jnew one-player mini-game by Steve Miller and George Carlson, and an all-new monster race (along with new feats and a talent tree) for your d20 System games that was inspired by the stories in this book--the Feary Ghoul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
