			<description>from Kelestia Productions website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The definitive version of one of the best-loved fantasy maps ever made, available in both printed and interactive multi-layered PDF file formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All new vegetation and relief makes geographical features clearer than ever before. This is the most detailed map of H&amp;acirc;rn ever made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete replication of all geographical &amp;amp; settlement features from N. Robin Crossby&amp;rsquo;s 1983 H&amp;acirc;rn Map, with many additional features identified. There are more than 500 geographical and settlement features on this map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the most &amp;lsquo;artful&amp;rsquo; fantasy maps ever published. It looks more like a satellite photo than a topographic map, yet has all the detail of the original 1983 map (and much more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interactive PDF version includes details of political boundaries, areas of core and peripheral control by the various realms, the ranges of human and g&amp;acirc;rg&amp;uacute;n tribal groups, details of major and minor trade goods and trade routes, and enables the user to zoom into very high levels of detail. It also includes square and hex grids to enable location of features and the tracking of distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
