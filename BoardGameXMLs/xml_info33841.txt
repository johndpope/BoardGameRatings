							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Potato Head Kids Game</name>
									
			<description>The Potato Head Kids Game is a spin-and-move game for children Ages 3 - 6. Though it adopts the movement mechanism from Candy Land, it also includes a tactile component through the gradual reconstruction of your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;The Potato Head Kids are so excited about their new clubhouse that they've gone all to pieces - a shoe here, a body there, arms and hats everywhere. Can you help put them together again?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spin the spinner and move around the gameboard. Land on the right spaces and win the missing parts of your Potato Head Kid. But be careful, on some spaces you can lose parts too. Then you have to go around the gameboard again and win them back. Enter the clubhouse first with a perfectly put-together Potato Head Kid and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
