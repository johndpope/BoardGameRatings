			<description>Arc the Lad: End of Darkness, known in Japan as Arc the Lad Generation, is a video game developed by Cattle Call for the PlayStation 2. It is last game from the Arc the Lad series on the console, the first being Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits.&lt;br/&gt;This is the only Arc game to, instead of a tactics-style battle system, feature a more of a real-time battle, online-play battle system. Generally, this was viewed as a step backwards for the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic mode of play requires the player to go to guilds around the world, taking on missions. To advance the story however, the player must speak to NPCs around the towns. The game features a real-time battle system new to the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arc the Lad: End of Darkness&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
