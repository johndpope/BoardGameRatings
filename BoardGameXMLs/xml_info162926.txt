							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island – Sailor Health Tracker</name>
									
			<description>Have you ever accidentally moved your Health Cube while playing a game of Robinson Crusoe? Reach for your drink, another piece on the board and suddenly you have 2 more or 2 less health than you did before, or maybe the Cube isn't even on the character sheet anymore? Control your cubes with this tracker. It keeps the cubes from moving independently up and down the scoring track if you hit your mat during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tracker is made to fit the Sailor Character Card made by Portal Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
