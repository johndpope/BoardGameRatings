			<description>This is a traditional Chinese variant of Snakes and Ladders. Like Snakes and Ladders, it takes place on a square board with a boustrouphedron track, and players roll a die to move their piece from start to finish. The distinguishing features of this distinct subgenre are that the board is set in a playground with many children playing on a see-saw, a slide, a Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, and so on. Some squares will have instructions that will move the player forward, backward or cause a missed turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other traditional Chinese games of this ilk, it is made by different companies and comes in small boxes with a folded paper board - in this case, the board is often fairly colourful. More modern versions include cartoon character themes (e.g. Doraemon Kang Le Qi, Snoopy Kang Le Qi).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
