							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witch</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a little known secret that there is magic in everything, from plants to stones, to metals and animals. Names carry power, and in certain times and places it swells and coils upon itself, forming a wellspring of raw, untapped magical energy. Some learn these secrets after ceremonial induction, others through extensive instruction and trial, while the more desperate or greedy find that there is no shortage of dark entities willing to help them shortcut the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a price, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The how matters less than the results: through your work, words, and will you gather, bind, and temper magical forces in accordance to your desires, good or ill. You can brew a concoction to heal someone just as easily as one to alter a man&amp;rsquo;s shape or desires. You can forge a talisman either to shield someone from harm, or draw ill fortune to them like a moth to a flame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course you are not helpless without time and safety: with a few words you can make someone&amp;rsquo;s eyes bleed, cause even the most faithful and tame of beasts to turn on them, prevent them from speaking, or vermin to crawl forth from their screaming mouths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a reason others regard you with equal measure of fear and respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is a digest-sized, 24-page book laid out like the Dungeon World book. It contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The witch. Foretell the future, curse your foes, brew potions, and craft charms.&lt;br/&gt;     New equipment, like the athame, warding pentacle, divination trappings, and poppets.&lt;br/&gt;     Twenty magic items.&lt;br/&gt;     A behind the scenes look at our design, as well as some expanded explanation on the fiction powerful the moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other is a 2-page, letter-sized character sheet with custom graphics for you to print out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
