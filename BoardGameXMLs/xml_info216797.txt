							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gridiron Football: The Realistic Football Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple, luck-based game designed to simulate the play of American football. Using a deck of 78 cards, players select from among eight play types, including special teams options, then turn over the topmost card to determine the result. Two plays through the deck constitute a complete game. In addition to the card deck, the game contains a rules pamphlet and a pegboard for marking field position, down, and distance to go for a first down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
