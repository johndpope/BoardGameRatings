			<description>[from the instructions]&lt;br/&gt;Hours of sunshine for a rainy day&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early peoples in every part of the world harvested from riverbanks, oceans, fields and forests, what brought them life and happiness.  Games were fashioned from everything imaginable, often from the same objects that brought them food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wherever people have organized socially, whether in bands, tribes, nation or nations, they have usually sought to develop knowledge, tools, and resources, in order to increase the harvest and standard of living for all, from one generation to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chief Surprise uses the symbols for wealth, and the tools of implement, rewarding each when correctly applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
