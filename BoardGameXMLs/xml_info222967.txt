							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): The Mighty Zug</name>
									
			<description>From Forgeworld's webstore:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Gifted with not only hefty bulk, strength and power but the ability to use them properly, The Mighty Zug is an expert at incapacitating opponents with a single swipe of his gigantic paw. A firm favourite with the fans despite (or because of) his brutish, ugly and stupid demeanour, he&amp;rsquo;s the Star Player of choice for Blood Bowl coaches who just want to get the job done. Nothing fancy &amp;ndash; just a trail of smashed faces leading to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add The Mighty Zug as a Star Player to any Human Blood Bowl team &amp;ndash; not just the Reikland Reavers &amp;ndash; with this resin kit. He can be built clutching the ball in his left arm, or modelled without; all the better for smashing faces in with a swipe of his enormous forearm. His rules, which mostly involve moving forward with the unstoppable grace of an angry continent, can be found as a Star Player card included with the Blood Bowl boxed game, and also in the supplement Death Zone Season 1. This resin kit comes in 7 components, with a 32mm round base and a 32mm round Blood Bowl base, featuring a slot for the ball.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
