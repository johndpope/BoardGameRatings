			<description>The Blockade is a pirate themed strategy game for 2 players that takes about half an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a sea with marked starting spaces and pirate island on one side. Start by placing your ships on the marked spaces and setting the difficulty. On each turn you'll move one of your ships. Pirates are more maneuverable, but there are only 3 of them. The navy moves slower, but has a large fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pirates win if they can get just one treasure back to the island, and the navy wins if they can stop the pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
