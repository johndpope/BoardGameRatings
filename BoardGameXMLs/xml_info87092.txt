			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Competition Submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Alexander the Great forged one of the largest empires in ancient history. He was taught a secret wisdom by Aristotle, that to succeed in life one needs to walk the Edge between the Desert and the City. With the assistance of this scroll, you may journey in his footsteps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Sojourn in Alexandria is a game examining how a journey can shape a character, for good or for ill. It's meant to tell stories of both the physical voyage and the ethical one. The characters try to walk the knife's edge between the deprivation of the harsh Desert and the excess of the opulent City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended for a single session of play; ideally suited to convention play or as an intermission to an ongoing campaign. It involves one Game Master who will one who directs the Desert and the City during the course of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the game requires between one and six players who portray travellers who will work together to reach or flee from the great city of Alexandria. Each participant needs 6 six-sided dice, a character sheet, a writing implement and six small markers or tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
