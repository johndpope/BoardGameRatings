			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom Come: Deliverance draws its inspiration from historically authentic characters, themes, and warfare. It will be set in 15th Century medieval central Europe, specifically at the time of the Hussites and will feature no magic, high fantasy, or mythical overtones. The game will have period-accurate armor and clothing, actual combat and fencing techniques, and real-world castles recreated with the assistance of architects and historians. The game will also contain period music recorded by Czech masters that were taken note for note from ancient song books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will feature horseback combat, open-field sieges, and large-scale battles, all while developing relationships and a reputation that will effect the story. Before going into battle weapons may need some resharpening, repairing, or you may craft news ones in a skill/stat-based mini game, not in a menu. Creating potions, ointments through alchemy, picking locks and pockets, fishing, mining, distilling alcohol, and preparing food will all be done with similar mini-games. Eating and sleeping will be required to keep your strength up and perishables held onto for too long may go bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
