			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything Old Is New Again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it comes to getting things done with technology and artisanal efforts, the past isn't what it used to be; it's better than ever! This month's issue of Pyramid -- the PDF magazine for roleplayers -- is devoted to more gear and know-how of a bygone era. Our tinkerers' trove includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Lord of the Manor,&amp;quot; an exploration of how many households and what crops you need to sustain your Wealth. Composed by Matt Riggsby (co-author of GURPS Low-Tech Companion 3: Daily Life and Economics), it uses the GURPS Low-Tech foundation to keep your lands well-tended.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Concealed Armor,&amp;quot; showing how you can be both discreet and well-protected (with GURPS stats for various hidden helpers). It's written by Dan Howard, the armor enthusiast who brought his expertise to Low-Tech.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Low-Tech Armor Design,&amp;quot; this month's installment of David L. Pulver's Eidetic Memory. With this optional system for designing donned defenses, you'll be safe from a-sworded threats!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Puckle Gun,&amp;quot; a comprehensive look at a weapon that was ahead of its time (with additional GURPS stats), presented by GURPS Crusades co-author Graeme Davis.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Delayed Gratification,&amp;quot; an optional new addition to GURPS combat that will let you plan a step ahead to smite your foes!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Return to Ein Arris,&amp;quot; which uses the classic GURPS adventure Caravan to Ein Arris as a great justification to provide a comprehensive guide to caravanserais. Rest and relax in an amazing locale -- complete with map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue includes a Random Thought Table that shakes up the future of the past, an Odds and Ends that shows how worse can be better, and a Murphy's Rules that's sew much fun. You'll be a Renaissance man with this issue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
