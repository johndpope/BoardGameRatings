							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirates Backgammon</name>
									
			<description>A pirate themed strategy game played on a Backgammon board. The four quadrants of the board are referred to as Outer Sea (points 1-6), Great Sea (points 7-12), Middle Sea (points 13 -18), and Inner Sea (points 19-24).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of pieces used in the game &amp;ndash; Pirates, Merchants, and Man-o-Wars. In addition, tokens are used to represent Gold Coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pirate piece is used to collect Gold Coins. While gold is in the Pirate ship it is subject to being lost or plundered. When a player bears gold off the board, it is placed in the player&amp;rsquo;s Treasure Chest where it is safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The first player to accumulate 25 Gold Coins in his Treasure Chest is the winner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
