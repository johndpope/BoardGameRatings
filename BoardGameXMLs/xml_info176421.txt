			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amora Game Presents: Survivor first appeared in Liber Influxus Communis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[*If you own Liber Influxus Communis, you aready own this class.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survivor&amp;rsquo;s key conceit is, quite naturally, survivability. Survivors are selfish characters who care only about their own survival. They adventure for wealth, to test their own limits, and, sometimes&amp;hellip; to seek a good death. Survivors are grim folk, having been tested and tempered in the worst crucibles the world has to offer. Many of them have physical reminders of their brutal ordeals, by which archetypically, a survivor&amp;rsquo;s body sports numerous scars and perhaps even a missing fingers, limbs, or eyes. They have been characterized by have cold piercing stares, a hardness that alienates others, and a habit of sitting with their backs to a wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is an individualist first and last, and his needs always come before all others. It isn&amp;rsquo;t to say a survivor is only selfish, but he does things for his advancement, be it for the greater good or evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Survivor is a d12, full BAB class that focuses on  survival tactics. The animalistic Feralist is one born of the wilds. A Seething Survivor is barbaric and fights to the death. While the Thrill Seeker lives for the next adrenalin rush. Finally there is the street runner, the Urban Survivor who can't be stopped by traps and can disappear into the crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 10 page PDF product includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 Survivor base class&lt;br/&gt;    4 Pathfinder Compatible Archetypes: Feralist, Seething Survivor, Thrill Seeker, and Urban Survivor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
