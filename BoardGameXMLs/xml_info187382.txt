			<description>The game uses a pack of 81 cards consisting of one Super HOO HA! card, 24 red &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; cards and 4 suits each of 14 cards of a particular colour. Each suit consists of one HOO, one HA! and 12 &amp;quot;question&amp;quot; cards of the form &amp;quot;40+8&amp;quot;and &amp;quot;2x8&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt; Seven cards are dealt to each player, one is turned face up and the rest put face down as a draw deck.&lt;br/&gt; On their turn a player should can do one of five things depending on the top card of the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt; 1) Play another question card of the same colour as the top card&lt;br/&gt; 2) Play a question card that has the same answer &lt;br/&gt; 3) Play correct answer&lt;br/&gt; 4) Play a question card that matches the answer&lt;br/&gt; 5) Play any HOO HA! or Super HOO HA! card&lt;br/&gt; If they can do none of these they pass.&lt;br/&gt; Each of the above plays has an effect, e.g. next player misses their turn.&lt;br/&gt; When one player gets rid of all their cards the rest of the players add up the values of their unplayed cards and a running total is kept. The winner is the last player to reach 215.&lt;br/&gt; The Super HOO HA! game consists of three 81 card packs, based on the numbrs 8, 12 and 14 respectively and only one pack is used in any one game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
