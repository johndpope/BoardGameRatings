			<description>The emperor has ordered his council to relocate all pagodas away from the capital. The fastest person who completes the task will be rewarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This abstract game combined elements of puzzle, Tower of Hanoi, Ludo and Chinese checker to bring endless fun for the whole family. It is designed to help players to improve their cognitive planning skills. The game also includes a separate game called &amp;quot;Pagoda Raiders&amp;quot; of which owners can download the player's manual from the company website free of charge. The well-designed and colorful pagoda layers make this game enjoyable to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires the Qu-MAT (sold separately) to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
