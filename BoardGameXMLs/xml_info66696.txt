			<description>Science Versus Luck: A game of war, doctrine and matchsticks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is designed for a group of players - &lt;br/&gt;ideally as a fun club project. It has scope for role playing, planning and playing with matchstick cannons and toy soldiers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To work best it needs around 10 people ideally in a club setting (ie. A hall and several tables), though it will work with less, down to two players and one table (if you just play the battle game part).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The players are divided into teams of 2. There are enough briefings for six teams, though it is easy to ad teams. Ideally you need an even number of teams, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t essential.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is played in three distinct phases: 1. The Arms Exhibition - buying the weapons for the next war. 2. Evaluation and Doctrine - testing the new weapons and deciding how they will be used. 3. Battle - the acid test of both equipment and doctrine.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle phase consists of each team matching a force of miniature infantry figures against another team's matchstick-firing model cannon. The cannons are acquired by the team's by way of an auction held during the Arms Exhibition phase. A team's model cannon must be operated in accordance with the doctrine drafted by the team during the Evaluation and Doctrine phase of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
