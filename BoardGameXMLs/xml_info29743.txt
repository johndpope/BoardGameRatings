			<description>In Dutch game Afvalwijzer the players have to cope with 6 types of garbage. This could be a bag of chips, an empty package of cigarettes, ... In the centre lies the board with on it twice every location. By using die, the players walk around the board, whenever they get at a location where they can dump their garbage-cards, they can do so. He who manages to get rid of his garbage at the right location before his opponents, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
