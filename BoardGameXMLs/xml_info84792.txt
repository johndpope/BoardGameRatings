			<description>From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;Welcome to my conversion of Leverage for Savage Worlds. Allow me to make a few comments before we begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am assuming that you already know how to play Savage Worlds and are familiar with the core rules. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain any of that stuff as I go along, unless I feel something needs clarification or modification for the purposes of this conversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am also assuming that you are familiar with the television show on which this conversion is based. If you&amp;rsquo;re not a fan of Leverage, then why are you even reading this? I swear, I just don&amp;rsquo;t understand you sometimes...More seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s important that you are fairly familiar with the show and especially the main characters (Nathan, Sophie, Hardison, Eliot, and Parker), so that you can make sense of various comments and examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
