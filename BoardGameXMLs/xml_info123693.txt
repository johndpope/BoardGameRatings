			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action 52 on the Genesis was released later than the game by the same name on the NES.  Many of the games on the Genesis version of the game are new or at least greatly updated.  Just as the NES Action 52 served as an advertising project for the original Cheetahmen game, so the Genesis served as the host for a new Cheetahmen game effectively made it the third in the series.  Arguably, it is the second Cheetahmen game, since Cheetahmen II on the NES was an abandoned project which was only released several years later when the warehouse housing the game cartridges was foreclosed on.  Most of the rest of the 52 &amp;quot;games&amp;quot; are really more like demos and have the complexity of early browser games on social media sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
