			<description>&amp;quot;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;  Dirt 2 is a racing game released in September 2009, and is the sequel to Colin McRae: Dirt. This is the first game in the McRae series since McRae's death in 2007. &lt;br/&gt;  It features a roster of contemporary off-road events, taking players to diverse and challenging real-world environments. The game takes place across four continents: Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. The game includes five different event types: Rally, Rallycross, 'Trailblazer,' 'Land Rush' and 'Raid.' The World Tour mode sees players competing in multi-car and solo races at new locations. &lt;br/&gt;  Dirt 2 was reviewed positively by IGN, receiving a score of 8.4/10 from the US site, The main criticisms of the game being reserved for the lack of weather and track deterioration, and the fact that damage now has very little influence on the game, with drivers receiving a brand new car for each race.[24] The features and expanse of the multiplayer component, which was often criticized in Colin McRae: Dirt as being fairly anaemic, was completely new and improved in Dirt 2.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;  Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;  Dirt 2 features five racing disciplines, all of which are playable offline (against AI bots when applicable) and online. In addition, three 'special modes' are included. Dirt 2 runs on an updated version of the EGO engine, which powered Codemasters' Race Driver: Grid  as well. The engine features, most notably, an updated physics engine, which models realistic weight transfer during turning maneuvers, allowing the player to incorporate advanced driving techniques, such as the Scandinavian flick. The Flashback ability, allowing players to rewind time mid-race, a new feature in Grid, was kept and improved due to its popularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RALLY: racing occurs on non-circuit roads which usually involve public (closed) routes and technically challenging courses. Usually involving staggered starts, each driver competes against the clock. In addition, during rally events, a co-driver is present, constantly reading pacenotes to guide the driver along narrow and meandering tracks of up to 6 km in length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RALLYCROSS: races involve cars identical to those used in rally events; the races themselves, however, are completely opposite. Each rally-cross race involves up to eight racers competing in multiple lap events on circuit tracks of mixed surface type. The tracks, half tarmac and half dirt, exist in closed settings, such as in or around stadiums, and are approximately 1 to 1.5 km in length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRAILBLAZER: The most similar real-world equivalent of trailblazer events are hill climbs. Unlike hill climb events, however, trailblazer races do not require a positive change in elevation. Similar to rallying, trailblazing features staggered starts. Trailblazer (and hill climb) cars, unlike rally cars, usually feature massive aerodynamic aids, such as spoilers, diffusers, and splitters to help keep traction at higher speeds, regardless of track surface or conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAID: races are multi-car events involving heavyweight vehicles, such as buggies and trophy trucks. Each race begins with a simultaneous start of up to eight competitors, with tracks averaging 5 km in length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LANDRUSH: events are similar to raid races, but take place on a circuit. Each event features eight racers on a dirt track of about 1 km, and involve multiple laps.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;  Special Modes:&lt;br/&gt;  In addition to the five straight game types, there are three special variants, each applicable to multiple modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GATECRASHER: which uses Rally courses and cars, involves smashing yellow barriers; competitors race against the clock. When smashed, the 'gates,' strategically placed along the best racing line, add time to the clock; whichever racer finishes the event with the most time on the clock wins. The format of the race is more similar to a multi-competitor time trial than to a traditional rally race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOMINATION: playable Rallycross and Land Rush stages, involves multiple drivers competing to set the lowest time in any given track sector. Points are awarded based on the final number of controlled sectors, as well as the final race position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LAST MAN STANDING: is an elimination-style race, during which the driver in last place is eliminated in a 20-second interval. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dirt 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
