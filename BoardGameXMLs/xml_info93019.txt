			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters are relaxing in Limbo when their Mentor enters the waiting room. He looks worried, an expression the characters are unaccustomed to seeing on his wizened features. &amp;ldquo;An evil spirit has been haunting the earth for over 100 years. He&amp;rsquo;s been killing five women a year, each year in a different country. Now he is back in the city where it started. I fear he is on the threshold of his greatest evil. You must stop him before it is too late.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If asked who it is, the Mentor says, &amp;ldquo;Even I don&amp;rsquo;t know his true identity. That is what you must discover.

Possible vows include &amp;ldquo;I will not rest until I discover the identity of the killer,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I will not rest until I stop the killer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once their vows are made, the Mentor opens a tunnel of light. By passing through the tunnel, they arrive . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
