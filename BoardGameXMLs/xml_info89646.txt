			<description>The third installment of the Valkyrie Profile series. This time the game is an isometric tactical RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten year old Wylfred lives in the village of Tourque with his friends Ancel and Tilte, sister Elsie, mother Margot, and father Thyodor, a soldier. One day, Thyodor's friend Duwain arrives with news that Thyodor has fallen in battle, a Valkyrie's plume on his corpse indicating he was taken as an Einherjar, which Duwain gives to Wylfred. Thyodor's death leaves his family in poverty, Elsie dies of starvation, and Margot goes mad from grief. Wylfred becomes bitter and cynical, vowing vengeance on the reaper of his father's soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years later, Wylfred leaves his mother and becomes a mercenary, hoping that he may also become an Einherjar and get his revenge on the Valkyrie. Ancel follows him, hoping to divert him from his quest. During a battle at Aullewyn Keep, Wylfred is mortally wounded and hears Queen Hel's voice, asking if he will do anything for revenge. Wylfred says yes and awakens to find the Valkyrie's feather in his hand, not fully understanding what he has done. Wylfred and Ancel are called upon to fight again and, outnumbered and outmatched, Wylfred invokes the Plume upon his friend. The incantation increases Ancel's strength and they defeat their opponents but Ancel dies afterward. Hel then delivers to Wylfred a woman named Ailyth, who is to accompany him and act as a contact between Wylfred and Hel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
