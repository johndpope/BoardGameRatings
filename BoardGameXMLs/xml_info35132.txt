			<description>Historical themed card game for 2 players depicting the Protestant break from the Catholic Church. One player is the Protestants, the other is the Catholics. Players use Faith cards to bid for control of different nations. There are separate Faith decks for each player and a shared deck of Nations. Some Faith cards have special powers that affect the Bidding. Some Faith cards have special Event powers that affect the game outside of the bidding. Faith cards have period titles such as Martin Luther, Edict of Nantes, and Council of Trent. A complete copy of the rules is available for free at:  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.angelfire.com/games2/warpspawn/Reform.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/games2/warpspawn/Reform.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
