			<description>The game has a 5x6 array with each letter of the alphabet on it, plus 4 &amp;quot;free letter&amp;quot; spaces.  Each player draws a card with a 6-letter word on it, and on his turn the player rolls two coordinate dice, find the space on the board so designated, and if it's in his word, he places a chip by that letter.  If he can't, he draws a card which may let him do things like removing an opponent's chip, swapping words, etc.  One of the dice has a &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; option to choose any space in that row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first one to place chips for all the letters in his word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
