			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare for War: Basic Training simulates boot camp suitable for any war campaign in a fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As newly selected recruits, the PCs go through the rigors of basic training in which they will have to run the obstacle course, train on the use of weapons, learn the use of formations in combat, assemble a catapult, and maybe see a little combat action, all under the guidance of training instructor Sgt Lithgow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In two weeks of training, they will be cut off from the daily life of a city, and placed into a routine of training that is to be expected of an elite unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare for War: Basic Training is a zero level adventure and is intended for 4 &amp;ndash; 6 Player Characters. Don&amp;rsquo;t know how to create a zero level PC? Those rules are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 42 page product comes packed with 1 adventure, an NPC appendix, player handouts and colored maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
