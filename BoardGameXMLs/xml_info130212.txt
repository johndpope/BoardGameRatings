			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowlore II (...) will be out long before Microsoft gets all the bugs out of Windows 95.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Former NERPS Editor J.D. Falk, on Wed, 7 Jun 1995 11:33:10 -0400&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What follows is a collection of articles written for NERPS books that never were: Shadows of the Mind, ShadowLore II, and DragonLore. The reasons for their not appearing before are numerous, and include things such as disinterest on the part of the NERPS list in continuing the projects, lack of time on behalf of the original editors, and more. Now, they&amp;rsquo;ve been brought together into one book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadows Of The Mind was to be a psionics handbook for Shadowrun; although it was never finished, a very incomplete version can be found on various WWW sites, and more articles intended for it appear in old NERPS logs. I&amp;rsquo;ve dug through those logs, and added all missing articles I could find into the basic text; however, as you can see in this book, a lot still remains unwritten. At the end I&amp;rsquo;ve added a short thread about Shadows Of The Mind I also found in the logs, on the basis that it clarifies some of the things brought up in the preceding chapters. You&amp;rsquo;ll spot a lot of &amp;ldquo;to be written later&amp;rdquo;s in the text, showing just how incomplete this document actually is; the logs weren&amp;rsquo;t helpful there, unfortunately.&lt;br/&gt;Note that Awakenings tells us that psionics are normal magicians doing their magic under some self-imposed rules that makes them believe they are psionics, but this NERPS document was written before Awakenings came out. (So what if several listmembers did obtain a copy of what, at the time, we knew as the Neo-Anarchists Guide to Magic? :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ShadowLore II was to be a follow-up to the very first NERPS book, ShadowLore (hence the title), and was completed by late spring 1995, as evidenced by the quote at the top of this page. J.D. was to do the editing, but for various reasons it took him so much time that in the end we decided it would be best to read through the old logs and gather all the articles together, then edit them ourselves (J.D. having quit the Shadowrun-related mailing lists in early 1996, if I recall correctly). However, instead of opting for careful editing the texts to make all the articles fit smoothly together, as I believe J.D. had planned to do, I chose to add in everything I could find, and only edit out things like typos, spelling and grammar errors, etc. My reason for doing so is because this fits better with the thought behind Lost And Found, namely to bring old material back in the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DragonLore started out as a new NERPS project in spring 1995, around the time the articles for ShadowLore II were finished; the idea behind it was that we knew little about the dragons that live in the Shadowrun world, and it was to gather together much of the material we knew, and speculate about the rest. It never was as successful or popular as was envisioned; not all that many articles about dragons were submitted, and it was then decided to expand it to include other paranormal animals as well.&lt;br/&gt;NERPS veterans will notice that the articles written for DragonLore don&amp;rsquo;t appear in ShadowLore II in this book, which was the plan when it turned out there were less dragon-related articles than was originally anticipated. Instead I&amp;rsquo;ve made it a separate section of this book, I felt that would fit in better with the whole &amp;ldquo;compilation book&amp;rdquo; idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you know (more or less) the story behind NERPS: Lost and Found. I hope it proves useful to your Shadowrun game.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Gurth, NERPS Editor &amp;amp; Project Leader, 23 August 1997.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
