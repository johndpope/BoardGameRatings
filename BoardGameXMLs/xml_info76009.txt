			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circuit's Edge is a computer game developed by Westwood Studios and released by Infocom in 1989. It was based on George Alec Effinger's 1987 novel When Gravity Fails. The game was a hybrid interactive fiction/role-playing game; it contained a window of text, a graphic window for depiction of the player's current location, and various menus and mini-windows for character statistics and other game functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of Mar&amp;icirc;d Audran, a private detective. The game is set in &amp;quot;The Budayeen&amp;quot;, an entertainment / criminal quarter in an unnamed city somewhere in the Mideast that is a seedy reflection of modern-day New Orleans. While running a series of errands/&amp;quot;business deals&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;Saied the Half-Hajj&amp;quot;, a friend of Mar&amp;icirc;d's, Mar&amp;icirc;d is framed for the murder of a man named Kenji Carter. Although Mar&amp;icirc;d's influential patron Friedlander Bey clears him with the local police, Bey asks him to look into Carter's death. Doing so leads Mar&amp;icirc;d deep into the criminal underworld of the Budayeen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
