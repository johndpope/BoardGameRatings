			<description>From the designer notes:  &amp;quot;JITO is a multi-game format rather than a single game.  It can be simply competative, like most games.  It can be a sophisticated game that features competitive cooperation, or it can be a completely cooperative game.  You are invited to invent your own game using the board, but we would suggest that you start with the usual competitive game to learn how to balance cards most effectively and how to guess future peg locations with the greatest success. (Remember that the longest dimension of a card is from one corner to another.)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Game I., 2 players (or 2 teams of 2 players) compete to be the first the cross the board from one site to the opposite side with a continuous bridge of cards balanced on pegs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play progresses by each player throwing 2,d6 dice then a player may place a peg in the area on the board that matches the number thrown.  After placing a peg, you may attempt to balance one or more cards on your peg(s).  You may not overlap or touch an opponent's card bridge or share pegs.  You must place a card within 20 seconds or lose your turn.  The game ends when one of the players spans the board from one side to the opposite side (side to side, up and down, or diagonally).  A completed bridge is worth 3 points.  The usual match is to 6, 9, or 12 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game II variant:  This variant is a cooperative/competitive game for 3 players.   Three players attempt to cross the board, but at any time 2 players may voluntarily decide to merge and build a bridge together.  If they succeed in reaching the opposite site first, each player receives 1.5 points.  The usual match is to 4, 5, or 7 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game III variant:  This version is fully cooperative and is for 2, 3, or, 4 players.  All players work together to build a successful bridge. Individual scoring is assessed by counting the same-colored number of cards belonging to an individual player.  You may also desire to set a time limit as the goal for building a bridge together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
