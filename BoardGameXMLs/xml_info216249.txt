			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Perrenland Regional Introductory Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Schwartzenbruin the city of pleasures, on the coldest day of the year the famous festival called the Dance of Nerull has begun, tourists form all over have come to witness the macabre events of the festival, for some tourists the events can become very personal indeed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario has a complicated development and publication history, with at least four versions circulated:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        It was first circulated during 2001 as a &amp;quot;Mini&amp;quot; scenario for character levels 2 - 8; two versions of this document exist, both with &amp;quot;Version 2.1&amp;quot; on the title page, but one edited (with trivial revisions) in 2002.  These versions were withdrawn before play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        It was next circulated during 2003 as a &amp;quot;Mini&amp;quot; scenario for character levels 2 - 8, still with &amp;quot;Version 2.1&amp;quot; on the title page.  This version was withdrawn before play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The final version (still labeled &amp;quot;Version 2.1&amp;quot; on the title page) was circulated during 2003 as an &amp;quot;Introductory&amp;quot; scenario for 1st level characters only.  This is the version that was actually used during organized play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is quite unusual in dealing with fairly explicit mature themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
