			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shortly after OVA's release, an adventure-writing contest was held. This product is the winner of that very contest. The only requirement was to feature one or more of OVA's Sample NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is being offered for free for your enjoyment. How you make use of this adventure is up to you. Though it is presented as a whole piece ready for your gaming group, feel free to tinker and take apart at your leisure. As always, having fun is the most important thing, whatever way that may be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if you do not own the OVA Role-Playing Game, you may find material useful in your own campaigns. Likewise, you can use it to get a little insight to OVA itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: Players, while hanging out in a happening nightclub, become witnesses to a strange kidnapping. Their aid entreated by billionaire Grant Zurkrieg, they set off on an adventure to steal back the girl and put a stop to the mysterious master of water Lady Tempest. But all is not as it seems. What is the significance of the missing girl's crucifix necklace? Who are the mysterious men-in-black that seem to show up everywhere? Could there be some greater evil afoot? Only you can find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
