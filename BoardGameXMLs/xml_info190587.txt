							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Madness of Little Emma</name>
									
			<description>Madness of Little Emma is a roguelike platformer inspired by games such as Castlevania, Legend of Zelda, American McGee's Alice, Binding of Isaac. Help Emma find her brother who has disappeared in eerie cirumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a procedurally generated platformer where the player, controlling the title Emma has to dive deep into her basement to find her lost brother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On her way Emma will find various items which will affect her abilities and strengths granting such effects as heat aura burning adjacent enemies, bouncing bullets, double jump, laser bullets, protective shields, friendly minions and much more. Collecting power ups has a downside as picking up items results in Emma slowly going insane which is reflected by the types of monsters that are encountered - the player is supposed to find the balance between picking up items and not losing sanity too fast. On the way Emma can meet over 50 unique types of 'ordinary' monsters and almost 20 different bosses each with different attacks and powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will have an online ladder for anyone who wants to compete and compare his results to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game will be released on Steam in december 2015 on Windows, Linux and Mac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
