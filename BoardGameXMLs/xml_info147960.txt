							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forest Camp</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of an Forest Camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Halt! Who approaches this camp?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product includes a single map of a small, three tent encampment in the forest. Perfect to represent a night camp for the adventurers or a forest encampment of rangers or bandits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in fantasy games. The camp could be used as a small village in a primitive setting or even a small forest shanty commune in modern settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook for use with Forest Camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forest Bandits: The adventurers find a group of rangers who are hunting bandits in the woods. The rangers invite them to aid them in the fight against the bandits for a share of the loot. The group can either accept or refuse the offer. The rangers go on without them if they refuse, but offer to let them stay in their encampment for the night. Without the help of the adventurers, the rangers are defeated. A survivor makes his way to the camp and warns them of the coming bandits who may mistake the group as ranger reinforcements if they are in their camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A twist: The &amp;ldquo;rangers&amp;rdquo; are actually the bandits in disguise and trying to dupe the group into helping them beat the actual rangers. They have no intention of sharing the loot with them and turn on the group as soon as the rangers are defeated if they agree to go with them. If they stay at the camp, the bandits come back to rob them after defeating the rangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
