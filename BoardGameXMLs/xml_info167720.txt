							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Octo: Games of Autumn (Volume 1, Issue 2 - Oct 2013)</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If April breeds lilacs from the dead land, October blows the life from vibrant trees. Harvest brings feasting. We hope the stores will last the winter. Nights stretch, shadows grow. That country road with the trees and fireflies is now watchful eyes, creaking and cold wind. Crisp frost on early morning grass. Soon the freeze will come. You leave footprints behind that fade in the early morning light. No one saw them but you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We light fires because the nights are cold, and feel our ancestors comforted by the light and warmth and the feeling that the fire will keep Them away. Warm apple cider under bright full moons. A billion shades of orange in the trees. Virgin composition books waiting for your name + their name. Homecoming. High school football games. Crab season. Fat orange squash carved into forgotten wards. The growing silence as the birds and insects flee for warmer climes. Crowded kitchens. Migration. Jubilation. Temptation. Trepidation. Going into the cave. Jumping in a pile of leaves. The last trip to go swimming. A thousand ghouls on the streets begging for sweets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Octo: Games Of Autumn will ship mid-October 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's who is contributing so far, and a bit about what they're writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Designer &lt;br/&gt;         Game &lt;br/&gt;         Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Filamena Young &lt;br/&gt;         Trick n Treat &lt;br/&gt;         &amp;quot;Fight monsters, get your little sister the most candy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Tracy Barnett &lt;br/&gt;         It Came to Town That Night &lt;br/&gt;         &amp;quot;an apocalypse-powered horror movie RPG.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Niki Hammond &lt;br/&gt;         Fall Report &lt;br/&gt;         &amp;quot;Students - Oral presentations are due TODAY!
