			<description>This game uses a standard deck of cards without the Deuceys and Treys. The game played in four parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The draw. Players bid for the right to draw card replacements in hope of improving their hand. Only the highest bidder may do this.&lt;br/&gt;2. Players bet as to who holds the best ruff - that is, the greatest value of cards in any one suit.&lt;br/&gt;3. Players declare their gleeks (three-of-a-kind) and mournivals (four-of-a-kind), and are paid by each opponent for each one held.&lt;br/&gt;4. Players play 12 tricks, and then score for the tricks they won and their face cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
