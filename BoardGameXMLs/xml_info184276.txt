			<description>Different preconditions and as many surprises and incidents enliven this race of wedding guests. While playing, you are exercised in knowledge and mastery of the most fundamental rules of the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a rental car. With it, he must transfer the members of a family to a wedding. Before picking up passengers, the driver must prove their condition by examination. Only then you can go pick up the various family members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The driver must also buy a gift. When all requirements are exceeded, each driver must try to get the first to the wedding. But along the way not only must observe all traffic rules, but also be able to make money in various ways. Only when you have 100,000 in cash you can reach the finish line as winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
