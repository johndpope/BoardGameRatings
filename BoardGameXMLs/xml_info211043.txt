			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waiting Room is a high-contact experiential freeform designed in pursuit of magical realism. Play requires one person to facilitate, eight or more people as players, the player instructions on the following page, and a space large enough for all participants to move around freely. Play time varies though the facilitating player does have some control over pacing; however games with more players will tend to last longer. For a game involving ten to twelve total participants budget approximately an hour. Inform players that they will be photographed during play, but that if they wish pictures with their image can be cropped, modified, or discarded. All the facilitating player must do is provide the other players with their instructions, field player questions or concerns, and occasionally follow instructions themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
