			<description>In Match &amp;amp; Matrimony you are trying to marry your daughters off during the British Regency era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over a number of rounds.  Each round two eligible suitors are available to be won.  Each player secretly chooses a daughter to send in an attempt win over one the suitors.  Each daughter has unique values in 4 attributes, and each suitor has a preference for one attribute.  Some suitors are worth more than others, and in addition players are attempting to collect sets of suitors to increase their worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All but one of your daughters will be married by the end of the game, so it is important to choose suitors wisely.  It's not enough to marry your daughters to just anyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
