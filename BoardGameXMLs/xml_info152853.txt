							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Shopping</name>
									
			<description>The Game of Shopping is played with two types of cards: Money cards and goods cards. There are 35 money cards totaling $23.35. There are 16 goods cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw money cards from pile and use the money to buy goods offered for sale. The twist is that items, or a collection of items must be bought with the exact amount. So if a player makes a partial payment &amp;quot;on account,&amp;quot; then a following player can get the item by paying the exact balance due. On his turn a player may also aggregate items into a collection. The total cash in the game is exactly equal to the total value of all of the goods. The winner is the player with the highest value of goods when all goods have been bought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
