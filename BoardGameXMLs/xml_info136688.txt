			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Locales are smaller examples of the plug-in Foul Locales you will find in our latest release titled Of Places Most Foul. These locations are meant to be plugged into the existing landscape of your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mansion of Blood&lt;br/&gt;Brief Description: An old house sits behind rusting iron bars. Ivy covers the cracked brick walls and weeds poke up through the flagstones. The wraparound front porch is rotting, and a portion of its roof has collapsed in on itself. Broken windows leer down at those that pass by like the empty sockets of a huge skeletal head.&lt;br/&gt;When night falls, eerie noises can be heard coming from the house, the sounds of cats being strangled and the groan of a rocking ship&amp;rsquo;s planks on a tempest tossed sea. Lights, like those from low burning lanterns or candles, pace the upper floors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terror of Taverns&lt;br/&gt;Brief Description: A pleasant tavern set back from the hustle and bustle of the crowds, which is what most people would call &amp;ldquo;The Terror.&amp;rdquo; Unlike what its name implies, this tavern is a grand feasthall and parlor of ladies of the evening. All flavors of pleasure can be had at the Terror, whether it is flesh or food. Dancing girls and bards perform nightly, and the place is usually packed to the rafters with devoted patrons and the curious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
