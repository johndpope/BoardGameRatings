			<description>This is a game about buying furniture by the local furniture manufacturer Rolf Benz. In it players spin a spinner and move from the &amp;quot;Rolf Benz showroom&amp;quot; in the middle of the board first to one of 4 appartments to claim one. Then they move to the different furniture stores on the outer edges of the board. Each of the furniture stores carries only 1 type of furniture. A player must get each kind for his/her appartment. Getting a furniture means answering a question read by another player. If the answer is correct a piece of furniture is awarded. Then the player must spin and go back to his/her appartment to place the furniture piece. There are also &amp;quot;action spaces&amp;quot; on the board where an action card is drawn and its instructions followed (e.g. swap a piece of furniture with another player). All the questions asked in the &amp;quot;furniture stores&amp;quot; are furniture or company related.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
