			<description>A 25 min game for 2 players, ages 8+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;5x5 board &lt;br/&gt;1 draw bag&lt;br/&gt;5 cards &lt;br/&gt;24 dice in four colors&lt;br/&gt;Paper and pencil for keeping score&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;The player who can &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; the most buildings from his side of the board when the game ends is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;1.    Set the 5x5 board between the players.&lt;br/&gt;2.    Shuffle the five tetromino cards and deal two face-up to each player. Set the remaining card face-up and to the right of the board.&lt;br/&gt;3.    Place the 24 dice into the draw bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY&lt;br/&gt;The non-dealer starts and turns then alternate. Rotate the start player after each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over &amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; rounds. A player on his turn first draws four dice from the bag. In each turn a player has up to three throws rolling four dice, setting aside any and rolling the remainder. They do not have to use all three throws and may stop after the first or second.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two open cards, cards display one of five tetromino shapes. The active player chooses one of his cards and places this card face-up to the left of the board and then places his four dice onto the board matching the shape of the chosen card, any rotation and/or reflection of the shape may be used. He now adds the fifth card placing it next to his remaining card in front of him and passes the draw bag to his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player unable to take his turn may pass. If both players pass one after the other, the round ends triggering a scoring phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
