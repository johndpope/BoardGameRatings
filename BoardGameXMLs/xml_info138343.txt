Britain supported the rebels and declared war on Russia. Two objectives of the Royal Navy are to destroy the Russian squadron in the North Sea and the establishment of a full blockade of the North.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A steam-ship period naval combat simulation games focusing on fleet-scale battles in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage financial and strategic aspects while planning your squadron's structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scramble your fleet to gain sea supremacy.
