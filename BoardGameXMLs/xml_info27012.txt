			<description>From the back of the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FUTURE TANK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future tank is a two-player board game pitting players against each other with tank armies of their own choosing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have four different types of tanks to choose from in which to build their armies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Fast-Assault Tanks: Quick, highly maneuverable and able to outflank any other tank with cutting precision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Light-Assault Tanks: Fast, but more heavily armored and more heavily weaponed. It can pack a solid punch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Heavy-Assault Tanks: Slow, but carry the biggest gun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Missile Tanks: Slow and heavily armored. Able to kill from a distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are easy-to-read and play-action can let you start blasting away in the first turn! Terrain features are optional and six scenarios are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Average Play Time: 20-40 Minutes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played on a chess board, this games uses either the photocopied &amp;quot;counters&amp;quot; from the book, or minis of your choosing. You will also need a D4, D6, D8 and D12. A basic move and attack format. Lighter moves further and heaver shoots further. Each tank has a diagram showing its armor amounts (think SFB shields) and has ratings for movement, firing ranges and weapon damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
