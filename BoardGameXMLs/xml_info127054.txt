			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;First we took The Chessmaster 2000 and added 10 Man-Years of work by our programmers and graphic artists&amp;hellip;then we supercharged its brain with the latest, most powerful, chess-playing technology direct from the laboratories of Fidelity Electronics--the foremost manufacturer of dedicated chess computers--developers of the world's Only USCF Certified Master-Rated (2325) Chess Program!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting triumph contains every feature that skyrocketed '2000' to the top of the charts! Stunning 2-D and 3-D graphics, a mammoth opening library (now expanded to over 150,000 positions), 'Hint,' 'Teaching' and 'Show Best Variation' modes, and levels and styles of play from 'Newcomer' to 'Grandmaster.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus&amp;hellip;The Chessmaster 2100 boasts even stronger and more varied play with unlimited game levels (from an 'easier easy' to a 'tougher tough')&amp;hellip;triple the number of features, more and different Classic Games and greater in-depth analysis. The special 'War Room' mode even allows you to view the Board, Move List, Captured Pieces, Clocks and The Fidelity Chessmaster 2100 'Show Thinking' window all at the same time!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
