			<description>Immunity is a board game in which your immune system will fight against the pathogens agents that attempt to infect your body. Become the healthiest player of the table, and live all your life free of harmful diseases! Take the control of virus, bacteria and parasites, and strike the vital organs of your rivals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this card game, each player receives an organism board which shows the health of your five vital systems (nervous, cardiorespiratory, digestive, hepatic, and renal), as well as your age throughout the life.  There are also two environment squares that will be occupied with the pathogens before they invade your organism. In addition, the board shows different human cells (red blood cells, immune cells, platelet, etc) that can be bought with oxygen. These cells are responsible for eliminating pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 types of deck cards in the game. Pathogen cards can be placed on the environment squares of the rivals, in order to infect and harm their organs. Medic cards can be used to prevent damage, transplant organs, eradicate microorganisms, etc. There is a common deck for all the players, the environmental deck, which represents hazardous effects that can affect the health of a person, like occupational accidents, blood donation and school fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game emulates in a proper way some aspects of the immunity, like the inflammation, adverse effects of medicaments, the disease transmission, the spread of tumors, and many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
