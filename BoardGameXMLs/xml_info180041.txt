							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magic Shop</name>
									
			<description>The Magic Shop is a game of magical, mercantile mayhem! Players each assume the role of a wizard or witch running their own magic shop, using ingredient cards to to concoct potions, talismans, scrolls, and magical weapons and armor with the help of your apprentices. Apprentices are sent into the market to gather magical ingredients and advertise to potential customers, or you may have some stay in the lab to help with the work of enchanting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ingredient cards are placed into your &amp;quot;cauldron&amp;quot; to produce a dice pool. This dice pool is then rolled in an attempt to complete enchantment lines (sets of specific dice facings). Players may opt to try and add more dice to their cauldrons to complete additional lines to make their items more valuable, but risk drawing magical accident cards that may make their apprentices vanish, curse the item, or turn some of your hard-earned gold into lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast spells to help you in your endeavors by having an apprentice visit the caster's tower, or hex your opponents to give you an edge in your quest to be the greatest magic shop owner in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try to anticipate your customers' needs when they arrive and sell them as many of your finished items as possible and pave the way to your victory! Victory Points are earned primarily by making the most gold selling your enchantments, but victory points may also be earned from completing all enchantment lines on a magic item. Points may be lost if your items end up cursed. The wizard or witch with the highest number of victory points at the end of eight turns is considered the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
