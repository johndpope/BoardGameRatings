			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I was listening to the first episode of Bayou Beatdown &amp;ndash; specifically the base creation part &amp;ndash; it occurred to me that forcing characters to roll standard fudge dices regardless of the power tiers for investigating was arbitrary and some how unfair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also occurred to me that having several characters rolling dice versus an unknown tier difficulty was challenging if the GM did not want to disclose the difficult tier to keep the players in the dark whereas they succeeded or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I set up to find a way to overcome this difficulty and came with the following rules. Those rules are also well suited for any kind of information research or more generally any test the GM does not want to disclose difficulty tier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
