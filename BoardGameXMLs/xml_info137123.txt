							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NAVALUM Naval Strategy</name>
									
			<description>NAVALUM is a boardgame of naval strategy. The game emulates the situation in the world during the era of sailing boats before the construction of the Suez Canal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the number of players, each one of them has at their disposal a number of resources to place in their geographic regions and boats. Each player must decide their strategy to follow during the game in order to achieve the score fixed for the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the conquest of empty geographic regions and the forecast of the movements of your opponents are crucial to keep ongoing your choices to win the game. Most of the resources to run the game are normally shipped in your boats, sometimes you'll need more load capacity in your army to assure a final alpha strike attack and others just quick boats to colonize or steal your opponent's assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these matters have been taken into account to provide you a real laboratory of the world&amp;rsquo;s geostrategy at the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
