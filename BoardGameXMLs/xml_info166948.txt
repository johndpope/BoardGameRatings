			<description>In the king's court, more tall tales are being told than players can shake a stick at! The cat cook sometimes likes to pretend to be a princess pig, and it's not uncommon to hear the frog-legs minstrel crow like a knight rooster. The only thing players can be sure of is that the animals are not always who they pretend to be! If players want to go far in the king's court, they have to know a story when they hear one and be able to keep a straight face when telling one of their own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With animal cards in their hand in Flunkerk&amp;ouml;nig, players lay them face down in turns, mimicking their sounds as often as the number of the animal appearing on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But careful! A players' card must show a greater number of the same animal played, or at least one animal of a higher-ranking animal. If they don't have the right card in their hand, they have to keep a straight face while pretending they do! Whoever has the fewest penalty points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
