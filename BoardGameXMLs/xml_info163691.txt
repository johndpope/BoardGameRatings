							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Viktor Kalvachev&#039;s BLUE ESTATE the game</name>
									
			<description>He is the one and only son of Don Luciano, the boss of the West Coast Cosa Nostra, located in Los Angeles. The Don has given him the opportunity to prove himself as a leader and businessmen, by putting him in charge of an establishment called &amp;ldquo;The Smoking Barrel&amp;rdquo;. The Don is aware of his son&amp;rsquo;s lack of management capabilities, but there is still hope he could improve and may be one day even become &amp;ldquo;the Don&amp;rdquo;, although Don Luciano isn&amp;rsquo;t holding any high hopes. The club was making decent money and even had a star dancer, who was pretty famous amongst the strip joint circles. Her stage name was Cherry Popz. It was going to be an easy ride to simply run the club as before and don&amp;rsquo;t screw up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tony however is nothing more than a violent psychopath, who is absolutely incapable of taking rational decisions and responsibilities. His ego is bigger than a football field and nothing has ever been his fault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
