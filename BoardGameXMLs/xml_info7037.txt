							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Domination</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The two greatest challenges facing the military leader today are imparting professional knowledge to the solder and subsequent application of that knowledge in a training environment and/or on the field of battle . . . Training Technologies is committed to making that first great challenge much less difficult for you by enabling you to obtain a solid grip on the fundamentals of military knowledge; and we hope that by mastering 'Domination' you will become a much more knowledgeable and professional soldier/leader.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A trivia game in the style of Trivial Pursuit (fill your jeep with passengers by answering questions in various areas of military knowledge). Features 100 Q&amp;amp;A cards with questions in six different categories. The Domination questions come in six categories: Leadership, Soldier Skills, Weaponry, Military History, Tactics, Friends and Foes. Veterans and hardcore military buffs will appreciate questions such as &amp;quot;When utilizing the leaf sights of the M203 grenade launcher, what is the maximum range you are able to select?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
