			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're armed, dangerous, and ready for action. They're the D.R.A.G.O.N. Force--Drastic Response Assault Group Operations Network--an elite international strike force made up of the 14 finest combat soldiers in the free world. Your assignment in this individual combat simulation is to lead your team of top-secret trouble-shooters on special operations to the hottest hot spots worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your missions, should you choose to accept them, include rescuing hostages, raiding terrorist camps and cocaine labs, blowing airbases - 12 &amp;quot;delicate&amp;quot; operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As team commander, you'll enlist 7 men for each mission. Choose from the best of the best from the D.R.A.G.O.N. Force files.  Classified dossiers detail the specialty, experience, and individual strengths of each Force member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outfit your men from an impressive arsenal of 16 lethal personal combat weapons. Add some grenades or extra ammo, and you're ready to rock and roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the action starts, strike hard and fast as you battle against time and the enemy. But stay cool under fire. To achieve your objectives, you'll need all your strategic skills as you command the simultaneous actions of team members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be a big hero, and you might get a medal (if you don't get killed). Get caught, and your own mother will disavow all knowledge of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No mere arcade game, D.R.A.G.O.N. Force is a realistic strategic simulation of individual level combat from award-winning wargame author Roger Damon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
