			<description>Half-Time Football follows all the rules for playing professional football.  You can play the game in four quarters.  Decide on how many minutes you want each quarter to last.  Dice change hands according to whether you are on offense or defense.  Use the score board and pegs to keep track of your score.  Use the football to mark the line of scrimmage and the down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
