			<description>&amp;quot;Sjansen&amp;quot; is a Dutch word for flirting. It's a tongue in cheek game about flirting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;In the bar, at courtside or in class rooms: flirting is possible everywhere. Nevertheless one is better at it than the other. Fortunately a game exists that teaches you flirting in three simple lessons. Decide how far you will go and with whom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a matter of luck, an enormous challenge, but above all it's a tactical game. Newbies need practise, others are naturals. Anyway every single student needs to do it often. Everyone gets the same lessons but not everyone will learn as fast. Mixed signals, it's all there. Take your chance and maybe you will find Mr. or Mrs. Right this way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
