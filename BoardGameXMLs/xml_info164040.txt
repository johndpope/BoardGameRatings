			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Battlemap of a City Campus at a scale of 20 feet per inch, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Homework was never like this in high school.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is a single map of an outside view of a college campus with a quarter circular shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in modern settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extracurricular Activities: Most people join campus clubs for fun. But what the other students don&amp;rsquo;t know is that you joined the fencing or archery clubs to improve your aim, precision, and accuracy for deadly serious reasons. The campus is a normal college campus by day. But at night, the place crawls with creatures of the night. Vampires, werewolves, demons, all stalk the college campus looking for meals. You and your closest confidants have banded together to fight these creatures and keep the campus safe. Making the task even more difficult is the need to keep your grades up at the same time. Can you and your fellow students survive, find the source of these creatures and their connection to the campus, and still get good enough marks to graduate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
