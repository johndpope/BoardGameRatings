							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Prismatic Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atop Starreach Peak, far above the clouds, a tower with stained glass outer walls stands and collects the sun. Here, the Prismatic Guild, led by the sorcerer Atrementous, conducts their experiments with colour, infusing it into their spells. Visitors undertaking the journey to the Prismatic Tower gain access to powerful prismatic and other colour-based magic, provided they have the coin to afford it. However, dark rumours have surfaced regarding the guild, their (some would say) dangerous research and a breach into a strange dimension of prismatic colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Places of Power are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a flavoursome locale such as a remote temple, borderland fort or reclusive wizard&amp;rsquo;s demesne. Ready to be plugged into almost any home campaign, each instalment can be used as a waystop on the road to adventure, the home of a powerful NPC or even as a mini-adventure site in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
