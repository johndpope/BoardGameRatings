							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Zoom</name>
									
			<description>Game of Zoom is a spin-and-move aviation race that involves four different spinners: a Dispatcher dial for take-off and landing, a second for determining Altitude, a third called Weather which governs movement forward, and a fourth called Radio which provides good/bad news as a result of some spins of the Weather dial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the birth of regular passenger air service in the United States, with each player flying between coastal terminals while stopping at cities along the way. There are four color-coded routes, and each player flies one plane E-W and the other W-E along his route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planes have a 50/50 chance of taking off or landing when they wish to do so, and if they fail, that player's turn passes. The altitude dial then determines how far into the sky spaces above the map that the plane moves, but this is for visual impact only. Planes must take off, move forward, and land at each city on their routes. Once a player has two planes en route, the Weather or Dispatcher spin can be used for either plane. Oddly, the four routes are not equal: two have 9 cities, one has 10, and the fourth (orange) has 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is undated, but because it was manufactured by E.E. Fairchild in Rochester while being marketed under the All-Fair brand, it was certainly published in 1938 or later, and most likely, given the theme, just after WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
