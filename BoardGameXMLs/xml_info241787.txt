			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister Ball is the first completely original arcade-type game for a computer.  Not a copy, not an adaptation, not a spinoff, Blister Ball is new - it's a new idea - better than invaders, better than Circus, better than Asteroids, better than Galaxian.  If you've played other games for hours, you'll play Blister Ball for days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does it work?  Well, some mean but fun-loving aliens have produced some bouncing bombs.  First they drop one and you've to to position yourself under it and zap it with your laser.  If you miss, that's OK.  It will bounce around, although each bounce is lower, and you have several chances to zap it.  Got the hang of it?  OK, here come two bouncing bombs.  ou zap them.  Then you're faced with three, then four and five.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As they bounce longer and longer the walls begin to close in so you're faced with either zapping the bombs or being hit.  Each hit knocks you a little further toward the gutter.  But you can survive two hits which is usually enough to zap all the bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feeling confident?  Don't.  Because after 5 bombs the murderous little devils drop 5 bonus bombs, worth ten times as much.  These don't bounce, so you get only one shot.  You need nerves of steel and the reflexes of a tail gunner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you complete one round, the game stars again with bombs that bounce faster and lower (and are worth more) than the previous ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister Ball is a fantastic solo game.  But there are two-player options as well in which players can play as a team or as opponents.  Each player can move the entire width of the screen and zap any of the bombs.  Here, you're not only trying to survive, but trying to outscore your opponent.  The game has two skill levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
