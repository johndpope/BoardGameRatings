							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gypsy Queen Fortune Telling Cards and The Game of Stars</name>
									
			<description>36 cards. Half a fortune telling accessory and half a game. The important part of the rules, the Game of Stars, is a card game in the spirit of Black Maria in Britain or Hearts in America.&lt;br/&gt;Two to four persons can play. The cards rank in the order indicated by the number in the corner, 1 being low. The cards are dealt one at a time until each player has eight cards. The object of the game is to avoid taking tricks which contain cards in the unlucky suit of Stars. There are four suits, Squares, Circles, Diamonds and Stars. The highest numbered card of suit played wins the trick. Players must follow suit if they can. After each hand every player counts the number of unlucky cards (Stars) he has had to take. Every Star card counts one against him and the winner of each hand wins one point for each Star card in his opponents' tricks. First player to get 25 points wins the game. &lt;br/&gt;The unlucky Stars are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Pride&lt;br/&gt;2. Danger&lt;br/&gt;3. Malice&lt;br/&gt;4. Gossip&lt;br/&gt;5. Calamity&lt;br/&gt;6. Envy and Jealousy&lt;br/&gt;7. Sickness&lt;br/&gt;8. Disappointment&lt;br/&gt;9. Tears and Sorrow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
