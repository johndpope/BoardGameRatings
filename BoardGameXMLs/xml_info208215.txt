			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario details a single night in a coaching inn. It is an eventful night with lots of action and the GM should make some notes and read it through a few times before running it. There are plenty of NPCs for your players to interact with. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if the various plots interact or clash with each other, that is part of the fun. Your players will add their own particular blend of WFRP mayhem to the mix. This adventure is suitable for characters in their first or second careers. Don&amp;rsquo;t be intimidated, run the events at a steady pace and remember to have fun. We had a lot of fun writing it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
