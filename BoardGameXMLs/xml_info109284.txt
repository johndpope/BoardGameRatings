			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZDefense is a vector-drawn, hexagonal, free-form tower defense game, and the towers can be upgraded (straight-path upgrades) to phenomenal potency.  As with most free-form tower defense games, you are disallowed from cutting the invaders off from their goal; however, the game is played on a hexagonal map, and as the game progresses, some of the spaces have special attributes, which provides dynamic challenges to the player.  The game has a tutorial, and features three levels of difficulty.  The third level of difficulty is customizable:  Basically, you decide just how difficult you want it to be.  ZDefense also sports a level editor and a built-in screengrabber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
