			<description>Connoisseur is a game based on the wine industry. Each player takes the part of an international wine shipper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players travel round a board using dice, in the usual way, matching GRAPE cards they collect along the way to WINE cards that they have to purchase (52 wines labels, of which only 3 are available at any time(face up)). By obtaining a matching GRAPE and WINE label, and buying a LICENSE, the player can then produce that wine, which earns them money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to establish monopolies - there are only 2 WINES for each region, and if the player can produce both, they own that region. Target for a short game (90 minutes) is 3 monopolies, while a normal game (2-3 hours) is 6 monopolies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a simple roll and move game, as there is a certain amount of economics in the game - the value of everybody's wine is dependent on the VINTAGE, which changes periodically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no need to have a knowledge of wine, as the information on what grape makes what wine is provided on the cards. So unlike &amp;quot;The Wine Game&amp;quot;, which tests your knowledge of wine, &amp;quot;Connoisseur&amp;quot; actually teaches you about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is well produced, with a nice board, printed in colour, and very nicely finished cards and playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
