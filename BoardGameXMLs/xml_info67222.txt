			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So Capitan Swagbeard, tell me about the time you defeated 10 men with your raging halitosis.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Well there I was, still passed out from having lost that drinking contest, and when i came to, standing above me were 10 men. They were glowering at me with murder in there eyes. One of them says 'Swagbeard! where here to our revenge on you for those horrible taxes you forced us to pay'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swagbeard pushes forwad the Taxes card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I says look, you must be confused, my taxes were nothing but just, how bout we have some rum and forget all about it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swagbeard pushes forward the Rum card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Unfortunately they were having none of it. And just at that time i could feel the hardtack i had eaten for lunch rumble around in my tummy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swagbeard pushes forward the Hardtack card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capitan Clovis plays the That thing was possessed card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no Swagbead, the hardtack you ate, well it was possessed! I'm making it more difficult&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So you know how people claim that when you burp it was just the food coming up to say hello, well this time it was actual true. I belched forth a horrible belch and out came the hardtack. It was not just any hardtack, it was possessed hardtack, with wings of halitosis and horns of digestive juices. The hardtack flew around the room attacking the men, which gave me enough time to escape on me schooner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swagbeard pushed forward the Schooner card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I call Shenanigans on that Swagbeard, you were supposed to tell the story of how you defeated the men, not how you escaped!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shenanigans is a card game of piratey fun and tall tale telling. Somewhere between an RPG and a card game, each player takes on the role of a fearsome pirate complete with a pirate ship. You tell silly pirate stories to the other assembled pirates about your pirating life. During the course of the game you get items that must be used in the telling of the stories prompted by story cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To tell silly pirate stories until the deck runs out&lt;br/&gt;Number of Players: 2-6&lt;br/&gt;Recommended Number: 3-5&lt;br/&gt;Best Number: 4&lt;br/&gt;Play Time: 60 - 90 Minutes&lt;br/&gt;In The Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;119 Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 Story Cards&lt;br/&gt;59 Item Cards&lt;br/&gt;5 Of Cards&lt;br/&gt;10 Modifier Cards&lt;br/&gt;5 Narration Cards&lt;br/&gt;10 Ellipses Cards&lt;br/&gt;What you need&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 thingamajigs per player. Anything really, we will call these 'Shenanigans Tokens'.&lt;br/&gt;Name tags, placards or index cards. Something to display your pirate name to all the other players.&lt;br/&gt;A pen or pencil (to write on the name tag).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
