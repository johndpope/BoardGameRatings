			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Game of Rhyme and Reason.&lt;br/&gt;In this hilarious cross between Chinese whispers and drawing charades you start by inventing a rhyme... Anything from &amp;quot;A Rat on a Mat&amp;quot;... to &amp;quot;A Fish on a Dish&amp;quot;... or even &amp;quot;Plaice in Space&amp;quot; The next player then has to draw your rhyme! Moving clockwise, the initial rhyme is hidden and the drawing interpreted as a new rhyme... ... and that is where the fun begins! With everyone drawing and guessing at the same time it's a crazy, frantic, befuddled muddle of a game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a round points are scored for drawing a phrase correctly and for recognising the original rhyme. Several rounds are played and the winner is the first person to score 20 points.&lt;br/&gt;Contents: game pad, pencils, score pad, rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
