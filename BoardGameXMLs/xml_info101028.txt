			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hanging with friends is a game from Zynga(with friends) that follows their template of a 2 player game based with both hotseat play and turned based network play on mobile devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is strongly based around the classic hangman model, with a few twists. Players are give a rack of letter tiles similar to that of scrabble(words with friend) and use these letters to make up words in hangman style that their opponent then needs to solve within preset number of guesses. If the opponent fails guess the word they lose a balloon after X of fails they fall into the lava and the game is over. Players take turns both attempting to solve the word of their opponent and making words with their tiles to stump their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another twist is that letters have a value again similar to scrabble and can gain bonuses with random score/point bonuses if they can stretch their letters/words to meet these bonus squares. The points are used or can be spent on gaining hints or getting more guesses when attempting to solve their opponents words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
