			<description>History of Civilizations is a card-driven civilization game for 3 to 8 players that depict the rise and fall of empires from 4000BCE to 1900CE. Each player leads his empires to Glory through conquest, trade, science, religion, wealth, culture and many other means. The player with most Glory at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History of Civilizations differs from most other civilization board games as each player controls several civilizations at once. The game is divided into 5 Ages and takes place on a map spanning the entire world. Each round, players will take turns playing cards from their hand to build cities and wonders, move units, adopt religions, gain powerful leaders, trade with other empires, produce new units and many other things. Each card also depicts an empire that can be started if the game has reached a certain age and an event. Events can be played to affect the game in many ways; everything from natural disasters, generals, spies, revolts, golden ages and usurpers is included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each empire has an individual set of Glory conditions that define what that particular empire must achieve in order to earn Glory points (victory points). For example, the Mongols want to be the largest empire in the world and conquer other empires, whereas England wants to have the most colonies and the largest navy. At the end of each round, all empires in play gain Glory according to their empire card. If an empire is performing poorly, it can simply be discarded to free up that empire slot, allowing you to play another empire later. This way, new and more modern empires keep coming into play as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History of Civilizations has many small and simple parts that make up a complex and highly dynamical game, where no two games will play out the same way. Imagine western history without the Romans and Greeks. What if the Aztecs and Incas held out against the Spanish conquistadors? What would the world look like if you made all the decisions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
