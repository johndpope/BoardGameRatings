			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just before that, though, a very interesting argument had just ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different aspects of the mind of God had incarnated long before the start of time, with the intention of making their opinions heard. Gabriel, Michael and Uriel formed a power block and refused to give up on the concept of determinism. Samael favored free will, and wanted a democratic decision made about it, but Phanuel refused them all point blank, saying that as the Face of God, He/She/It had to have the last say. Israfil tried to set Himself up as mediator (as usual), but was distracted as Raphael and Haniel almost came to blows over whether humanity should experience pain. Only Azrael, the Angel of Death, stayed out of it. As It watched the ensuing threats and complaints, It found Itself shaking Its head. With the entirety of creation at stake, a metaphysical argument could cause a fall from grace for eternity. It would be a miracle if they got it all started without killing themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking at the universe we got, who said it was not created by a committee?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archangels : In the Beginning is a Freeform LARP (Live Action Role Play) event game using A Token System, set at the dawn of time for sixteen parts of the mind of God. I wrote this game after an overdose of Vampire, Cthulhu and ghost games, and wanted to see life on the Other Side. Divine power, infinite possibility, boundless ego. Does that spell trouble? You betcha. Knowledge of any gaming system is unessential, and in fact may give headaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
