			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Smugglers Run. An adventure designed for four to five players from levels one to two. Smuggler's Run, once considered the primary pipeline for Corinthean contraband in the great City of Jor-Carmin, has been dormant for quite some time now. Officially claimed by Corinthea nearly 20 years ago when a toll was placed on the road; the farmhands and settlers along the old route have enjoyed peace and fair trade since, albeit heavily taxed. The humble villagers of Hamilton, who once would have to sneak their goods throughout the kingdom, now are simple farmers, traders, and craftsmen who are happy to play by the rules. Still, the dangers along Smuggler's Run have not entirely vanished. The players in this adventure are hired to investigate a lost caravan. What seems a simple task that any farmhand could do turns into something much more intriguing. The path to becoming a hero starts somewhere. The mysteries of Smuggler's Run may be more than just urban legends and are filled with more questions than answers, but will the players have the guile to investigate it's shady past? If they make it through to the end, it will be up to them to decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
