			<description>The game is described as 'designed to allure the minds of youth to an acquaintance with the wonders of nature'. The playing surface has 37 playing spaces each with an animal. The game is played with a teetotum marked on eight sides. The animals featured include the otter, armadillo, beaver, sheep, rat, lynx, monkey and fox. The end of the game is marked by the lion. The game comes with a booklet which describes the animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two or three persons may amuse themselves with this agreeable pastime; and if a double set of counters and pyramids are purchased, six persons may play at it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
