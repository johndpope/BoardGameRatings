							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Claw Law (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Claw Law, 1st Edition is the core rules natural weapons combat system for Iron Crown's original Rolemaster fantasy role-playing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first edition book was later combined with the weapons attack charts from the book &amp;quot;Arms Law&amp;quot; as the second edition book &amp;quot;Arms Law &amp;amp; Claw Law&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claw Law covers animal attacks, martial art attacks, and inanimate object attacks such as those from thrown objects or a fall.  This item includes 12 natural weapons charts, various critical strike tables, and three blue pages with additional rules and along with statistic charts for animals, monsters, martial arts, and additional weapon conversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Internet sources state that the first printing was simply a group of loose chart pages which came in a bag.  Later versions were saddle stitched or came in a box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
