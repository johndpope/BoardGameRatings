			<description>Hellcats Over the Pacific is a flight simulator computer game for the Apple Macintosh computer written by Parsoft Interactive and released by Graphic Simulations in 1991. Hellcats was a major release for the Mac platform, one of the first 3D games to be able to drive a 640 x 480 x 8-bit display at reasonable frame rates. The graphics engine was combined with a simple Mac interface, a set of randomized missions and a number of technical features that greatly enhanced the game's playability and made it a lasting favorite into the mid-1990s. The basic Hellcats engine was later adapted to produce a series of games, including A-10 Attack!, A-10 Cuba, the F-18 Hornet series and early versions of Warbirds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hellcats Over the Pacific&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
