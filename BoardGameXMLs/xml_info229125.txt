							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Axes and Allies</name>
									
			<description>Axes and Allies is a simple dice game for 2-6 players.  One axe and 1D6 are required for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his turn a player rolls his dice.  The number obtained is the power of his axe for that turn only.  The player than has the choice between attacking another player or declaring an alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If he chooses to attack, he selects a victim (he may not choose to attack an ally) and rolls his dice.  If the roll is less than the power of the axe the attack is successful and the player is eliminated.  If the roll is equal to or greater than the power of the axe the attack fails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If he chooses to declare an alliance he may ally with any one other player.  The individual chosen has no choice in the matter.  Allied players may not attack each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any point a player rolls a one for power all players' past alliances are voided.  If a player is allied with all other players, that player's turn is limited to a power roll (to see if they roll a one).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player to execute a turn is considered the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
