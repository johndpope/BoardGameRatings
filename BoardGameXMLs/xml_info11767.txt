			<description>The object of this game is to score points by matching as many safari animals as possible. An entire deck of cards is dealt, and players fan out cards in their hands without showing them to the others. Before play begins, each player matches pairs (or sets of four) from their hands and places the matches face-up in front of them. Players then make new matches using the other player's pairs. The game ends when all possible matches are complete. The player who collects the most points wins. This game encourages fine motor skills (handling a fan of cards), concentration, and sorting and sequencing, and it promotes interactive play and social skills. The game includes 44 safari animal cards, one lion card, one vulture card, and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
