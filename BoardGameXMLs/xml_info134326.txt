			<description>Monopoly: Zapped Edition updates the classic game by combining the attributes a board-game with the technology of an iPad/Phone/Pod Application.   The APP is free and is quick and easy to download from the APP store.  The basic mechanics of Monopoly are here, but with an updated look and no hard currency.  Players use the app to buy and auction property, transfer money, pull Chance/Community Chest cards and take part in mini-games as play evolves.  Each player has their own touch-banking cards which track their balances and allow for electronic transaction on your device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Board comes with Rubber Pads, 6 tokens, 28 Property cards, 32 green houses, 12 red hotels, 2 dice, 4 Monopoly Touch-banking cards and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:  An internet connection/iTunes account are required to download the app but not for game-play.  App is in English language only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
