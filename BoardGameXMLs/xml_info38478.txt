			<description>From publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chaos Expansion is all about giving the players more control over their adventurers. With these new cards the player can now choose to encounter a danger, or not. Do they want attempt to open a possibly trapped chest? Failure might mean death, but success could bring a ton of treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chaos Expansion also introduces a new way to win the game. Now instead of just being able to defeat the vampire lord to win the game, players can collect Chests of Power. The first player to collect three wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Choose what your hero encounters and whether the risk is worth the reward! &lt;br/&gt;- Change the way you win the game &lt;br/&gt;- Hire henchmen to create strategic options &lt;br/&gt;- Explore new magical obstacles, traps, and random event cards &lt;br/&gt;- Discover powerful treasures &lt;br/&gt;- Chaos also includes 1 new hero -- Made by Robert Doyel!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
