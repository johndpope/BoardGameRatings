			<description>A Sci-Fi twist where Allied forces battle to destroy a time-travel port that guarantees the survival of the enemy's supreme human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Soldiers is a turn-based game for 2 players (Axis &amp;amp; Allies) or two teams of up to 3 players each. Played on a board divided into 3 separate areas for temporal jumps (Giza, Egypt 2560 BC, Holy Roman Empire 1248 AD, and Central Europe 1945 AD), and 1 area where soldier reinforcements can be acquired by each team. Located in the center of the board is a time-travel port that transports soldiers through both time and space to engage in battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary object of the game for the Axis Powers is to finish their two-stage plot to rid the world of the human race in 1945, then time-travel to the future in 1946 to start a supreme human race. The primary object of the game for the Allies is to locate the time-travel port, battle Axis forces to gain control of it, and shut it down before the Axis Powers finish their two-stage plot. If either stage of the plot is finished, the dynamics of the game changes drastically with battles in both time and space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control and move soldiers of different ranks and powers in an attempt to battle and control element cards used in the Axis Powers&amp;rsquo; two-stage plot, with movement and battle results determined by dice rolls. There are multiple successful strategies that could be used to win, and both sides have an equal likelihood of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by award-winning video game designer and artist Ray Shingler, utilizes lessons learned from a 15 year career in video game and virtual world user interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
