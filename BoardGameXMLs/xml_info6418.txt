			<description>Chronicles is a trivia game that asks players to guess when certain historical events took place.  The questions are designed to enable players to reason their way closer to the answers, and partial credit is given for how close one comes, dependent on question difficulty.  The partial credit element of Chronicles makes it somewhat distinct from other trivia games in which players either know the answers or they don't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
