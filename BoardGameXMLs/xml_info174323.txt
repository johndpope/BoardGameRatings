			<description>The All-Seeing Eye is a speed-based card game featuring simultaneous play and symbol-recognition for two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are trying to make points by slapping matches as fast as possible. Players can only hold one card in each hand and play to three piles in the center of the table. They may discard cards from either hand to their discard pile. If Players do not have cards in their hand, they may slap the center three piles if they see a match. A match may be made by slapping three of the following combinations: three of the same color of top symbol, any three same parts of a symbol regardless of color, and the whole symbol matching regardless of color. Slapped matches or missed matches are removed from the board quickly and play is continued. Color matches score one point, part symbol matches score two points, whole symbol matches score five, and missed matches are scored minus two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
