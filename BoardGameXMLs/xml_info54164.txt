			<description>From the title page verso:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is eco&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;eco is a different kind of RPG. Rather than delving into lost dungeons, crossing the vast emptiness of space or stopping dangerous foreign spies, players in eco take on the roll [sic] of ordinary animals. Well, not quite ordinary. The PCs of eco are Aware, granted sentience and an ability to learn far beyond normal animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;eco was designed with two types of players in mind. The first are typical gamers accustomed to fantasy, sci-fi and horror games who are simply looking for something different, something unusual, to play between their normal games. The second are those new to roleplaying, younger players who are just discovering this hobby. eco is an excellent introduction to roleplaying as well as being an educational game that will help younger players learn about the world around them: zoology, ecology, pollution, habitat destruction, teamwork, problem solving and other valuable skills. Welcome to the world eco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please Note: eco requires the Omni System&amp;trade; core book to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
