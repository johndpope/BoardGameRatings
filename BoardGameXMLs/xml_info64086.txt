			<description>This is and old soviet union board game about fishing. This introduces fishes that live in Estonian part of soviet union (back in those days) and regulations and rules for fishing those fishes. It is not permitted to catch fishes under regulated size and like in life is in this game - the one to do so, will be fined. Catching fishes right size will give you an advantage on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;The follows a story, like most games back from that time. The story starts with leaving home and finishes with getting back there. Winner is the one who caught most fishes. On the way you have obstacle like leaving your bag home or you broke your fishing rod! All this things will held you back while other players just keep catching the good fishes and moving towards the end. Very entertaining old board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
