							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Presidente</name>
									
			<description>Presidente is a quick, fun game where the smartest presidential candidate wins. It puts the player in the role of one of the candidates , who will do anything to win this presidential election, including using various dirty tactics against his opponents. Luckily, the victims can use the newspapers they own to spread the truth and walk away clean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not everything has to be achieved by cheating. You can also win elections cleanly, working honestly, achieving an impeccable political career, performing marches and other activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructions: Every player has a hand of 5 cards, which he replenishes from the deck after every play. On his turn he will play one of the cards in his hand. Usually he will play them in his own tableaux in one of three piles, votes (orange), money (green) and influence (purple). The person with the most votes at the end of the game is the winner, but you will need money and influence to be able to play the cards with the most votes. Sadly, the cards representing the strongest money and influence have the whiff of corruption about them, and if an opponent sees corruption in your tableaux, he can use the press to strip you of said money/influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when all cards have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
