			<description>From the creator's website:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to DIGI-WORLD, the only resource for pen and paper role-playing in the Digimon world setting. Taking elements from everything from Digimon Adventure to Digimon Frontier, we hope to bring you the definitive players guide. On this site you will find the rules for basic play, as well as world setting information for anyone unfamiliar with the Digital World. Initially this page is designed to mirror events from season 1 of Digimon Adventure, allowing only for your partner to evolve to Champion level, but regular updates will also be added. These take the form of sub-sites that will be linked from this main page, bringing you additional rules and scenarios such as Armor Digivolving, advanced monster lists and Spirit Evolutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system in use is designed to make play as streamlined and simple for both the Game Master (GM) and the Players. For the purposes of play the enthuses is very much on the Digidestined, as children from all over the world are drawn from the safety of the real world and pulled into a world of adventure and excitement with their new Digimon partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
