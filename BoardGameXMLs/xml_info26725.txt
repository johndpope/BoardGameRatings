			<description>A German game based on one the most popular game shows on German television in the 1960s of the same title. The game includes a board, two plastic crossbows, pawns, dice, three plastic balls and a plastic figurine, as well as a cardboard with holes in it. Apparently, the player moves along the board by rolling dice. If he lands on a field with an apple or bulls-eye he has to shoot an arrow through the appropriate hole on the cardboard component. The player that reaches the bulls-eye in the center of the board first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(game number assigned by Noris: 626/2450)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
