							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King Under the Mountain</name>
									
			<description>You and your friends are Dwarf Lords leading an expedition to a remote mountain, rich in resources the Dwarf Kingdoms need. You each lead a group of Dwarven Miners and workers as they delve deep into the heart of the mountain. You goal is to establish a new, powerful and wealthy Dwarven kingdom and become King under the Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you will send your Dwarf Workers out to mine through the mountain, build buildings, craft jewelry, ingots, coins, and armor. You make all the decisions, no dice to determine what resources you receive. Do you mine that gold and mint coins to lure more dwarf workers to come to your banner? Or do you harvest gems to start building your hoard of jewelry?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resources located in the tiles include:&lt;br/&gt;Iron ore&lt;br/&gt;Raw Gems&lt;br/&gt;Gold Ore&lt;br/&gt;Coal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items which can be built as cards you hold include:&lt;br/&gt;Steel ingots&lt;br/&gt;Gold Ingots&lt;br/&gt;Cut Gem Piles&lt;br/&gt;Gold Coin Piles&lt;br/&gt;Warrior Gear&lt;br/&gt;Jewelry Piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are produced in the following buildings which are placed onto the table as tiles, replacing caverns and mines: &lt;br/&gt;Smelter&lt;br/&gt;Jewelers shop&lt;br/&gt;Smithy&lt;br/&gt;Mint&lt;br/&gt;Armory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But plan your realm layout carefully, at some point your delving will converge with those of your competitors. At that time the game changes and you will need Warriors to defend your fledgling realm. Or you may even decide to go on the attack denying the enemy their buildings and resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the building of a mighty military or a greed inspiring pile of jewelry you can become the King Under the Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
