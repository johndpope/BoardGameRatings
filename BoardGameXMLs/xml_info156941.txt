			<description>from the Preface:&lt;br/&gt;This dungeon was created as an example to appear in a commercially available set of rules. As if often the case in the development cycle, needs changed and the project was orphaned (so to speak). The actual map was produced by Paratime Design specifically for the project and is reminiscent of several sample dungeons from the halcyon days of our hobby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our first product, intended to fit into a larger scale setting to be released by the Wobbly Goblin as it is developed. The so-called Old School gaming community has produced a lot of good work but has come under some (not completely undeserved) criticism for trying to make a buck off the hobby. Thus, Wobbly Goblin Press was born, a creative outlet for getting some fun, cheap material out to gamers everywhere. We are striving to create both free PDFs and at cost print-on-demand works that are cleanly formatted, well-organized, and fun to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope we have succeeded. Let us know!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;note from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;With minor alterations this adventure may be used with any rules based upon or compatible with 1974 Edition D&amp;amp;D FRPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
