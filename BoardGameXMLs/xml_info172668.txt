							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yogi Bear</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the game cassette box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a bear that's smarter than the average, life in Jellystone Park should be one long picnic.  After all, everyone knows picnics mean picnic baskets!  But life has taken a nasty turn.  Poor little lovable Boo Boo has been &amp;quot;bearnapped&amp;quot; by a bloodthirsty hunter and is a prisoner somewhere in the Park!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic as ever, Yogi is on Boo Boo's trail.  But Jellystone's a big place and you'll have to find plenty of tasty snacks to keep our trusty bear's strength up.  Especially since along the way Yogi's pursued by angry campers, a furious Ranger, ferocious animals and homicidal hunters!  Time's getting short too.  Yogi's hibernation season is nearly here.  So you'll need speed and a lot of bare (ouch!) cunning to rescue Boo Boo before Yogi slumps into his slumbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step into Yogi's paws and see how long you can survive in this bonanza of fast-moving arcade action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
