							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Green Lantern Power of the Ring Game</name>
									
			<description>The path is filled with excitement and danger: will you master the four constructs that you need to defeat Parallax? When you arrive at the lantern with the ring, press on the lantern to see the result. An unlit ring means you have to go back on the track. A lit ring means... you've won! Light up the ring and recite the Green Lantern oath!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a pip die to move around a circular board. Only after collecting all four types of Green Lantern Constructs will a player leave the main board and have an opportunity to win the game. Varying spaces along the way distribute Constructs or force players to discard Constructs, while other spaces allow a player to send themselves or other players to a space of his or her choosing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two notable components also affect game play. By landing on a ring space, a player might take the Lantern's ring (an actual light up ring component), allowing him or her to roll the pip die twice and pick from the outcomes. Finally, even after collecting all four Constructs, a player must successfully charge their ring to win. A large Lantern battery piece gives a player a roughly 2/3 chance of victory by spinning a plastic piece, pressing a button, and awaiting the random response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
