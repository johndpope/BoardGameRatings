			<description>Game Overview: A small box, a small price ($10), and big fun! Fire Ants! is a card game where you play as an ant and fires are breaking out throughout the ant colony. As a fire ant, you must extinguish those fires by collecting resources from the card deck. The fires can only be extinguished by collecting a certain number of metal cards, a certain number of plastic cards, and a certain number of water cards. You will also find ant magic cards which can be used in place of any resource card that you need. Each fire card that you extinguish is worth a certain value. The higher the point value on the fire cards, the more resources that are needed to extinguish that fire. At the end of the game, if all fires were extinguished then whoever scored the most points from their fire cards win. However, the game can beat you when seven fire cards are played at the same time and no one can put out the fires. When this happens, your entire colony has burnt to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box Contents: The game comes in a small box that easily holds the 90 playing cards within it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play: At the start of the game, each player is dealt three cards and a five point double sided fire card is placed in the middle of the table. This fire will not be extinguished for a few rounds with players drawing a single card. You will need a total of 11 resources (2 metal, 4 plastic, and 5 waters) to capture this card and to put out this fire. While players are drawing cards to get that five point boost to their score, other fire cards may be drawn. When this occurs they are placed down onto the table. There are two five point fire cards, two four point fire cards, three three point fire cards, four two point fire cards, and five one point fire cards. If at any point, seven fire cards are placed onto the table, one of the players must put out a single fire without drawing any additional cards. If no one can, the game is over and the colony has burnt down and everyone loses. If you are able to get through the entire deck, then you know someone will win. You will need to reshuffle the cards and then it is a race to get the remaining cards to determine the overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Chad Osborn (thedicehaveit)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
