			<description>This was published sometime between 1910 and 1930 in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a 9 x 9 grid of black and white squares 2 players move their pawns diagonally from their own corner towards the centre of the board. Here, the central area of 9 squares is marked (the &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; squares are red).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 1 &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; and 8 &amp;quot;additional&amp;quot; pawns. Starting position is on the 9 spaces of one corner (creating another square), the main pawn in the middle of the 8 additional ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game, players agree upon a goal to reach: One out of 7 ending positions to fulfill with their pawns. All of these positions are located in the central area, from 2 pawns sitting on two opposing corners of the area up to the full 9 spaces of the centre. If the goal includes the central space, the main piece has to be placed there to reach the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players move one of their pawns one space diagonally. You can &amp;quot;catch&amp;quot; an opposing pawn by having two of your own pawns on each side of it - again diagonally. You can then pick it up and place it on any unoccupied space of the same colour anywhere on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who manages first to fulfill the goal wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
