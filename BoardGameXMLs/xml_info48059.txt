			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Blood Runs Cold is an OSRIC, old-school adventure for four to six characters of 10th-12th level. Blood Runs Cold features five new monsters, players handouts and gorgeous maps.This adventure is penned by Chad MacPhee and Greg Oppedisano, authors of &amp;quot;The Jackal's Redemption&amp;quot; appeared on Dungeon #95. Many generations ago the land that is now the Blackened Fen was actually the thriving and warlike city-state of Shyyth. Populated by a race of evil humans knows as Annelids, Shyyth was a religious center of dark renown where the Annelids held sacrifice to their vile god Hirudinea. The Annelids worshipped the Drinker of Life, Lord of Slime and Leeches. They tattooed their bodies in leech-like patterns of mud brown and deep ochre and drank the blood of their enemies. As penance their priests would attach leeches to the exposed parts of their bodies, always feeding their essence to the Drinker in return for His granted powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
