			<description>56- 2 sided, hand stamped wooden tiles depict words, word parts, letters, pictograms, symbols, and/or numbers.Grab as many as you wish but at least 10 and say what ever you can say in an interconnected manner that makes sense within 2 minutes while other players hover to gain points off your demise.Players use their tiles to form interconnected sentences, words, slogans, phrases,names, countries, etc...anything that makes sense and can be explained if challenged. High points win.Players score two points per tile played but subtract points for unused tiles.Bonus Round points are scored at 3 points for and one against for all un-played pieces. Proper spelling, grammar and English are not necessary and Multi and Bi-Lingual use is allowed. Phonetic, symbolic, numeric and literal use for all pieces. Think Caveman,Shakespeare and Einstein trying to communicate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
