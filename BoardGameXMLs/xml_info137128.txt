							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roadkill Rumble</name>
									
			<description>It's Vehicles vs. Varmints in this whacky(!) card game where you try to flatten that fauna! Two players pit critters against cars to see who can accumulate the most roadkills. But watch out! You also have to avoid other hazards on the road while you attempt to hurdle that turtle! Big cars are tough to crash while little animals are fast enough to avoid the dangers of a busy highway. The first player to get 100 points of roadkill wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: After drawing a hand of 3 Hazards, each player flips a Critter/Vehicle, the faster of the two getting to play and resolve the first Hazard, followed by the second. If both are still alive then they rumble, with the larger of the two winning the trick and scoring. This continues until one player has scored 100 points worth of roadkill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
