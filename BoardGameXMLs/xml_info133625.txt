			<description>The game is set in Elemental, a world once filled with magic that used to house magnificent civilizations. This world has been ravaged by war, and has been torn apart by Titans, immortal beings who sought to control the world. The game is the story about the survivors. The Kingdoms of the West are dominated by men and value the power of the individuals, while the Empires of the East who are dominated by other races believe in raw strength and strive to increase their power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental, Fallen Enchantress has a single-player campaign, and a nonlinear &amp;quot;sandbox&amp;quot; game-play. Outside the campaign, players win by conquering or allying with other factions, or fulfilling an epic quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player control a pre-built or custom sovereign leading a faction; each has characteristics affecting gameplay. The sovereign founds the factions capital and may then be sent to explore the world or govern the city. Cities can research technologies, build military units or can be improved by building buildings or harvest nearby resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sovereign or other recruited heroes may do quests to gain experience, gildar, the game's currency, or other benefits. Heroes may also fight alongside military units, hunting down some of the many beasts of the world, or interact with other AI-controlled players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Military units can also be customized, allowing the player to make unique units that fits the current technology or resource level, not unlike Alpha Centauri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is a magical place where elemental shards may be harvested and canalized as mana to spellcasting heroes. Crystals can be used to give units special abilities. Spells can be used to alter the world, improve a city or to heal, hurt or alter the abilities of military units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research are divided in three different technology trees, civilization, warfare and magic. New and improved technologies allows the user to build improved buildings, better weapons or to access new abilities or spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
