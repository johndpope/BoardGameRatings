							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rally Cross</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rally/racing game in which much relies on having your car not topple over. The cars run on a bumpy course, and all four wheels' torque and suspension is calculated individually, in turn affecting the car's momentum and rotation. The cars are more like off-road trucks than rally cars, and keeping the balance on the bumpy road becomes the main part of the game; Rally Cross is less a racing/rally game with high-speed drifting, and more a three-dimensional physics engine with cars in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US version has a 4-player mode, whereas the Japanese version only allowed for 2 players, while also allowing an &amp;quot;in-car&amp;quot; view that the US version didn't have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was sequelled by &amp;quot;Rally Cross 2&amp;quot; that ran on a completely different physics engine and thus shared nothing with the original game except the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
