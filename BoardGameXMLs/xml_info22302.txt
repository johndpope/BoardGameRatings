			<description>Last Man Standing is a simultaneous-play gambling game.  Cards representing fighters are played one per round over five rounds by each player and 'paid' with coins equal to their value.  As fighters are defeated, their coins are collected by the winning fighter.  Players also put coins in a pot which is won at the end of the fifth round by whichever players have surviving fighters.  The player with the most money at the end wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Man Standing was first published as part of Chief Herman's Holiday Fun pack.  It was conceived on a road trip across Eastern Washington as a cross between Lamarckian Poker and Dogfight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
