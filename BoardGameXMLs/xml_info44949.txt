							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slayer&#039;s Guide to Orcs</name>
									
			<description>Footsoldiers of Evil&lt;br/&gt;Orcs are the foot soldiers of evil, the creatures that make up the hordes of darkness that threaten to overwhelm the good peoples and turn the entire land into a region of little else than slaughter and depravity. Most Games Masters use them as the guardians of low-level dungeons, just a slight step above kobolds as a threat. Often they are simply portrayed as evil humans and are given little more thought than that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside You Will Find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Physiology: Whilst the life of orcs are often brutal and short there&amp;rsquo;s more to them than meets the eye&lt;br/&gt;     Habitat: Where and why orcs can most often be found&lt;br/&gt;     Society: From Tribe to warcamp to raiding party, orcish societies are geared towards warfare&lt;br/&gt;     Methods of Warfare: There are few things for which orcs are renowned, but fighting is one of them&lt;br/&gt;     Roleplaying with Orcs: Breathing life into orcs as a race, including the dread Battle Shaman&lt;br/&gt;     Prestige class, blessed by their gods for combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Scenario Hooks: A selection of ideas on how to use orcs in your campaign&lt;br/&gt;     Gruk&amp;rsquo;s Kamp: A detailed orc camp is presented&lt;br/&gt;     Orc Reference List: A ready to go list of characters and enemies for players to face, when they stumble across these evil creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
