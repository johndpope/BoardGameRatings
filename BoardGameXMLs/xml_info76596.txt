			<description>This is a race game from 1 to 60 and was produced during the black-out period of the Blitz in Britain. Special squares on the game board resulted in different things happening during the course of the game (i.e. Dogfight in the sky, stop to watch and lose your turn, Red plane shoots down enemy, receive two tokens, black and red flyers collide, lose two turns, etc.) Players start with a number of tokens which are at different times placed in the kitty or removed from the kitty. The first player to reach #60 wins and gets 2/3rds of the kitty the second place player gets the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: be the first arriving at target space 60, moving by turns. Simple 'Roll &amp;amp; Move' game. &lt;br/&gt;Translation of the title &amp;quot;Feindliche Flieger in Sicht!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Enemy Planes in Sight&amp;quot; - see further remarks about the Klee company in the data base&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
