							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Archetypes of Cthulhu</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stars Are Right&amp;hellip;For Your Next Character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eldritch, the strange, and the weird are often relegated to the domains of villains and NPCs in fantasy, with the good guys being the ones who stand in the way of the dark things that remain just beyond our perception, which we can never truly understand. But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&amp;mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&amp;rsquo;t fit in with normal society&amp;mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this book, we focus on the most famous Lovecraftian horror of them all, Great Cthulhu. Slumbering for aeons in the cyclopean city of Rl&amp;rsquo;yeh, the alien horror introduced in The Call of Cthulhu has the power to drive men mad from across the globe. Whether or not they reference this mythos entity directly, each archetype builds on themes closely associated with it, including dreams, sculpting strange statues, and gaining power when the stars are right. This book contains the following archetypes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The dream warrior, a fighter archetype who is empowered under the right stars, can enter the dreams of others, and even survive in dream form if slain.&lt;br/&gt;    The eldritch investigator, an inquisitor archetype that can detect otherworldly creatures and read the dreams of those she encounters.&lt;br/&gt;    The seer of strange aeons, an occultist archetype plagued by horrible psychic nightmares that provide myriad strange insights, and who can store extra focus in a dark stone idol.&lt;br/&gt;    The Cthulhu mystery, for oracles, which grants a wide range of Cthulhu-themed powers.&lt;br/&gt;    The mad chanter, a skald archetype whose insane chants can drive men mad or grant strange visions.&lt;br/&gt;    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who worship Cthulhu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
