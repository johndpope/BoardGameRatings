							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Hitch Hiker</name>
									
			<description>Players try to complete a travel route across the board using a spinner and action cards. The first to reach their destination wins. On each turn the spinner directs player movement. Spaces on the board can direct you to jump to other locations or to draw cards which can slow you down (take a slow vehicle) or speed you up (take a fast vehicle). They can also (as in Monopoly) send you to jail or to the Hitch Hiker hospital. As is often the case in the 1930's, the Hitch Hiker theme is pasted on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
