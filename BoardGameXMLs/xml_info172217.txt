			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue #49: Unique Superscience Artifacts V&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With amazing powers, terrible mutants, and scientific advancements available only in our collective imagination, Mutant Future stretches the bounds of conception. From a foundation of Clarke&amp;rsquo;s Second Law and Goblinoid Games&amp;rsquo; supplement Realms of Crawling Chaos, we present superscience artifacts, devices that are one step beyond and seemingly magical even to characters familiar with wondrously advanced technology. This issue of Wisdom from the Wastelands coalesces around the mind-bending, with artifacts ranging from hazardous personal-improvement gear and pet accoutrements to a many-pedal building and diabolical nightmare toys for both kids and adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These items are intended for Mutant Future games but could easily fit into other science-fiction or fantasy games with little or no adjustment. Each artifact is so detailed every one could become a central plot point or continuing idea for whole gaming sessions &amp;mdash; or entire campaigns. They are not one sentence, throw-away items: each has a history that will hopefully enrich, inspire, possibly even drive your own gaming story, and we hope you enjoy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
