			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A little girl lost...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For three years the Mayan Cutter terrorized the metahumans of Seattle and many point to their inability to stop him as the reason Lone Star lost it's Seattle contract.  Shortly after Knight Errant took over, the killings stopped and the Tin Men took credit for bringing him down.  But now the killings have started again.  Is it a copycat or is it the real deal?  You'll have the chance to find out when a grief-stricken Mr. Johnson calls you to track him down so he can get revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternative publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mayan Cutter and Tempo were two of the causes that the Star lost its Seattle contract. Shortly after Knight Errant took over, the killings stopped. Conspiracy theorists believed the Cutter was a ploy by KE to bring the Star down but now the killings have started again. Is it a copycat or the real deal?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CMP 2010-02: Copycat Killer was originally released as part of the 2010 Convention Missions series and was only available at gaming conventions. This adventure also serves as a prequel to SRM04-05: On a Silver Platter.&lt;br/&gt;This adventure also has loose ties with CMP 2010-03: Ashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
