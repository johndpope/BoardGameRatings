							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robinson Crusoe Game</name>
									
			<description>A vintage game (1961 or 1962) for up to four players who move a little boat around a series of Islands in search of Robinson Crusoe and Friday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn he or she spins the arrow and will move either the ship or his pawn that many spaces. The ship moves in a circle around a series of islands stopping at a pier on each island where a player can leave the ship and then move point to point across the island to a location where a counter is placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most counters are blank on the reverse side.  There are however two counters (one for Robinson Crusoe, and another for his man Friday).  When the player finds both locations, which he keeps secret from his opponents, he must then take the ship back to the starting island and declare  where he believes the Crusoe and Friday counters are located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of 10 counters placed face down on ten different locations (one on each of 10 islands).  The spinner also has two spaces which indicate the player should draw a card instead of move a certain number of spaces.  The cards either direct the player to &amp;quot;move the ship to any island&amp;quot;, or move the Pawn directly to any island without having to use the ship to carry his pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
