			<description>44 cards depicting 11 different animals or birds.&lt;br/&gt;Two games are in the rules, one for a variation on Pelmanism (sometimes called Pairs) and the other for a variation of Snap (the noisy children's game).&lt;br/&gt;In Pelmanism, players have to use their memory, by turning over two cards. If they match, that player keeps both cards. The idea is to win a majority of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;Snap is a traditional game where cards are turned over and if two match, you must call &amp;quot;Snap&amp;quot; and if you are the first to do so, you can keep the cards. The object is to take all the cards eventually.&lt;br/&gt;The illustrations aren't by an artist as they usually are for this company, but they are photographs taken at a Wildlife Park, by Phillip Wayre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
