							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Animae</name>
									
			<description>From the most primitive tribes to the most cosmopolitan cities, the notion that all things possess an awareness and can be called upon for aid is a popular one. While the gods are revered for their raw power, most commoners pay only lip service to them. The gods, while often active in the affairs of humanity, rarely interest themselves with the day-to-day needs of the people. In many cultures, worship of household spirits and personal gods is widespread. These spirits, known collectively as The Animae, number in the tens of thousands. Though not true gods, they have a direct impact on the day-to-day existence of those they watch over. From preventing food from spoiling to keeping a drinking well clean, their duties may be mundane in scope but vital to the survival of a family.&lt;br/&gt;Mythos: The Animae, explains the nature of these strange spirits, from how they come to be to the powers they possess. Learn how to design customized Animae for your campaign, or even allow players to create their own guardian spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
