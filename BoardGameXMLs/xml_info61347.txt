							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gallia, Land of Chivalry and Intrigue</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A setting for d20 fantasy, inspired by the myths and legends of medieval France...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Alana Abbott has created a highly detailed sourcebook for GM's, packed with npc's, monsters, magic items and equipment, intriguing places and more flavor than a piping hot pot of bouillebaise! Discover the rules for jousting tournaments, the chivalry of knights and courtly love. Indulge in local lore and gossip of such legendary characters as Charlemagne, Ricky of the Tuft, Analise the Ugly, Renart the Fox and Blue Beard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For PC's there are new Prestige Classes like the Mousquetaire and Goliard, and rules for playing 'Talking Beasts'. Beautiful interior artwork and a full cast of memorable characters, as well as rare treasure and magic items make Gallia a unique addition to your gaming library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the d20 Magazine Rack review by Duane Nutley:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Gallia is a great resource for DMs or players wishing to play in a more medieval setting. DMs who have read the literature of the age will have a library of options available to them when using Gallia as a setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again Dog Soul Publishing has brought out a quality product detailing an area from Earth full of history and literature. Alana Abbott has done a great job in providing a region full of player opportunity, while giving DMs the bare bones so that they can flesh Gallia out as they wish. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
