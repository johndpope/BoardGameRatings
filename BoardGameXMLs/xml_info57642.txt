			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T5 gives you the opportunity to take part in a unique combat simulation set in the mostly unexplored and devastated future, where earth has witnessed four prior world wars and life is primarily spent on survival. Countries go to war over water and food. Paper and coin monies are unknown-with bartering being commonly accepted and &amp;quot;currency credits&amp;quot; taking the place of traditional money exchange. once again, the seas and oceans are largely untamed and ruled by pirates. the skies never see human flight as it was once known. worldwide population is cut by over two-thirds. Earth is reduced to a savage and primal state with new multinational borders. Cached old technology comes back and new &amp;quot;futuristic&amp;quot; technology is limited and held at the highest and most top secret &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; levels. Scientists are typically regarded as the most important life forms on the planet and must be protected-and retained-at all costs, for they may very well be the saviors of the human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play T5 as a traditional tabletop miniatures wargame or roleplay as one of the characters - or both simultaneously - while you explore this sanguinary new earth. if you prefer, you can have the game run by a game master igm), or have it run on its own with all the players filling the role as gm and having a say in the course of the action-no more waiting for someone to run the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission awaits...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 422 page Master Rulebook is packed with all the rules and information you need to play both miniatures and role playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A complete easy-to-use game system with all the charts and tables you need.
