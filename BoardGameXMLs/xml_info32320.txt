			<description>High Noon was published in the Swiss gaming zine &amp;quot;AHA&amp;quot; #87/4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of 12 spaces, where 12 subsequent races are carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 4 players has 1 token and a set of 6 cards, numbered from 1 to 6. These cards are used to move the tokens. Every turn, all players play one of their cards simultaneously. Passing other tokens is possible at the cost of 2 movement points, but landing on occupied fields is forbidden; such a move would forfeit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the first race starts with all tokens off the board, the following 11 races leave all tokens where they have been at the end of the previous race. But the finishing line will be shifted by 7 fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 12 points can be won per race and the winner is the player with the most points after all 12 races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
