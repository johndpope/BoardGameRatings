			<description>A rare card game for the late Victorian era. For once, it is not a Snap, Happy Families or Old Maid variant.&lt;br/&gt;The cards have a fair amount of text on them (see images), not just the naval illustration. I am assuming that cards are revealed and interaction takes place between the different kinds of vessels now on view. The Battleship can protect 'Simple cards' drawn against a Destroyer. The Cruiser is a 'Simple card' itself and needs the protection of the Battleship. And other ships have their 'rules', the Destroyer, the Merchantman and the Torpedo Boat. A Victorian boy must have been thrilled with this game, with its military links.&lt;br/&gt;By the way, the odd title is intended to be pronounced 'Sea-Fight'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
