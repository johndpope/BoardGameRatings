							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Powerplay: The Game of Knowledge and Strategy</name>
									
			<description>POWERPLAY is a question and answer game of political and social issues.  The questions are based on 5 categories (committees): War, Environment, Commerce, State (International politics and policies), and Domestic Policy (U.S. policies and public opinions).  There is a range difficulty from &amp;quot;lots of people know this&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Wow!  I didn't know that.&amp;quot;  More difficult questions have multiple choice answers and higher point (vote) value.  Using political reasoning and/or logic can yield a correct answer even when it is not initially known.&lt;br/&gt;The board for POWERPLAY resembles a Senate chamber.  Players are &amp;quot;Senators&amp;quot;.  Each player/team gets a &amp;quot;Committee Table&amp;quot;.  The object of the game is to correctly answer questions in each category to gain &amp;quot;Committee Seats&amp;quot; as well as more votes than your opponents.  &lt;br/&gt;Strategies that can be used include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    answering multiple choice questions correctly before the answers are read gives the player double the votes for that question&lt;br/&gt;    censuring an opponent sends them to the censure room where they cannot answer questions to gain Committee Seats or votes&lt;br/&gt;    filibustering allows a player to remove votes from their opponents&lt;br/&gt;    players can remove opponents from Committees on which they have already gained a seat&lt;br/&gt;    players that have a Seat on every Committee have a choice: either allow their opponents to chose the category for the next question and automatically win with a correct answer or continue playing and maintaining control over which category questions will be answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POWERPLAY game pieces are made of wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
