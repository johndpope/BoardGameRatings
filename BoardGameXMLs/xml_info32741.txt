							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tru Action Electric Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>TRU Action Electric Baseball game by Tudor featured a spring loaded bat and a magnet that was used as a ball. The pitching device threw the ball at a target which stood upright behind the batters side of the field. on that target was BALL. STRIKE and WILD PITCH. Once the &amp;quot;ball was thrown at the &amp;quot;plate&amp;quot; the batter sitting behind the wall which was the plate used the spring loaded bat to strike the target plate hitting the ball in the air and on to the playing field where a number of circles were marked. Hitting the ball into a circle was an out. Little men similar to those used in vibrating football games of the same ilk were used as base runners and &amp;quot;ran around the bases once the power was turned on. A &amp;quot;fence or wall&amp;quot; was also situated after the outfield and any hit &amp;quot;ball that stuck to the wall higher than the fence was a HOME RUN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
