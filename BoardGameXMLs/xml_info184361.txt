							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sherwood</name>
									
			<description>Sherwood is the campaign setting used with the Claymore! rules.  It is a complex setting derived primarily from various published sources which are incorporated by reference.  These sources are then adapted or modified by supplemental comments specific to Sherwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary source of Sherwood comes from four related articles by Ian Malcolmson, originally appearing in Dragon Magazine #274 (August 2000):&lt;br/&gt; - Steal from the Rich (p. 54)&lt;br/&gt; - Wolfsheads (p. 58)&lt;br/&gt; - The Great Greenwood (p. 62, with poster map)&lt;br/&gt; - Rogues &amp;amp; Royal (p. 66)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These articles are adapted by a PDF document titled &amp;quot;Sherwood House Rules&amp;quot; (4 pages).  A random encounter system also is provided by a PDF document titled &amp;quot;Sherwood Encounters&amp;quot; (3 pages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Secondary source of Sherwood comes from TSR's The Complete Castle Guidebook for AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Ed.  This is adapted by a PDF document titled &amp;quot;FutalSystem&amp;quot; (12 pages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Secondary source for Sherwood comes from TSR's Legends and Lore AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Ed.  This is adapted by a PDF document titled &amp;quot;ArthurianHeros&amp;quot; (5 pages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Secondary source for Sherwood comes from an unnamed supplement for Roll Lord Games' Castles &amp;amp; Crusades.  This is adapted by a PDF document titled &amp;quot;Sherwood C&amp;amp;C Mods&amp;quot; (2 pages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for converting Rolemaster character stats to Sherwood are provided in a PDF document titled &amp;quot;RMto3E(robinhood)&amp;quot; (4 pages).  Rules for multiclassed characters are given in a PDF document titled &amp;quot;Multi-Class Characters&amp;quot; (2 pages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These various documents are distributed as a set.  Successful use of this disparate material from various publishers, with adaptation to Claymore!, would be difficult to say the least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
