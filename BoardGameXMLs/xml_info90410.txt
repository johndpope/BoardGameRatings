			<description>Earth 2160 is a real time strategy (RTS) computer game, the third in the &amp;quot;Earth&amp;quot; series and developed by Reality Pump studios. It is a direct sequel to Earth 2150.&lt;br/&gt;Plotline:&lt;br/&gt;Earth 2160 follows the progress of the factions, the United Civilized States, the Eurasian Dynasty and the Lunar Corporation, who, after escaping the doomed Earth, headed for Mars. After a time of relative peace and recovery, the factions once again come to blows, with a fourth faction of extraterrestrial nature, named the Morphidians, coming into play. Just a few thousand humans were specifically chosen for the evacuation of Earth, and as such manpower and resources are limited. Upon reaching Mars, the factions set about completing the difficult and lengthy task of terraforming the planet independently of one another. As the game begins the process appears to be far from completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Earth 2160&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
