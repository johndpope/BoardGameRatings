			<description>Note: We finally figured out what to do with the base mechanic; this game is back under active development as of late 2010.  The theme below will likely change while keeping the base mechanic and adding some others.   Maybe you'll see it at BGG.con 2011.   Fingers crossed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are future trying to commute home from work -stopping for groceries along the way- via pedestrian teleporters in a future world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of moving a player's pawn around a board made of placed hexagonal tiles representing physical locations connected by teleporters.  The board grows as tiles are added and is constantly reconfigured as teleporters are disconnected and reconnected to distant locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teleportals is a light-hearted and quick (10-20 minutes) game with a significant strategy element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
