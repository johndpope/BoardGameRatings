							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The End: The Boston Massacre</name>
									
			<description>From back of book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When The End came, only the Meek were left to inherit the Earth. It took thousands of rotting corpses to teach the few living that being &amp;quot;meek&amp;quot; is no longer an option. And the Meek have learned. Deep within one of the birthplaces of liberty, a young colony struggles against two mysterious foes. These Sons of Liberty have begun to build a new world upon the corpse of the old, but their dream is about to die...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refugees from the rubble of New York have begun to stream into Boston. The Sons of Liberty are struggling to help these fellow lost souls, but many of the refugees carry with them a strange illness which resists cure and is consistently fatal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worse, bikers and road trash from the South are close on the heels of these refugees, almost driving the refugees before their &amp;quot;army&amp;quot;. Claiming allegiance to a dark general in a giant citadel of stone, these rag tag soldiers show no mercy. Is this the coming of the dark empire promised by the emisarries of evil during the last days of the revelation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The struggle for survival within the decaying corpse of a once strong world has sent many of the Meek to an everlasting death. Join the struggling colony of Boston and its Sons of Liberty as they attempt to deal with the twin threats of war and plague while preserving their young colony... and what's left of their way of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
