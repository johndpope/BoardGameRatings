			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Connect 4 card game brings added dimensions to the classic 4-in-a-row contest. Wild colours give more choice, and power up actions and secret missions ramp up the challenge for your colourful connections!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn draw a Connect 4 tile and place it next to a tile already in play.  Making the patterns shown on your secret mission cards completes them.  The first player to complete 4 missions wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards conation power ups that may allow players to take a second action on their turn and alter the tiles already in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the shuffle card app to add an extra element to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
