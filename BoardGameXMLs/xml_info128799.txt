			<description>Psight refers to a collective of psychics founded by the gifted Clairvoyant known as The Seer. With the aid of a powerful Telepath (Psi-Guardian) she sought out others of various talents to swell their ranks. She organized them in preparation for a war she foresaw hundreds of years into the future. The Psight competed with each other to gain strength and to teach the future generations to use their abilities. This competition became known as Psight, after the order itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Psight, each player takes on the role of a psychic within the order of Psight. The goal is to defeat your opponents using your various Powers, Memories, and Abilities. If you gain Dominance over a Domain, your road to victory may become easier, as your opponents will no longer be able to use any additional Powers, Memories, or Abilities from your Domain. However, plan your actions carefully, because one wrong move could easily spell defeat. With a well-planned strategy and a little luck, you can be the last psychic standing and claim victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psight is a strategy card game designed for 2-4 players. The objective is to out think your opponent and be the last player with cards in your hand. It plays similar to many CCG's without the expense of constantly buying booster packs or individual cards. We strongly disbelieve in the pay-to-win gaming model so everything you need to play with up to 3 other friends or family members is included in the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psight is also a color-blind gamer friendly game with the use of Domain names and symbols on every card in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
