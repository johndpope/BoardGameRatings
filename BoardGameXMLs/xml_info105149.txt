			<description>What is the fastest series-produced car in the world? When was the first crash test dummy built? And what is the Michelin Man's real name? Welt des Automobils (World of Cars) is a quiz game with 600 questions about car models, car manufacturers, advertising slogans and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, one player reads the question on a card, followed by the five possible answers. Unlike most other trivia games, the number of correct answers to the question ranges from one to five, but players don't know how many answers are correct. After reading through the answers once, the player reads them again one by one. Players secretly decide whether they think an answer is correct, hiding one of their answer tokens in hand if they think it is. Players reveal their guesses simultaneously, then place their tokens on the numbered answer card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After players have guessed on all five answers, the correct answers are revealed, and the players may move forward on the scoring track:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If a player has placed one or more tokens on incorrect answers, he does not move on the scoring track.&lt;br/&gt;     If a player has placed tokens only on correct answers, he moves forward a number of spaces equal to the number of (correct) answers he selected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an agreed-upon number of questions, the game ends, and the player who is furthest on the scoring track wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
