							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Battle for Germany</name>
									
			<description>From publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;In 1989, the governments of eastern Europe fell leading to an end of the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet leadership surrendered to the political and economic realities they faced. Events could have been different. Last Battle for Germany is a simulation of a military climax of the Cold War. The game is played against a backdrop of unknown political and military events over which the players have no control, but to which they must react. Players maneuver their divisions, brigade and regiments across a map with 15 kms per hex during turns representing 48 hour. An innovative game system represents each subordinate commander's headquarters and support assets. An integrated air game completes this definitive simulation of a Warsaw Pact-NATO conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
