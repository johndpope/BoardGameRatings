			<description>ScatterLand is a game of strategy and deduction for 2-4 players.  It takes roughly 30 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic idea is that players are exploring an archipelago in search of islands. The game board consists of a 9&amp;times;9 array of 81 squares, further divided into nine 3&amp;times;3 boxes. There are 18 islands total, but these islands aren&amp;rsquo;t distributed randomly; instead, they are arranged so that two islands occupy each 3&amp;times;3 box, each row, and each column.  What's more, these islands are initially hidden from view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players claim one square per turn.  A player either places an island of her color in the region (if there's an island there) or a boat of her color in the region (if there isn't).  Players are trying first to discover and then to connect together as many islands as they can:  the more islands they connect together, the more points they receive at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use logic to determine where the islands are likely to be, but logic alone is not enough:  players must also think tactically and strategically in order both to foster their own growth and limit the growth of their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ScatterLand takes no more than five minutes to learn (or to teach), but its gameplay is surprisingly deep.  There are a lot of things to try to balance when deciding where to play:  do you want to claim a new island as your own or try to connect two of your islands together?  Do you want to try to consolidate your own position or be the first to explore a given area? Do you want to focus on expanding your chains or trying to cut off your opponents?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two versions of the game are included:  the basic version (described above) and the advanced version (which limits the number of exclusive islands any one player can claim).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ScatterLand can be found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/&lt;/a&gt; -- just click the links toward the bottom of the page for both the rules and 20 additional boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
