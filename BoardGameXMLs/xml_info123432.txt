							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Siege Towers For Two</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Step into the medieval battle and build the higher Siege Tower to take over the enemy castle! In this fast and fun game made for two players sharing an iPad or Android tablet, your task sounds simple: drag the wood, spikes and cannons onto your wheeled base platform so that you'll end up constructing the higher tower. There's only three things in your way to an easy win: gravity, a ticking clock... and the other player, who is trying to build an even higher tower and whose cannons are directed at you!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
