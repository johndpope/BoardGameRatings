			<description>Santa's Special Delivery game is essentially a Candyland variant designed around Christmas.  &lt;br/&gt;Cover Game for Gameplay No. 10, December, 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving around the board delivering Christmas gifts.  A spinner is used to determine movement.  The first player to deliver 4 gifts and return home wins. Santa needs your help delivering gifts this year!  So pack up your sleigh and away you go!  Be the first to deliver all of your gifts and return home to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It appears the game is a kind of race game. The article announcing the game describes it as &amp;quot;an educational fantasy game (featuring) four elven characters by the names of Alfy, Beezy, Chappy and Doozy, who assist players in collecting the toys they will eventually help Santa deliver. The game's objective is to stress the importance of the philosophy that it is better to give than receive.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
