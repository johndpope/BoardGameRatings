							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Veil of Truth: Space Opera Rules and Setting</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The late 21st century seemed surprisingly similar to the mid 17th century. The world&amp;rsquo;s major powers clashed in controlled wars for the conquest of resources in distant colonies. Space was the new frontier, a savage land out of control of any one power. The race for the outer solar system was on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was only one problem: THEY were waiting for us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veil of Truth is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible product that brings the Space Opera into your table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    7 new races: celonian, en, karizar, nabora, niterian, thoy'ykoth and yahidar;&lt;br/&gt;    4 alternate classes: engineer, medtech, psion and seeker;&lt;br/&gt;    New uses for skills and several new feats;&lt;br/&gt;    Tons of high and ultratech equipment;&lt;br/&gt;    Everything you need to know to start your very own Veil of Truth Campaign;&lt;br/&gt;    And everything without needing to learn a whole new game system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product requires the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. For best enjoyment of this product we also suggest you own the Advanced Player's Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
