							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mystery of Malvern Manor</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party has shipwrecked in the frontier town of Breakwater Bay, an isolated fishing village on the Isle de Mont Deserette far from the mainland of the Kingdom of the Western Isles. Baron Pavel Pavelovitch holds Breakwater Bay and its surrounding territories by grant from the king, but in practice, his rule extends only as far as he can deploy his household guard. Although the party has made it safely to shore, their belongings sank along with their ship, leaving them with little more than their weapons, armor, and whatever gold was in their pockets at the time of the wreck. To make ends meet, the party has been working for Cassius Ironhide, clanleader of the Ironhide dwarves, collecting on debts and doing other unsavory business with which Cassius himself wishes no outward involvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the adventure opens, Cassius has dispatched the party to the shop of Xerxes Goldlighter, a local silversmith. Xerxes owes Cassius some 500 golds but has so far refused to pay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 4th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
