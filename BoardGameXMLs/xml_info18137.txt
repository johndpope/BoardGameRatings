			<description>SPOOF is the classic game of BLUFF but with forfeits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Everybody conceals a number of Spoofing disks in their hands and holds them out in a closed fist.  Then you have to guess the total number of disks held out by all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It sounds straight forward enough but the other players will, quite naturally, be intent on stitching you up.  Crafty bluffing and double guessing are the order of the day.  You'll need to be sly, cunning and fiendishly sneaky to stay ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make the wrong decision and you'll have to take a dreaded forfeit card and face the consequences!  You'll find yourself Sumo wrestling, eating dry biscuits off a plate on the floor without using you hands - or worse...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players hide between 0 and 3 disks within their hand and then take it in turns to try and guess the total number of disks held, taking it in turns to make the first call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player that guesses correctly is eliminated from the game and a new round starts.  Play continues like this until there is only one player remaining.  That player is the loser and spins the spinner on a penalty wheel to select a category of forfeit. The actual forfeit is determined from drawing from 5 different categories of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
