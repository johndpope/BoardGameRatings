			<description>From the Troll Lord Games website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Features&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Building 101&lt;br/&gt;By Robert Doyel&lt;br/&gt;An introduction to dungeon building as presented by the author of the recently released Engineering Dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Guest&lt;br/&gt;James Ward and Frank Mentzer&lt;br/&gt;Jim and Frank take a moment to remember Gary Gygax&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comics!&lt;br/&gt;Trolls at Work a comic by Jason Walton and Steve Chenault&lt;br/&gt;Snits from Tom Wham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regular Columns&lt;br/&gt;How it All Happened: Ghostly Happenings I&lt;br/&gt;by E. Gary Gygax&lt;br/&gt;Young Gygax has his first spiritual encounter of the ghostly kind when poltergeists haunt the attic above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alea iacta est or The Die is Cast: Remembering Gary Gygax&lt;br/&gt;by Stephen Chenault&lt;br/&gt;Steve remembers Gary Gygax, the origins of his first encounter and some thoughts on his parting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auld Wyrmish: Creating High Level Characters on the Fly&lt;br/&gt;by Mike Stewart&lt;br/&gt;This provides not only a system to create medium to high level characters for Castles &amp;amp; Crusades in a fast and simple manner, but also gives a quick system to give some background adventures to the character&amp;rsquo;s history as well. Yes, you rolled that your PC gets a +3 Longsword, but the system can also tell the player HOW the character got it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hammer &amp;amp; Anvil: Campaign Settings Part II&lt;br/&gt;by Casey Cannfield&lt;br/&gt;I take the concepts discussed in issue #7 and expand upon them, developing more details about the setting and fashioning elements to match my overall premise.  I describe how I incorporate all of the different concepts into one main campaign theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeper&amp;rsquo;s Notes: Running a Game&lt;br/&gt;by Davis Chenault&lt;br/&gt;Playing Monsters and NPCs is a little more involved than you might think. That precious critical hit characters love so much goes both ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Convention Blog: GenCon&lt;br/&gt;By Stephen Chenault&lt;br/&gt;Plunge into the maelstrom of the convention experience. Its as chaotic as memory serves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover Art by: Jason Walton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
