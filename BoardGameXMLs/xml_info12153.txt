			<description>A one-dimensional (played on a line) variation of Go that was first described by A.K. Dewdney in his book The_Planiverse. In 2001, Alan Baljeu modified the game into its present form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules (from Wikipedia):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Black and white take turns placing stones on the line. Unlike Go, this placement is compulsory if a move is available; if no move is possible, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;     No stone may be placed in a location occupied by another stone, or in a location where a stone of your own colour has just been removed. The latter condition keeps the game from entering a neverending loop of stone placement and capture, known in Go as ko.&lt;br/&gt;     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of enemy stones to no longer have any adjacent empty spaces--liberties, as in Go--then those stones are removed. As the above rule states, the opponent may not play in those locations on their following turn.&lt;br/&gt;     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of your own colour to no longer have any liberties, the stones are not suicided, but instead are safe and not removed from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until a player cannot place a stone on their turn. At this point, the number of stones on the board is counted; the winner is the one with the most stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Super Duper Games&lt;br/&gt;     Richard PBeM server&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
