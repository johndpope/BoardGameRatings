							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bamf: The Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>from the foreword:&lt;br/&gt;Bamf was originally created to provide a way for the role-player to play him or herself in a fantasy or science fiction adventure.  Since that time, the rules have been modified to allow the player to play not only him or herself, but to create a character and play that character much like many of the other role playing games available on the market.  One of the reasons was that the novelty of playing yourself in a role playing game might wear off after a few games.  Another reason was to give the Game Master (GM) a game mechanic by which he could create non-player characters for the players to interact with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally designed for use with play-by-email (PbEM) games.  An brief appendix at the back of the book offers suggestions and methods for running this type of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
