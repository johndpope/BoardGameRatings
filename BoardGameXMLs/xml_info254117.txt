							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Apothecary</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apothecaries excel in keeping everyone on their feet, and helping them bounce back when they get knocked down. You aren't solely a supporting class, however: by examining creatures (living or dead), you can learn how to really hit them where it hurts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you level up you can focus on improving your healing skills, patch people up or make medicine much more quickly, branch out into alchemy, learn how to brew deadly poisons and cultivate diseases, exploit weaknesses, bring people back from the brink of death, and even animate them as undead if you're too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains three files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a letter-sized character sheet that uses our new character sheet layout (so we could fit all of the advanced moves on the back).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized PDFs, one in color, the other in black and white to make it easier to print at home. They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The apothecary class (which includes 26 advanced moves)&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons, armor, poisons (including more elaborate rules and explanations for poisons), gear, and alchemical potions.&lt;br/&gt;    A Director's Cut with questions to ask yourself when rolling up a apothecary, explanations/clarifications for some of the moves, rules for handling diseases (plus some example diseases), and an optional rule for changing up how healing works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
