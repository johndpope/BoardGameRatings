			<description>Description of Party Time:&lt;br/&gt;Party Time is a drinking game that tests the creativity and courage of the players involved. Discs are distributed evenly among all players who then write a challenge on the dry-erase side. The unique, custom-made challenges are where the greatness of Party Time lies. Players should write something wacky, funny, weird, embarrassing, physically demanding or thought-provoking -- the more creative the challenges are, the more fun the game is. After all the discs have a challenge written on them, place them face down discs into cells of the box. Players then take turns bouncing the ping pong off the table and into the box. If you miss - you take a penalty drink, if you hit an empty cell - everybody drinks, but if you bounce the ball into a cell with a disc - that player pulls out the disc and must do whatever is written on the back of the disc. After you&amp;rsquo;ve completed your challenge, keep the disc and pass the ball to the next person. You get one bounce per turn, and the ball is passed clockwise around the table/group. Continue playing until all the discs have been drawn. The player with the most discs wins, but really, if there&amp;rsquo;s drinking and having fun with friends -- everybody wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples of challenges are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Truth or Dare&lt;br/&gt;    Kiss the person across from you&lt;br/&gt;    Take a mystery shot&lt;br/&gt;    Keep in physical contact with the person on your left for the rest of the game&lt;br/&gt;    Shotgun a beer with a friend&lt;br/&gt;    Exchange an article of clothing with the person on your right&lt;br/&gt;    Share your last five Google searches&lt;br/&gt;    Give out superlatives to all players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
