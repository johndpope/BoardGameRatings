			<description>This game is based around magnetism. The board consists of 80 chips, some of whom are magnetic. Players take turns trying to pick the chips up using a magnetic stick. Differently colored chips are worth a different amount of points, and the player with the most points when all chips have been picked up is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
