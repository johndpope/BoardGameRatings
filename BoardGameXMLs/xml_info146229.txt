							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Inside Track</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inside Track is written by an Aucklander, Ray Wilkinson, and dedicated to any one who wants to have his computer show its paces at parties or family or group gatherings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extremely clever machine coding makes each horse race as close to the unpredictable but, with hindsight, near inevitable results of live gee-gee action as it is possible to get. Race results are not random and not merely weighted to the pre-race selection hints but arranged such that if a certain race is re-run the place-getting horses may well be different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graphics are amusing and this is one of the very few programs I have ever seen arouse a gathering to cheering, and the kind of excitement that can be seen at real sporting events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
