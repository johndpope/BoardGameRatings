			<description>Color Checkers &amp;quot;Finally, a game more challenging than checkers but easier than chess&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two primary team colors - white and black. On one side, the crown side, the color is solid white or black. On the other side there are four different colors - blue, red, green, and yellow. There are four single colored, six bi-colored, and two quad-colored checkers for each team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 24 pieces are set up just as in regular Checkers. The object of the game is also the same: to eliminate your opponent's men by jumping over them. To do so, your checker must have the same color on it as the one you are jumping. When you reach the opposite side of the board, you turn your checker over to the solid side - black or white. Then, like regular checkers, you can move backwards or forwards. It can now jump or be jumped by any of your opponent's checkers. In case of a stalemate, the last player to move wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second way to play is more advanced. You simply jump over your own man in order to jump your opponent's man as long as all have a like color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
