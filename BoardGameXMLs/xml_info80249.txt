			<description>Aero Fighters 2 is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game released in 1994 by Video System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with two buttons, with the A button firing bullets from the plane and the B button launching a special bomb attack which uses a bomb from a limited stock of bombs. Power bullets can be obtained by destroying buildings and armored enemy planes. There are 2 types of Power bullets: &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; Power bullets, that increases the plane's firepower by one level, and &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; Power bullets, that increases the plane's firepower to the maximum level instantly. The maximum level only lasts for a limited amount of shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When certain ground enemies and buildings are destroyed, money bonuses appear which give a random amount of points each. When the player reaches the end of the stage, the player has to face a boss ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Aero Fighters 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
