			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age of Crisis:  This was a particularly bad time in the history of Europe. Climate change and weather disasters destroyed much of the farm land. The Black Plague began killing people in the millions. The economy took a huge plunge. The population of Europe was cut in half by all these disasters. During this time there are several wars, especially between the English and the French during the Hundred Years&amp;rsquo; War. The peasants eventually revolt but are put down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presents resources for several historic periods of play, including: Age of Crisis, Age of Discovery, Age of Enlightenment, and Age of Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
