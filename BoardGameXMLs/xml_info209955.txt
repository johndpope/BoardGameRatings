							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anduine: First City in the West</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and upon returning to the land of men, the Elders of the High Council made that fateful decision. Go West. West into the wilderness, where wretched Goblins roamed and the Warlock  held sway. West, into the blackness of Thil Asara. Their mission was clear. To set a beacon to quell the dark, a beacon that would grow in brightness and strength. A shining light to announce to all the world that they had returned. And that light came to be known as &amp;ldquo;Anduine - First City in the West.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Anduine - First City of the West, a cooperative fantasy board game for 1-5 players, each player will take a role as a member of the Elvish Elder council: Galadhon Master Builder, Nienna the Ranger, General Istaras, Mardiel the Sorceress and Mithrond, Lord of the Elves.&lt;br/&gt;Together they will build a new city, master challenging Events and defend their fledgling home from vicious Goblin Raids. &lt;br/&gt;All while the Warlock lies in wait, plotting to defeat the Elves and destroy the city of Anduine, once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Negotiation and strategy are paramount, as players will come together to decide how best to use the resources of the Elves to develop and defend their city. Players will research new magic, master new abilities and command the Elves of Anduine to construct a city worthy of legend. &lt;br/&gt;With teamwork, planning and a little luck, the Council of Elders and the Elves of Anduine, will successfully defeat the menacing Warlock and his hordes once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
