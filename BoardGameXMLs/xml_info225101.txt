							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Gok</name>
									
			<description>Gok&amp;rsquo;s fate was sealed before he was even conceived. His harsh upbringing combined with his inability to learn, left him as a ideal recruit for the Cult of Yurei, that and the fact that he is quite formidable. His mutating mass, and he has a lot of it, allows Gok to adapt to best any opponent. The disease ridden, body filled cart he insists on hauling also serves as a grotesque distraction in battle for his opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
