							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cédric Sacrée journée</name>
									
			<description>Cedric like to be photographed with Chen, his girlfriend. But Chen agreed only if he pass a perfect day to be a good boy. He must collect points to charm the girl and then run to the place where she waits to be photographed with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a journey through the day of Cedric on the gameboard. Beginning with the square &amp;quot;Start of the day&amp;quot; and ending with the square &amp;quot;end of the day&amp;quot; where players is able to pose with Chen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player rolls the color die and move his game-piece &lt;br/&gt;to next square with rolled color. Then he may pass a test to roll a number dice and get a result greater or equal than the number on the box. If the test is successful he adds the points he has just won the score noted on their file and writes it on the notes (with erasable marker).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 3 event cards he may use in his turn to help provide bonuses to its dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who reaches the finish square and pose with Chen is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
