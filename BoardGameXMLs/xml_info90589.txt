							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Invasion of the Gaeo System</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        In the Year of the Oak, at the height of winter, they came. Without warning or reason they fell upon the defenceless Fey, killing mercilessly.&lt;br/&gt;        Many races sent aid to the gentle Fairy-Folk, but were sent only to their death. The invaders brought might and fury unseen in our system, with relentless slaughter of all who apposed.&lt;br/&gt;        They were the Daemons of legend whose coming was foretold by Gaeokerena himself at the dawn of our birth. There were lesser races that warned us of their power, none more so than the Reptilians, but in our pride we did not listen. We had become complacent in our eternal lives and were unprepared for their invasion. Many of our kind fell in the fire and destruction they left in their wake.&lt;br/&gt;        Within a month the Fey had been scattered, forced to hide away in the darkest regions of their own land and for the first time in over ten thousand years we ourselves were forced into retreat to reconsider our strategy. The enemy had no fear, no care for their losses, and were resilient to our greatest magic.&lt;br/&gt;        With their first victory the Daemons turned their vile intentions to Lupa, the realm of the Canis. Here the &amp;lsquo;Moon Worshippers&amp;rsquo; fought valiantly for two years, never giving quarter to their enemy. Many perished on both sides and yet the Daemons continued their onslaught. Then, without cause, they stopped, returning to their new homeland.&lt;br/&gt;        We know now that we have those outside our world to thank, for they closed the doorway to Gaeo, prevented the arrival of more daemon-kin. However, the daemons are not without leadership and have sought aid from others in their conquest.&lt;br/&gt;        The Daemons have now allied themselves with our everlasting enemies, the Druge, and together they have brought a new struggle to our world.&lt;br/&gt;        It is not only a war of arms, but also of subterfuge and fragile alliances. It is a war of survival. We must not fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engeran of the Wild&lt;br/&gt;Ancient One of the Gaeo-Ran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speech to Gaeo-Ran Protectors prior to the Battle of Messran Forest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
