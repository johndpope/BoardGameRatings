							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chapter 7: Highfolk</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the adventuring party takes to its canoes and paddles the Velverdyva River, a signpost directs them down a tributary to the Free Town of Highfolk where they can resupply their outfit. As they paddle down the side river, in the distance, they see rising mysteriously above the town&amp;rsquo;s center is a black stone tower. The construction of the tower does not fit the surrounding buildings which are all made of wood, and when the player characters approach the dock, the robed figure that watches them and then turns away, adds even more mystery to this town. What is the purpose of the strange black tower and who is the mystifying figure in robes? Find out in Chapter 7 of the Great Flanaess River Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
