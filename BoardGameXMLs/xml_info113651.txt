			<description>KenTron or the bees chess. This game opposes two swarms of bees that fight for a 91-hexagon beehive. The player's pieces and their movements are: a queen (one hex in any direction), drones (jump over adjacent hexes), adult workers (any number of hexes in any direction, no jumps allowed), young workers (one hex forward). If a young worker reaches one of the 5 &lt;br/&gt;opponent&amp;rsquo;s pollen hexes she is promoted to an adult worker. If a bee finds an opponent&amp;rsquo;s bee in one of the hexes where she could arrive, she can kill her. When a queen is threatened by an opponent&amp;rsquo;s bee and she cannot escape to a safe hex nor she cannot protect herself with another bee, the player loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our word &amp;quot;centre&amp;quot; is a word that we have inherited from Ancient Greek. The greeks called kentron the centre of a circumference, because kentron was the compass needle. But the primitive meaning of kentron was the insect sting. Kentron also meant &amp;quot;the spike of the spear&amp;quot;, and this is the name that this chess-like game recieves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
