			<description>The player controls one of five characters with the quest to save the kingdom of Tempest. Each character has his or her own specialty (meaning different agility, strength, stamina, etc.). The story also changes depending on the character and each has a different ending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Anvil of Dawn&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released 1995 for MS-DOS and was one of the last of the classical DOS RPGs with blockstep movements and semi-3D environment. The game presents a real-time, three dimensional view from the character's perspective. It was released on CD and features fully spoken dialogue and several pre-rendered cutscenes. The player controls only one character throughout the game, which is chosen at the beginning from 5 different heroes. The other characters can then be met in the game also trying to fulfill the quest. The game is mostly action oriented but also contains some puzzles. There are no experience points as the character gets better through using his abilities and spells. It also features several different endings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
