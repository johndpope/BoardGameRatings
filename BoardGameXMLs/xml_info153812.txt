							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Across the Dead Earth</name>
									
			<description>Across the Dead Earth is a forthcoming Post-Apocalyptic skirmish wargame from Dead Earth Games. Three generations on from The Last War, pockets of humanity roam the ghost towns and ruins of humanity, looting and fighting for profit, glory, dominance and their very lives Across the Dead Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assemble your Gang of deadly warriors and embark on campaigns to win loot, territory or simply glory, as you upgrade your Gang and their equipment from game to game, building a persistent and truly personalised Gang, honed to your style of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is fought with 28mm miniatures representing the players Gangs. Each turn, the players act with one Gang member at a time, then the other player acts with one Gang member and so on. Each character can make two actions per turn, except leaders who have three. These actions include moving, shooting, entering into melee, hiding, or Waiting and Watching, which allows the character to act out of turn sequence if an enemy moves within their line of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaigns are made up of three basic game types: Loot, in which the object is to find and lay claim to Loot (with which to upgrade characters and weapons in between games), Territory games, in which the Gangs fight over specific Objectives, and Grudge matches, in which the sole aim is the elimination of the other team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear, skills and injuries are persistent throughout campaigns, which are Won by controlling a number of territories on a map, each representing an area in which a battle is fought for control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
