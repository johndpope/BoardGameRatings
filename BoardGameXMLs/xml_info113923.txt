			<description>Lunch Box is a  patent pending, educator recommended children's health and fitness board game that has been in development since 2007!  Lunch Box reaches out to our children through a fun and educational board game, bringing health and fitness back to the forefront of their daily lives. It teaches through the best way children learn&amp;hellip;playing a game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lunch Box is for ages 6+.  Players 2-8.   Average game time is 30-45 minutes to earn 5 Healthy Golden Lunch Tickets!  Or choose to only play for 2 Healthy Golden Lunch Tickets for a 15-20 minute game play!  For a school environment you can have up to 12 players per game board (3 players per house).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game:&lt;br/&gt;Move around the board with your lunch box pawn.  Answer Pop Quiz questions from Cafeteria, Science Lab, Library, and Cool Facts.  Answer correctly and earn a Healthy Golden Lunch Ticket!  Get 5 Healthy Golden Lunch Tickets and be the first player to make it back to your Front Yard Space to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t get caught sleeping in class from a sugar crash or you go to the Principal&amp;rsquo;s Office and lose your Healthy Golden Lunch Tickets. Be careful not to land on Couch Potato, as you must roll a lemon/s or jog in place to get out!  You can try your luck pulling a Snack Card but if it is an unhealthy snack then you go to the Nurse and must roll apple/s or stand up and touch your toes to get out!  Maybe you will land on P.E. where you will earn a FREE Healthy Golden Lunch Ticket for all your efforts and improve strength, flexibility, and confidence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for spaces like &amp;ldquo;Roofus ate your homework&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Late for school&amp;rdquo; as you will lose your turn!  Hopefully you will make the honor roll and earn a FREE Hall Pass, which will get you out of losing your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With so much fun and action you will almost laugh yourself silly when your opponent lands on your Front Yard Space and must stand up to do your yard&amp;rsquo;s Exercise Challenge; Frog Jumps, Push Ups, Jumping Jacks, or Abdominal Crunches!  This game is so much FUN you will not even realize that you just learned what a &amp;quot;Whole Food&amp;quot; is and which foods are the best choices for you to live a Healthy Lunch Box Lifestyle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
