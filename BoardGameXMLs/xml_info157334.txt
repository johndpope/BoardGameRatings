							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amor und die Herzen</name>
									
			<description>The goal of the game is to shoot the heart of the opponent with Amor's arrow. The game pieces are the heart, Amor, the devil, 3 male guardian hearts, 7 female guardian hearts and 2 impetuous hearts. They are used to protect the player's heart and impede the opponent's Amor. To do this, the pieces can move in specific ways (like in Chess) and can block or eliminate one another. The devil is the only piece, that can eliminate Amor. When Amor gets in a straight line with another's heart, he can shoot it and wins the game. The game can be played by 2 or 4 players. In the game for 4 players, the players at the opposite sides of the game board play against one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game was most likely published in the 1920s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
