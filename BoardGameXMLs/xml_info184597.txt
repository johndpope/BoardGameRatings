			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an android app of the classic Swahili game Bao.  Despite information to the contrary, there are several versions of that game, depending either upon the traditions from the mainland of Tanganyika or the island of Zanzibar.   This mobile game follows the more complex Zanzibari version, which is probably the most complicated game in the entire Mancala family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules included with this app, although difficult to read with brown on brown lettering and even more difficult to follow and make sense of.  Although not listed in the languages these can be accessed in Swahili.  If you do not know the rules to this game  -- and who doesnt need a refresher? -- there are better rules summaries online, but be assured that the game will not let you make illegal moves.  All in all, its graphics are crisp, the music more exotic sounding than The House of Wonders,  and the AI perfectly fine for basic play.  At the moment the single player version versus the AI is free while the two player version (local or online) requires a fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
