			<description>Mix between Trivia game and Top Trumps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 32 trump cards are mixed. Each player receives 16 cards in front of them.

The higher value wins. The losing player ask the question from the card. Winner of the duel can answer the question and wins if he answer correctly. Otherwise he loses to opponent.&lt;br/&gt;Some cards are with word &amp;quot;target goal&amp;quot;, then the duel winner may shoot the goal.&lt;br/&gt;After 16 duels the player who now has fewer cards takes &amp;quot;the end of the game&amp;quot; card and puts it behind his stack of cards. &lt;br/&gt;Duels continues until this card.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who has more trump cards in his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
