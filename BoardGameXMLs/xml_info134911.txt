							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road Safety Game With New Road Signs</name>
									
			<description>The Road Signs in Britain were changed in 1949 as a first step to achieving a common design throughout Europe. This game was educational in that it taught old and young more information about the signs' meanings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board is two intertwined tracks. Players start at the beginning of either track and roll dice to advance their playing piece. The spaces are mainly new road signs and they have an effect if you land on them. Each player is given a player reference card so that they can read the instructions for themselves.There are also diversions and instructions when to draw an Accident Card (which also must be obeyed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get to the end of their track, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
