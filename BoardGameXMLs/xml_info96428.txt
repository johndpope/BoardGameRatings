			<description>In Play the Sign, players compete in teams or individually to be the first to rid their hand of cards. Each player starts with a randomly dealt hand of value cards and sign cards. On a turn, a player either discards a value or sign card that matches the card currently face-up on the pile or discards a number of cards for which the arithmetic calculation corresponds to the value of the face-up card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the Sign can be played in single games or as a points tournament, with the player who collects the fewest points after the designated number of rounds winning the tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
