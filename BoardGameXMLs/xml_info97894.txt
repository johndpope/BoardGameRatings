			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Are the Fema Su&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They look like anyone you want them to look like... a perfect companion, a perfect lover, and a perfect imposter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their race is facing a horrible dead-end in their evolution, and the only cure that exists is to interbreed with humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have been here for thousands of years; studying us, seducing us, taking on our forms, worming their way into our society, and breeding with us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it comes right down to it, humanity isn't really getting a bad deal...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...unless you count the endless complications and turmoil that a relationship with your perfect alien love-partner can bring. Surviving the mating is one thing - but when your perfect alien lover shows up on your doorstep because they're being chased by men in black suits, the &amp;quot;morning after&amp;quot; can be a real killer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces the Fema Su race into the world of Earth in 2015, complete with statistics for several Fema Su, their agents, and their monstrous living starships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one-night-stand will ever be the same again...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for HOT CHICKS: The Roleplaying Game. You will need the core rulebook in order to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second of our &amp;quot;Alien Files&amp;quot; books, in which we detail one of the many alien races that threatens the state of Humanity in the year 2015. In this edition, we highlight the sensuous and dangerous Fema Su, and their heroic attempt to head off the evolutionary dead-end of their race, using human genes to shape their future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are descriptions of the various classes of Fema-Su operative, their equipment, networks, and ships. Stats for various Fema Su operatives are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, we finish up with a a bucket of adventure seeds based around the Fema Su and their works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty Pages, lavishly illustrated.  Because if you're going to have hot aliens, you need pictures of hot aliens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
