			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;BrightSword is DGS Games&amp;rsquo; fantasy roleplaying game system set in our world of Faelon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;BrightSword is a set of fantasy roleplaying rules set in the world of Faelon&amp;mdash;a world of great beauty and great danger, of politics and religion, intrigue and honor, people and power, magic and mystery.&lt;br/&gt;More than a dozen factions strive for domination and survival across Faelon&amp;lsquo;s two known continents. Strange creatures move along the fault lines of civilization&amp;mdash;some from a past that never passed out of reckoning, some from portals between Faelon and Mervael, the Spirit World, and some from Faelon&amp;lsquo;s heavens and hells. The gods have sundered Faelon&amp;lsquo;s magic in twain&amp;mdash;Casters are divided between spells that influence the inorganic and inanimate and those that influence creatures both living and recently alive. Only an immortal may learn the secrets of both, leading some to seek immortality through pacts with abominations.&lt;br/&gt;Above all, Faelon is the story of its people&amp;mdash;resonant characters who seek power and peril each in their own way against a backdrop that is as full of life as it as it is fraught with menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
