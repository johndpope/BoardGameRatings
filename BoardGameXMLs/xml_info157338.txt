			<description>from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for Gun-Fu: Balletic Ballistics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the foreword:&lt;br/&gt;With A Bullet is a Gun-Fu adventure for 5th-level heroes. You'll need the Gun-Fu: Balletic Ballistics game in order to make perfect sense of everything in here &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure features six primary encounters, several of which can occur in any order (or not at all). &amp;hellip;  the adventure is flexible enough to accommodate multiple scenarios. &amp;hellip; This is not a location-based adventure, so you won't find detailed maps or keyed descriptions. A Gun-Fu game is more concerned with drama and vast amounts of ordinance, anyway, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Boss Tanaka is not a man who minces his words. His deal is offered in simple, direct terms. &amp;quot;My man in Lombok is Tony Ashgar. Once you're through customs, get a cab to his bar, the Highlight. All the airport cabbies know it. Tony'll pay you there.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
