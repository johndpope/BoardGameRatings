			<description>Zwikken is a Dutch betting game played with a twenty-card deck of traditional playing cards: AKQJT in four suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ante, deal three cards each, and turn the top card for the trump suit. The player to the left of the dealer opens bidding. The high bidder leads any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are played according to these rules of precedent:&lt;br/&gt;1. Play any card of the suit led.&lt;br/&gt;2. Beat all trumps in play.&lt;br/&gt;3. Play any trump.&lt;br/&gt;4. Play any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highest trump wins the trick. Otherwise it goes to the highest card of the suit led. The winner leads the next trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from a couple rules complications, the high bidder either (A) wins the pot by collecting two of three tricks or (B) loses and doubles the pot for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
