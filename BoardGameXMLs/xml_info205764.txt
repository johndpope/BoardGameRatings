			<description>Besides armored vehicles and planes, [several] countries started to use experimental drugs that gave supernatural abilities to their soldiers. This great power provoked accelerated deterioration that caused users of the drugs to wither away at incredibly accelerated rates. To compensate for this undesired effect, these &amp;quot;lab rats&amp;quot; were young men and women in their prime but without beloved relatives who would miss them and who had their whole lives ready to be sacrificed in the name of the faction that were using them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playable characters (PCs) are a group of young soldiers exposed to these experimental serums and their effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
