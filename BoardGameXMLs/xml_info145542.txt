							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Krosmaster: Arena – Goultard the Barbarian Exclusive Figure</name>
									
			<description>Goultard the Barbarian is a promotional figure for Krosmaster: Arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iops are known for being courageous knights. They will fly into the thick of battle to save their allies without hesitation and perform feats that would break even the most experienced fighters. Goultard is considered one of the strongest Iops in history. In a twist of fate, he was possessed by an extremely powerful demon, resulting him becoming an avatar of chaos and destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like his normal form, Goultard the Barbarian is a close range fighter who uses his health to fuel his devastating attacks. As he continues to attack with no regard for his health, he gains additional range on his attacks. And thanks to his godlike strength, he can execute clusters of low power enemies with little effort, allowing him to quickly level teams that chooses to fight with numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
