			<description>Swedish game about running a lokal athlete club, where you as a manager will have to deal with player salaries, national review boards, tax administration, sponsorships etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has borrowed a lot of mechanics from Monopoly, but instead of streets the board consists of a number of local business, local to different areas i Sweden. The game exists in a number of variants, similar as a game but with different local business on the board. The players make deals with the business (instead of buying the street) and build arinas and VIP-booths (instead of houses and hotels). There are random events on cards and you walk around the board using 2 dices. There are also charade cards (!) where you are awarded money if you manage to get the co-players to understand the charad. The one who has the larges fortune after a set time is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
