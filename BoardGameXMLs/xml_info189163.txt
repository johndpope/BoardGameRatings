			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1527; Stage One: Sean Smith; Stage Two: Dan Maruschak; Stage Three: Jason Dettman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about people with a fondness for the little-known and obscure, who present themselves with ostentatious affectations in their manner of speech and dress, and are sometimes seen with eye-catching facial hair: Wizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a fundamental truth about magic: it doesn't work for everybody. In fact, if it worked for everybody it wouldn't be magic, it would just be normal. Here's another fundamental truth: wizardly magic is based on knowledge. You have to know things about spiritual power, the deep structure of the universe, the connections among things, and the imposition of will upon reality. Naturally, in concordance with the first fundamental truth, this knowledge wouldn't be magical if everybody knew it.  As such, wizards prize esoteric knowledge that sets them apart from the rest of society. Of course, some people merely pretend to have knowledge instead of actually possessing it. What separates a real wizard from a charlatan is that they know real stuff, they're not just making it up. As such, it's important to most wizards that they let you know what they know, so you can tell they're a real wizard who knows stuff that's worth knowing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of you is playing a wizard who has chosen to spend the evening in pub that's well-known (among those who are in-the-know) for its exquisitely authentic local flavor. As often happens when wizards gather, however, your evening is beset by problems. But there are two sides to every coin, because for every problem is also an opportunity for you to explain how best to solve it. And, as luck would have it, there are several other wizards in the pub: exactly the sort of people who can fully appreciate your expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
