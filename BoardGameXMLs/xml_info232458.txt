							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stable Boy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stable Boy is meant to be a very unique character. He seems mean, or perhaps &amp;ldquo;snarky&amp;rdquo; at first. But as your players will come to see, he is merely blunt and plain spoken. Your players are meant to dislike him at first, but they should come to see him as a kind of &amp;ldquo;king&amp;rsquo;s fool,&amp;rdquo; simple but wise beyond his years.  Everyone around the players either likes Stable Boy, or at least has a deep respect for him. Evil NPCs may hate him, but it&amp;rsquo;s for sincere reasons, not simple disdain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stable Boy is meant to act as an example, an external moral compass for the group.  He doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the words for it, but he has honor, integrity, and a strong sense of right and wrong.  He has a code (which may differ slightly from version to version), and he refuses to betray that code.  He always treats friends fairly, and sticks up for them even when they&amp;rsquo;re being idiots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
