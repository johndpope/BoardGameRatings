			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to your nightmares&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the terrors and creatures from the land of Outcastia and surrounding areas, from the revered adamantite dragons to the unusual wailing parchment, from the mighty meteor golem to the hideous digger ghoul, from the reclusive sponagledragon to the grotesque hill behemoth. You will find creatures to challenge, assist, and confound almost any adventuring party. With challenge ratings that range from 1/16 to 43, nearly every player and Campaign Manager alike can be appeased. Also included are the descriptions of all player character races allowed in the Outcastia campaign world (though individual CMs may allow even stranger PC races). Find inside a new template for half-breeds of any two races. Want to play a half-dwarf, half-elf? Voila: the Ulf. Want to play a half-minotaur, half-merfolk? The template tells you how to make your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added feature the descriptions also give the geographic (or game centric) location of each creature. Not sure if the monster fits into the game world or area of the OCS you want to place it? No problem, it&amp;rsquo;s all in the description to make it easier. Of course, this is optional but we hope it helps those that want to keep their world &amp;ldquo;canon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 100 monstrosities, this manual is essential for any CM who wants to throw some danger at their group. Most of these entries are newly created monsters, just for this book. Spice up your game with great adversaries to combat or even new player character races. Just be warned, once you peruse the contents of this book you may not be able to stuff the denizens back into their proper place&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
