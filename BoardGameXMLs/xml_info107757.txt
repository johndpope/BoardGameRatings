			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a conflict engine. In roleplaying games, all the numbers on sheets, dice rolls, and rules governing such stuff, all come down to making a system out of conflicts &amp;ndash; all kinds of conflicts. If someone isn't struggling in some way, to do something, there's no reason to involve rules at all; just describe it, play it out, carry on. So, this is a way of resolving those conflicts for fictional characters, and of describing characters so that this conflict system can be used for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system exists purely to put power behind the ideas and the narration of your playing group; it won't &amp;quot;carry&amp;quot; your group the way a game with more rules can, but it will let you put the focus of your game where you want, and can run pretty much any setting with under an hour of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
