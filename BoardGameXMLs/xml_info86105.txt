							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Anthology: Volume 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What new foes await your characters? Are they fiends from the Lower Planes, or strange new races infiltrating the world your players once knew? Within you'll find creatures that will fit into nearly any fantasy campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From our best selling supplement, Fringe Campaigns: Soul Harvest, to our early products Tremon: Kingdom of Sorcery and Fringe Races: Rogues, we've collected all of our creatures, critters, and races and bound them into one complete supplement. Inside you'll find thirty-four of our monsters -- 8 of which also include Monsterous NPCs, ready to use! Plus you'll find multiple Templets to convert end more creatures over to the Khan's Press way of gaming. All of the creatures have been updated to the 3.5 d20 edition, and many have undergone changes giving them a brand new look. GameMasters will find something for any level adventure, with CR's ranging from 1 to 50!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khan's Press didn't forget about the Players either. Of the 34 monsters, 9 include stats to be played as characters (including Level Adjustments). And you don't need to purchase any of Khan's Press's other releases in order to use the Anthology. All necessary rules are reprinted in the appendix (which means you also get 12 Khan's Press feats and 7 Khan's Press spells)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
