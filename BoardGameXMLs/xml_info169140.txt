							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heaven and Hell Toroidal Checkers</name>
									
			<description>This is a checkers variant using an 8x8 board that is viewed as a torus: column A is adjacent to column H and row 1 is adjacent to row 8. Thus, for example, a piece on 1.a3 can move to h4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL: to be the only player with pieces on the dark squares (called &amp;quot;heaven,&amp;quot; light squares are called &amp;quot;hell.&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SET UP: starting position is for a standard game, 12 pieces per side, moving one space forward diagonally, obligatory captures. Kings are made whenever a friendly piece is landed on, and move forward or backward per the norm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOING TO HELL (or back to Heaven): when an enemy piece is jumped over, it is moved to the left (of the jumping player) to the nearest empty or friendly occupied  square in the same row. If landing on a friendly piece it becomes a king. If there are no such spaces left in a row the jumped piece is removed from the game. Movement rules on light squares are the same for dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
