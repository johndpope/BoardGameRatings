			<description>Welcome to Kingdoms. The game where you must build your evil empire before other demon lords can build theirs.&lt;br/&gt;Kingdoms is a very social game that encourages interaction between players and is best suited for 4 players although 2 players can still have a lot of fun. If you like building up your strength while causing you opponents a lot of trouble then this is the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 1000 gold, 1000 resources and a blueprint of their kingdom which shows the buildings they need to construct in order to win the game. To construct buildings you need money, resources and minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of play are simple. Each turn a player draws a card and performs an action such as constructing a building, buying resources from the bank, or sending a cat with fleas into a rival kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you are faced with the choice of building up your kingdom or ruining someone else's. Be wary of players forming secret alliances.&lt;br/&gt; However its not all about being mean to each other, the card pool contains a lot of nasty surpises too. Watch out for Demonic health Inspectors, drunken Aunties and your new &amp;lsquo;uncles&amp;rsquo; dropping by, and various unpleasant diseases coming your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then there are your Minions. Everybody needs minions, it&amp;rsquo;s just a pity they are an unpredictable and fickle lot. Minions construct your buildings for you and generally moan a lot of the time. &amp;lsquo;We are bored!&amp;rsquo; they cry so you build them a den of iniquity. They are still not happy. &amp;lsquo;We are lonely!&amp;rsquo; so you build them a House of ill repute. They are never satisfied. Good job you can smite a few now and again to keep them in line&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mess with you opponents plans. Tempt their minions to your kingdom or infect them with a plague or even send in a serial killer to thin the herd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
