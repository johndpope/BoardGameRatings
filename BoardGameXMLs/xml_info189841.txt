							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Poker</name>
									
			<description>In Castle Poker players use one standard deck of cards with 6 special cards added.  Players also have a castle card each with 3 vacant spots on the bottom, where cubes are placed, to represent their progress building their castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 cards are dealt to each player.  Then in order,from the left of the dealer, players may discard to The Moat, as many as three from their hand.  When all the players have discarded, hands are refilled to 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then in order from the left of the dealer players may make one bid of stones (cubes) from their supply.  When each player has made ONE bid, all hands are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the lowest poker hand looses their bid back to The Quarry.  All other player get an extra stone from the Quarry to their supply.  They also keep the stones they bid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest poker hand may place half the stones (rounded down) they bid onto their castle if they also bid the most stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special cards include a messenger, a trebuchet and barrels of supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
