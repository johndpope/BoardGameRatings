			<description>Tell me a story. &lt;br/&gt;Not the usual made up kind, but one from real life - your own real life!&lt;br/&gt;We are all full of stories, and Snapstories brings them out into the open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you have to do is draw a card, and get inspired by the text ... it could be &amp;quot;That scared me&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I felt loved&amp;quot; or any of 98 other cards. Turn the sand timer, and start you story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It doesn't have to be a great story or a long one, just tell it like you remember it. After 3 minutes at the most, you are done, and the next player is up.&lt;br/&gt;Did you get stuck? No panic, we have cards to help you out, so just draw one of those.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do the other players do during your story? &lt;br/&gt;They Listen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to add anything to a story, or hear more about it, you will have to play one your tokens - and you only have two for the whole game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snapstories brings people together across generations, across cultures and across the table. The game can engage anyone, anywhere, because the subject is life - your life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
