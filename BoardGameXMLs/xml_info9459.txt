			<description>Standard Uno-themed card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: The 'Fetch' card. When this card is played, everyone has to scramble to get hold of it first. If you get it, keep it! Everyone else must draw cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2006 Version replaces the 'Fetch' Card with the 'Roll Over' Card. When this card is played the player who plays it chooses a player to reveal his hand to all. That player must play his hand exposed until his turn. The 'Roll Over' Card is also a wild card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
