			<description>Fate of Heroes is a fast-paced action fantasy card-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the game in a series of battles/fights.&lt;br/&gt;Place your Fighter, add Fate and Gear cards to boost the Action Values and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When only one Player has Fighter(s) left, that Player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate of Heroes is built on the Xemytica Rule System - a quick and minimalistic card game system that focuses on action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true beauty of the Xemytica system is that it is NOT turn-based. Instead, each card is played simultanously by all players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game is sold in packs of 54 cards. Starter Packs include 3 Rule Cards, 17 Fighters, 17 Fate cards and 17 Gear cards. This is enough for 2 players. Add more decks for more players. Add-on packs (with 54 cards totally) are released during 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
