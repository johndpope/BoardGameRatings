			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the shining cities of the coast; between the villages and castles of the land; between the mines of the dwarves and the lairs of the trolls - there is Wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far from civilisation, adventurers discover locations that bring adventure, treasure...or death. Wilderness Locations is a set of four locations that are ideal for Wilderness adventures.&lt;br/&gt; Wilderness Locations is a printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. It can be used as a standalone gameboard, or combined with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilderness is a geomorphic set, comprising 4 10x10 square battlemaps which can be arranged in multiple layouts. Each tile can be used on its own, or can be matched with tiles from the Wilderness, Highway, River, Forest (and more!) geomorphic sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilderness Locations includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Ruined Tower - the lower floor and walls of a long abandoned tower&lt;br/&gt;     The Bandit Camp - bedrolls, loot, a campfire. What else does a bandit need?&lt;br/&gt;     The Stone Circle - Ancient standing stones, the site of countless rituals&lt;br/&gt;     The Tumulus - The burial mound of a long dead king. Includes map of the grave inside the Tumulus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a set of 300dpi full size jpgs, for poster printing or VTT, in both gridded and non-gridded versions. (n.b. gridless version only available as full jpeg).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
