							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FUBAR: Assault on Penzar Island</name>
									
			<description>Three years in the making, FUBAR: Assault on Penzar Island is an amalgamation of strategy game fused with contemporary popular cultural myths and a whole lot of chaos thrown into the mix.  Up to six different factions face off to control the last remaining land mass on Earth in the very distant (or not so distant) future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario and subsequent conflict begins with an alien abduction through the fabric of time and space which is unexpectedly thwarted by a glitch, landing the warring factions on a remote island in the middle of nowhere.  The factions begin in their respective base hub on the outskirts of the island.  Quickly, they must build their ranks and establish their perimeters to begin the conquest of their adversaries. Their goal is to acquire the Mojos of their opponents and secure more territories on the island.  Factions not only have their own set of specific cards to aid them in their conquest, they also have a random faction force that enables them to have a unique edge over their foes.   To complicate matters and add an element familiar to any survivalist, there is a good chance that chaos will enter the fray.  From radiation leaks, mad cow outbreaks, and teleportation malfunctions to volcano eruptions or the periodic tsunami, the unpredictable chaos events (a dreaded favorite) will force players to adjust their strategies as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The victory goes to the first player that successfully absconds with an enemy&amp;rsquo;s Mojo and safely returns it to their own hub&amp;hellip;. but the game could go on as there are chaos events that could shift the game objective at any time.  In addition, there are 4 other game variations with different objectives that players can choose from to make for a variety of gaming experiences with the same set.  There is a planned expansion/variation called Covert Ops being developed as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
