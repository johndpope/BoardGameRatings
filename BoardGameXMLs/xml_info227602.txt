			<description>Thirty-six cards, displaying various creatures from all across the world are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are divided into six different sets containing six animals from each of the set&amp;rsquo;s locations.  &lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect as many complete sets as possible (called books), and have the most points. &lt;br/&gt;Two of the sets (US East and US West) are worth two points.  &lt;br/&gt;The other four sets (Europe, Asia, Africa, and Polar Regions) are worth one point.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
