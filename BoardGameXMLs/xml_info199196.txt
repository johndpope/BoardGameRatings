			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cohorts &amp;amp; Companions &amp;ndash; Shobolan Mussman provides twenty stat blocks (CR 1/2 thru 19) for a male ratfolk rogue utilizing the eldritch scoundrel archetype (included here along with a progression table).  He mixes stealth and trapfinding, ranged combat skills, and arcane spellcasting in a support role.  His capabilities focus on enhancing others, setting up sneak attacks, and bypassing obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game compatible and gives you twenty ready-to-play stat blocks for a stalwart companion at all levels, 1 thru 20!  Use these stat blocks to add companions or assistants to the party when players are absent, extra muscle is needed, or mercenaries are hired.  This also gives the GM the ability to have potential cohorts on hand built at any level needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find the character&amp;rsquo;s history and other story elements not to your liking, you still have twenty NPC stat blocks you can use as standalone characters of your own naming and developing or as minions and other rabble.  Increase your available NPC stat blocks at every character level (Challenge Rating 1/2 thru 19).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
