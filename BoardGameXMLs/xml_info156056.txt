			<description>Traumatosaures takes place in the neurological ward of the Coeurs Bris&amp;eacute;s (Heartbreak) Hospital. The patients on the ward are dreaming of the traumatosaures, creatures from another dimension, who appear in the hospital and try to absorb the patients so they can return home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in hourly turns over the course of one night. One player takes the role of the nursing staff, who move around getting treatments (pills, injections, and electroshock devices), administering treatments, waking up sleeping patients, and moving patients from room to room. However, they do not have free choice when moving the nurses; for each one a die is rolled, giving two possible rooms they can go to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The traumatosaure player moves the traumatosaures that have appeared in the hospital (because the matching patients fell asleep) and moves them, also using die rolls, which now determine how far to move (half speed if the patient is now awake). The traumatosaure player also has a certain number of &amp;quot;AARRGGHH&amp;quot; tokens which can be used on patients to make it harder to help them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced game adds fixed events which take place each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
