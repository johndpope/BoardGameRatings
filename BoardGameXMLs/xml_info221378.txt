			<description>The Fourth Edition of Magic: The Gathering was the tenth set released for the game, and the fourth base set (or &amp;quot;core set&amp;quot;). It contained 378 cards and was the first set to reprint cards from the expansions Legends and The Dark with white borders. Fourth Edition cards have white borders. The set has no expansion symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourth Edition was also the first Magic set to be printed in Asian languages, including Japanese, Chinese, Korean, as well as Portuguese, which was printed primarily for the Brazilian market. The Japanese edition was particularly successful and contributed to the burgeoning of Magic's popularity in Japan. Korean and Chinese Fourth Edition cards have been made only with black borders while Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish cards exist with white and black borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Magic the Gathering 4th Edition Starter Deck contains 60 cards and rulebook. The distribution is 3 rare, 9 uncommon, 26 common, and  22 land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
