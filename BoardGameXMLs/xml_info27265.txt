			<description>THE dumbed-down version of Silent Death for the next generation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawk eyed his instruments as his squadron sped towards the marauders. &amp;quot;Get your Talon back into formation, Parker.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I saw something in the asteroid field, going to confirm.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Negative, Parker, back in line.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; Almost there . . .&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Across the void Hawk saw the flare of thrusters ignite as his board lit up. The bogie was a Nighthawk.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; Abort Parker! Abort!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The massive guns of the Nighthawk flashed across the asteroid field like a small sun and Parker's ship vanished in silent fury. Some rookies never live to learn.&lt;br/&gt;Silent Death is an exciting, quick-playing, and&lt;br/&gt;easy-to-learn star fighter combat game.
