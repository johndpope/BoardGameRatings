			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trauma Control is a game about being pushed past your breaking point and attempting to pull the pieces together. Something horrible has happened to the protagonist, and together players will tell a story that reassembles the character's history. As they explore the physical environment &amp;ndash; an asylum, a mansion, a suburban home &amp;ndash; they will put together experiences and sensations to reunite (or finally destroy) the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s fragmented self.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires a custom card deck of 100 cards.  The cards are not provided in the document but it provides a brief suggestion of what they may be like.  The cards are used to present an image to spur creativity.  Otherwise, the game entirely is a narrative excursion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
