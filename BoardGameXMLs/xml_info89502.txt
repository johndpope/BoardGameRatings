							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MisFortune: Container Ship</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally christened &amp;quot;Fortune&amp;quot;, this massive container ship has suffered a long run of bad luck. Though old and neglected, the ship continues on as if driven by its own purpose. At over 1000 ft long, this heavy can carry 624 of the common HMT-337 cargo containers and is designed to provide power, life support, and access to each one during flight. As these standard containers can be customized for everything from freight, to passengers, to offices and medical facilities, this ship is the ultimate in large-scale, affordable versatility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This oversized issue also includes a bulk-hauler variant (with a dozen 5,000 ton cargo bays instead of container couplings) and the smaller Ajax-class military transport. This workhorse uses the same technology (and a subset of map pages) as MisFortune to provide a rugged transport with a flexible payload capability. With space for 48 containers, it has plenty of room for troops, cargo, and modular base sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this issue introduces the Sherpa-class freight hauler. This single-pilot ship is little more than a frame with engines and cockpit attached. Designed to carry a single cargo container and easily switch from one to another, this rugged working-man's ship is a common sight at ports throughout civilized space. MisFortune carries a pair of these vessels and the Ajax-class transport has an external landing pad for one. Ten container designs, including a &amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;, are provided along with the Sherpa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     29 page PDF file detailing the ships, interior areas, and crew.&lt;br/&gt;         The main book also includes the Alpha (bulk hauler) variant and the Ajax-class transport.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Open Game License stats provided for the vessel and crew.&lt;br/&gt;     Map Books&lt;br/&gt;         Full-color 64 page PDF file containing complete interior maps.&lt;br/&gt;         Includes miniature-scale maps for tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;         Miniature-scale composite map of the Ajax interior.&lt;br/&gt;         A poster-sized, 32x64 inch, 150 dpi, color JPEG image of the Ajax deck plan.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     For convenience, the versatile Sherpa-class freight hauler is detailed in its own documents:&lt;br/&gt;         10 page PDF detailing the Sherpa, several custom container types, and sample pilot.&lt;br/&gt;         Full-color 15 page PDF file with miniature-scale maps.&lt;br/&gt;         The Sherpa already fits on a single page and so does not require a separate poster.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
