			<description>From the rules: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of the game is to become the wealthiest person in the Sutherland Shire through the buying, renting, and selling of property. &lt;br/&gt;The gaining of such wealth will enable you to fund patriotic organizations like Australia First and the Patriotic Youth League, so they can get into parliament and Win Back Australia! &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note the game only simulates the former; the latter is left to the imagination of the players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This print and play PDF game is essentially Monopoly, with title deeds, colors and payouts lifted from that game.  Locations are all relative to the Sutherland Shire of Southern Sydney, Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chance and Community Chest are replaced by &amp;quot;Aussie Luck&amp;quot; cards, of which the majority are xenophobic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nationalist group Australia First has already moved to distance itself from the game, posting a statement on its website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This product is not an Australia First product, despite the 'game' mentioning the party at various points.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The revision listed in the rules is 2006 v.2.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
