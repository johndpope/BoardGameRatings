			<description>The players are collectors of old money, and their aim is to collect more and more coins, old bank notes, bills, and assemble a valuable collection of them. They can also sell these collections throughout the game, to make an extra profit by the end of the game. The player who knows the most about the acquired art treasure's historical background, can make lavish benefits quickly, but who has less knowledge can also get one copy released for auction, with the help of an expert. Knowledge or tactics may prove better? Whoever collects the most forints by the end of the game, will be the most succesful numismatic and the winner of the game. The game was created with educational purpose, and its aim is to present and teach Hungarian history. Every thesis has five questions, specific fot that era, which must be answered correctly to win the subject of auction. If someone doesn't know the correct answer for the question, he/she can hire the other players as experts, who will get payment for the right answer from the principal. The biggest income can be reached by selling collections during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
