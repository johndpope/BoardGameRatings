							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Back to the Future</name>
									
			<description>A simple roll-and-move game themed around the Back to the Future movie. Produced and made available in the UK by Smiths Crisps, a snack food company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Marty McFly, a senior of Hill Valley School was late for class. After that night, however, when he climbed behind the wheel of a nuclear powered time machine car invented by eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown, he wouldn't be late for anything. In fact, he was 30 years too early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marty traveled back in time to 1955 just as the town clock was showing 4 minutes past 10 o'clock in the evening. After hiding the car and cautiously walking through his home town, Marty meets up with Lorraine Baines and George McFly - the two teenagers who are later to become his parents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only had Marty traveled to a point in time before the dawn of rock n' roll and Smiths flavoured crisps but he had tampered with history. He now had a number of problems to solve before he could attempt to get back to his own time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, through this exciting board game, specially produced by Smiths, you can imagine you're Marty and follow his adventures - will you be first to get back to the present time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please read the rules of the game carefully before starting our on your journey, you don't want to get stuck in 1955 forever!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
