			<description>This is a trick-taking game with fairly standard mechanics.  Players are dealt five-card hands (or equal hands of less than five cards, if the deck is nearly exhausted).  The highest card played wins a trick, and players must follow suit if possible.  Players who cannot follow suit can play a non-trump card (automatically losing the round) or a trump card (potentially winning the round, unless a higher trump is played).  The trump suit is determined by rolling a special die showing the four suits plus one side with both red suits and another side with both black suits.  When a side with multiple suits is rolled, the dealer gets to pick which suit is trump.  The trump suit and dealer change every time the deck is exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small plastic poker chips also play a part in the game.  Players start with an equal amount of chips.  A plastic tray is kept at the center of the board during play.  At the end of every trick in which a trump was played, all losing players have to place a chip in the &amp;quot;Suits&amp;quot; section of the tray.  Whenever a King is played, players place chips in the &amp;quot;Jackpot&amp;quot; section of the tray.  Each player has a game card showing the four suits.  Whenever a player wins a trick, he or she places a special yellow &amp;quot;Hoyle&amp;quot; tile under the leading suit for the trick.  Whenever a player fills all three spaces under a suit, he or she wins the chips in the &amp;quot;Suits&amp;quot; area of the tray and the other players have to put chips into that area.  Whenever a pre-determined number of suits are filled in, the &amp;quot;Jackpot&amp;quot; is won along with the &amp;quot;Suits&amp;quot; area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a player has filled in a suit, he or she gains the ability to &amp;quot;freeze&amp;quot; the suit -- upon winning a suit for the fourth time, the player can flip over one of the tiles on his or her card.  This prevents any other player from placing a tile under this suit -- instead, the only option they have is to &amp;quot;unfreeze&amp;quot; the suit by flipping their opponent's tile back over.  It's possible for all three tiles to get flipped, making it very difficult for anyone else to win in the suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has no predefined end.  The rules suggest playing for a certain amount of time, eliminating players who run out of chips until only a single player remains, or playing for a pre-determined amount of time.  The play time listed in this entry reflects a single round of play, not an entire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
