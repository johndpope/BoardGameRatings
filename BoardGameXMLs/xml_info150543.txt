			<description>from the designer / publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet includes some ships that made appearances in an ongoing campaign but did not make it into the previous book, Between Chains and Starlight. It contains some oddball creatures and ships for use in scifi or fantasy settings that involve space travel. (The dragons can be used in ground-only campaigns also.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dragons in Space (and stuff)&amp;quot; contains rules, stat blocks, and illustrations for spaceborne dragons, Starlight Dragons, and the Abomination; two 'hostile' NPC ships; two stations; one neutral trading ship; and one more 'traditional' spaceship for use by player characters, complete with floorplan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules and stat blocks for the dragons are created to be used with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game when personal (traditional) combat is involved. Additional rules are included when vehicles or ships come into play. The larger dragons can not realistically be defeated without starships. (The largest ones may not be beatable in straight-up battles at all.) Rules and stat blocks regarding ship combat are created to be compatible with the ruleset presented in Between Chains and Starlight, but can also be used in games using existing Open Game Content rules with relatively little modification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some illustrations span two pages and are best viewed with dual page view enabled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
