							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunger Hollow</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey into the natural wonder of the wilds in this adventure for 4-6 characters of 6th to 8th level, but beware, for even great beauty hides great danger. Presented by Brian Miller for the CK's pleasure and the players challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunger Hollow is a rocky canyon containing a green valley where generations have passed without the influence of civilization &amp;ndash; a place where they say animals and humanoids are often the same breed. It&amp;rsquo;s a wild land where dangerous creatures prowl by day or night looking to make a quick meal of the weak or to ambush foolhardy stragglers. Rumors spread by the locals suggest that kobolds, goblins, hobgoblins, orcs, gnolls, bugbears and even ogres and trolls laid claim to the unexplored territory within the hollow. Tales abound of priceless treasures captured from trade caravans which ventured too close to the mountainous cliffs then vanished in the shadow of the forsaken canyon, never to be seen again. Some folks believe the humanoids are forming an evil army large enough in number to attack strongholds within a day&amp;rsquo;s travel in any direction. It&amp;rsquo;s this grievous concern and the loss of countless supply wagons which inspired the local lords to hire a group of mountaineering mercenaries to investigate the hollow and bring back word of the dangers may lurk beyond or perhaps within the hollow&amp;rsquo;s treacherous canyon ridges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
