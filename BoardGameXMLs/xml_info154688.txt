							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Khyber Ablaze: Uprisings and Punitive Expeditions on the North-West Frontier</name>
									
			<description>The Khyber Ablaze places the Player in command of the British Forces along the North-West Frontier and Afghanistan in the later part of the Victorian Era. You must use the forces available to you to put down a wave of uprisings, led by a fantatical Leader, that threaten to throw the British out of the region. If you liked movies like &amp;quot;Gunga Din&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Brigand of Kandahar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Flame over India&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Lives of the Bengal Lancers&amp;quot;, this game is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of British Forces along the North-West Frontier, the Player must protect the British Settlements and defeat the Khan&amp;rsquo;s Forces by capturing three of their four Fortified Settlements of Samagan, Konduz, Herat and Kandahar before time runs out or the Khan&amp;rsquo;s Forces capture enough British Settlements to drive you Back to India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: The game features a fun and simplistic method for resolving solitaire combat tactically, rules for Heroes that can make an impact on the outcome of battles, and lots of colorful game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
