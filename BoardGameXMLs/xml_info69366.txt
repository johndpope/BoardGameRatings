							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golden Age Starships Compilation 1-5</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compiling the Golden Age Starships, this book features new ships for Traveller, including deck plans, crews, variants and scenario ideas for each. All ships can be found in the official Spinward Marches setting, and the Compilation features the Fast Courier, Corsair, LSP Modular Starship, Sword Worlds Patrol Cruiser, and a collection of archaic small craft and stations for worlds who are just finding their way into space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Age Starships 1: Fast Courier&lt;br/&gt;Details the 200-ton Fast Courier, a Jump-3 ship originally designed for the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service but now used throughout the Imperium. Some are in private hands, used for movement of high priority and secure cargos and on subsidized routes. This is an ideal ship for characters wanting a vessel a little different from the norm. Full Traveller statistics are provided as well as deckplans, a registry of Fast Couriers in the Spinward Marches, and 7 adventure seeds for merchant campaigns set in the Marches using the Fast Courier. The vessel is designed for player use as well as a ship that players may encounter. It is usually seen carrying mail or priority, secure and hazardous cargos. In addition, details are given on the exploration version of the Fast Courier used by the Imperial Scout Service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Age Starships 2: Corsair&lt;br/&gt;Contains complete information and deckplans for an upgraded variant of the 400 ton Corsair, known as the Buccaneer class. This corsair class is suitable as a ship that could be encountered by characters if they are travelling anywhere on the fringes of the Imperium and beyond, although the five specific encounters listed in this book are located in the Spinward Marches. Alternatively, this design could be used as the basis of a corsair campaign, with the players taking roles as pirates. Any of the scenarios presented in this book could be used as the basis for a corsair campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Age Starships 3: LSP Modular Starship&lt;br/&gt;Details an entirely new class of ship; a 300 ton &amp;quot;framework&amp;quot; vessel which utilises the versatility cutter modules to create an infinitely customizable vessel. The modular starship can be configured as a cargo hauler, a research vessel, a hospital ship, an escort carrier or whatever else the owners may need. 2 cutter modules are detailed, complete with stats and deckplans for each module, as well as stats for the 600 ton Zhodani patrol corvette and Zhodani 10 ton light fighter, as well as the Imperial 20 ton multi-role fighter, which is carried in one of the cutter modules. Three adventure seeds are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Age Starships 4: Sword Worlds Patrol Cruiser&lt;br/&gt;Outlines the standard, heavily armoured 600-ton Sword Worlds Patrol Cruiser, with complete Mongoose Traveller stats, deckplans, history, variants and operational details. This supplement also contains a short adventure (Amber Zone) set in the Sword Worlds of the Spinward Marches. The adventure comes complete with all NPC stats in Mongoose Traveller format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Age Starships 5: Archaic Small Craft and Space Stations&lt;br/&gt;Many worlds are Tech Level 6-8, and these worlds may not have access to high tech space travel - this supplement fills the gap by outlining Tech Level 6-8 expansions to the High Guard Small Craft Design Sequence, including rules for reaction-drive launch vehicles (rockets), smaller hulls down to 2.5 dtons and a new drive for the small craft drives table. 23 new designs in the book include launch vehicles, 2 and 3 man archaic small craft from 2.5 to 7.5 dtons, a 20 ton modular launch, 5 ton stratospheric mini-fighter at TL7 and 8+, and 10 ton modules for both the modular launch and to create low-mid tech modular space stations. Many space station designs are also included, ranging from small science stations to defense stations and small highports. Includes a Mercenary Ticket/Amber Zone: Assault On Space Station Alpha, which details an Ine Givar hostage situation on a large modular space station that a military team must solve - by deadly force if necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
