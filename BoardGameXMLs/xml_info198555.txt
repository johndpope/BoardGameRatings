							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Temple of Forgotten Evil (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 4-6 players of level 4-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small town of Boldon, and its surrounding villages are afraid. Dozens of people are missing, some speculate lost to some nefarious purpose. A broken drunkard tells fantastic tales of an evil temple and the horrible things within. The rare few who know the legends and history of the region are beginning to think the dark times have returned; not seen since the fall of the first age of man. People are beginning to feel the icy fingers of fear closing in. The party becomes aware of these events and is inspired to investigate. This leads them to a broken man who tells them a story of a lost temple. Has it been rediscovered by men seduced by its forgotten evil? The drunkard&amp;rsquo;s tale leads to others who might help the party discover more before they face The Lost Temple of Forgotten Evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
