			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mouldering pit. Below the wreck of its sculpted capstone a stair winds sodden into gloom where a rancid sump rises, over walls sunk with hollows of life in death. Gibberings echo, and words in unknown tongues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It presents core ideas and key numbers to fall back on, with general approaches that can be applied in other situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted pit as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including occupants, pit structure, a potentially transformative slumber, a surviving builder and accelerated decay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pit could be detailed using Elaboration: Structure &amp; Surface and possibly Being: More or Less Fantastical Olde Worlde Technologies, the sump using Elaboration: Atmosphere &amp; Liquid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
