							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alhambra: Designers&#039; Expansion â€“ The Palace Staff</name>
									
			<description>Every building in the Alhambra needs staff to maintain its beauty. These people are (depending on the building) the gardener, concubine, noble, housekeeper, archer, and stableman. The more staff you have at the end of the game, the more additional victory points you earn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player gets a &amp;quot;Chief of the palace&amp;quot; to place at the fountain. Then a display of 4 staff members is formed next to the building market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player buys a building, they may move the chief of the palace, paying one extra money for each space he moves. The chief can go anywhere, except crossing over walls. For each building he lands on that not already has a staff member, the player can take the corresponding staff tile from the display, if he is present in the display, and place it on the building. After the chief made all his moves, the display is refilled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more staff tiles the player manages to place in his Alhambra the more victory points they are awarded at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 54 staff tiles and 6 foreman tokens (1 in each player color)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
