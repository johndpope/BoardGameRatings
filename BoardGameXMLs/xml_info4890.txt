			<description>Fangface is a roll and move game, with simple interactive elements, based on the cartoon series of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin a spinner in order to move around the board. Some squares are safe while others cause you to move back. The most common square on the board is &amp;quot;throw fingers&amp;quot; where two players randomly put out a number of fingers. If the total is odd, the active player moves back while if it is even, he/she stays on the square. There is also an element where you must guess in which hand a player is holding a token. During the game, a special &amp;quot;moon card&amp;quot; can be used on a player to move them back on the board to a specific square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to make it to the End space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
