			<description>Xit is a themeless abstract strategy game for two players using some of the principals from the Tixel family of games, including the piece activation mechanics, only reversed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Xit, players take turns moving an active (square) piece on a 6x6 (or 8x8) game board. Some of the pieces are missing one or two of their corners. After a piece is moved it is inactivated (by turning it 45 degrees in either direction, or from square to diamond). When a piece is moved past an inactive piece it will push that piece back to its active state it if there is a corner of that piece in its path. Players capture (remove from the board) any pieces of their opponent's activated in this way. Their own pieces remain on the board, ready to be played again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has no more active pieces, they lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
