							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Overgrown Temple Ruin</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ages past a small but well built and beautifully decorated temple graced this spot. These days only ruins remain. The temple's gold and silver decorations have been looted long ago and with time the harsh weather washed away the colors with which many of the stones were painted as well. Even many of the stones of walls and columns alike have been carried off to be recycled in newer constructions. And maybe no evidence would have remained of this structure if not for the forest which began to cover much of the surrounding landscape through the years. Today these ruins lie mostly forgotten. Only a few Gothic tales still tell of the old temple and the ghosts supposedly haunting it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
