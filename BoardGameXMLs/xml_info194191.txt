			<description>Glass Face is a fast-paced, set collecting, dice and slapping game. The characters in the game are trapped in the cards. You need to slap them and set them free and place them into your care. There are 64 characters, on cards numbered 1-8. 8 of each number. There are 8 rounds in the game. Each round there are 8 cards in a line. Each player has 3 die (1-3) Everyone races to roll numbers corresponding to the numbers on the cards. When you roll the same number, you slap it and take it. If you roll a 9 you are frozen, so be careful when rolling 3 dice. Each card you collect is worth one point and if you have more of one number than anyone else, you get the point value of that card. Whoever has the most points at the end wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
