							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Nate&#039;s Detention Dash</name>
									
			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;Based on the best selling Big Nate books, Detention Dash is a fun fast paced game!  Join middle-schooler Nate and his friends as they run from classroom to classroom collecting detention cards.  Along the way Coach John might surprise you!  The player with the fewest detention and fail cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information: Players must roll and move through the spaces representing hallways and classrooms.  Each player must collect a report card from each of six classrooms.  Along the way, they may get Detention cards in various ways, such as being caught in the hall when the bell rings or being caught by good student Artur. Each player must also draw and play an action card each turn.  Some cards allow extra moves, moving other players or discarding or taking extra detention cards.  Others are &amp;quot;Coach John All Play&amp;quot; cards which require all players to complete a physical challenge (such a making and flying a paper airplane). First player to get all six report cards discards two detention cards and then total detention and &amp;quot;fail&amp;quot; report cards are counted, &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; report cards are subtracted and the player with the lowest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
