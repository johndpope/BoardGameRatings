			<description>Waterloo! There are only a few battles in history whose names have become so famous as to mean something even to those least interested in military affairs. The epic showdown that ultimately brought down the French empire erected by Napoleon Bonaparte is so well known that it has even entered into common language. Phrases such as &amp;quot;he met his Waterloo&amp;quot; now signify ultimate defeat and the end of all hopes. On June 18, 1815, south of the small Belgian hamlet Waterloo, in what was then the Kingdom of the Netherlands, one of the bloodiest battles of history occurred. Napoleon hoped to destroy the European coalition arrayed against him by means of a quick, decisive victory over one, or preferably both, of his main antagonists. These were the Anglo-Allied army under Field Marshal The Duke of Wellington, and the Prussian army under Generalfeldmarschall Gebhard Leberecht Fuerst Bluecher von Wahlstatt. Admittedly, preparations for the campaign took a couple of months and after its conclusion some more weeks were needed to bring the French empire to its knees, and there were other theaters of war besides the one in Belgium. Yet the Waterloo campaign proper, the just four days between the crossing of the Netherlands border by the Arm&amp;eacute;e du Nord on June 15, 1815, and its disastrous defeat at the hands of the combined Anglo-Allied and Prussian armies on June 18, decided the fate of the emperor, and by implication, the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units represent historical regiments, battalions, skirmisher companies and artillery batteries, as well as all major leaders and unit commanders. Players can view units in several different modes, including 3-D &amp;quot;miniatures&amp;quot; style figures or NATO style military symbols. Each map hex is 100 meters across, and each turn averages 15 minutes of real time. Players can select formations for units and employ a wide array of tactics. There are also special rules for light infantry, heavy cavalry and pioneers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waterloo contains some sixty scenarios. These include the major actions of the campaign, such as the battles of Quatres Bras and Waterloo itself, as well as several hypothetical actions based on alternative approach marches. Several of these scenarios place the entire French Army against both the Anglo-Allies and the Prussians for one grand battle of annihilation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Scenarios Covering:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ligny&lt;br/&gt;Quatre Bras&lt;br/&gt;Soleilmont&lt;br/&gt;Waterloo&lt;br/&gt;Wavre&lt;br/&gt;Twin Battles: Ligny &amp;amp; Quatre Bras&lt;br/&gt;Twin Battles: Waterloo &amp;amp; Wavre&lt;br/&gt;Entire Campaign - single scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What If Scenarios Covering:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Braine le Comte&lt;br/&gt;Chatelet&lt;br/&gt;Mons&lt;br/&gt;Nivelles&lt;br/&gt;Plancenoit&lt;br/&gt;The Ridge&lt;br/&gt;Togrinne&lt;br/&gt;And others..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
