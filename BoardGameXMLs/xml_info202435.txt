							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monocacy/Ft. Stevens</name>
									
			<description>The third game in the Line of Battle Series covering Jubal Early's campaign in the summer of 1864 to either take Washington DC or to threaten it sufficiently that forces would be stripped from Grant's efforts to advance against Richmond. The two battles (one on two maps the other on one) can be fought as a campaign where the player's success (or lack of it) at Monocacy affects his chances at the gates of Washington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
