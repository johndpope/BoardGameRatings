			<description>Pinch It! is a simple dice game based primarily on luck. The game was intriguing since it was played using a 4x4 grid of pegs. The board is divided into four quadrants each having a different color. Within each quadrant is a 2x2 grid of pegs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The die used is a six sided die with special markings which control the action of the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 Blank faces &amp;ndash; The player&amp;rsquo;s turn is over and the die is passed to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hollow Square &amp;ndash; The player discards one of his own pegs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hollow Triangle &amp;ndash;  The player may take a peg from any player of his choice and discard it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Solid Square &amp;ndash; The player may replace one of his empty peg holes with a discarded peg. If he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any empty hole, then his turn is finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Solid Square  and Solid Triangle - The player may replace one of his empty peg holes with a  peg from any player of his choice. If he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any empty hole, then his turn is finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to have the last peg on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
