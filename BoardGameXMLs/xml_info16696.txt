			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick your favorite Packy PlayFair game piece, spin the wheel and see what the cards have in store! Each card teaches a valuable lesson in sportsmanship and fair play. Read the game card and if Packy does the right thing you move ahead - a slip up will send you back! If you spin and land on a space that matches your Packy game piece you spin again! But be alert as you move around the board - there are twists and turns that will either help you toward the finish line or hold you back! You pick the best course to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first person to move around and collect all the letters of PLAY FAIR and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the Creative Child Magazine Seal of Excellence 2004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
