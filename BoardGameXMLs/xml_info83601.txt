							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Runic Weapons</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runic Weapons is a short D20 fantasy supplement that provides an alternative way to produce magical items from that given in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 3rd Edition. With this system, you a +1 weapon need not be BOTH +1 to hit and +1 to damage, but could instead be just +1 to hit or just +1 to damage. It also provides a groundwork for creating upgradable magical weapons and armor, much like some of your favorite CRPGs allow. The system also allows for the creation of quick and dirty one-shot magic weapons and items, as well as treasured herilooms that took generations to carve, adding another depth to the value of magic in your game. Along with the system, this booklet also details roughly 150 magic runes to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
