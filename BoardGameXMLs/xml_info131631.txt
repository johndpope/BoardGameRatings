			<description>Battle Unit Zeoth is a scrolling shooter developed by Jaleco for the Game Boy in 1990 which saw a North American port one year later in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Unit Zeoth takes place in the future where mankind is invaded by a race of alien robots known as the Grein. The Earth&amp;rsquo;s forces were triumphant in battle and the Grein forces fled the Solar System. However, as they retreated, the Grein left behind a secret underground base filled with self-replicating Grein machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty-two years after the Earth&amp;rsquo;s victory, the Grein base opened and a new attack force decimated the city of New Age. To retaliate, Earth&amp;rsquo;s military has stored a mecha that specializes in alien combat known as the Zeoth. It is the Zeoth&amp;rsquo;s assignment to stop the attack force, go into the Grein secret base and destroy the mechanical occupants before a new invasion force arrives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battle Unit Zeoth&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
