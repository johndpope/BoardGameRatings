							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Demon Pits of Caeldo</name>
									
			<description>From the inside cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CASTLE CAELDO IS HAUNTED!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The once proud castle of the Barons of Caeldo is a tumbling ruin, populated by rats and hawks.  'Tis said that demons inhabit the cold corridors of the castle and the pits below, and that to spend a night within its walls is to risk horrible death (but that's just a silly old wives' tale!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King in Tualyn is offering 10,000 pieces of gold to anyone who can spend a week in the old ruin -- and a title and the Barony!  Think of it! a fortune for sleeping in an old castle and fighting off a few mice and birds!  And the rumors of treasure within its walls -- magical artifacts, huge piles of gold and jewelry, fabulous rugs and tapestries, all sorts of treasure!  Just spend a week cleaning up the castle, dusting off the cobwebs, stomping an occasional rat, and the Barony, the castle, and all its treasures are yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
