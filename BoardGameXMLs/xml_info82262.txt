Race low and deadly over the treetops at 200 mph. Then lock onto your target with Hellfire missiles and 30mm cannon as you deliver a powerful punch against the enemy! They'll retaliate with massive armored force but it's up to youand GUNSHIP to extinguish their threats and survice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUNSHIP is another in the excellent line of real-life simulations from MicroProse.
