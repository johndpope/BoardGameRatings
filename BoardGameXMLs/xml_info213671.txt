			<description>Turn of Phrase is an adult-themed drawing game that revolves around popular phrases. These phrases are split into two decks. An angel deck (with clean phrases) and a devil deck (with adult phrases).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team selects an artist.  One artist picks up the top card from each deck, chooses one, and shares it with the other artists, who start drawing the phrase at the same time.  The first team to guess the phrase wins the round.  After every artist has picked a card to draw, a new artist is selected from each team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team that guesses the phrase correctly first wins a point. After players have played any desired number of rounds, the team with the most points is declared champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows for multiple methods of play, such as acting out and playing as every person for themselves. There is even a kid friendly way to play using only the angel deck, and a more adult way to play using only the devil deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
