							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What Lurks Within (5e)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What Lurks Within?&amp;quot; is a D&amp;amp;D adventure for four to five 2nd-level player characters (PCs). The scenario takes place in the World of Farland, in the Kingdom of Daven, in and around a small sleepy human village named Eichen...Although the Kingdom of Daven has been plagued by evil since the Liberation, the town of Eichen was mostly spared from this suffering because of its location. Near the edge of a large forest, away from major roads and trade routes, the town has been largely unmolested. The past two months, however, have been dark times for the folk of Eichen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
