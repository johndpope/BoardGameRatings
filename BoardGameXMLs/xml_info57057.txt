			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old soldiers never die...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more than three decades, Dr. Rudolph van Richten stood against the forces of darkness, and hunted their servants in the far corners of the land of Mists. Now he had thought his long battle over, had thought he could spend his declining years in quiet enjoyment with old friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But for some, a tragic end is inevitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark forces have been gathering in the Mists. Their objective is to see Ravenloft's foremost expert on the supernatural destroyed, shattered in spirit as well as in body. From the crumbling edifice of Van Richten's childhood home, an enemy long thought vanquished spins a web of powerful evils and lost souls, drawing Van Richten to his doom. And then a group of heroes gets trapped in the web as well. . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witness the final stand of Rudolph van Richten!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this box is a grand-scale Ravenloft adventure that pushes heroes to the brink of madness, and draws them into the terrifying scheme to annihilate Rudolph van Richten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set contains:&lt;br/&gt;- Sea of Madness, a 96-page book detailing the island of Dominia and relating the events that start the cycle of doom.&lt;br/&gt;- Homecoming, a 64-page book describing the Van Richten family estate and the large haunted mansion known as Bleak House. Suitable for use with the Bleak House campaign or the Masque of the Red Death setting, this adventure is designed so that it can be played several times, and no two experiences will be the same.&lt;br/&gt;- Heroes, Monsters, and Settings, a 32-page book containing game statistics for some of Ravenloft's best known, yet never detailed, villains; a new type of vampire; information on Martira Bay in Darkon; and maps intended for use with the Bleak House campaign.&lt;br/&gt;- A color map revealing the layout and secrets of the Bleak House itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
