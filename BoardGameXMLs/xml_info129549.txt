							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ports of Call: The Frontier Zone</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the joys of Bulldogs! is the constant discovery of new places. Let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;ndash; it's boring to spend every adventure flying back and forth between the same two points. Bulldogs! is about going to strange new places, meeting new people, turning a profit any way possible, and hoping you don&amp;rsquo;t get shot at in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ports of Call is a collection of new starports and planets from the Frontier Zone. Each location is sketched in, with the details that make it special &amp;ndash; the general environment, port amenities, the local laws, what the native residents are like, what kind of jobs you&amp;rsquo;re likely to find, and what kinds of trouble you might get into. If a new alien species makes the planet their home, Ports of Call presents them as a new playable species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains basically everything a Class D Freight crewman needs when the airlock opens &amp;ndash; all summed up in a few pages. Each entry has just enough information for a quick pick-up game setting, or for the GM to drop into an ongoing game however she chooses. Additionally, each entry will have a handful of story hooks and non-player characters to inspire single sessions or campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ready? Check your blasters and vibro-knives. The airlock is opening. The next port of call awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
