			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building a world is hard work. You need a map, you need countries, you need cities, you need histories. The list of things you need is long. Even worse, you need players who will read it all! You can purchase a world, but that is expensive and then there is a lot of reading. Again, its hard work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This whole concept is to take that work away. Get a map that is already drawn. Cover it with countries and cultures that already exist. Just tweak it a bit and everything is right there ready to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just for lazy DMs, it is for any DM who wants to prioritise their time and focus on story rather than background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
