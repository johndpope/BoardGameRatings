							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dungeon Under the Mountain: Level 4</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain, Level 4&lt;br/&gt;This deep level is known as &amp;quot;The Web&amp;quot;. It features a great, dangerous maze in the northernmost area. Below that area there is a large dungeon complex that features a great spider temple. The temple extends its &amp;quot;legs&amp;quot; across the dungeon and holds dangers and treasures as no one has never seen! Nobody knows if the drow still inhabit the dungeon below the web, or the purpose of the maze above. Was it a slave pen? Was it the maze of a devilish minotaur who declared war to the drow below? Who knows?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Return of the Mammoth Dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under The Mountain is a massive dungeon you can locate anywhere in your campaign world. Each level contains hundreds of rooms ready to be filled with the critters of your choice and with the devious traps you prefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product contains one king-size map (22&amp;quot;x34&amp;quot;) and the same map divided in eight US letter sheets. So, your choice is to print the whole map (maybe through a print server) or print yourself the single pieces and tape them together. You can print even a small portion of the dungeon and scale it as you see fit since these products are completely vector-based; therefore you will not suffer loss of print resolution. So, you could print out every single room in battlemap-scale, for use with your miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back to old-school mammoth dungeon, this product offers a variety of uses. You can simply take it straight, fill the rooms and start your favorite dungeon crawl campaign. The dungeon has suggested key areas but, if you want customization, it lies few clicks before you! Using the &amp;quot;Rule the Dungeon&amp;quot; feature you can alter the map as you wish to suit your needs. Want a blank dungeon without features? Want just the key areas over a white background? Want to print only some portions of the dungeon? Want to make handouts for your players with the dungeon without features? You can do all and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
