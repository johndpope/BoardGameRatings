			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ten day ago a theft took place at the Gatehouse located in the Dawn Pass. The thief was chased into a mine a half day ride from the Gatehouse, along the Eastern side of the Grey Peak Mountains. Adventurers pursued the thief into the mine and found themselves in the middle of a battle that had been fought every day for the last 100 years. An evil entity feasted on the fear and pain. The adventurers overcame the creature and obtained all the stolen books and scrolls except one book. Upon investigating, it was determined that the missing tome contains rituals that allow transference through any barrier. A Phaerimm, a member of an evil and powerful race bent on deaths of all races in Faerun, is believed to be behind the theft of the tome. The factions are concerned that this creature will attempt to release more of its kind from the barrier they are locked behind. But the ritual takes a week and requires rare and specific ingredients. The Phaerimm knows where the ingredients can be found and so do the factions. Who will obtain the ingredients to the ritual first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
