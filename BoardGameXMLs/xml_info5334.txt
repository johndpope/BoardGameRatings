			<description>2 players (or 4 players playing as partners) each start out with 6 bidding chips, numbered 1 to 6. You and the player to your left simultaneously reveal their chips.  The player whose turn it is then gets to move his pawn a number of spaces, either forward or backward (his choice) equal to the difference between the two bids.  If it's a tie,  the player can't move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a 25-space track of famous English Inns &amp;amp; Taverns.  The game starts with each space having a corresponding coaster with the Inn name on it. If you move onto a space with a coaster still on it, you take the coaster.  Then the next player goes, bidding against the player to his left.  As the bidding goes round and round, eventually each player has used all 6 of his bid-chips.  They then take them all back into their hand, and start fresh.  First player to get to space 25 then gets to take all the remaining coasters still on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player (or partnership) with the most coasters wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
