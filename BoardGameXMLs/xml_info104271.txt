			<description>Manufacturer Description/Rules(quoted exactly):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to &amp;quot;Shop&amp;quot; for the various &amp;quot;Goodies&amp;quot; along the game path.  To Shop for Goodies, a player must land on an orange circle with a name of a Goodie that the player has a Goodie marker of the same kind. To begin play, punch out the Goodie markers and place them name down and mix up well. Players draw an equal amount of Goodies markers.  Players choose the color of playing piece they wish and place it at &amp;quot;Start.&amp;quot; In turn, spin the spinner and move along the path the amount of spaces indicated on the spinner dial.  When a player's playing piece lands upon an orange space they may &amp;quot;Shop&amp;quot;for the Goodie named and place the Goodie marker on the Ice Cream cone.  There are two spaces where a player may choose any Goodie marker from their pile to discard.  A player having two of the same kind of Goodie markers may discard only one at a time when &amp;quot;Shopping.&amp;quot;  Play continues around the path until a player has &amp;quot;Shopped&amp;quot; for all the Goodie markers, and this player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
