			<description>As the old American Indian legend goes, the world is supported by turtles all the way down. This game has stacks of turtles climbing on top of each other. The stack is owned by the player whose turtle is on top. The game begins with each square holding 3 turtles, and the stacks are arranged checker board style in a 4x4 grid. If player knocks a stack over he loses. The game ends when the players agree that no more stacks can be formed. Whoever owns the most turtles in their stack wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment Needed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;       4x4 board&lt;br/&gt;       24 six-sided dice in each of two colors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
