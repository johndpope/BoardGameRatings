							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Count Khabal</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While searching for a dark force to help rescue his family from the Thule Society, Reuven Khabal was approached by the Merlin of Earth. Warning him against using dark magic, the Merlin took Reuven on as an apprentice. Unfortunately, Reuven&amp;rsquo;s ambition to inflict pain and suffering upon his enemies festered within his heart and soul. Even after the fall of the Axis powers and the ending of the Second World War, Reuven&amp;rsquo;s desire for vengeance could not be fully sated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unable to attain this goal under the Merlin, Reuven eventually sought out, and made a pact with, Lord Orkus -- the King of the Underworld. Using the power given to him by Orkus, Reuven hunteddown Thule sorcerers as Count Khabal (PL 11).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
