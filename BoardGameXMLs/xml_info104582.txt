			<description>A card game for multiple players with a wizard theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box art:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of strategy and luck where fortunes are won or lost at the turn of a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play for a few minutes or play all night.  You control when the game ends.  Play against the other players while you play against the dealer.  Accumulate the most cash and you're the winner.  Easy to learn, tough to master, this action packed, fast paced game has something for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With six phases, make the most of the cards dealt to you as you choose your &amp;quot;COLOR&amp;quot;; go &amp;quot;HIGH or LOW&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;COVER&amp;quot; your GOMI cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the deal rotates to you, it is your chance to call for the GOMI to get the other players to &amp;quot;PUT&amp;quot; more than they &amp;quot;TAKE&amp;quot;.  If they don't there's always &amp;quot;DEALER'S REVENGE&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any strategy is legal.  Play conservatively or risk it all.  The right strategy can put you in a position to double or quadruple your cash.  Choose your cards wisely because in this ancient game, fortunes are won or lost at the turn of a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
