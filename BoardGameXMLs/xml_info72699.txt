			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire Ant is an arcade puzzle game for the Commodore 64, release in 1983 by Mogul Communications, and later ported to the Amstrad CPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls an ant who has to rescue his queen from evil scorpions who have taken her captive. The game is played on maze-like screens where scorpions are wandering around and the player must navigate the ant while avoiding the enemies.
