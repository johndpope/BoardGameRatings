			<description>This is a mini-game in Bartl's range of match-box sized games and puzzles. The game is a simpler version of Pass the Pigs, where little pig figurines are cast and points are scored according to how they land. However, the main difference is that instead of two pigs, the game comes with five; and there is no 'jeopardy' element in the game. Players simply cast the pigs and take their score, then the next player takes their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
