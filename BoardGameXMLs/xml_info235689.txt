							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Bits of Miscellaneous Tat to Find (PFRPG)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not truly tat, this is a list of items that have very little value. Although they are mostly worth money and can be sold, they are all worth less than 1 gp. These items can be used for scene dressing, to be found on corpses or for players who want to loot everything in sight (if you have the sort of player who, in an Elder Scrolls game, rolls into a shop with plates, trenchers, weights, quills, ink, empty wine bottles and other such items of clutter to sell, this list is definitely aimed at them). Players can possibly make money from these, but they will need substantial quantities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result: Skin Scour: This rough soap is made from ground pumice, and a little bit goes a long way. Light gray in color, it scrubs off trail dust, sweat, and blood with equal ease, leaving behind a clean, slightly dusty scent. Weight: 1 pound per sack, Cost: 4 cp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover, one the front matter, one the Open Game License and around half a page is the introduction and blank space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is also available in a system neutral version. The latter is a bit shorter and doesn't have the Pathfinder stats for some items. You do not need to buy both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
