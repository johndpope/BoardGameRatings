							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Endicott Epidemic: Infectious Contagion</name>
									
			<description>Thirty years ago MBI dumped their industrial waste into the ground beneath Endicott, NY. Today, the deceased walk the earth as a result of the toxic plume that was created. Now, it's up to you to find a way to stop this infectious contagion from spreading before MBI returns to clean up their accident...with a nuclear purge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endicott Epidempic: Infectious Contagion is a game for 1 to 8 players. Each player plays as a character with unique abilities allowing them to combat the Zombie hordes. The object of the game is to find the Hermit, his critical Intel and his escape route before all of the players have become infected by the never-ending wave of Undead. Additionally, all this must be accomplished before the 4 Countdown Cards have been drawn, which will lead to the Nuclear Purge and an instant lose for all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endicott Epidempic: Infectious Contagion is also great for solo play. You can play with some or all of the characters, or play as a single character and take a stand as the only uninfected human in the county. Once you become infected, all hope is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 70 Cards: &lt;br/&gt;4 Countdown Cards &lt;br/&gt;8 Character Cards &lt;br/&gt;30 Zombie Cards &lt;br/&gt;15 Item/Weapon Cards &lt;br/&gt;7 Event Cards &lt;br/&gt;3 Cure Cards&lt;br/&gt;3 Hit Chip Cards [requires manual cutting]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Infectious Contagion is a spin-off card game, Endicott Epidemic is also available as a full board game with more objectives, more items, more gameplay styles, and of course - more Zombies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endicott Epidemic: Infectious Contagion will also be expandable with new card packs including advanced Zombies and Zombie Bosses, Upgraded Weapons, New Items, and objective-based area cards that augment the gameplay to make the already intense battle against the Undead even MORE exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Mechanics/Design and Artwork by Douglas Harvey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
