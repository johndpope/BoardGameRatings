							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slippery Slope</name>
									
			<description>The Slippery Slope is a board game designed to help players open up and deal with their emotions and feelings that are associated with the grief they feel when separated, going through a divorce or living through the aftermath of a single parent family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects either a frog, race car or person, and starts moving down the slope.  The slope is labeled for the stages you go through &amp;ndash; Denial, Bargaining, Depression, Forgiveness, and Acceptance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives one Grace Card at the beginning of the game.  As each player rolls the die they will move 1, 2,or 3 spaces.  As they move ahead they will have to either select an Action Card (a question designed to ask &amp;ndash; What would you do&amp;hellip;) or a Feelings Card (a question designed to ask &amp;ndash; How would you feel&amp;hellip;)  Every now and then they may land on a miss a turn or move ahead or behind space.  Depending on their roll, they may also acquire additional Grace Cards.  The Grace Cards can be used at any time if they select a question they may choose to pass on.  First one to reach Acceptance wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
