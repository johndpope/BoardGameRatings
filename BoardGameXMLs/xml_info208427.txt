							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Guide to the Border Princedom of El Valle Eterno</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El Valle de la Vida y de la Prosperidad Eternas (usually just called El Valle Eterno) is one of the rarer examples of the Border Princedoms in that it has been relatively stable for almost two centuries. In part, this is because the region&amp;rsquo;s current Prince is one Felipe Lopez, a vampire of Estalian origin whose wisdom and experience far surpasses most men. Also, Felipe has shown considerable ruthlessness in the two centuries of his reign, but he has mainly directed his cruelty towards his enemies, rather than the mortals who inhabit and support his Princedom. Felipe&amp;rsquo;s leadership, economic wisdom and the protection he has given from external threats has benefited El Valle Eterno and its people, and they have long supported him, even to the extent of providing him with their own blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the PDF is formatted &amp;quot;two-up&amp;quot; for booklet printing.  The PDF has 8 pages; a printed and folded booklet would have 16 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
