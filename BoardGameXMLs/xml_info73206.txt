			<description>In this color decoding, star gathering, trick playing game you gotta be the first to match your various colored Star Cards with the Code dealt and use special PLAY cards, switch abilities and Black Wild cards to change the round in your favor. Obtain five wins and the game is yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Color-Coded is simple to learn! Each player is given a specific code of colored stars they need to match using the colored cards in their hand. Match the code and you move on to the next, match five and you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special cards to help tip the balance in your favor. Use the Black Wild Cards which can be used for any card in your code. PLAY cards grant abilities like switching, trading, and even destroying your other players hand and code! When nothing else can be done, you can at least tempt fate by using SWITCH, which forces all players to choose a card from their hands and pass it to their left, maybe the card you need is just around the corner?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best part is no matter where you are in the game, additional people can join in the fun! Simply deal then a hand and give him a code. Who knows, the winner may have just arrived!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     of Players: 2-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Time: 45 min.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;    * Star Cards Deck (80 cards)&lt;br/&gt;    * Code Cards Deck (40 cards)&lt;br/&gt;    * Color-Coded Rules Document&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
