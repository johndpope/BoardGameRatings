			<description>This building game is about the Cape Kennedy shuttle base. Each player has 25 parts (each in his color) in which he has to create a construction so that the shuttle can be launched. The player who completes the construction first wins the game. In the game, which has very simple mechanics, a die is used to determine if a part may be build. The die has colors on it, matching the 4 color of the players and 2 other color. When a die roll matches a color the part may be build. The game can be played from the young age of 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
