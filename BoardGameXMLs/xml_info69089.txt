			<description>From the Editorial Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When thinking about locations that should be useful for any V&amp;amp;V campaign, some types of locations jump out. One clear choice was the police station recently offered, while others are still in the discussion or preparation stages of development.When Dave Woodrum suggested a tabloid newspaper with its offices, the overall usefulness of the suggestion absolutely jumped out. As editor at FGU, I could not help but remember how original V&amp;amp;V designer Jack Herman would always check out (and sometimes purchase) tabloid newspapers in supermarkets. Jack had always commented on how such tabloids provided plot ideas for adventures. Plot ideas, possible or probable contacts with heroes and villains, alien abductions and possible secret invasions, rumors of strange doings and events - what could be more in tune with the needs of any ongoing V&amp;amp;V campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tabloid project includes more than the expected floor plans to an office structure and more than even the hoped for information and stats on interesting staffers with knowledge of and contacts with super-powered beings. It includes tons of adventure seeds in the form of stories extracted from the pages of the tabloid. Even tabloid covers are included (copies can be given to players) serve as lead-ins to new adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all hope that this adventure location will serve as a springboard for new adventuring and as an information source when clues dry up for the player-heroes. After all, when a new villain group begins to create havoc in any community, those who hope to restore tranquility and order need to find out as much as possible about the&lt;br/&gt;doers of evil, their habits, their pasts, and their apparent goals. What better source of information is there than a news organization that is especially interested in compiling such information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the third in a series of free PDF downloads that herald a new line of V&amp;amp;V products from Fantasy Games Unlimited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Truth Seeker Weekly News contains a GM's Map and a Player's Map of a tabloid newspaper office, a key to all of the locations (each with its own description), along with a listing of the staff of the facility and their game stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supplement also contains, not surprisingly given the location, stats and information about &amp;quot;Grey&amp;quot; aliens, and how the might be brought into a V&amp;amp;V campaign. The authors have taken the time to write dozens of small tabloid-style articles which are included throughout the supplement. They've also designed a number of full-page tabloid covers usable as player handouts sure to add color to any campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
