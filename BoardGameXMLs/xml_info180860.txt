			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elf Feats is our latest Mythic Mini devoted to the graceful and mysterious race of elves, long-lived and wise yet distant and sometimes aloof, and their half-elven kin that forever span two disparate worlds, doing so with their own brand of elan. This product contains 14 mythic feats for your nigh-immortal epic elves, Elven Battle Training and Guardian of the Wild to Seen and Unseen and Half-Drow Paragon! !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Minis are short, inexpensive products designed to take one rules concept or set of Pathfinder RPG rules and bring them to you in a new way for the mythic rules, including converting existing rules as well as introducing entirely new rule options. Created by the same designers that helped bring you the official mythic rules, Mythic Minis skip the fluff and give you all crunch, all the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knows mythic like Legendary Games, and whether it's new mythic feats, class abilities, path abilities, magic items, or anything else, every Mythic Mini delivers a delicious dollop of dazzling design that will fill out your mythic experience one slice at a time. Check for a new Mythic Mini every Monday to make your game just a little more Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
