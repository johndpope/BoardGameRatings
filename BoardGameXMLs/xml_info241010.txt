			<description>CHAKRA. Sanskrit. n. &amp;quot;ring&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;wheel.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chakra is a turn-based two-player strategy game descended from Go, a game of creating life through structure. Chakra is a game of territory, capture, and flow that exercises and improves your lateral thinking, spatial reasoning, serialization, and more. You will learn how to extend, trade-off, circumnavigate, and consolidate gains along subtle curves and beautiful shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of game pieces (stones): black and white. Black plays first and traditionally played by the the less experienced player. Like Go, each stone is placed on an intersection of crossing lines. Unlike Go, the board is made up of twelve interlocking circles and an outer rim that functions as a thirteenth circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's goal in Chakra is to create as much &amp;quot;living territory&amp;quot; as possible by the game's end. Players create living stone groups by connecting chains of stones around two or more &amp;quot;eyes&amp;quot; (empty intersections). In each turn, a player will optionally pass or place a stone on an empty intersection, after which liberties are counted and any captures removed. The player may then choose to slide another stone on either of the two circles it resides on, with stones of either player blocking movement. Liberties and captures are then counted a second time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
