							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer Attack: War in Russia</name>
									
			<description>Panzer Attack: War in Russia is a fast-paced, easy to learn, deck building, card game that captures the epic scope of World War 2 combat on the Eastern Front.  The core game abstractly simulates the war between Germany and the USSR between 1941 and 1945, and the territory cards included allow players to fight along Army Group Center's path between Berlin and Moscow. Additional add-on modules add more cards for greater customization possibilities, and open up new campaign options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses deckbuilding aspects that allow players to customize their deck to fit their preferred play style, and features play that only requires the cards themselves in order to play a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to either destroy all of your opponent's forces in play, or capture all territories on the board. This is done using troop and unit cards that represent the troops, equipment and historical units that fought in the war, in addition to action and leader cards that add variability and an extra layer of strategy to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
