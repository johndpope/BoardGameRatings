							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Know Islam Know Peace Board Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is easy to learn and simple to play. Each player or team selects one of the yellow game boards. One player identified as the &amp;quot;caller&amp;quot; selects a blue information card and reads the Islamic term or name at the top. Players that have the word on their boards are asked to define or describe the importance of the Islamic practice, person or event. If they do so correctly, they receive a chip to cover the word. The object is to be the 1st player to fill a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. There can be numerous variations to the standard play to accommodate different age groups or to emphasize English or Arabic language skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More info here...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://onlineislamicstore.com/a4437.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://onlineislamicstore.com/a4437.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
