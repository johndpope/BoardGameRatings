			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in this unusual and intriguing game are &amp;quot;ghosts&amp;quot; who have give up (or lost) their physical bodies and now work as possessors, taking over the bodies of others to pursue their own goals.  One of the more intriguing aspects of the game involves the morality of the characters' actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghosts (characters) have three Attributes (Heart, Senses, Wits) that have a numeric value (1-5) assigned from a points pool.  They also have Skills with numeric values (1-8, at creation) assigned from another points pool.  Characters also have Affinities with values and a Pools structure for holding resolution dice in one or more pools.  These values may interact with the host's values depending upon the situation.  Various descriptions of the levels of ability are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
