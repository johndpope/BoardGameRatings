							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knock Out</name>
									
			<description>You try to score points by making rows as long as possible. Each player has a paper wheel with the numbers 1 to 8. First the players select a number and then it's simultaneously revealed. If any player has a number that is one step higher than the opponents then it's a knockout. (1 is a knockout on 8) If it's 2 steps higher it's a knock and if they are equal it's a clinch. When there is no knockout, knock or clinch each player puts down a marker at that number on the scoreboard. After a knockout the victim must remove all markers in that row, after a knock you don't put down a marker and if there is a clinch no player marks. It is also possible to win if you successfully ask for a knockout before the numbers are revealed. If it's not a knockout then that player that asked looses. You can't ask for a knockout if any player only has 1 or 2 markers left. When any player is out of markers the game ends and points are counted, highest wins of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
