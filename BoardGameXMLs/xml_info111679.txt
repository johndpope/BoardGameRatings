			<description>You play a mastermind, sending your agents to gather control over matters momentous and sinister. The threads come together to put a person in a place at a time. It is by such capers that you will prove your superlative &amp;hellip; mastermindery? You are not sure that's a word, but your genius cannot be contained by the bounds of vocabulary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this auction game, players bid a number of agents that they will commit to a task. The high bidder takes a card. Agents committed to taking the card eventually return. If there is a tie in the initial auction, players bid delay - an extra amount of time they are willing to wait before getting their agents back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the games included in The Revised and Expanded Decktet Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
