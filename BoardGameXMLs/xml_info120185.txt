							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FLASHBACK</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;FLASHBACK is a game about identity and the power of choice. The Players assume the roles of characters (PCs) that awaken in a strange place, with no memory of their former lives. As the game progresses, Players receive Flashbacks which represent the slow trickle of memory returning to the character. Although the cards indicate the content of the memories, it&amp;rsquo;s up to the individual Player to decide its specifics. Does the memory of committing a crime make one a criminal or is it the choices made from here that matter most?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
