							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows in Focus: City By Shadow - Metr√≥pole</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Is Not for You&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metr&amp;oacute;pole was not built with shadowrunners in mind. Or even metahumans, for that matter. In the Awakened country of Amazonia, the great dragon Hualpa reigns, critters walk the streets under full protection of the law, and the people struggle to figure out how they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to fit into this huge mess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And huge it is. With many kilometers of coastline, thousands of tangled streets, and millions of residents, the city is packed with power, money, and intrigue&amp;mdash;everything shadowrunners need to do their work. Yeah, the job might come with a slightly elevated chance of becoming dragon food&amp;mdash;if that worries you, maybe the work down South America way is not for you. But if you have enough courage and an appetite for the strange, Metr&amp;oacute;pole is a great way to fill it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metr&amp;oacute;pole is a guide to a fascinating section of the Sixth World, with information on the city, the powers within it, and the plots that will entangle shadowrunners. With NPCs, critter stats, and even a life module for Metr&amp;oacute;pole natives, the book has all you need to experience this massive sprawl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
