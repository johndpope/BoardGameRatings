							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warband</name>
									
			<description>Warband is a skirmish game based on the Hundred Kingdoms Mass Combat System.  Using similar rules to the mass combat system, Warband allows new players to get a taste of the system without committing to purchasing an army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective in Warband is to maintain control of a strategic point on the battlefield for a set number of turns (usually 5) or destroy all of your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Warband, each individual miniature is a unit, each unit may receive only one command each turn, unless modified by a spell or special ability.  Possible commands are&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Non-combat Movement&lt;br/&gt;2. Charge into Melee Combat&lt;br/&gt;3. Melee Combat&lt;br/&gt;4. Missile Combat&lt;br/&gt;5. Rally&lt;br/&gt;6. Disengage&lt;br/&gt;7. Sorcery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to these commands, you may have to deal with the mandatory command Retreat.  Each player in turn issues all commands to his forces, resolves all effects, then play passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warbands are built using a point based system, before play begins players choose their Kingdom, and may only marshal forces from that Kingdom.  Full rules, army lists, and point costs are downloadable for free at the company website. While Black Orc would of course prefer you bought your minis from them, the game can be tried out with the miniatures you have on hand, and the downloaded information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxed sets contained everything to get started, including&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule book&lt;br/&gt;Testors acrylic paints and paint brush&lt;br/&gt;Miniatures painting guide&lt;br/&gt;Flexible ruler&lt;br/&gt;Two 20 sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bushido Clan Strike Force consisting of&lt;br/&gt;a. Ashigaru Spearman&lt;br/&gt;b. Bushido Bowman&lt;br/&gt;c. Samurai&lt;br/&gt;d. Geisha Assassin&lt;br/&gt;e. Wuxia Warrior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Panthera Tribe hunting party consisting of&lt;br/&gt;a. Jaguar Javelin Thrower&lt;br/&gt;b. Jaguar Archer&lt;br/&gt;c. Tiger Swordsman&lt;br/&gt;d.
