			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Four noble houses compete for land in a struggle of power and glory. Strategically claim your territory while obstructing your enemies as you fight for reigning dominance. Use the grid to your advantage and become victor in the game of Town Squares.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Town Squares is a card game for 2-4 players. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun, easy to learn, competitive strategy game in which players take turn placing cards to earn points while at the same time taking points away from others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the decks are shuffled each time, and you get to decide where you are placing them in the layout of the game, every game is different and individual. You will never play the same one twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games with 2 players tend to be fast and furious - about 5 to 10 minutes in length. More players add to this time and games with 4 players can be from 10 - 20 minutes in length. You could have a quick game anywhere you like as it&amp;rsquo;s highly portable: on a table at a cafe, on a coffee table at home, or on a blanket at the beach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
