							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: Gladiators</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solaris VII, Noisiel, Westerhand, Astrokaszy&amp;mdash;these are just a few of the so-called Game Worlds of the Inner Sphere. As the Word of Blake&amp;rsquo;s shadow of terror recedes from the worlds where warriors did battle for the little more than entertainment and profit, the arenas have once more come to life with the cheers of spectators and the clash of high-tech gladiators. Yet even as these modern champions wage wars in the controlled chaos of the dueling circuit, new technologies continue to advance. Eager stables and warriors employ the latest in prototype designs, seeking any edge they can find against their competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Tech Readout: Gladiators samples the custom designs that have appeared in the arenas of the BattleTech universe during the Jihad. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake continues. These technologies&amp;mdash;first described in Tactical Operations&amp;mdash;now face their live-fire trials in the arenas of the various Game Worlds. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, and battle armor units, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
