							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reclaiming the Caves on the Borderlands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been a year since those insipid heroes from the Keep had cleared out the caves for their own purposes.  They've now been cleaned up and are home to dozens of miners and their families as a vein of silver was discovered.  Well, it's time to take them back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reclaiming the Caves on the Borderlands is an adventure where you play the role of humanoids (orcs, goblins, etc) or traditional races as mercenaries.  You must compete against other humanoid factions in an attempt to reclaim the caves for yourselves.  How you do that is up to you.  Do you ally with another faction?  Do you manage to gain control of the caves before the Keep's forces manage to rally an attacking force?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is compaitble with the 5th edition of the world's most famous role-playing game.  So shake up your traditional dungeon crawl with something different.  Most of the individual caves are not predetermined for you.  Instead, use the tables as a guide, or just come with your own inhabitants to stock the dungeon which whatever feels best for your interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
