			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;It began with a simple scientific mission to an exotic world at the edge of civilization. Now the survey team is overdue and all attempts to contact them have failed. To make matters worse the company who sent them has overextended itself and is unable to deploy a rescue team of their own. Time is running out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solution is as simple as it is desperate. Within hours a call goes out over the Hypernet for a team of skilled adventurers to venture beyond the Outer Colonies to make contact with the missing survey team. The pay is much better than usual as is the chance to make a name for yourself. So it all comes down to this, will you and your team dare to venture beyond the safety of the Outer Colonies and out into the Deep Range?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
