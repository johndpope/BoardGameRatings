							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Final Bug</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a stranger dies in a chamber that can't be entered, in a way that can't happen, and for no apparent reason, authorities call in YOU, Sebastian Cord, the Orion Foundation's top Special Intelligence agent, to help solve the case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that single mysterious death helps Cord uncover a far more sinister scheme - one that could destroy humanity by turning people into mindless slaves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this CATACOMBS style adventure book, you enter a world of espionage filled with gadgets, guns, and genetic glitches. To complete your assignment, you must explore the rooms of a secluded laboratory, interpret clues found in the special pocket* at the back of the book, avoid or fight off guards, and locate and destroy the creation known as THE FINAL BUG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE FINAL BUG is an illustrated solo operations casebook based but not dependent on the TOP SECRET/S.I. role-playing game system. It is a complete game adventure by itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     By using keen Special Intelligence skills, you'll uncover the evidence to help exterminate THE FINAL BUG. The unique CLUE POCKET in the back cover of this book holds hands-on clues - a photograph, a computer printout, a letter, a brochure, a news clipping, and more! They'll brinq you closer to the solution than you may want to get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
