			<description>This is a set of tactical rules for gun-fights and shoot-outs in the setting of the American Wild West.  The gun-fights take place as a table top miniature game which uses 25mm scale miniatures.  The rules cover everything that is needed to play including character design and stats, scenario creation and even rules for campaign games.  There are floor plans included in the rule book, or the game master can create their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battles can take place outdoors for example in the middle of a western town, or even indoors, such as in saloons, banks, etc.  Once each player has his character or gang of characters, then each player takes turns moving and firing at each other until there is one player (or team) remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
