			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(This product) reflect(s) a time when the world was entering a golden age of adventure.  In our world of the 1930's, the use of gasoline was viewed as too dangerous for personal use.  It was considered too volatile to use for any other reason than for bombs.  The world stayed with steam power.  Society used steam for everything, from generating energy to power a city to the transportation of people and goods.  The advances in steamology paved the way for &amp;quot;steamplugs&amp;quot;, which are used as a replacement for our gasoline.  When your steamplug needs to be replaced, just pull it out and put in a new one.  Planes gather moisture from the air and ships pull up water and convert it to power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empire City is home to the famed Caldorian Explorers Society, which has its headquarters at the top of the Empire Trust Building.  Emerging onto the world scene now is villainy that has its hands in the future.  New technology is appearing and what was once considered science fiction is beginning to become reality.  Gadgets supplement a hero's inventory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not confuse the term &amp;quot;Hero&amp;quot; for someone with super powers.  The heroes of this age are normal people doing heroic feats out of love and loyalty to their beloved United Republic of America and their E.U.R.O.P.A. allies.  When someone tries to destroy the world through their own dominating ideas, it will be you and your friends who will stand in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a world of the pulp-hero, but with a twist.  Robots and ray guns are not imaginative toys, they are real weapons that confront the world daily.  So grab your jet-pack, &amp;quot;Typewriter&amp;quot; machine gun and buckle up for a ride down an alternate reality in the world that we call &amp;quot;Hardened Heroes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
