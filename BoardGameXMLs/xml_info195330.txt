			<description>Doppelt und Dreifach is an abstract card game by an anonymous author. It consists of cards numbered 2-15, with higher numbers being rarer. Each player holds six cards at the beginning. In clockwise order, players play one card each. If it is higher than any other card currently on the table, the lower card is discarded and the player who had played it has to draw a new card. However, if two or more players play the same number, the card values are cumulated. When it's a player's turn and their card is still in front of them, they can discard it without redrawing. First player(s) to get rid of their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doppelt und Dreifach was anonymously sent to various people in March, 2016. The rules or the box give no hint at the identity of the designer, publisher or point of origin. In July, Friedemann Friese revealed that he was the designer (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/210813/futschikato-story-must-be-told&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/210813/futschikato-story-...&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
