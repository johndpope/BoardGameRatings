			<description>A multi-use card game. This East German game was probably intended to be educational as well as fun. There are 12 sets of three, each card in a set having the same letter in the bottom corner. The three cards are related i.e. A sheep, a ball of wool and a jumper makes up the set F. In addition there is a Clever Child Card and a Schwarzer Peter card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various uses of the cards are described. You could play as a quartett game (as a game of Authors in America), the one collecting the most sets of three will be the winner. Or you could play as a Schwarzer Peter (Old Maid) game, the one finishing with the Schwarzer Peter card being the loser. If the parents thought that losing was harsh, then you could play a 'White Peter', the child having the Clever Child gard at the end being the winner. And you could play it as a quiz game where the parent will reveal one card of a set and ask the children in turn to name another card they might expect to see. If they can, they get the card and so on, the one with the most cards at the end being the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
