			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai (ドラゴンボールZ 真武道会,  Doragon Bōru Zetto Shin Bud&amp;ocirc;kai, Dragon Ball Z: True Tournament) is a fighting  video game part of the Dragon Ball Z franchise, developed by Dimps and released in North America on March 7, 2006. The game's story mode is based on the events of the movie Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. The choices the player makes in the story determine how the story evolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another mode is the Arcade mode, a single player mode that lets you brawl against the CPU in order to fight and gain the Dragon Balls. Next is the Z trial mode, which consists of two different types of play: survival, where you fight against CPU-controlled opponents for as long as you can, and time attack, where you see how fast you can make it through a predetermined set of opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s the Profile Card mode in which the players will have their in-game character profile cards that lists their name and power level. The player can design their own card and customize them with the items from the game's item store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
