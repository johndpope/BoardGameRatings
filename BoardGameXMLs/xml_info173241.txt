							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What The Fact</name>
									
			<description>What the Fact (WTF) is an outrageously fun, quick &amp;amp; easy (like your mom) party game. Dice make the game about the players &amp;amp; what you'll post on social media to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player selects a black card and rolls the dice to find out which player the card is about. Each of the other players turn in a gray card that fills in the blank and completes the fact. The person giving the most outrageous card wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice symbol represents whichever name came up on the dice.  Where it gets even more interesting: if you roll a &amp;quot;WTF&amp;quot;, the card is up for grabs! The symbol then represents YOUR OWN NAME and the first person to post the phrase online gets the point. This could lead to some interesting What The Fact moments!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
