			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lank Boars are long-legged creatures combining the worst aspects of bear and swine. They have long, curling snouts, bristly, boar-like bodies and long legs with clawed three-toed paws. They stand six to eight feet at the shoulder and are nine to ten feet long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lank Boars are omnivorous and will eat nearly anything. They prefer to get their meat from carcasses, but aren&amp;rsquo;t above killing smaller animals -and people- if they&amp;rsquo;re hungry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lank Boars most often appear in temperate forests with fae populations. Though they aren&amp;rsquo;t much smarter than a clever dog, their proximity has left them predisposed to defend fae and have a natural affinity for their environment. Despite this connection, they&amp;rsquo;re very susceptible to corruption, and dark magic tends to turn them foul long before other creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
