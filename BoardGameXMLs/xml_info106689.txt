							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tank Force</name>
									
			<description>Tank Force is a multi-directional shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1991. It is the sequel to Battle City, released 6 years earlier, which is a sequel to Tank Battalion, released 11 years earlier than Tank Force. It is sometimes called Tank Battalion Arrangement for the way 2-player simultaneous is available (and up to 4 can play in some versions) and similar graphics to the Arrangements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is very much like Tank Battalion except that this time 2-4 players can play simultaneously, there are several types of enemy tank and there are powerups that can be collected to increase your tank's firepower and boost your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tank Force&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
