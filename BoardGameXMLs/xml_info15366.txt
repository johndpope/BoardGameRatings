							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gargoyles Audio Cassette Game</name>
									
			<description>This game, based on the animated TV show, is actually two games-in-one. Side A of the audio cassette is used for the game on one side of the board, and Side B is used for the game on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game #1 is a track game in which players try to find the Grimorum Arcanorum, an ancient magic spell book that is hidden somewhere in New York City. The audio tape narrates the story and tells the players how far to move and whether it's day or night. Players flip a Transformation Disk to see if they are allowed to move that turn (depending on if they're turned to stone). The first player to reach the spell book at the end of the track is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game #2 is a dexterity game in which the villains have stolen computer disks that would let them create Gargoyle robots. The villain targets are set up on the locations indicated on the board. Each player takes a Gargoyle Glider. Whenever the narrator identifies a target (Xanatos, Demona or The Pack) you aim at that villain and toss your glider at it. The player whose glider lands closest to the designated target takes one computer disk token. The first player to collect three computer disks wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
