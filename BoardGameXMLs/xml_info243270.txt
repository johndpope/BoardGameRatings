							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zoid Battle</name>
									
			<description>Zoid Battle (actually, Zoid Battle 2) is a set of rules I wrote when the Zoids anime became popular in the US. I wrote them mainly to play Zoid-themed games at local game conventions. The rules are written for hex-based combat (approx. 50m per hex), and not actually intended for use with your full-sized Zoids toys or models - but you can certailny have them with you at the table to act as your mascots!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
