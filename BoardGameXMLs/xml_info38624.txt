			<description>&amp;ldquo;The first English Civil War (1642 - 1645) was a power struggle between King Charles I and his royalist supporters on the one hand, and Parliament and its supporters on the other. At the battle of Marston Moor (1644) a Parliamentarian army reinforced by a Scots army decisively defeated the Royalists. It was a humiliating defeat for the dashing Prince Rupert (his poodle was among the many Royalist casualties). The battle left the Parliamentarians in control of the north of England.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per stand. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Units portrayed in the game include commanders, musketeers, pikemen, and artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
