			<description>From the Invisible City Productions website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dynamic game of gain an loss played on an ever-changing board for two to six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 10 cents and a pawn. By moving through the ever-changing board, you attempt to gain more money than your opponents. Each space has an action associated with it, which can change as the game goes on. These actions can gain you cents, cause you to lose cents, change your location on the board, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all players have passed through one of the three spaces at the end of the board. The player with the most value in change wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the parts and rules here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/88/slipmax&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/88/slipmax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
