			<description>Why not play a game where people have to correctly pair a sentence together with the words in their/there/they're hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are fairly simple, you will need to make pairs in order to gain a point. So you will have cards with sentences and a blank space. For instance; 'The boy had to grab his bike to get to _____ house.' Seems simple right? You would want to use your 'their' card. Laying it in front of you, would claim that you correctly made a pair. Not everyone will be able to pair correctly, it's human to make mistakes. If a player lays a pair that you deem incorrect that is when you play your [puh-lease card] which is pretty much you calling your friend an idiot. So the game can be rude, it really depends on who you are playing with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Each Player is dealt five card (this will include two different types; Sentences and Words)&lt;br/&gt;2. Throughout a players turn they will combine sentences with words using correct and proper grammar.&lt;br/&gt;3. If a player plays a pair that is not correct, another player may use a Puh-Lease Card to call out their play. This will either award or penalize them based off their play being correct or not.&lt;br/&gt;4. The player with the most pairs is the winner, the game ends when the last card is drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
