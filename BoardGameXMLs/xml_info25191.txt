			<description>This is a game for ages 5 and up. The box contains a board, 1 die, 24 wooden pawns (in 6 different colors) and 1 sheriff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board contains a star shaped plan. The sheriff is placed in the middle of the board. The start fields for the pawns are on the edge of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game is to get your pawns as fast as possible past the sheriff to their destination field. Each player gets 4 pawns of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When on your turn you don't have a pawn on the road, you can roll the die 3 times in order to get a &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;. If you succeed in rolling a &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; you can put one of your pawns on the first field of the road and you get an other roll. The pawn moves accordingly to the die roll, but for each &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; you roll your turn continues. On crossings you can choose to take the short trajectory across the center or to stay on the saver loop. When you end up on an occupied field, you can throw that first pawn off the board. This pawn has to start all over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sheriff can reach all pawns on the fields within the loop. If a player rolls a number that allows the sheriff to take one or more pawns, the sheriff has to be played. All pawns that are caught by the sheriff have to restart. The sheriff never beats the pawns of the player who has made the sheriff active.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as a player has his 4 pawns on his destination field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
