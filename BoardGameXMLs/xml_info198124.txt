							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beastmaster</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A big part of this class is your animal companion, not just because you both work well together, but because it's essentially a pseudo-character: similar to the eldritch horrors The Cultist can summon, it's got stats, hit points, Armor, a damage die, makes its own moves, and you build it from a list of options (it's just initially tougher and more competent, but you only get one).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you level up you can make your animal companion even stronger, gain a damage bonus against beasts, gather a pack of other animals (which mercifully use hireling rules), learn to speak telepathically with beasts (and even see through their senses or control them for a time), better refine your fighting tactics with your companion, and more: all told there are 25 advanced moves to choose from!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We didn't include any multiclassing moves, because those are the easiest to &amp;quot;design&amp;quot;, but if your GM is cool with them we could see it working very well with the ranger, druid, and even shaman (especially with the Spirit Bond move).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains three files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is a letter-sized character sheet that uses our new character sheet layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized books, one in color, the other in black and white (to make it easier to print at home if you want). They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The beastmaster class.&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons, armor (both for you and your animal companion), and dungeon gear, &lt;br/&gt;    A director's cut with questions to ask yourself when rolling up a beastmaster, explanations/clarifications for some of the moves, and an alternate move in case you wanna better focus on Bonds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
