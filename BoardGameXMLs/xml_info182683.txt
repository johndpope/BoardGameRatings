							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horn of Delmar</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s Filbar offering is an introductory level adventure pitting fresh adventurers against a variety of opponents. As they head out to make a name for themselves the young group will first need to pass by the Horn of Delmar. This mountain landmark was once home to a mighty fortress felled centuries before hand. While many have adventured to the top they have returned ravaged with injuries and reports of strange and foul creatures. This adventure features an old tower, bandits, undead, and an old dungeon complex for those who search hard enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set under the 5th edition ruleset this adventure makes for a nice start to a campaign or a useful &amp;ldquo;one-shot&amp;rdquo; adventure. This challenge takes place near mountains but is easily adaptable to any campaign or setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
