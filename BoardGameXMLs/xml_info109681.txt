			<description>From Zillions of Games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Court begins with each player having a force of twelve Peasants on the field. Each player has two Red Stones, two Blue Stones and an additional two Peasant in reserve. &lt;br/&gt; Play consist of either moving a piece on the field or placing a piece from reserve on a Peasant to form a new piece. &lt;br/&gt; Pieces move accordingly: &lt;br/&gt; PEASANT - The Peasant moves to the forward empty cell, and captures diagonally forward (like the chess Pawn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOBLE - The Noble (a stack of Peasant and Blue Stone) moves and captures like the chess Knight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLERIC - The Cleric (a stack of Peasant and Red Stone) moves and captures like the chess Bishop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BANKER - The Banker (a stack of two Peasants) moves and captures like the chess Rook. &lt;br/&gt; Captured Red Stones and Blue Stones become the property of the attacker and may be played in subsequent turns. Captured Peasants are removed entirely from the game. &lt;br/&gt; The game is lost by the player who has no Peasants on the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
