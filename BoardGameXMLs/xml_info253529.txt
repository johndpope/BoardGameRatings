							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wobble Garden</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wobble Garden is a hand-crafted arrangement of sensing springs combined with reactive lighting. Players wobble springs to interact with the installation and play games. It creates a unique visual and tactile experience and will be scaleable to a several meter large installation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of metal springs, connected with sensors and LED rings in between form a hexagonal grid. It's modular construction allows for large scale installations; the soft- and hardware are both carefully built with scalability in mind. Two Teensy Arduinos control the in- and outputs, with an additional python API and simulator running on a computer providing easy modding and opening access to other developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controller is being built as a platform to run different interactive animations and games. I am experimenting with several games at the moment, some fast and arcadey, while others are more abstract and slow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
