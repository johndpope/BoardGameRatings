			<description>Ever been with a group of people and can't decide what to eat for dinner? What's For Dinner? is a light and fast game designed to cleanse the palate, inspire hungry players, and bring friends and family to the table. Grab meals that match your cravings and traits before other players snatch them, or you might go without.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt three dining trait cards, discards one card, keeps one hidden, and reveals the third for all players to know what their eating trait is, e.g., vegetarian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a custom food die that represents all food groups: fruit/veggie/meat/dairy/wheat as well as bacon [fats &amp;amp; oils]. Bacon is a wild in the game, representing any of the five basic food groups as the player chooses. Each player rolls the food die during their turn to see what they crave during the round, then either acquire a matching meal card in play from the meal card pyramid of five community meal cards, or veto a specific meal card and discard that card into the dumpster (the bottom of the game box), then draw a wallet card. Wallet cards can be used during the game to purchase a corresponding meal card, better their turn, or impact another player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get the most meal points as others decide to go along with your food choice. The game-end is triggered when the last meal card is drawn from the meal card draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
