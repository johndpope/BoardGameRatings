			<description>Farmish is a game about &amp;ldquo;co-operative&amp;rdquo; farming with limited, random resources. The Seed &amp;amp; Feed stocks a random number of seeds of differing types that they give out to poor, local farmers. These farmers all share the same land and operate as a small co-op. The only problem is that the farmers are rather insane and decide, by lottery, which plots of land each farmer tends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for 1 or more players. The materials needed are the included game board, chits, dice labels, 10 beads (tokens, chits, M&amp;amp;Ms, coins, a spinner&amp;ndash;a d10 works wonderfully here.) to keep track of which turn you&amp;rsquo;re on, and 3d6. There must be one standard die with the numbers 1-6 printed on it and you need 2 blank dice (or the willingness to put labels over your standard dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score the most points after 10 rounds of game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
