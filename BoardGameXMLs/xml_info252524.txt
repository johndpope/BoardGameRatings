							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Out of Line: Food Trucks!</name>
									
			<description>All the fun of waiting in food truck lines without the actual satisfaction of tasty food. Make your enemies your friends and your friends your enemies as you jostle to be the first one served! What could be more fun than actually waiting in line? Playing a game about waiting in line!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of Line: Food Trucks is a take-that party game for 2-6 players that plays in 15-20 minutes. To start, set-up your food trucks and make some lines. Once the initial lines are formed with foodies, the players add themselves to the back of the line. Then the game is simply a backstabbing race to the front of the line and be the first player to be served completely. Out of Line: Food Trucks is a blend of strategic positioning, card play, and pure dumb luck, where you shouldn't be afraid to cut in line or use distractions to your favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn consists of 3 easy steps:&lt;br/&gt;    1. Roll a dice and move that line up &lt;br/&gt;    2. Take an action (play a card, move to the back of a line or just discard a card)&lt;br/&gt;    3.  Draw your hand back up to three cards&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Player cards allow you to do things like:&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; Move a player to the end of a line&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; Force a player out of line&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; Let a foodie cut into the front of the line&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; Add a food(ies) to the end of a line&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; Temporarily close down a food truck&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; Stop another player from playing a card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
