							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">La 11 Coffee &amp; Tea Party</name>
									
			<description>In the caf&amp;eacute; La Once, there is a special activity each year in which the guests must play about their food. Only those who play out the finals will be served the tastiest food in a special room. The (fictional) caf&amp;eacute; has now decided to publish the game that is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In La 11 Coffee &amp;amp; Tea Party, players have to collect sets of the same cards to grab the sweet dishes on the table. For two of the same card, one may take the corresponding dish from the center of the table; for three of the same, one may steal it from another player. When a player has collected the three dishes in their secret mission card, that player wins. Special cards spice up the game flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than being packaged in a box, the game comes in a cookie bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
