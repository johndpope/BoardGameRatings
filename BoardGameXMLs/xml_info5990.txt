			<description>Blood &amp;amp; Iron: The Battle of Koniggratz, 1866, was the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War, in which the Kingdom of Prussia defeated the Austrian Empire. Taking place near K&amp;ouml;niggr&amp;auml;tz and Sadowa in Bohemia on 3 July 1866, it was an example of battlefield concentration, a convergence of multiple units at the same location to trap and/or destroy an enemy force between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some extensive rules for cavalry charges, artillery, morale loss, and weather effects.  The game also includes a number of 'what if?' scenarios which include alternate orders of battle as well as the historical one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game length and victory conditions are determined by the scenario being played.  Victory usually relies on capture of geographical objectives and/or elimination of opponent's forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first published as a supplement to Command Magazine Issue #21 Mar-Apr 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with 3W's Blood and Iron, this game is a two-player wargame covering the battle of Koniggratz (3 July 1866), the decisive battle of the 7 Weeks War between Austria and Prussia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 500 yards / 457 meters&lt;br/&gt;Units: Brigade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full-color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (240 1/2&amp;quot; counters - 200 for Blood &amp;amp; Iron, 6 for Tet '68 &amp;amp; 34 for Gettysburg)&lt;br/&gt;One 24-page Blood &amp;amp; Iron rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One 12-page Lost Victory Study Booklet (Designers Notes)&lt;br/&gt;Two 4-page dual-side printed Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;One 10-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 2-12 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
