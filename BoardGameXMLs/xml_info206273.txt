			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our world is passing through an invisible storm of snarls in the fabric of reality. Attracted by consciousness thought, these anomalies grant abnatural power to the minds capable of harnessing them. Minds like yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the anomalies you can perceive glimpses of higher dimensions, gain understanding and control of the principle forces of our reality, reshape your surroundings, and conceive of impossible creations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The priceless secrets tearing through your mind grant the power to make your deepest desires reality, but at a cost. If you channel this power, use it, you can do anything but you will lose your connection to the world you&amp;rsquo;ve remade to suit you. And you are not alone in this power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are others, grappling as you are with what to do next, and none of you have time to waste. Corporations, religious fanatics, cold-eyed moguls, bright-eyed ideologues, and a whole Scrabble-set's worth of acronymed government agencies will do anything to chain you to their purposes, and shape you into tools fit for use before you burn out or go mad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a living arcane engine. What will you make of your world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During early development this game was titled The Arcane Engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
