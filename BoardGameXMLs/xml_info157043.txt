			<description>Munchkin Dungeon: Warehouse 23 is a promotional item from Steve Jackson Games that can be used with any Munchkin expansion that contains Dungeons. This item is larger than other Dungeons (6&amp;quot;x4&amp;quot; instead of 4.4&amp;quot;x3.3&amp;quot;) and is meant to be kept separate from them. Its text reads:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any player may choose to put Warehouse 23 into play instead of drawing a Dungeon from the deck. You can never be quite sure what you'll find when you get a box from Warehouse 23! Whenever you are about to draw Treasure as a result of combat, roll the six-sided die and consult this table:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 or less - Forget what you were supposed to be drawing, and take one Treasure.&lt;br/&gt;    2 - Draw one Treasure fewer than you otherwise would have.&lt;br/&gt;    3-4 &amp;ndash; Draw Treasure normally.&lt;br/&gt;    5 - Draw one Treasure more than you otherwise would have.&lt;br/&gt;    6 or more - Draw twice the number of Treasures you otherwise would have. Score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you discard Warehouse 23, put it in the box and forget you ever saw it. Even if several players have Warehouse 23, it can still only show up once per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
