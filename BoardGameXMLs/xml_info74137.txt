			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wargames 2: Superspies and Commandos of the Cold War details secret agent characters and organizations within the Cold War superhuman timeline of the Wargames universe for M&amp;amp;M Superlink&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the 80s and 90s, a period when espionage stories were hugely popular in movies, TV, and print, it seems that in superhero comics, spies occupied the role of a &amp;quot;red shirt&amp;quot; from a beloved sci-fi franchise- at best, they served as set dressing and at worst, they got smacked down to raise the dramatic stakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Wargames, we're imaging an Iron Age the way we would have wanted it. One where the super-spy and commando characters that languished for so long are given interesting plotlines interwoven with Cold War tensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wargames 2 has seven superspy organizations including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S.H.E.R. (The United States Headquarters for Emergency Response): U.S.H.E.R. is the primary American agency for superhuman affairs and also boasts a formidable brigade of power armor. After the emergence of the Iron Curtain, U.S.H.E.R. transitioned into the new mission of monitoring and opposing the Communist threat and established itself as the American security agency that would deal with threats too powerful and strange for conventional forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shutrmovik: Shturmovik serves as the &amp;quot;power armor&amp;quot; branch of the Soviet military, in addition to functioning as an independent military intelligence agency. Its operatives are deployed to support Soviet military and intelligence operations, to carry out covert information gathering and sabotage missions, to assist with super-crime emergencies in the Eastern Bloc, and occasionally in support of the People's Revolution superteam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.H.A.N.T.O.M. (The Philanthropic Harmony Association for National Treaties, Order, and Militarism): P.H.A.N.T.O.M.'s founding ideal is avoiding the horrors of global war by instituting a world government with themselves firmly in control. In addition to ruling the small European nation of Ruritania, P.H.A.N.T.O.M. is a puppetmaster that controls more than a dozen countries from the shadows, with influence over several dozen more. The organization recruits from intelligence agencies, militaries, governments, and criminal organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foundation for World Harmony: With legions of operatives wielding high technology gadgets, the Foundation for World Harmony is an independent global security organization established and financed by the UN, with the mission of securing global political order in general, and specifically to oppose P.H.A.N.T.O.M. in its goal of world domination. It is international in both scope and make-up. The nations of the world, Eastern Bloc and Western Bloc, First World, Second, and Third World all provide resources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Directorate: Led by the enigmatic Supreme Commissar, the Red Directorate is the primary Soviet agency for the oversight of superhuman affairs. It monitors metahuman and supernatural threats to the Soviet Union. It oversees the Soviet super-soldier creation program and is charged with monitoring the Eastern Bloc population and recruiting all metahumans it discovers into government service. It functions as the supersoldier branch of the Soviet military machine, providing superhuman support to military and intelligence missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stonehenge: This ancient organization is charged with guarding the magical artifacts of Great Britain and defending the nation and the world against super-natural threats - be they otherworldly or merely Soviet in origin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourth Reich: The Fourth Reich was founded during the last days of the Second World War by a group of Nazi super-soldiers and cultists. From the safety of a secret Antarctic base, the Fourth Reich plots revenge against the Allies and the restoration of their empire across Europe and eventually its expansion across the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wargames 2 includes over a dozen fully stated NPC and amazing secret base maps for several of the organizations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
