							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cup Final (Harris)</name>
									
			<description>Cup Final is a soccer board game, played on a 30x50 grid.  Each player has 11 footballers on the board, which exert a zone of control which is used to intercept the ball.  The ball is moved by means of dice throw which tells you how many squares the ball moves, and the direction type (e.g. diagonally).  The board is also divided into 6 zones, and when the ball is moved into a new zone, an Action Card is drawn which may make you lose possession, or allow you to move the ball through ZoCs.  Every five minutes the players are allowed to redistribute their footballers around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
