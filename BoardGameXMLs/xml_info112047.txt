							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enlightened Scholar</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you know a thing, to realize that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it: this is knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Kung Fu Tse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sagacious master of esoteric knowledge and inscrutable methods, the enlightened scholar searches for both mundane and arcane secrets. In motivation, he ultimately seeks to understand the universe. The method differs from one enlightened scholar to another. One may wish to become truly enlightened to join with the universe while another may desire the secret to immortality for purely selfish reasons. Another may simply want to serve his people through applied knowledge. The enlightened scholar actively works to apply what he knows to the problems at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enlightened Scholar is a new base class converted from Heroes of the Jade Oath; part monk, part alchemist, and part mage, this class is an evocative and unique creation now wholly compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
