			<description>The Spirits of Carter Mansion is a Social Deception Microgame where you are the Spirits that Haunt the large estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The neighbours child has kicked their Soccer ball in through the upstairs window of the estate your spirit has been trapped in, and your fellow spirits are in turmoil as to what to do. The good spirits want to help the kid navigate the ever shifting rooms of the old house, where as the more sinister spirits are trying to sneakily lure them into the basement to never return...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spirits of Carter Mansion is an 18 card game, where players navigate through the different rooms of the mansion, and use their unique effects to inch closer or further from their goal. In order to enter a room, you must convince the other players that your room is the best choice, and convince that you are in fact a good spirit. Beware of the treachery of the evil spirits trying to convert other players to their sinister ways, or their deceptive words, as they try and steer the neighbours child towards the basement. &lt;br/&gt;Each turn players will play a card from their hand which represents a room for the child to travel into, each player then makes a case for why their room should be picked, and the chosen room is then navigated into. Evil Spirits will try and trick the group into journeying into the basement, whilst good spirits must try and maintain justice and level-headed thinking through the rooms.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends once either victory condition is met, the Good players must travel, and retrieve the Soccer Ball, and return to the entrance, whilst the Evil team must journey into the Basement (however if the basement is entered with the Soccer Ball, the ball is lost in another room, and good gets another chance to continue!). If either Victory condition is met, all the players of that alignment win!&lt;br/&gt;Spirits of Carter Mansion relies on clever bluffs, subtle team work, social deception and Luck for players to successfully navigate the perils of the haunted estate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
