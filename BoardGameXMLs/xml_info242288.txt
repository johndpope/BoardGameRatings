							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gravity Stones</name>
									
			<description>Day 1: It has been confirmed that what is now called &amp;quot;gravity stones&amp;quot; arose last night. Crystalline rock formations levitate in mid-air, resulting in a great decrease in the gravity around them.The potential benefits are enormous and the seven days we have to study them won't be wasted, be sure of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravity Stones is a development and optimization game with multiple choices in a brief playing time. The game plays over the course of seven rounds. Each round, a simultaneous first phase allows the players to play cards from their hand on the action side or on the resource side, also discarding one of them onto the central (company)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second phase is individual, and starts with the first player, who uses their actions and resources (if needed) to establish a camp on the mountain, to study the stones, or to construct ZeroG tools from them. Once your actions are spent, you can either recover one of the cards left by the players or leave them; you will be punished or rewarded based on your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its intertwined actions and grant system, Gravity Stones allows you to augment your base actions with the stones you get back from the central board. The company that's hired you will also give you objectives to fulfill...or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
