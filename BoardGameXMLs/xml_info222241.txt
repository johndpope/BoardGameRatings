			<description>BUILD THE HIGHEST TOWER EVER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colour Towers is a wooden board game based on the colour theory! It is an educational game for children and for the whole family. It is also an unusual gift.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS: 34 pawns made of 100% beechwood (100% FSC&amp;reg;) in 6 colours, 1 bag, 1 brochure containing the instructions and the explanation of the colour theory.&lt;br/&gt; INSTRUCTIONS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick a pawn from the bag. There are three ways to conquer the pawns on the field or on top of towers of the other players: 1. Easy: you conquer the pawns of the SAME COLOUR as the one you picked from the bag (example: if you pick a red pawn you can conquer a red pawn) if there is any free on the field or on the top of the towers of the other players. 2. Average: you can conquer pawns according to the SUM OF COLOURS, meaning that you can conquer pawns of the colours that when mixed together make the colour of the pawn you picked (example: a violet pawn can conquer red and blue pawns). 3. Advanced: you can get the pawns of the COMPLEMENTARY COLOUR of the pawn you picked. If you cannot conquer any pawn, leave the picked pawn on the field. The conquered pawns are to be piled up to form a tower. The player who build the highest tower wins the game. In the package you will find the COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS AND THE COLOUR THEORY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
