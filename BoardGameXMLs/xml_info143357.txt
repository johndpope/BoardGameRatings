			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the Graylock outback, in the mists of pre-time, dwelt THE WIZARDS, a race not native to this simple place, a race of powerful necromancers, whose awesome prowess at magic caused rampant terror in every heart that dared contemplate them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the years marched by, they each individually succumbed to the ravages of death. Some, who were the most powerful among their peers, forstalled the shadow-journey by barring themselves from the sunlight and the eyes of time, in huge towers, islands of life in the barren desert. By surrounding themselves with magic, they, for a time, held off death. But the reaper claims all, so he claimed each of The Wizards in his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last of these would-be immortals, BLACKHEART FIRETHROWER, so named through profeciency with flameballs, built a fortress so awesome as to earn a reputation of Widowmaker to the Kings. Many tried to conquer it, to dispell the dred CYCLOPS, to penetrate its inky interior and remove its secrets and treasure. None returned. Kings and paupers all perished in its traps and corridors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the Wizard's Tower, last of the surviving fortresses, and catacomb to the omnipresent undead spirit of BLACKHEART FLAMETRHOWER became known as THE TOWER OF FEAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENTER IF YOU DARE, BUT DON'T EXPECT TO EMERGE ALIVE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
