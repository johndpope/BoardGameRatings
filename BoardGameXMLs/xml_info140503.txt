			<description>A children's game from the Rupert Fun book, in 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A parent should first write some short messages, each on a separate piece of paper and give one to each player. It is important that each message should be different and yet have the same number of letters in it, say fifteen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to see which player can first cross out all the letters of his message. To do this the players take turns to shut their eyes and put the point of a pencil on the checkered squares of the game. If the pencil lands on a picture, the player must say what the object is. For example, &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rdquo; for Dog. If &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rdquo; appears on the player&amp;rsquo;s paper it can be crossed off the message. Sometimes a player will be lucky enough to land on one of the squares which contain an alphabet letter (that too can be crossed off). Should the pencil land on a blank square, the player ends his turn. The games goes on in this way until one player has all the letters of his message crossed out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some examples of ready&amp;not;made 15-letter messages which the parent can use to start the game.&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE COME TO TEA.&lt;br/&gt;DO YOU LIKE MY TOYS?&lt;br/&gt;MEET YOU TOMORROW.&lt;br/&gt;I HAVE SOME SWEETS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
