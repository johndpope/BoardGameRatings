							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bastard Baron&#039;s Hideaway</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let me start off by saying something bad about this adventure.  I don't think this adventure fully captures the Bastard Baron, Nazar.  I see him as a mid-level foe that the players have heard about for a while.  Has seen the results of the Bastard Baron's efforts and has had direct experience with one of more of his men.  The Bastard Baron with his self-righteous beliefs makes for a fun enemy to have the players go against from time to time.  While I don't think he stands up as a long term foe he definitely could be the transition from low level adventuring to mid-level adventuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end, there is a map and a key, a title to a mountain tower.  This could easily be turned into a party's stronghold.  Of course, someone may already be living in the tower, but I am sure that could be remedied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
