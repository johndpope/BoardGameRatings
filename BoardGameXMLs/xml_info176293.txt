			<description>There are 22 white cards which are shuffled and laid out as a board. Special plugs are used to hold the cards together. One of these cards is the Start space and all players put their pawn on that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 40 Piggy Cards. Their background colour determines which family they belong to. There are 4 families of 5 cards (so each family member has two cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Piggy cards are shuffled and each player is dealt 5 cards. The remaining cards are stacked in the middle of the board. The youngest player begins.&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to collect the 5 members of a family first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before a player begins to roll, he draws a card from the deck. Then he rolls the die, and moves his pawn. Whichever card he lands on, he must follow the instructions on it. He ends his turn by discarding a card, forming a discard stack.and shall finally again a card beside the stack. Players may never have more than 5 cards in hand at the end of a turn. The play continues in a clockwise direction. Whoever rolls a 6 may roll again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card-types that form the board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Chair:&lt;br/&gt;All players need to move one place to the left and leave their cards behind. Thus everyone gets a new hand in effect. The sixth card is discarded before this happens.&lt;br/&gt;Single card icon with two arrows pointing to the right:&lt;br/&gt;All players are required to pass a card to the left, without having first seen the card of the right neighbour.&lt;br/&gt;Paw Print:&lt;br/&gt;The player has to imitate an animal of their choice. Only when the other players have guessed which animal it is. Then he may discard a card.&lt;br/&gt;Die:&lt;br/&gt;The player may roll again.&lt;br/&gt;Two Arrows pointing left and right&lt;br/&gt;All players have to change direction of play, clockwise to anti-clockwise and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;Circle: &lt;br/&gt;Nothing happens.&lt;br/&gt;Start Card:&lt;br/&gt;All pawns start the game here. Should you land here during play, you get to roll again.&lt;br/&gt;Card Hand Icon&lt;br/&gt;The player draws a card from the player of his choice, and then gives any card from his hand to the chosen player.&lt;br/&gt;Exchange Icon:&lt;br/&gt;Landing here also lets you pick an opponent and exchange a card but this time the two cards are swapped face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to get all 5 members of one family, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
