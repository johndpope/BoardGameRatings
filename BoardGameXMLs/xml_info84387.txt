			<description>Goal! is a 1988 football (soccer) video game published by Jaleco for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game supports up to two players. It was released in Japan as Moero 5!! Pro Soccer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has four modes: World Cup, Tournament, Shoot Competition, and Vs. Mode. The object of the game is the same as in real football; one team must score more goals than the other to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In World Cup mode, players must choose one of sixteen international football teams and compete to advance to the finals. The teams are: Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, England, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Uruguay, United States, and the USSR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In Tournament mode, players must choose one of eight American teams and compete in a standard single elimination tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In Shoot Competition mode, players must choose one of three characters and try to score as many shots out of five as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In Vs. Mode, two human players face off against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing World Cup or Tournament mode with two players, the players can either play on the same team or against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game later spawned a series of sequels, including Goal! 2 for the NES, Goal! (Super NES) (which was released in Europe as Super Goal! in order to distinguish this game from the original) and Super Goal! 2 (SNES), which in Japan was released as Takeda Nobuhiro no Super Cup Soccer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Goal! (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
