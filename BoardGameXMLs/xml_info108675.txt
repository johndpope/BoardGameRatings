			<description>HammerLock Wrestling is considered to be Jaleco's take on professional wrestling, the game has a style geared towards Saturday Night Slam Masters. The player can choose from 12 fictional wrestlers and compete in four different modes of play. There are also 60 different moves to choose from as well as unique finishers for each wrestler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exhibition mode allows up to four different players to compete either against each other in singles match or in tag team format. There is also a round-robin tournament with six different wrestlers competing to become the league champion. A standard tournament for up to eight players is also used as an alternative to the round-robin format. Meanwhile, the Top Ranking Match puts the players against other eleven wrestlers in an arcade-like tournament to become the ultimate champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into three different screens at times. The middle part shows the current action happening in the ring while the top and bottom parts of the screen are used for close-ups of action sequences such as power moves, illegal moves and finishing maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;HammerLock Wrestling&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
