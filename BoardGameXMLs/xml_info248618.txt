							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of Entropy: In the Shadow of the Great Wall</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colorful Wuxia-drama set in ancient China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eternal dynasty was in its death throes, people whispered and glanced fearfully towards the horizon. There, beyond the Great Wall were the barbarians, living on their horses. The fierce horde had already conquered everything on its path and only the wall protected the last remnants of the dynasty. Rumors grew of a massive, definitive strike that would wipe the dynasty from the face of the earth. Raiders pillaged half-empty caravans in search of the weak to lay their hate on. Nobles withdrew into their protected castles and villas preparing for the war to come, or lived like there was no tomorrow, doing their best to forget the doomsday that was riding their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
