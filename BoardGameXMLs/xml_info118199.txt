			<description>Ultimate Baseball The Game is a strategy baseball board game for two gamers (teams).  Each gamer drafts and manages his/her team, including managing lineups, roster decisions, and ongoing game play.  Play is simulated pitch-by-pitch using an order of play and often involving simultaneous decision-making (i.e., gamers secretly makes choices simultaneously which then are made &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; and enacted on the game board).  Each virtual player that comes in the game box (240 all-time stars) as well as those included in the Ultimate Baseball The Game Player Register (over 4,000 players) are based on top picks from across the annals of American major league baseball, and are rated and ranked based on lifetime composite career stats.  Each rating (pitching, hitting, running, fielding, etc.) is based on meticulous research and heavily influences game outcomes.  These ratings, along with simultaneous pitch-by-pitch simulation and highly detailed charts and tables, afford gamers a wide spectrum of strategic options at nearly every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ultimate Baseball The Game game box includes a basic version for youngsters and beginners which takes around an hour.  Also included is the fully advanced and highly realistic game, which takes about as long as a real-life baseball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Baseball The Game is for gamers age 11 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
