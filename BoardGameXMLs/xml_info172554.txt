			<description>Fool's Dice is a simple race and gambling game where players roll dice and attempt to move their marker up a metaphorical mountain. Players initiate &amp;quot;scrambles&amp;quot; where they roll specially-designed &amp;quot;target dice&amp;quot; to create a target number, then roll &amp;quot;number dice&amp;quot; to see if they can score under that target number. If they do so, they can move their marker a specified number of steps up the mountain. They can choose to gamble and continue their &amp;quot;scramble&amp;quot; until they fail to meet their target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the target roll is not met, they will fall back to where they started at the beginning of their turn. Additionally, they must pay a penalty. These penalties are devised at the start of the game by the players and provide the &amp;quot;party&amp;quot; atmosphere, since penalties can be things like &amp;quot;Wash one dish in the sink,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Run around the room 10 times.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also have three chances to knock a player's marker back down the mountain. This action, combined with the supposed humorous nature of the penalties, provides as the box says, &amp;quot;An extremely unique and wildly intense party game for two to six players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the interior of the rule book, the first printing of this 1991 edition was of 3000 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
