			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tales of Desert Shade, First Khagan of the Dominion, are many, varied, and often made of equal parts fact and fiction. One particular tale tells of an enemy wizard that opposed him in the early days, before he declared himself Khan of Khans. According to this tale, Desert Shade was nearly defeated. He was saved by a gift from a rival of the enemy wizard: a magical scimitar and shield, which gave the First Khagan the edge to defeat his enemy and forge a kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
