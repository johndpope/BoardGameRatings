							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Aliens: The Astori</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close Encounters of the Mythic Kind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re encountering them on a distant planet in a far-off nebula, or they&amp;rsquo;ve come to you, and are abducting innocent villagers for nefarious purposes, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like a strange, alien race to help breathe some life into your galaxy&amp;mdash;and your game. Some Pathfinder products have even explored the idea of alien life in the past, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly true that many aberrations could serve as alien creatures in a pinch. But there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that Pathfinder aliens have never been until now, and that is&amp;hellip;mythic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the astori, a race of mysterious energy beings, who were once very human-like, but have since ascended to a higher plane of existence. This curious and advanced race are highly insular, but are curious about the greater cosmos around them, and send emissaries, known as exemplars, to learn about other worlds, races, and cultures. All astori have some small amount of mythic power within them, and those who embrace their mythic nature and gain mythic ranks find a greater wellspring of power than mythic members of other races. In addition to a detailed description of astori culture and background, as well as rules for astori player characters, this book contains several feats for astori characters, as well as full game statistics for a mythic astori exemplar, which can easily be included in mythic and non-mythic games alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
