			<description>Cammy is a Yahtzee variant that tries to evoke a &amp;quot;Southern feel&amp;quot; by stating in the rules that it was played on southern plantations and later by New Orleans gamblers. It also has a steamboat scene on the cover. It is different from Yahtzee mainly by the fact that 10 dice are used, and the low score wins. &lt;br/&gt;Players roll 10 dice on the first roll. On the second roll they choose which of the dice to re-roll. Same on the third roll. After 3 rolls the 10 dice are divvied up into two groups of 5 dice. Each player has a sheet of paper with 10 categories. Players choose a category to score with each of the 2 groups. Each category must be finished after the player's fifth turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
