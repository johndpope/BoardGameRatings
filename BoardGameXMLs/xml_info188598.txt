			<description>(from the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this original series of Adventure Game Books, YOU decide what they do and whether they solve the mystery or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to play the game is contained in your own Adventure Wallet. Inside it, you will find a book and a selection of playing cards including a compass, binoculars, a map, a code book and a rucksack; and in case you need refreshment, a lunchbox and picnic cards! There is even a special Famous Five dice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played over and over again, as many times as you like. For there are a variety of routes to the solution and each route involves different clues and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
