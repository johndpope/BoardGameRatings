Your mission is to destroy as many enemy units with the minimum amount of losses to your Troop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;The objective of CHOPPER WAR is to successfully complete a number of missions and destroy enemy forces in order to gain Victory Points (VP) for the US Forces.
