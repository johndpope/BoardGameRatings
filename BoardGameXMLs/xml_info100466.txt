			<description>NHL Breakaway is a new and exciting action packed 2 player strategy card game. You and your opponent draw from the deck of cards placed between you. When you go to draw cards from the pile, you will draw Player Cards (they represent the players on your team), Instant Replay Cards (intangibles which&lt;br/&gt;may momentarily affect a player or team&amp;rsquo;s performance) or Slapshot Cards (cards that have a more permanent effect on your team and the overall game).&lt;br/&gt;With the help of your Player Cards and your other cards, try to win Possession of the puck during the face-off and then to go on the Attack to score more goals than your opponent over the course of 3 periods of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
