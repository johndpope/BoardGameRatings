			<description>In this small promotional expansion an alternate city deck is provided. &lt;br/&gt;These cards can be used instead of the ones provided with the game. This deck has 10 cards in it. These could even be shuffled in for an even longer campaign of find land mines with mad cows (however, the card backs are different from those in the base game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cairo (2): Take any cow from the discard pile and play it into another player's herd.&lt;br/&gt;     Istanbul (3): You may take any number of Spies from the table into your hand.&lt;br/&gt;     London (4): Every player with at least one card in their hand passes one card to the left.&lt;br/&gt;     Los Angeles (1): Take 200 from every player.&lt;br/&gt;     Moscow (1): Draw four cards. Pass one of them to the player on your left.&lt;br/&gt;     New York (2): Take 400 from another player.&lt;br/&gt;     Paris (4): Choose a random card from the normal city deck and follow its instructions.&lt;br/&gt;     Rome (5): Every player who has at least one cow passes one cow to the left.&lt;br/&gt;     Sydney (3): Swap hands with another player.&lt;br/&gt;     Tokyo (5): Take 200 from the pot. Put any cow on the table into the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
