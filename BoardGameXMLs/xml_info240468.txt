			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Great War, more Corsicans served relative to their population than any other country working with the Entente Powers. Their casualty rate was high as well. After the war, those Corsicans who managed to return found their hometowns had also been devastated by the fighting. In some cases villages only had one survivor. In those days many where asking themselves the question, &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Mercenary Faction for Wild Skies: Europa Tempest is available for use in any Wild Skies game. Have your players dive right in with a cohesive backstory for the group, pregenerated characters, and new items and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
