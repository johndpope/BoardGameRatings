			<description>There is an inner circle and an outer one. Players move around the circles clockwise, trying to eliminate each other. An eliminated pawn (five per player) gives the attacker all the rings attached to it. When a certain number of rings are collected, they are exchanged against a silver ring; when a pawn has two silver rings, that player exchanges it for the &amp;quot;joker&amp;quot;, a special piece which moves much faster than other pieces and can move both ways. &lt;br/&gt;During the game, players try to either eliminate all others or manage to collect all player's &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; rings and deliver them to the own &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
