			<description>[From introduction of enhancement rules and from company website.]&lt;br/&gt;This model enhancement was made to provide more value to the Death Ride game series. For those who want to feel like you are really part of something bigger, these enhancements now allow a team of players to play much more like a real command staff. there are 4 primary staff sections in a military unit at Battalion and higher. They are the S1 which handles all aspects of personnel and replacements, the S2 which handles all the aspects of battlefield intelligence, the S3 who deals with the operations of the unit, and the S4 who is responsible to provide for all the supply, repair, and provisions of the fighting force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This enhancement features the need for players to provide for the supplies that keep the battle running smoothly.  This will provide some additional critical thinking to decide how to plan for moving supplies from the back to the front where they are needed and used.  It will also allow you to perform operations at full strength even when cut off, at least until your reserve supplies run out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This package provides for more detailed supply operations for the Death Ride Kursk series.  Supplies are represented as points and are stored at the supply units already in DRK and then moved around via additional supply convoys (supply trucks) as needed to support combat.  Units now can move out of supply at will and can stay in supply until the on hand stocks fall short.  This module will add a whole new dimension to the game and again has only a page of rules to digest.&lt;br/&gt; It comes with:&lt;br/&gt;(2) counter sheets&lt;br/&gt;2 page rules supplement&lt;br/&gt;Example Card&lt;br/&gt;Logistics Tables&lt;br/&gt;(2) Logistics Charts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
