			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations Colonel!&lt;br/&gt;You've just been promoted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 5150 Star Army you were a Platoon Leader in charge of three squads and with a little experience it became a company. But now all that&amp;rsquo;s changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 5150 Battalion Commander you&amp;rsquo;re in control of a battalion. Three companies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t worry; it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a learning curve so we&amp;rsquo;ll start you out with one company. Before you know it you&amp;rsquo;ll be up to speed. And you better do it quickly as there are new enemies to conquer in addition to the Hishen and Bugs from 5150 Star Army. Remember, it&amp;rsquo;s not a job, it&amp;rsquo;s an adventure and this adventure will let you play with cool new toys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for infantry, mechs, vehicles and aircraft on a larger scale.&lt;br/&gt;     A pre-generated mini-campaign linking your Missions, yet still allowing you to play one-off battles when desired.&lt;br/&gt;     Complete campaign system that rewards your successes and punishes your failures.&lt;br/&gt;     New Aliens to fight, plus the old Hishen and Bug standbys.&lt;br/&gt;     Increased gaming scale where each squad consists of two stands allowing for bigger games, while maintaining the realistic feel of men under fire found in 5150 Star Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all THW games Battalion Commander can be played solo or same-side, against the game mechanics or head-to-head against your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5150 Battalion Commander - THE Big Battle Sci-Fi Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
