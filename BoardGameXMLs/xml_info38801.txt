			<description>Footsteps of the Prophet is a game about the early succession to Khalifa, each player vying for control of Islam in the years after Muhammad's death.  it is a game of conflict, diplomacy, treachery and a little bit of luck, for two to six players who have anywhere between fifteen minutes to an hour to kill, depending on how many players there are and how cutthroat they are about their strategy.  Someone must take on the role of Khalifa, leading the faith. Can you unite the squabbling clans, pummel the Persians, beat back the Byzantines and unite the Arabian Peninsula?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More importantly, can you do it in spite of the other players?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since only six of the first twelve Khalifa died of natural causes, there are frequent openings for the position. Based on historical events and people, winning takes strategy, diplomacy, and an occasional bit of treachery. The game is notable in that it has both English and Arabic-native versions, making it one of very few US games designed expressely for an Arabic-speaking audience.
