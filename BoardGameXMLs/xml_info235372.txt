			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1986, TSR published H2: The Mines of Bloodstone. It was written by Douglas Niles and Michael S. Dobson as a sequel to H1, which was originally conceived as a stand-alone adventure. Unlike H1, The Mines of Bloodstone was not primarily designed to highlight Battlesystem Fantasy Combat Supplement, which provided rules for mass combat in the form of miniature wargaming, and instead gave DM's the option to use Battlesystem Fantasy Combat Supplement for the large-scale battles, or to have them take place off stage. H2 thus consisted of a 48-page story, with several pages of maps for battle encounters and dungeon exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this conversion guide, you will need a copy of H2: The Mines of Bloodstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
