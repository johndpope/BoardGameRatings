			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ready to play Fantasy Dice adventure for Crimson Exodus or your own fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jump right into a high tension scenario with four Orcs led by a Dwarf, or let your own party discover the ancient underground complex deep in the mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure comes bundled as a zip file with not only the full colour PDF, but high resolution maps, encounter action cards and an adventure module for playing online using Fantasy Grounds II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure comes complete with character sheets and background for a player party with conflicting motivations and strengths and weaknesses that means cooperation is key to survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The underground warren was sealed off from the mines above and so can easily be placed anywhere suitable in your own world where ancient and dangerous secrets might lurk deep underground forgotten by all if not for an old and worn map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure contains many potential encounters using the Fantasy Dice system, not least the gnashers wonderfully illustrated by Forest Immel. It is up to the players how they face or avoid these challenges, and whether they can work together to survive the horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the players navigate among the echoes of death to find a treasure worthy of the risk, or will their screams stir ancient horrors better left undisturbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the package you get two versions of the full resolution 2480x3508 pixels colour map in jpg format of the sprawling underground complex with its many secrets. Drawn by talented map maker Robert Altbauer. Both a pristine GM version and the incomplete and worn player version scribbled with dwarven runes, smudged and stained. If there is a map there must surely be treasure, otherwise why draw a map &amp;ndash; right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Action Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 12 page bonus set of illustrated cards that can be printed on normal paper or avery business card sheets for a total of 48 double sided encounter cards (also contains the 12 page free action card PDF).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Grounds II Adventure Module&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fantasy Grounds II adventure module can be used together with the free Fantasy Dice ruleset for an online virtual tabletop adventure ready to go (an appropriate Fantasy Grounds II license is required). The adventure module has encounters, items, maps, player character sheets and a fully linked adventure text index to make it easy to run the adventure and share text with the players with minimal typing. This includes GM Map &amp;quot;pins&amp;quot; which link directly to the description for each section of the map. Open the GM map and hold down CTRL to see the pins and then simply click a pin to open the description for that tunnel/cavern/room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
