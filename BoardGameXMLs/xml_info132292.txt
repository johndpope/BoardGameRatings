							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twilight Sector Starfarers Gazette #2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Starfarer's Gazette is an intermittently-published style magazine for the cutting edge 30th Century audience in Terra/Sol's Twilight. Nonetheless, this material has been designed specifi cally to be open and available for any Traveller game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So whether you are a fan of Twilight Sector, or looking for some ideas for your Traveller Campaign, lean close and lend me your ear... or other appropriate sensory appendage. As the inestimable (and anonymous) crew of the RSS Avenger would claim if they were aware of their fi ctitious state, this book is intended to be a hodgepodge of background material, rife with ideas and ready to spice up your games. Crank it up a notch, give you ideas. No, not naughty ones. Okay, maybe just you cheeky little gun-bunnies. As is always the case, feel free to fold spindle and mutilate (after purchase) any of the ideas found herein and have a great time...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of the Gazette looks at the fringer world of Edge, an unpleasant little backwater well off of the frontier. For the Twilight Sector Setting, this world is a sample of the kinds of planets that exist along these remote regions. For other settings, it is another world that has taken the long slow slide to barabarism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
