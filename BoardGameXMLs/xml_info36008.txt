			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game. Simulates the Battle of Britain. July-September 1940. Players will have to make their own sets of cards.&lt;br/&gt;The RAF and Luftwaffe have their own unique decks. Both decks have 62 cards. Notice that most cards have a force value. The Germans also need 20 tokens to represent bomb damage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players start the game with four cards. The players draw two cards at the start of each turn, with the maximum hand size at the end of the turn being eight cards. The German player has the option not to play a raid, in which case the turn ends. If the German player plays a raid, the players alternate playing force cards until neither player wants to play a card. The strength of the opposing forces are compared. If the RAF has a higher force total, the raid is stopped. If the German has the higher force total, then the amount of bombing damage caused by the raid is determined and added to the German&amp;rsquo;s score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the German&amp;rsquo;s accumulate 20 points of bombing damage then they win. Hitler decides to go ahead with operation Sealion. If the German player goes to draw a card and there are no cards left in his deck the British win. Hitler postpones operation Sealion indefinitely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
