							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gnomes of Levnec (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;...There are older things in these forests too; the knights did not just battle the pagan kings of man but also the forest dwellers; the wodewose. Spend too long in any tavern or listen to a village alewife and you&amp;rsquo;ll hear stories of knights and wodewose duking it out in little patches of now cleared pastures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of these little villages is the village of Levnec, a sad little town ruled by a self appointed lord banished from his seaside villa far to the south. His name is Lord Kristoph and he has been looking to hire some transient sell swords to solve his problem. Some of the townsfolk are (repeatedly) going missing and others are refusing to work, even after examples were beaten and hobbled by his men. Seeing as the townsfolk are blaming the local Gnomes, he would simply like these drifters to saunter in the wood, murder some Gnomes and bring them back to show the townsfolk there is nothing to fear (except him) and to get back to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;The adventure The Gnomes of Levnec has now also been updated to include professional art, layout and cartography by Jez Gordon.  It also is now dual statted for both NGR and OSR games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
