			<description>In the Game Boy action video game based on the film, the divorced father is looking for a Tasmanian Tiger while trying to survive in the harsh wilderness of Tasmania. Players can choose between two &amp;quot;types&amp;quot; of levels; slow levels or fast levels. Either jumping on the enemies or using the bombs kills them instantly. Players are limited in the number of bombs that they receive in the game. Certain enemies are worth more than others when defeated. Other animals like koalas appear in the game as bonus characters. However, these bonus creatures tend to disappear very quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game plays similar to the classic arcade game Mappy. All plants must be collected and animals must be cleared off the level before players can begin the next level; there are approximately ten levels in this game. While the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; button is used to plant bombs on the screen; the &amp;quot;Select&amp;quot; button is used to choose the level (and make the Tasmanian Tiger either slower or faster). It is possible to stun the Tasmanian Tiger with a bomb attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tasmania Story&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
