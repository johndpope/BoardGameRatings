			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Seven Kingdoms, you stand on a continent torn apart by a war that befell us all almost 780 years before now. Before then there was truce between all the races and with the land itself, no one is sure what it was that set the Elves to war but it consumed everything from west to east. For twenty years there was conflict, blood and debris filled the land until one day it all fell silent, no one today knows what truly happened but there were celebrations across all the kingdoms. The aftermath of the war left the seas inaccessible to anyone, raging torrents of storms and seas prevent any ship from sailing to or from the land, the continent shuddered and shifted creating unexplained volcanoes, nothing was spared in the elements mournful wake. A new reform was made so that no war so destructive should ever be brought forth again. To uphold this reform Guilds were created, these guilds are there to keep the balance and to this day still hold great influence across the continent. Many have found honor and glory where others have found wealth and great knowledge. The world turns and now, seven hundred and seventy eight years later things begin to stir in the great forests, dark hearts leak out of the pores of shadows and even magic turns and rebels against itself. These are troubled times and your tale has yet to be told. Will you seek fame and fortune like those before you? Or will your exploits bring about your untimely demise. Whatever the outcome remember that time is of the essence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
