							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rival Den of Thieves</name>
									
			<description>Rival Den of Thieves is a strategic card game for two to five players. The criminal element of the city is in a race to steal the most -- from the bank or each other. Each player controls one of the dens, and each card in her/his hand represents one of the thieves in his/her den.  Each player chooses which of her/his thieves to make active, knowing which thieves are in every player's den (and knowing that they know which cards s/he is choosing between).  Guessing which thief another player is making active can help block and/or steal from that other player.  Players bluff and back stab their way to victory, using the upper class thieves in the city -- including the Counterfeiter, the Gentleman Burglar, and the Lawyer. The game can be combined with Den of Thieves for richer play. The game can accommodate 2-5 players -- up to 10 with a second deck or Den of Thieves added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
