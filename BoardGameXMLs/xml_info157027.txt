			<description>MazeScrolls are a series of maze puzzles games in the form of scrolls. They are a new kind of game genre: the pen and paper maze puzzle dice games for multiple players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 different MazeScroll designs and each one uses different graphics and offers different game-play. The eight MazeScrolls are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Galaxy Far, Faar, Faaar Away&lt;br/&gt;- Perimeter Perplexity&lt;br/&gt;- De Stijl Mile&lt;br/&gt;- Daedalus Treasure&lt;br/&gt;- Lovers Duel&lt;br/&gt;- Daedalus Palace&lt;br/&gt;- Crossing&lt;br/&gt;- Skritches, Skretches and Skrutches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MazeScrolls are a game of meandering journey that can be played by a single player or multiple players. Players can race from one end to the opposite end or they can start at opposite ends and attempt to find each other. Players can also &amp;quot;duel&amp;quot; by first collecting power points so that when they meet-up the one with the most power wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play the MazeScroll games using a pen, pencil or colored pencils. When the game is done, the finished MazeScroll becomes a piece of artwork that is also a record of their play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
