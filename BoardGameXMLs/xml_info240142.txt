			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        GAME SYSTEM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole. It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Welcome to world of Dark Legacy. A world ruled by the ruthless battle mage by the name of the Kaiser. The planet of Titan is at war. The Kaiser is bringing the world to its knees. This is a war where anything is possible and anyone can become a legend. It is here where your journey begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Legacy is a unique strategy game that mixes the best elements of campaign-style adventure games and tactical customizable card games and wraps them all up into a in-depth sci-fi/fantasy story. In Dark Legacy, players are no longer bystanders of the battle; they get to be part of it as a war general within one of six different factions. With the unique and various weapons, armor and relics that a player can equip themselves with, players can become whomever they imagine themselves to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dark Legacy, players want to destroy their opponents and their armies by building a deck of magic spells that no one can withstand, rolling the d20 in their favor and strategically summoning their army to be the strongest. Just like in real battle, you have to anticipate the probability of the unexpected. Don't make choices too hastily for they may be the demise of your army and yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
