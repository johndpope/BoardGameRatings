							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Old Republic</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil threatens to consume the galaxy. The Sith Empire's relentless assault during the Sacking of Coruscant destroyed the Jedi Temple and drove the Republic's defenders into exile after the last war. The surviving Jedi have withdrawn to their ancient homeworld of Tython, where they take advantage of a fragile peace to train a new generation of guardians for the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos grips the Galactic Republic. Influential star systems break away from the millennia-old alliance, angered over the Senate's treaty with the Sith Empire. On many worlds, civil war erupts between loyal Republic citizens and violent separatist extremists waging a campaign of terror against their own peoples. The Republic sends its best and brightest soldiers to help defeat the separatists and restore peace to these war-ravaged worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elsewhere, anarchy rules in the frontier systems. While the Republic struggles to recover from its conflict with the Sith Empire, reckless mercenaries profit from the interstellar turmoil. The worlds ravaged by civil war between pro-Republic citizens and separatist extremists have become a lucrative destination for free traders. The Empire, seeking allies among the neutral systems, has targeted the foul planets of the Hutts - though its wealthy and corrupt crime lords refuse to take sides in the cold war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the Sith Empire tightens its grip on the galaxy. The Empire has won a major victory against the Republic and its Jedi guardians, conquering and enslaving many new worlds. With a fragile peace negotiated, the Empire sends all potential Sith to undergo cruel and deadly trials at its Academy on the harsh planet Korriban, while its slaves toil to unearth relics of vast power that can be used to dominate the galaxy&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
