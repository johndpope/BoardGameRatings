							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Getaway Driver</name>
									
			<description>Following in footsteps of classic movies like Bullet, The Italian Job, and The Fast and the Furious, Getaway Driver puts you in the driver's seat in a reckless car chase out of town. Getaway Driver is a fast and frantic asymmetric game for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as the Driver - a daredevil motorist with the skills to pull a variety of crazy stunts - racing to get out of town. Or play as the Police - armed with a battalion of equipment and vehicles, and the city itself - working to catch the Driver before they escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the Police secretly build out the city and move their vehicles, working to corner the Driver and steer them towards the areas of the city that expand the police force. The Driver burns through their stunt cards, picking up stashes along the way. If the last city tile is placed, the Driver escapes out of town. However, if the police increase the pursuit meter to its final space, the Driver is caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
