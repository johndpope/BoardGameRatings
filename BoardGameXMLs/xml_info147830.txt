							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: Glendale (American Civil War in 3D)</name>
									
			<description>Glendale is the sixteenth battle in the series and is the sixth in our Peninsula Campaign set of 1862. The Confederates are in a position to attack the Union army who is retreating towards Harrison's Landing on the James River. Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
