			<description>Galassia is a space racing game of the 80s in which each player must be able to build a path from Earth to the planets that were randomly assigned at the beginning of the game, through the placement of the space lanes tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player also tries to hinder other players in their purpose. They also have strategic cards at their disposal, which can help a player get past space lanes closed by his opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spacecraft, which can be moved by all the players, move from Earth to the planets with the spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get points for arriving at the planets, with players who arrive earliet getting more points. The game ends when everyone has reached their destination; the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
