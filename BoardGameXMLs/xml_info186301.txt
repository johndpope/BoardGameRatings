			<description>This is kind of a soccer training simulation. One goal keeper (red) plays against up to 3 field players (yellow, black, green). Movement is determined by a die. The goal keeper has 9 meeples and each field player has 3 meeples. The goal keeper tries to catch the field players and vice versa by getting on the same space. If the goal keeper has lost all his meeples the first field player to reach the square goal space wins the game. The goal keeper wins if the catches all field players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
