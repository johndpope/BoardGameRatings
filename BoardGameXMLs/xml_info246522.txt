			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the commander of a fleet of ships operating in enemy territory.  Your task force consists of nine ships, and the enemy has nine ships.  Whoever sinks all of the opponent's ships first wins the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of Seawar was written by David S. Paxton, and revised by Mary T. Dobbs.  The program was published as type-in source code in Creative Computing, Vol. 1, No. 4, May/June 1975.  The listing was provided in BASIC with the assumption that users would make minor adjustments necessary to run on their own systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
