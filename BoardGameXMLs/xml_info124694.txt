			<description>Densetsu no Stafy 2 (伝説のスタフィー2 Densetsu no Sutafī 2?) is a platform video game developed by TOSE and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in Japan on September 5, 2003. It is the second game in the The Legendary Starfy series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Densetsu no Stafy 2 takes place shortly after its predecessor. Stafy, known as Starfy in Western regions, is now back at Pufftop Palace, playing with his friend Moe. The series' main antagonist, Ogura, imprisoned inside the Magic Jar, unleashes his children into the sky. Ogura's children cause a series of thunderstorms and earthquakes that shake Pufftop Palace, causing the Magic Jar to shatter and release Ogura. Ogura captures Starfy's mother and flies away with Starfy in hot pursuit. Both he and Moe fall from Pufftop Palace to the ocean below. The duo mount an attack against Ogura and his children during the journey back to Pufftop Palace. As in the previous game, Densetsu no Stafy, Starfy helps various people with all sorts of different troubles during the course of several levels, such as finding their missing items, defeating bothersome enemies, and so on. Starfy and company fight against Ogura and his 10 children to reseal Ogura in the Magic Jar.&lt;br/&gt; Ogura's children have two daughters and 8 sons but their names are all numbered and they're the ones who stole Starfy's treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Densetsu no Stafy 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
