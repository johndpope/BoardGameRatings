			<description>A guessing, singing and dice game for the young.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;2 sheep&lt;br/&gt;1 moon&lt;br/&gt;1 star&lt;br/&gt;1 large die (1 or 2 pips)&lt;br/&gt;1 game board&lt;br/&gt;1 set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is set up in the box so that it forms a two sided 'ramp' that the sheep set out to climb (ask not why).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two 'games' in this box. The first game is a perfunctory singing activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game involves a race to the top of the game board. One player secretly selects the moon or the star and inserts the chosen piece into their side of the board (hidden from the other player's view). The other player guesses which piece has been inserted. If correct, the guessing player rolls the die and advances their sheep 1 or 2 rungs up the game board. The guessing player now becomes the choosing player, and play alternates in this manner until one sheep makes it to the apex of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 2½ and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
