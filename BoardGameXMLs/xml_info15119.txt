							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Body Tag</name>
									
			<description>Body Tag takes only a minute to master and promises hours of fun. Each playing surface poses new and different challenges. It's easy to rub an opponent the wrong way. Moves can be ticklish, hairy, and exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spin the giant spinner, turn the sand timer over, and then as fast as possible, stick a sheet of paper from the special pad provided, on every part of your opponent's body you can think of that begins with the letter indicated on the spinner dial. The player who labels the greatest number of body parts before the sand runs out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Body Tag is a game of physical contact in which no one gets hurt. And, unlike other games, players that lose get as good feeling in defeat as players that win do in victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what are you waiting for? Get your body tagged by someone special.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Must be played with clothes on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
