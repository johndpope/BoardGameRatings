			<description>Demo case for Watson &amp;amp; Holmes game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;My sister is in jail, but she is innocent. She did not kill the doctor!&amp;quot; - This was said by a young boy on the first floor of 221B of Baker Street.&lt;br/&gt;My friend Sherlock Holmes was sitting and listening quietly to the full story. Finally, when the boy finished, Holmes opened his eyes and I listened to his voice: Watson, the game is afoot!&lt;br/&gt;...from the diaries of Dr. John H. Watson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This bonus adventure begins in Holmes' apartment, with Doctor Watson and the great detective tolerating an uneventful day in. A boy, Arthur Craig, arrives nervous, shy, and in need of assistance. He explains that his sister has been accused of a horrendous crime. Her former employer, Doctor Bont, has come up dead and foaming at the mouth, and as it was Madeleine who found the body, she is, of course, the most obvious suspect. The boy shares that his sister of pure heart, as anyone would, but also that he was in her company when the alleged murder occurred. It couldn't have been her!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
