							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MADS Role Playing Game (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wondered who has the toughest warrior? Or if your paladin with his magic sword can survive an encounter with a hostile alien horde? Care to see how your archmage would fair against a comic book supervillian?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MADS is a role playing game that can answer that question and many others. As a character conversion system it doesn't take a character from system A and convert it into a character from system B. Rather, it is designed to take the characters from system A and system B and convert them to the MADS system. MADS also includes its own character generation rules, guidelines for creating new skills and spells, and tips on how to use MADS in you gaming sessions. Best of all, your other game books do not become obsolete, as MADS is meant to supplement your favorite system, not replace it. Got a character? Then you can play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
