							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beta Colony</name>
									
			<description>It all started when the Imperium seized control of Earth and declared martial law, sentencing those who opposed their will to immediate death or worse fates. It seemed as if all hope was lost, but before their edict could be carried out, a group of defectors managed to wrest control of the Ridback, a Class&amp;ndash;II jumpship, and flee with as many of the condemned as they could save.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been close to seven years that these refugees from Earth have called the Ridback home, and finally the crew has found a planet with promise. They have managed to establish outposts around it, and now the great burden falls on you to expand these small &amp;ldquo;alphas&amp;rdquo; into a full-fledged Beta Colony. Success will mean that your people will be able to begin life anew on exoplanet 14 Bos c, or, as they have renamed it, &amp;quot;Victus&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; Latin for &amp;quot;way of life&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Beta Colony, you play as one of five Directors working to create prosperous colonies. If you earn the most Confidence Points (CP), you will be elected as the first leader of Victus. Players will collect the needed building materials to produce and erect colonization pods &amp;ndash; Defense Stations, Science and Tech Towers, Living Quarters, Agriculture Pods, and Water Treatment Centers &amp;ndash; on the varied terrain of Victus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a unique &amp;quot;rolldell&amp;quot; mechanism (dice + rondel), Beta Colony is a mid-weight strategic game for players of all levels. Each round, the start player rolls their set of four colored dice. All other players duplicate that roll with their own dice. Players take two actions each round, one action at a time in turn order, with each action using two dice. Players will use one die to move and one die to activate the location to which they moved. Die color and value affect how each of the seven unique locations are used. Players will build colonization pods at each of three colonies to gain the confidence of the settlers and lead them to glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
