			<description>Planet Raiders is an abstract strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action takes place on a space-like board with 4 planets at the peripheries (populated by aliens) and player's spaceships in the middle. The objective of the game is to recover the spaceships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to do this each player has 3 raiders and 5 rockets. Using these he has to form the crew of the ship by making prisoners enemy's raiders and recovering aliens scattered on the planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a crew is formed, the player must be the first to bring one of his raiders on his ship to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
