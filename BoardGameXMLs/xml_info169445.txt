			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re all in a band, that&amp;rsquo;s already been formed with certain agreements &amp;amp; parameters: You&amp;rsquo;re all fans of some sorts of rock &amp;amp; jazz to some degree or  another, and you&amp;rsquo;ve concluded that, while there&amp;rsquo;s no room in your  local music scene for another rock band, or another jazz band, the  clubs are eager to showcase a jazz-rock hybrid (yes, this is fantasy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve formed this band with the express purpose of filling that niche; you&amp;rsquo;re all on the same page as far as that very vague musical goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll play shows of all original material which is still in the works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be lots of improv in each performance, as players are moved by the inspiration of the moment. This band thrives less on rehearsed precision and more on spontaneity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within that, there will be disagreements, good shows and bad shows. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what &amp;ldquo;rock&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;jazz&amp;rdquo; mean to each of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll play to see if the characters can achieve their personal musical visions, and at the same time, if the band can stay together and forge a sound that will carry them forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
