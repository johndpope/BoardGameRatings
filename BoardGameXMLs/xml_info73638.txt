			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;    Die By The Sword is an action sword fighting game. Take control of  the hero through 7 levels to defeat the evil wizard, or fight against your friends or the AI in Arena mode.&lt;br/&gt;    There were several unique standout features of this game.  DBTS featured limb dismemberment, so one could target a specific part of the enemy to limit their ability to fight back.  The game also featured Treyarch's VSIM technology. This movement calculation allowed the player to take full control of the character and move the sword (or other weapon) independantly. Instead of canned animations the sword followed the mouse or keyboard movement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
