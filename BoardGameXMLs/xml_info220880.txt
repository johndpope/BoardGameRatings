							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hollowild Gorge &amp; Caves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miles from the road that cuts through the ancient forest is a secret and untouched place - Hollowild Gorge. Cut down into the rock by ancient rivers, the gorge is now heavily forested and covered with lush greenery. Weathering has eaten into the walls of the gorge and created numerous caves - just perfect for exploring!&lt;br/&gt; Hollowild Gorge &amp;amp; Caves is a printable RPG floorplan compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt; Contents: A 20x30 battlemap depicting the surface. A forested woodland valley, with trees and undergrowth covering the sides. The floor of the valley is sandy and clear, but the cliffs are covered in trees, punctuated at various points by cave entrances. The set also includes 13 cave battlemaps (of various sizes) which can be used as the caves inside any of the entrances on the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cave maps include several empty generic caves, as well as a pool, entrance to a dungeon, bandit camp, huge hole, treasure horde and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discover Range features large surface battlemaps and smaller underground rooms and chambers. When your party discover an entrance to the underground, simply use the underground map of your choice. It can be different every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
