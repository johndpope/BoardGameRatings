			<description>Free game published in the February 2018 issue of Game Trade Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Professor Elemental Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: &lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are attending a &lt;br/&gt;series of parties, where you want to be seen with the &lt;br/&gt;fanciest people. &amp;ldquo;Fancy&amp;rdquo; was designed with the Professor &lt;br/&gt;Elemental Pairs Deck, but is compatible with them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt; A PAIRS deck and a way to keep score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: &lt;br/&gt;The game is played in several rounds. &lt;br/&gt;Each is composed of eight tricks, or &amp;ldquo;parties.&amp;rdquo; The &lt;br/&gt;role of dealer passes to the left after each round. &lt;br/&gt;A full game is one round for each dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Round: &lt;br/&gt;Shuffle and deal a hand of eight cards &lt;br/&gt;to each player. Players look at their hands, and then &lt;br/&gt;pass two cards&lt;br/&gt; to the player on their left. The player &lt;br/&gt;on the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left will lead the first trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Trick: &lt;br/&gt;Each trick is a party. To score points, &lt;br/&gt;you can try to be the fanciest person, or to be seen &lt;br/&gt;with someone much fancier than yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the leader and proceeding to the left, &lt;br/&gt;each player plays one card face up. The card you play &lt;br/&gt;represents a party guest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important Rule: &lt;br/&gt;A guest can&amp;rsquo;t appear twice at the same party. You may play a duplicate of a card that was already played, but it will be discarded, scoring no points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring the Trick: &lt;br/&gt;After each player has played (or discarded) a card, the trick is scored as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center of Attention:&lt;br/&gt; The lowest card played is the most fabulous in the room. This card scores its face value for the player who played &lt;br/&gt;it. This player will also lead the next trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hangers-On: &lt;br/&gt;All other cards score points equal to the difference between themselves and &lt;br/&gt;the next-lowest card. For example, if the cards are 3-4-6-10, they score 3, 1, 2, and 4 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discards: &lt;br/&gt;Copies of earlier cards are discarded. These score zero points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After scoring, discard all the cards from this trick and play another, starting with the player who just played the lowest card. A full round is eight tricks, and a full game is one round for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End:&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after each player has dealt one round.  Then, the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
