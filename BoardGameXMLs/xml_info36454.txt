Each player has a set of eight Ship tiles. Ships are divided into four classes, numbered 1 to 4. Ship Class determines attack range, hull strength, and number of masts. Each ship is also rated for six skill types, described as follows in the rules: Seamanship, Gunnery, Command Authority/Discipline, Morale/Courage/Health/Stamina, Marksmanship/Snipers/Muskets, and Boarding/Swashbuckling/Hand-to-Hand Combat/Marines/Crew Size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: The player with the most captured ships at the end of the game wins. If tied the player who sunk the most ships wins. The game ends when there are no ships left to capture or sink.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
