			<description>An alternate title for this game might be, &amp;quot;How to Win at Baseball Without Fielding a Winning Team.&amp;quot; In Big Bucks Baseball, getting to the playoffs and the World Series can bring you financial rewards. However, it is the player who has the most money at the end of the game that wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is tasked with building a baseball team by drafting rookies, acquiring free agents, trading, etc. Free agents go a long way towards fulfilling the requirements for a post-season team, but cost money. Injuries can knock a key player off your roster, forcing you to acquire a replacement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrewd and cunning trades, plus a bit of luck, can either give you the edge to clean up on post season bonuses or to squeak into the financial lead with a cheap non-contender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
