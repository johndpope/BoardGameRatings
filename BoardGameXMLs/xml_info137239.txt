							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LowDie System Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>from the website:&lt;br/&gt;A generic roleplaying engine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LowDie system is designed to be a generic roleplaying game &amp;quot;engine&amp;quot; that minimises dice rolls, mental arithmetic, and complicated derived statistics to speed play up and allow the players to focus on the story being told. However, LowDie does not aim to do this by making things too abstract; instead it attempts to incorporate as many factors into each mechanic as is possible without bogging down play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
