							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killing Machine</name>
									
			<description>A science fiction infantry tabletop miniatures wargame retaining as many 'realistic' features as possible, while striving to minimize complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, intended for use with 25/28mm miniatures (of whichever manufacturers the players prefer), features morale and fog-of-war/limited intelligence rules which have a significant impact on the battles - at least as much as actually killing the opposing forces.  Troop types from lightly armoured basic infantry (say, Aliens Colonial Marines level) up to heavy power-armoured juggernauts (for example Starship Trooper Mobile Infantry or WH40K Terminators), as well as robots, cyborgs, remotes etc (thus allowing armies from the Terminator films, Cybermen, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicles are intentionally not featured within the rules, leaving it as a game with the focus on infantry (from high tech to very high tech) and their main support weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than treating tabletop battles as simply &amp;quot;line up 1000 points per side and fight until one side is gone&amp;quot; affairs, Killing Machine takes a more intelligent, mature look at this kind of skirmish gaming with its morale and intelligence rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
