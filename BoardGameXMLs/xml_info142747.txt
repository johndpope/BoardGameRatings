			<description>Warrior Heroes Legends is a set of rules for fantasy wargaming. The game can be played with any miniatures the player already owns. The system emphasizes group cohesion, leadership, and interactivity. The traditional turn sequence (move, attack, resolve attacks) is often interrupted by mini-sequences involving quick reactions from the miniatures in play, including those of the non-active player. This ensures that all players are involved in the action at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior Heroes Legends can be played competitively, cooperatively, or solitaire, and includes a detailed campaign system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LEGENDS AREN&amp;rsquo;T BORN, THEY&amp;rsquo;RE MADE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And in Warrior Heroes &amp;ndash; Legends here&amp;rsquo;s your chance to become one. You start life as an independent sell sword or perhaps an inexperienced caster of magic. But whichever you choose there&amp;rsquo;s nothing special about you as you start your story. But as the saying goes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IT&amp;rsquo;S NOT HOW YOU START BUT HOW YOU FINISH!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Warrior Heroes &amp;ndash; Legends the goal is simple. Gain Fame through your exploits and Fortune through your deeds. Start as a Warrior but finish as a King? It can happen and it&amp;rsquo;s all up to you. But before you can be King let&amp;rsquo;s start a little smaller. Like leading a small band of adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior Heroes - Legends includes:&lt;br/&gt;Multiple character classes and races.&lt;br/&gt;Over sixty Signatures and Skills to personalize your character.&lt;br/&gt;An easy to use Economics System with little book keeping.&lt;br/&gt;Quick and easy Magic rules.&lt;br/&gt;Complete environment to adventure in.&lt;br/&gt;A variety of scenarios and a how to for making more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
