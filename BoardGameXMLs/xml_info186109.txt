			<description>HARPE lite&lt;br/&gt;HARPE:  The Hugely Adaptable (Action/Anime) Role-Playing Engine&lt;br/&gt;LITE: &amp;quot;Lacking in Technically Encumbered&amp;quot; Game-Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HARPE lite is a &amp;quot;stripped&amp;quot; version of HARPE, to provide quick play access to the game.  Most of the rules--and all of the special-situation rules--have been removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters follow a Template (Common, Daring, Dramatic, Heroic, Super-Heroic) to gain 0-4 Abilities and 0-4 Deeds.  These are narrative tags created by the player, with examples being things like:  Artistic Ability, Combat Ability, Linguistics Ability, Social Ability, Stealth, Survival, and Vehicle Operations.  Deeds indicate how often a character may utilize non-common Abilities before recovery periods (which vary), with values ranging from 1-7.  Different levels of Abilities have different dice pools, running from 1d6 to 4d6+4.  When an opposed action is resolved it causes the loser to accumulate &amp;quot;Points of Defeat&amp;quot; which are vaguely like abstracted hit points in other systems.  Points of Defeat regenerate during recovery periods.  Actions are resolved by rolling the dice pool and looking for successes in the results, the number of successes determining the nature of the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
