							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Mokoti, Komuso Monk</name>
									
			<description>The Komuso monks are usually a happy sight for the villagers and peasants, when these nomadic musicians come to town it is an opportunity to down tools and sit and listen to the sweet music played in exchange for a meal and a warm bed. Mokoti has fallen to the seductive charms of Yurei and whilst his playing is exquisite his motivations are far darker. The gentle and light music hides a twisted a corrupt whisper from the dark, bending the minds of the weak and vulnerable to His will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister contains one model, one 30mm base and one full colour profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
