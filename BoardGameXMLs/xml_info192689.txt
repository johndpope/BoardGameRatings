			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Focke-Wulf FW-190 W&amp;uuml;rger (Shrike) was a German single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank in the late 1930s and widely used during World War II. The FW-190 D (nicknamed the Dora) was intended to improve on the high-altitude performance of the A-series enough to make it useful against the American heavy bombers. However, the circumstances of the war in late 1944 meant that fighter-versus-fighter combat and ground attack missions took priority. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft included Franz G&amp;ouml;tz and Waldemar W&amp;uuml;bke. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. Larger maneuver cards (63 x 88 mm) are included with this model, to handle the fast movement of this airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
