			<description>Street Racer is an early racing video game developed for the Atari 2600, then known as the VCS (Video Computer System). It was programmed by Larry Kaplan and released by Atari in February 1978 as one of the nine Atari 2600 launch titles. The game was also released by Sears by their Tele-Games product line as Speedway II.&lt;br/&gt;Street Racer was one of the two launch titles programmed by Kaplan; Air-Sea Battle was the other. Street Racer offered 27 game variations, grouped into the following sub-games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 1&amp;ndash;6: Street racer&lt;br/&gt;    * 7&amp;ndash;12: Slalom&lt;br/&gt;    * 13&amp;ndash;16: Dodgem&lt;br/&gt;    * 17&amp;ndash;20: Jet shooter&lt;br/&gt;    * 21&amp;ndash;24: Number cruncher&lt;br/&gt;    * 25&amp;ndash;27: Scoop ball&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the sub-games has roughly the same gameplay: the player controls a vehicle that must avoid or collect certain objects as they scroll down the screen. Between one and four players can compete simultaneously by using the paddle controllers, which allow the vehicle to move left and right along the bottom of the screen. If a one-player game is selected, the player competes with a static computer opponent that allows objects to collide with it or pass by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Racer_%28Atari_2600%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Racer_%28Atari_2600%29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;],&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
