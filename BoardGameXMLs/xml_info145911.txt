			<description>From publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desktopia is a fascinating game that requires good planning, physical coordination and a good eye. It has mighty warriors, mysterious artifacts and deadly missiles. They are represented by disks of varying sizes and colors that have to be sent flying towards their targets with a well-aimed flick of a finger. Choose a side of the table and lead your order&amp;rsquo;s army into a campaign of world conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desktopia games can vary substantially. The battlefield landscape is formed by the random conglomeration of objects that can usually be found on your desk or table. These may include books, cups, your laptop, a mouse or a remote control. The game pack includes a set of riveting scenarios. You can take part in a massive melee, rob caravans, perform speed missions under a hail of arrows and even solve riddles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have his own small army represented by discs of different sizes and corresponding reference cards. Legendary heroes, tough veterans and faithful fighters each of them with unique abilities described on reference card will be at your disposal. Likewise there will be small missile disks, which can be used by some of your characters, and mighty artifacts, which you can take under control during the course of a battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you can activate three of your characters: flick the disk to attack or use a missile instead or cast a spell. There are a lot of interesting choices you will have each time - whom and how to activate, trying to make a risky long short or just safely moving your warrior into an advantageous position for the next move. In this game your tactical choices are much more important than anything else. You also have to try to make the best use of the synergy of the different warrior types in your army!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We actively encourage players to use everyday objects from their tables. Imagine a turned glass as a sphere of ice which could freeze some disks of your enemy, a book as an impregnable cliff, from which your archers could safely attack, or a vase as a control tower with 10 hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
