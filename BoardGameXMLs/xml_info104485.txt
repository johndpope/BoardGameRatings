			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Propeller Arena is an arcade aviation dog-fight game developed by Sega-AM2, but never released. The game's scheduled release was cancelled just days after the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Towers. The game box shows a plane flying over city buildings and one of the levels is within a city. The halt in production of Dreamcast system's and Sega's move to become a third party developer/publisher are also reasons for the game's cancellation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game disc image was later leaked to the internet and is now available for download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are eight planes to choose from in the game: Eagle Jam, Shameless Cats, Muscle Brothers, Pizza Fat, Pengo Jets, 8-Bit Beat, Hex Candy, and Golden Knife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character flies one of the following planes (pre-determined): P-51 D, P-38 J, Bf 109 E, or the Spitfire Mk. VB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
