							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hell for Leather</name>
									
			<description>This is light motorcycle racing game based on the characters of Paul Sample's 'Ogri' comics. It is basically a roll and move game, with a number of cards that can be played at various times to enhance one's own progress or inhibit that of the another player. The game consists of three individual races   and a total of six laps around the course, played with different dice to represent the speed / intensity of each race. At the end of each race, players acquire sponsors based on their performance, and have the opportunity to spend money to purchase upgrades to their bikes for future heats. The overall winner is the first player to cross the finish line in the third race. The game is very aesthetically appealing, with board, card, and box art by Paul Sample and pewter miniatures for player pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box: &amp;quot;Hell for Leather is a fast, freaky race around the world famous Isle of Man T.T. course, featuring a host of the best loved characters from Paul Sample's cult comic strip Ogri, which has appeared in Bike Magazine since 1972. A game for 2-6 players, Hell for Leather is all about high speeds, hard cash, 'Derring Do', and dirty tricks. Relying on guile, cunning, and hopefully a little luck, set your sights firmly on the chequered flag... and go for it! Pressure builds as you progress through the races with sponsorship funding, heaps of trouble, and laughs aplenty. When fair play and skilful riding are not enough, deft use of your nasty 'nerg nail', 'orrible oil slick' and other 'cheats' picked up along the way may assist you in the 'no holds barred' charge for glory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
