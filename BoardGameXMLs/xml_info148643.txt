			<description>user summary:&lt;br/&gt;Praedor RPG is one of the most sold finnish RPGs ever, this first edition had two print runs before the revision and 1.1 edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated from back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;It is unknown whether Jaconia belongs to past or future. In some eternal universe it just is. Jaconia is a big round piece of free land in the middle of a long dead, dark civilization's ruins. Jaconia is surrounded by Borvaria, kingdom of death, miljons of square kilometers of ancient ruined city. Nobody knows what lies behind Borvaria, some religions say there is nothing at all. Borvaria is dead land. Eternal dark force and nameless creatures make it a dark hell. Praedors are adventurers who earn their living by robbing and pillaging the ruins of Borvaria and Warth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Praedor is a fantasy roleplaying game based on the world of Petri Hiltunens graphic novels with the same name. It tells about Jaconia, fragment of a world, left in the middle of the ruins of a super-culture, devastated by an ancient curse. It tells about praedors, talented and courageous adventurers, who make trips to the ruins of Borvaria in hope of treasures. They are the heroes and villains of legends, envied and hated upstarts. Among them, high and low are equal, because monsters and demons don't care about family trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jaconia is also a lot more, nothing prevents you from playing crooked nobles, acid-burned alchemists, thiefs of big cities, clergy men, cultists et cetera. Almost 100 pages of World book is a great source for anyone interested in Jaconia. The whole book is awesomely illustrated by Petri Hiltunen himself and includes 15 comic pages describing different parts of Jaconia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game rules and text parts are made by Ville Vuorela, who's earlier creations are Miekkamies, Taiga and Mobsters and many projects using RPGs in higher education. Rules are easy to learn, but very detailed if needed. Values are easy to change to be compatible with other RPG systems or to take in use in another environment or game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
