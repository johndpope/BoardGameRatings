			<description>The XVII. the king scented the plans of the noblemen conspiring against it in England on a century's waist, that down it wants to be repelled from the throne. He deprived all those, who were getting involved in a suspicion, of their title, their property and their name because of this. As a last opportunity, offered it to the ones driven into the exile in order for them to prove their innocence, that who gets into the utmost nook of his realm as the first, it proves it with his desperation, worthy that way, that gets back his goods taken away. Your rivals will make your road harder, save up at what more thalers, that give yourself to benefits and be able to hold back your adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the most resolute one and reach the aim, the long one and tiring one firstly on a road, defying the obstacles, that regain all that, from which falsely bereft!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peregrinus is a game that is still under development and just before publishing. Consequently, the rules are not complete yet but are still changing. In the game you have to come up with different colour combinations with four cards, and you can proceed in the game with these combinations. You can collect money, points, action cards and treasures. All this will be converted into victory points at the end of the game. You can create obstacles for your opponents, and you can turn the action cards into your advantage but can also annoy your opponents with these cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to collect the most VPs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
