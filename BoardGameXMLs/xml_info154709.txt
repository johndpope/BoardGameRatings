							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cards Against Librarianship</name>
									
			<description>A library-themed spin on the popular Cards Against Humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin, each player is dealt 10 white cards, and one player (the judge) begins the game by flipping over the first black card.  The other players then put down one white card each that fill in the blank on the black card.  The judge then decides which submission they think is funniest. The player who submitted the winning card gets to keep the black card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is free to print and share online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards Against Librarianship by Emily Lloyd is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
