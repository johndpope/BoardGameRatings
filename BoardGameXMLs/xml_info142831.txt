			<description>The playing board consists of 96 hexagonal spaces.  There are 48 spaces in a central diamond pattern, and four groups of 12 &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; spaces attached to the edge of the diamond area.  Each player starts with 12 pawns.  A certain number are exchanged with opponents, depending on the number of players.  There is a placement phase where all pawns are placed.  Players place pawns to make it difficult for their opponents to get their pawns home.  Players move their pawns; the first to get them all in the appropriate home space wins.  Movement types allowed include trading places, jumping, or sliding.  A pawn may be stranded if it has no neighbors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
