			<description>&amp;quot;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;  North &amp;amp; South is a combined strategy and action game for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, NES, Amstrad CPC, MSX and ZX Spectrum. It was developed and published in 1989 by Infogrames (now Atari Europe).&lt;br/&gt;  Plot:&lt;br/&gt;  North &amp;amp; South is an offshoot of the Belgian comic series Les Tuniques Bleues (by Cauvin and Salv&amp;eacute;/Lambil, from Dupuis) which is based on the American Civil War. The player basically acts out the Civil War, choosing to play as either the North or the South. The player may choose to start the game year from 1861 (the year the Civil War erupted) to 1864. Each year has a different array of armies and states that each side starts with. North and South contains a lot of humorous situations and gags.&lt;br/&gt;  Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;  Taking an extremely simplified board interface, the game features a strategic map of the USA separated into states and territories, where army units are moved around. Railways generate money which in turn generates soldiers. Moving their army units, the player may expand westwards into unoccupied territory. If two antagonistic armies clash, it will result in a battle.&lt;br/&gt;  The battle screen, one of the action elements in the game, is different from the strategic map. Each player starts on opposite sides of the screen and controls an army consisting of infantry, cavalry and cannons. &lt;br/&gt;  In the middle of the battle map, there may be a river or a chasm, in which case a bridge serves as a choke point  where the fighters are likely to meet. The bridge can be destroyed by cannons. One hit will leave a hole in the bridge where units can fall in and die instantly.&lt;br/&gt;  On the states that have a train station, the player must do a short side-scrolling  mission through a fort to capture that state. Here, the player controls a single soldier who runs towards the goal while meeting obstacles such as enemy soldiers, dynamite crates or dogs, with only the help of knives or punches that send enemies towards the sky, On occasions, the player also gets the opportunity to capture an enemy train in a similar manner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, North &amp;amp; South (video game), available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
