			<description>You are stuck on an island together, but the boat only fits one... You will have to kill everyone else, or, let them freeze to death on this extremely cold island before you escape...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has abilities to help them be the last man standing on the island. Choose what you use wisely, or, you might get killed when you are week...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try to get the others lower then you, so they freeze first, then, when everyone else is dead, take you one man boat to a warm climate and be happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best party game you will ever play, it will fill you with laughs when you are trying to survive against your friends, family, or loved ones. Just don't take it to seriously when they leave you to freeze alone...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
