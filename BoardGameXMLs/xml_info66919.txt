			<description>You need luck in this world! But knowledge is also necessary to get on in life - and it's the same with this game.&lt;br/&gt;The board depicts a 68 space track from a river up a slope to the top of the mountain. Thirteen of the spaces are numbered 1-13 and have a subject written next to them, cities, rivers, songs i.a.&lt;br/&gt;If a you land on a numbered space the next player in turn asks you a question on the given subject. If the answer is correct you may roll and move next turn otherwise you must go back one space. On certain spaces you have to answer questions from all other players. The winner is the first one to reach space 13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
