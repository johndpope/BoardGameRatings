							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wizard&#039;s Pen</name>
									
			<description>The Wizard has vanished! The clues to his whereabouts are in his workbook, but all the pages are blank. With the Wizard's Pen, players will reveal images in the book. Most puzzles involve revealing a small portion of the image at a time.  Some puzzles involve a blurry photo that needs to be brought into focus.  Other puzzles involved being zoomed in too close to an image.  The sooner you can identify the image, the higher your score and the closer you are to finding the wizard.&lt;br/&gt;- user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
