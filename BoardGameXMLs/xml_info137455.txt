			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick a World, Any World . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity has long looked up from Earth at the vastness of creation and exclaimed, &amp;quot;Get me off this mudball!&amp;quot; Pyramid -- the magazine for roleplayers -- is here to help, with an issue devoted to world-hopping: places to go, and how to get there. Your space-age strongbox includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Fast Reach,&amp;quot; an oft-dangerous cluster of star systems that allows speedy travel between two distant regions, as detailed by Matt Riggsby (author of the otherworldly travelogue that is GURPS Locations: Hellsgate). It includes a system map and tips for how to incorporate it into many types of spacefaring settings.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;A Song of Many Worlds,&amp;quot; an alien method of talking to planets that builds on the GURPS Psionic Powers framework to deliver new abilities, techniques, and a template.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Generation Ships,&amp;quot; the latest Eidetic Memory offering from GURPS Spaceships author David L. Pulver. Learn what can make or break a multi-lifetime trip through space, and unleash new Spaceships rules and guidelines, plus a sample vessel that's in for a long trip.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Hyperjumping,&amp;quot; an expanded way to use the GURPS Warp advantage to travel to other worlds, by Jason &amp;quot;PK&amp;quot; Levine, Assistant GURPS Line Editor. It provides new enhancements and limitations, plus a new method for using this trans-system ability.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Time Punch,&amp;quot; a systemless campaign framework that focuses on a strange -- and potentially dangerous -- machine designed to visit alternate Earths. Ideas for adding this device to GURPS Atomic Horror or GURPS Infinite Worlds campaigns are suggested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We can't send you traveling without the usual accoutrements! This issue's Random Thought Table considers some possible ways that you can ensure your crew gets to the surface safely -- and a bonus method shows up in Odds and Ends. Don't forget to check on a new installment of Murphy's Rules for something not-so-ordinary. If you're looking for interesting destinations or ways to travel, this issue of Pyramid is out of this world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
