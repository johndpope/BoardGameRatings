							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Personal Artifacts</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Personal Artifacts. In this PDF are many artifacts that you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to plop down into any campaign that you may be running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what is an artifact, and what is a personal artifact? Artifacts are usually described as extremely powerful items that, rather than merely another form of magic equipment, are the sorts of legendary relics that whole campaigns may be based upon. The traditional artifact has always had very high power levels and almost always been for use by high-level characters only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, there is a (minor) problem. Artifacts are, in my opinion, one of the most interesting game mechanics in the d20 System. Everyone loves them, but why do I have to be level 10 before ever getting one? This is where Personal Artifacts come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personal Artifacts is designed to show you a wide variety of artifacts of different power levels and for different character levels. There are personal artifacts for the high level character, while others can be used by a low level character and never become obsolete, no matter how powerful he becomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
