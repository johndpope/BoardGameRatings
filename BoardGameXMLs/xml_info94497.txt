							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dizzy Dice:  Ludo / Race &amp; Chase</name>
									
			<description>Dizzy Dice is a children's game.  The board is double sided - one side is a ludo game with standard ludo rules, and the other side is a straightforward roll-and-move game which is a race around the board, the winner being the first to cross all the bridges.  The thing that the game is most remembered for is its Dizzy Dice character used to roll the dice.  This is a transparent red plastic cube with legs and pressing down on the top of its head causes two dice inside to bounce around.  One dice is a standard 1-6 and the other has coloured spots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
