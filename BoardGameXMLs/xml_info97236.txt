			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if... one of your girlfriends received a photo of all your boys canoodling with tanned bikini babes on the beach? While you were ringing in the new year with pasty skin and the TV? Looks like it's time to make some new resolutions. First up? Get some new boys, stat. When the girls return to Hillsdale High, the ice is starting to melt, but their feelings aren't. Stepsisters Whitney and Sasha seem to be getting ever closer, and with Coco back at their side, it seems like the only one left out is Haley Is Haley just feeling supersensitive-or is she about to be de-friended? As the weather finally starts to warm up, will Haley need to shed her friends along with her winter clothes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
