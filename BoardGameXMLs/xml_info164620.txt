			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gridland is a match three puzzle game. There are a number of symbols in a grid that you must match. But the goal is not to indiscriminately match as many as you can to clear the board. Rather when you make a match, you collect the corresponding symbol as a resource. So matching three or more wheat will get you food. As you collect resources you will build a home and then expand the home with other outbuildings such as metal working. But the game does not always take place during the day. As you play the sun will move overhead then set and that is when the game becomes more strategic. The symbols shift. Matching three gravestones for example and a zombie comes out to fight your character. Fighting barehanded is not the best idea, so match three swords to get a weapon and three shields to get a shield. The match three takes on more strategy at night since you want to have shields and swords (both of which are consumed during battle) and you want to avoid chain reactions which can fill the screen with enemies. There are also treasure chests which can get you things like red and blue potions. Red potions refill health and blue potions damage all enemies on the screen. Note that as you improve your home and outbuildings you also improve the objects you get at night such as getting swords and shields that last longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
