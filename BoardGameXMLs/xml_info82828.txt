			<description>Darius Force, also known as Super Nova, is a horizontal scrolling shooter for the Super Nintendo, released in 1993 and is part of the Darius series. Taking place after the stories of the other Darius  games, the Silver Hawks are sent again to defeat the remaining battleships of the Belzer Army. However, there is no proof that indicates that the Belzer army sent the battleships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One main difference between this game and the rest of the Darius series is that the player can choose one of three Silver Hawks to play. The green one is the Silver Hawk of Darius. The blue one is the Silver Hawk of Darius II. The red one is a new prototype of Silver Hawk that exists only in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Darius Force,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
