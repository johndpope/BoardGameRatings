			<description>&amp;quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, often abbreviated JK2 or JO, is a first- and third-person action game developed by Raven Software and published by LucasArts and Activision. The PC version was released in early 2002 and the Mac OS X, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube versions were released in late 2002. Powered by the Quake III: Team Arena game engine, the game primarily revolves around ranged and melee combat. The player can wield classic Star Wars weapons such as blasters, lightsabers and Force powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes. The story-driven single-player is set in the Star Wars universe two years after the events of Mysteries of the Sith, Jedi Outcast's predecessor. It follows the protagonist Kyle Katarn as he fights against the Dark Jedi Desann and his followers. The game was critically well-received on all platforms, with scores between 75 and 89/100 according to Metacritic's composite averages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2003 a sequel titled Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy was released for the Xbox, Mac OS and PC. In 2006 the PC version was re-released with four other Star Wars games in a pack entitled Star Wars: The Best of PC. On September 16, 2009, the game was re-released with its sequels and the expansion to Dark Forces II onto Steam and Direct2Drive.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight_II:_Jedi_Outcast,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
