			<description>From the front page:&lt;br/&gt;The Passenger&lt;br/&gt;A Shadowrun 2nd Edition Virtual Seattle scenario&lt;br/&gt;by Wes Nicholson&lt;br/&gt;With thanks to Chris Maxfield and Mark Somers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the scenario:&lt;br/&gt;Two days ago you were all summoned to Claudia's place for a job. She offered refreshmants of the non-alcoholic kind, so you knew this was going to be tough. But so far it hasn't been.&lt;br/&gt;All you had to do was pick up some passengers from various places and tak them to Counsil Island. Claudia had passes for you all to get onto the Island for the next week, and she reminded you that no weapons of any kind are permitted on the island. None of you was tempted to test that out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
