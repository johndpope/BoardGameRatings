			<description>Turning Peasants Into Heroes Since 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever wanted to face the cold, dark, and dangerous unknown without the advantages of a fantasy hero? This is your chance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-level play has always been an RPG staple, but the Funnel..puts a brand new spin on slaughtering fresh player characters. In the Funnel, each participating player quickly generates several 0-level characters blessed with the abilities and low survivability of your average commoner. Those that survive the funnel will be promoted to 1st-level heroes. Most players will have more than one surviving character, thus creating a ready supply of raw recruits to fill the gaps when a hero or heroine dies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funneling process serves to bond characters over common challenges they meet and (hopefully) overcome. The surviving 1st-level characters share a common origin as adventurers. Instead of merely rolling dice, there is a trial by fire where average people overcome the odds to do something heroic (or hide under a table in a tavern).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fifth Edition Funnel has three distinct phases. First, your group of characters is randomly generated. Second, your freshly created villagers go on a small adventure. Third, the survivors are promoted and upgraded to true heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the 0-level adventure Lord Dunnywit's Manor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
