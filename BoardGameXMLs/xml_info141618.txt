			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are monsters afoot in Dungeon World. Dragons about, demons a-lurking, and giants a-smashing. Alas! What brave hero dares to challenge such impossible beasts? Who would dare to fight evil and also look absolutely fabulous doing it? You would, of course. Be it atop a noble steed or hanging from a rope or chandelier, you always charge into battle to save the day. That's what a hero does, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When hard times fall upon the world, you're always there, with a sword in one hand and a lover in the other. When the demons come a-knocking, you answer the door. When the dragons burn down the city, you're right there to nip at his heels. When the giant is smashing down the town walls and everyone else is running for cover, you're jumping on top of him from the parapets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Dashing Hero, and you're always there to save the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dashing Hero is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game. It is a daring adventurer who outshines all others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
