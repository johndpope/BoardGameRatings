The PCs have access to the Volvo Estate owned by Open Eye, and can charge their petrol to a company account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure begins when the PCs arrive at Timsdown West housing estate. Open Eye has been contacted by Colin and Jenny Robinson, in connection with their son, who went missing along with a number of otherpeople from the estate two weeks ago.
