			<description>There are 30 game-pieces for each player and 11 castles. The gameboard is divided into three sections: homes and center section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to capture four castles (among those of the central section and the other side) or 28 pawns of Your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player moves one of his pieces, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. In his first move, a pawn can move two squares after that only one square. Additionally a pawn can jump over another pawn as long as the square behind that pawn is free.&lt;br/&gt;Multiple jumps are allowed and all enemy pawns are captured this way and removed from the deck. A pawn can capture a maximum of five enemy pieces, and his movement ends after the fifth piece is captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A castle is conquered when it is surrounded by three of Your pawns. This castle is then removed from the grid and is held near the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
