			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Villainous Intent: 50 Plot Seeds for Superhero Roleplaying is a handy resource for players and GMs looking to spice up their campaign with sinister schemes and cunning capers. The plots range from star-spanning to street-level, and there are plenty of NPCs (good and evil) who can become part of your group's recurring storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These plot seeds are system-neutral, so they can be used with everything from Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds to your homebrewed superhero campaign. It's as easy as picking an idea, generating a few stats, and watching your heroes rush off to save the day. And since each entry can easily last an entire session, you're getting 50 weeks of entertainment--almost a full year--for less than the cost of a muffin at Starbucks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
