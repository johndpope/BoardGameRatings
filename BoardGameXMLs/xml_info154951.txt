			<description>This game is for 2 players (indians &amp;amp; cowboys) or 2 teams with up to 3 players. After the die is cast, the meeple can move to the next space of the rolled Color in any direction. The meeples start in their camp (colored triangle) and try to get into the enemy camp. Whenever 2 opposing meeples meet on the same space, they have to fight. The outcome is determined by the color die (red or blue). The loser has been captured, but can later be rescued by his mates. When a Player gets all his meeples into the enemy camp, or captures all enemies, he wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the 1940s or 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
