			<description>The annual Monster Tournament has arrived! Gather your wits, fill your backpack with baits, and venture into the wild to tame mystical creatures before your rivals do! Do you have what it takes to become the best monster tamer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Menagerie is played over a series of rounds, with each player taking one main action per round. Available actions include filling your backpack with baits, taming a monster, or preparing for a future turn by picking up cards. Players may also try to gain an advantage over their rivals by using the special powers of monsters in their menagerie. The game ends when a player tames at least 8 monsters. The player with the most prestige from monsters and hidden bonus crates is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
