							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Subterranean Races: Puddling Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The puddlings, a race of sentient oozes who live in the corpse of their creator god, have a very distinctive culture whose very stability demands the consumption of their deity's remnants. Though geographically insular by necessity, puddlings embody their creator's curiosity and have an insatiable thirst for news of the outside world. Visitors are welcomed with open arms, fed, entertained, and fawned over by entire communities at once, and then crystals are pressed to their foreheads with instructions to think about something interesting for the future viewing of their hosts. The records of the puddlings' enormous library of &amp;quot;memory crystals&amp;quot; have sparked strange ways of doing things, for when the puddlings see two good ideas, they'll combine them with no respect for the way the outside world will react.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    When a malfunctioning memory crystal scrambles a puddling's brain in the middle of viewing, the end result is a puddling with an amusing split personality disorder. Enter the crystalbroken bloodrager archetype!&lt;br/&gt;    Puddling society is predicated upon the concept of consensus, which requires that the oozes swap memories and beliefs until the best course of action is determined. In larger communities, this becomes difficult, as everyone's trying to be heard at once, and specialists are required to keep things organized. Create and control your own telepathic network with the moderator wizard archetype!&lt;br/&gt;    A group of puddlings watched some kung fu on a memory crystal once, and figured, &amp;quot;Hey, we could do that!&amp;quot; Having no bones does give them a distinct advantage, and the end result is the master of dropbear-style ambush tactics himself: the protoplasmic fist monk archetype!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
