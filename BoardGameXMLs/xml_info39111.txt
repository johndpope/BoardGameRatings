			<description>Subtitled: Rules for Miniatures Wargames of the 19th Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appears to be self published, and is noted as a revision of the 1994 Cold Wars version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Introduction states: &amp;quot;These rules are intended to be used for any land conflict from the Napoleonic Wars through the Second Anglo-Boer War. Encompassing both colonial actions and conflicts between technologically advanced powers, they are intended for those who wish to recreate the lesser-known conflicts of the period, for which specifically tailored rules sets are often not available. They are designed as a framework that is easily modified to fit the specific situation being recreated. Alternately, these rules are good for those who wish to play battalion-level games that move quickly...Toward this end, any consistent basing system can be used, with the number of figures on a base left to the individual.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System focuses on fatigue instead of casualties as has measurements intended for 15mm games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
