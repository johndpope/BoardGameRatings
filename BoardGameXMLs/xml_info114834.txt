			<description>I Shoot Randy is a card game for 2 to 6 players ages 13 and up with average length of playtime between 10-15 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player takes on the role of Randy and must survive the onslaught of attacks from the other players by countering the effects of their played cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Randy's health is reduced to 0, the player in the role of Randy looses the game. However, if Randy survives all valid attacks from the other players, then he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
