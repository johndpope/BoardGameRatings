							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wickie: Wind in de zeilen</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Cartoon character Wickie the viking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wickie and the Vikings are on their way home on their drakar with a valuable treasure, when suddenly, Terrible Sven starts chasing them. The boat from Halvar and Wickie is much slower, so they have to hide in the fjords, a dangerous mission, but luckily Wickie has some maps from the fjords. Aid Wickie and his crew to find his way through the fjords back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this two-player dexterity game, one player is Wickie who gives instructions, the other one is the boatsman who blows the ship over the waves through the fjords.&lt;br/&gt;The carton box has a plastic inlay which has to be filled with water and has a little boats and dangerous riffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you succeed to cooperate and get your ship into the safe harbour, you gain distance on terrible Sven, otherwise he comes closer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
