							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of History: Iron Phalanx vs. Dragonboat Raiders</name>
									
			<description>In Heroes of History, you are the general and Gods and Kings are awaiting your orders. Give Thor Mjolnir and hammer away at King Leonidas and his Spartan Warriors making a last stand for Greeece. Or, turn the tables with Odysseus wielding Artemis's Bow and feed Viking kings to the Minotaur. Make the right moves, and be remembered for all time. Make the wrong moves, and be lost to the ages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an expansion set for the original Heroes of History card game, featuring Midnight Riders (Revolutionary War) and Echoes of the Plains (Civil War). You do NOT need the first set to play the second set. They can be played together or separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 players minimum; supports up to 4. The object is to reduce your opponent's State Points from 50 to 0. Draw cards from your deck, play Combatants like Thor, the Argonauts, Erik Bloodaxe, and Odysseus to the Trench and power them up with Weapon cards, including Artemis's Bow and Mjolnir. Play Supply cards to change the game situation. Zeus's Thunderbolt smites your opponent's entire War Zone, or use Danegeld to steal their State Points! Battlefields give bonuses to your side: will you battle in Valhalla or Troy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fully stand-alone game, but components can be combined with the original Heroes of History for a completely unique experience. Want Loki to shoot a Gatling gun? YOU can make it happen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
