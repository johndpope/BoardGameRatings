							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Urbania</name>
									
			<description>A game for the people and their right to protest! Here you have it! The board game of rally, riot, protest and riot control, not necessarily in that order. What would you do? If all the people in a city that have something to protest about, actually did? Seven different rally groups are marching the streets and numerous heat squads are trying to maintain order while tension rises to a peak. Reporters are exposing the facts in the media sometimes in a good way, other times in a way that seems like slander to some. In Urbania, you are in control of a group of people that march to protest about their rights. During that march you will clash with heat squads, reporters, other rally groups and the ultimate choice: to lead your group to vindication, or accept the rule of the system and maintain order in your city. Order and chaos in a game of urban instability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains: 24 city squares 7 player&amp;rsquo;s groups 110 cards 2 six sided dice 35 tokens 63 markers 1 victory track 1 rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWARDS.&lt;br/&gt;Urbania has been awarded with the best theme and best game mechanic award in BGG's 1st Greek board game design contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
