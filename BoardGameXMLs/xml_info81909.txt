			<description>Child-sized dominoes designed with colorful pictures to encourage your children to learn numbers, counting, colors, and to associate common objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this game are 28 dominoes, each with an animal on the right and an animal shelter on the left. The objective of this game is to match the animal to its proper shelter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;-Place all the dominoes upside down on the playing surface&lt;br/&gt;-Each player draws 7 dominoes and sets them up in front of himself. The remaining dominoes constitute the bank.&lt;br/&gt;-Determine the starting player. The game begins with the play of the first domino.&lt;br/&gt;-The next player must fine one of the two playable dominoes. It must be played to the left or the right of the starting domino.&lt;br/&gt;-If the next player does not have a playable domino, one is drawn from the bank. If the domino drawn is playable, it may be played. If not playable, that turn to play is lost.&lt;br/&gt;-The game is to proceed in this manner until a player is out of dominoes. The first player out of dominoes is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Back of the box, Directions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Picture Dominoes except that each number-picture is divided up into two separate items that can only be combined a specific way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
