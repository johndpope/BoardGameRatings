			<description>In Vikings Can Fly! you play as Bjorn, a young viking inventor with an incredible passion for women and a laboratory full of weird machineries.He actually never created something really useful to his people because he is always too busy running after young ladies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few days ago he casually met a valkyrie that was bathing by a waterfall and he suddenly fell in love. She obviously ran away; leaving a sweet perfume trail along her path. His dream is to find her back all the way through the nine worlds of the Norse Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will he be able to use his genius this time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
