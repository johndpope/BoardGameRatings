							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nemar&#039;s Truancy</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prince Nemar has retreated to a hidden family shrine to meditate and avoid his dutiful responsibilities, particularly being the next in the order of succession to his uncle&amp;rsquo;s throne. Although he is required back in the capital, the majority of governmental duties has been quietly maintained by a cadre of advisors for a generation. The royalty has been a figurehead since Nemar&amp;rsquo;s great-uncle Ombel. Regardless, Nemar doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to have much of a part of it. The general public is not aware of his royal truancy, and news of his absence could give the court&amp;rsquo;s enemies the will to make a move. The party is tasked with discreetly contacting him and retrieving him safely to the palace, by force, if necessary... The shrine lies within the Grizzly Eye Cave, many leagues from the palace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
