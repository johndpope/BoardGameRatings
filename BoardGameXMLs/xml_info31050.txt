							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Run for President</name>
									
			<description>Described in the book Calculate!, Run for President is a representation of the Electoral College system for selecting a President of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play makes use of a calculator - floating point division is used at the start to seed the game.  Beyond that point, the process could also be done simply by hand (multiplication by a single digit).  The first three digits of the resulting number  gives the state and number of votes cast in that state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all states have at least one vote cast in them, the game ends.  The player with the highest number of votes cast in the state wins the state and scores points equal to the electoral votes the state has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
