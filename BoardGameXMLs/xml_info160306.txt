							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Busiris RPG: The Temples</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than in many roleplaying games, Busiris is dominated by its Deities. The people of the Empire worship six main Deities and a host of minor spirits and their ancestors. This worship is direct and heartfelt, there are no atheists in the Empire as the evidence of these deities&amp;rsquo; existence is seen every day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing happens in the Empire without the acquiescence of the Temples, and even the Emperor - a living Deity himself, has to take into account their needs and wishes. A wise Emperor will set each Temple off against its rivals, a foolish one will be dominated by one or more of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
