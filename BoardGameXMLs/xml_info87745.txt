			<description>This is a climbing game that has the rare status as being regarded as good for 2 players.  It uses a 48 card deck, with three 2's and one Ace removed.  Like Big Two or Tien Len, the 2 is high, Ace's next, and the remaining cards normal down to three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allowable plays are singles, pairs, triplets, runs singles (5+ cards), consecutive pairs or triplets (2+ sets), full house (triplet+pair), and bombs (four of a kind plus an additional card, except for aces, where its a triplet plus an additional card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played for points - you get as many points as are remaining in your opponent's hand, unless he is holding 16, 15, or 14 cards, in which case you would just get 50, 40, or 30 points (respectively).  A typical threshold for winning the game is 60 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
