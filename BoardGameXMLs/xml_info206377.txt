							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows of Brimstone: Flesh Stalker &amp; Flesh Drones Deluxe Enemy Pack</name>
									
			<description>Flesh Stalkers are a mysterious, rare, and ancient alien race. Masters of super science and the macabre, they work in the shadows, only emerging when required to accomplish their fiendish goals! Known for the ruthless and gruesome experiments they perform, the Flesh Stalkers splice the DNA and body parts of various creatures and people together, creating hideous monstrosities to do their bidding. Of all their wretched constructs, the most numerous are the Flesh Drones; mindless automatons cobbled together from the hapless souls stolen in the night by the Stalker, mixed with metal and madness to form the perfect hive of worker drones. When not in use, they are stored, dormant, on rows of hooks, hanging from the ceiling by the crude handles attached to their backs...waiting to be activated for the next call to harvest new bio-material and bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Deluxe Enemy Pack contains everything you need to add the sinister Flesh Stalker and his gruesome Flesh Drone minions to your games of Shadows of Brimstone! Included are 6 Flesh Drone models and 1 Flesh Stalker large model, the 2 large Enemy Record Sheets for them, a host of new cards themed around the Flesh Stalker - including all of the Threat Cards needed to add them to your games, and 2 new Missions focusing on these deadly new Enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
