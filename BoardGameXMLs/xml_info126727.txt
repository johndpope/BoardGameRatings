			<description>Fantail Volleyball is another board game of the line Fantail dedicated to sports. It is a board game didactic and very entertaining, where two teams develop Volleyball in a board game by using (2) smart charts each.

Smart charts begin with a decision, the player can choose float or power stroke. Then the dice 12-sided role, according to the number thrown, will derive on smart charts in different variants, which can result on hitting the ball by the forwards, or produce the opposing team simple, double or triple block, or the recovery or loss of the ball, or the obtaining or loss of the point at stake.&lt;br/&gt;The symbology printed on the game board is in direct relation to the symboligy printed on smart charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
