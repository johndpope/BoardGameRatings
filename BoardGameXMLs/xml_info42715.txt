			<description>Use custom dice to build, attack, and defend dice structures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase, players simultaneously build one of six possible structures by connecting the dots on their dice. Each structure has its own advantages. Points are awarded based on how many dice are used, and players can earn bonus points by being the fastest builder or by building certain structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase, each player attempts to damage his opponent's structure using a battle die, which determines how he may attack his target. The battle die may be flicked, tossed, or dropped in an attempt to move the dice in the structure. Points are awarded to both players based on the success of the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to earn 100 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Connect the Dots: Build and Destroy! is a combination of dexterity, strategy, and puzzle-solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
