			<description>&amp;quot;Adventure at Sea - The great submarine hunt&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An abstract naval strategy game for 2 players. One player is the submarine commander and controls a mothership-submarine and nine mini-subs; the other is the surface commander and controls a fleet of sixteen destroyers. The board has an asymmetric (roughly 10 by 16) grid on which the vessels move; initial setup is printed on the board and is always the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several exit points at the edges of the grid. The goal of the submarine commander is to take the mothership off the board through an exit point; the surface commander tries to prevent this and capture the mothership. (For the purpose of the victory condition, the mini-subs and destroyers are expendable.) Both sides can capture the other's vessels by sandwiching an enemy vessel between two of their own. Captured vessels are removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board also has several &amp;quot;military secrets&amp;quot;; by placing any of his vessels on such a space the sub commander forces the surface commander to remove one destroyer (her choice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes one rules variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hnefatafl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
