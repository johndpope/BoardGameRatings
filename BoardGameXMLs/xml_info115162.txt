			<description>Reach for the skies in this wacky skyscraper construction game! In Tower Bloxx Deluxe, your task is to build brand new homes for the Tower Toons &amp;ndash; funny little people who move in and turn the lights on before they even have a roof over their heads!&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;ldquo;Play Story&amp;rdquo; mode the mayor A.Z. Millspaugh and city architect Ava Dandelion of Sycamore Vale has asked you, a renowned tower builder, to quickly help in rebuilding the city since the old residences are falling apart. Luckily your amazing building block system is perfect for the job! And you have Ava to guide you all the way!&lt;br/&gt;In Quick Game mode your goal is to make your tower as high as possible and only your improving building skills set the limit to how high you can really go. In Time Challenge mode you get to see how well you do under pressure. In Party Game mode up to four people can build towers on the same machine with split-screen fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
