							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ark of Animals: Alternative Board Promo</name>
									
			<description>Ark of Animals is the first release by Historical Games Factory targeted mainly at younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the players help Noah fill the Ark with animals and save them from Flood. They do it by simultaneously drawing animal tiles from the pool and placing them face down on their boards. Players score points for being the first to fill the Ark, collecting the most mammals, collecting sets of three different birds, reptiles or amphibians, etc. They should also remember not to place herbivores next to predators, as carnivores will simply try to eat other animals. The game has various difficulty levels, introducing the possibility to balance the Ark's sides and managing grain supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alternative Board  is a promo sheet available at SPIEL 2014 at the publisher's booth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new board with a bigger number of spaces is given to the player with the fewest points after each of three rounds. In this way they have a bigger chance to score more points in the next round to keep up with the rest of the players. The promo also offers an alternative scoring method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
