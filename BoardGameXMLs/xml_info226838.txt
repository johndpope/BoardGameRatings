			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Maul Villain Pack, you can bring one of the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s deadliest Force users to your games of Imperial Assault, either as a powerful piece in the Imperial player's greater campaign designs or as an independent member of the Mercenary faction, ready to join any skirmish army that might allow him to further his own interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In either case, you'll find Maul eager to claim vengeance. To that end, he may be willing to stick to the Coruscant shadows and skyrises for a short time, stalking his prey, but it won't be long before his rage and fury get the better of him. Then, when Maul leaps into the fray with his iconic dual-bladed lightsaber, you'll find him more than capable of cutting cleanly through the defenses of any who stand against him. And while much about this former Sith is shrouded in mystery, you'll quickly learn that he's sustained by rage and almost always looking for a fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require the Heart of the Empire expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
