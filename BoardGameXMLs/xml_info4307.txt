			<description>A tactical simulation for two players between Russian and German armour 1944 - 1945. There are 12 scenarios and the counters display individual vehicles, artillery and infantry sections.  A small tactical wargame that plays like a miniatures game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swedish Game Production was located in Kisa, Sweden and Kowloon, Hong Kong.  Game includes:  260 hundred large counters, three 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; colored maps, 15 page rulebook, player charts, and a box.
