			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s that squishy popping sound?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walking anywhere in the wastelands of The Mutant Epoch is always risky, but swamps pose a whole new level of peril. That squishy patch of ground your character just walked onto wasn&amp;rsquo;t as safe a step as it looked, and with a squeal, a popping noise and the flash of piranha-like teeth, you&amp;rsquo;re PC just encountered a brood of clingers freshly jettisoned from a Back Hatcher!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by Brandon Goeringer, this new Creature of the Apocalypse is number seven in the lineup of free monsters for The Mutant Epoch post-apocalyptic RPG. Get this 6 page PDF which includes stats for both the adult and clinger variants of this terrible new creature. The document includes a random mutation listing and robust, multi use d100 loot table for items left behind by previous victims of the dreaded Back Hatcher. Also included is a full page player handout view of the image from the cover, but without the cover text so you, the GM, can hold it up and say &amp;ldquo;This is what you&amp;rsquo;re mutant just stepped on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although crafted for The Mutant Epoch role-playing game, using the Outland System Game Mechanic, a GM can easily modify the stats for the Back Hatcher and use the beast with another post-apocalyptic game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
