							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Animal Snacks</name>
									
			<description>The hungry animals have gathered around for snack time! It's up to you to feed these animals and quiet their rumbling tummies. The active player rolls the die and moves the corresponding animals from one player to the next until they roll a snack. Then all players get to feed their animals! The first player to feed all of their snack to the animals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pure luck game to teach the youngest players on following rules, matching (colors and animal pieces) and taking turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
