			<description>Boardgame of the French and Indian War in North America.  Mounted, color mapboard measures 22&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot;.  Map features significant land and water routes used in the period.  Inset maps are included for high seas naval movement and tactical battle resolution.  176 two-sided mounted and die-cut counters represent regular and militia, Indians, fortresses and fleets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reinforcements from Europe are variable depending on naval activity.  Militia must be &amp;quot;mustered,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;go home&amp;quot; at the end of each campaign year.  Natives are influenced by &amp;quot;gifts and supplies&amp;quot; and by battlefield victories.  Road, Indian trail and Water movement all have key roles in operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles occur between opposing forces occupying the same point.  Engagements take place on an inset map determined by terrain and situation: &amp;quot;Attacking/Defending Fort,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Open Ground,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Wood&amp;quot; (forested) or &amp;quot;Landing.&amp;quot;  Modifiers apply depending on whether engaged units are Regulars, Militia, or Indians, Rangers and Couriers de Bois.  Units engaging in battle line up opposite one another.  A &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; is determined by a D6 roll of &amp;quot;6.&amp;quot;  Die rolls are modified according to unit type and battle setting (Regulars defending a fort, for example, are &amp;quot;plus 2&amp;quot;, hitting on a four or better).  All units, except Iroquois, are flipped on the first hit and eliminated on the second.  At the start of his/her battle turn, a player may elect to &amp;quot;retreat&amp;quot; in lieu of firing.  Retreating units move to an adjacent friendly point, preferably toward their Base of Operations.  At the end of a victorious battle, flipped pieces are turned back to full strength, and one victorious militia unit, if present, may be &amp;quot;promonted&amp;quot; to a Regular or Ranger (British) or a &amp;quot;Troop of the Marine battalion&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Courier de Bois&amp;quot; (French).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortresses can be built; Towns and Fortresses can be burned.  Supply is critical at the end of a campaign year; all Regular and militia units must occupy either a town or fort, or is not connected by a red road (not trail).  They  must be able to trace supply by road or waterway to their Base of Operations (Montreal or Quebec for the French; Boston, New York or Philadelphia for the British).  Regular or militia units which fail these conditions are eliminated unless they are in a seaport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The powerful Iroquois Nation is key to victory.  Three of the six Iroquois tribes begin aligned with each side (the counters are two-sided).  After each battle, the victor of that battle flips one Iroquois unit to his/her side.  Any time a player begins his/her turn with all six tribes oriented to his/her side, the Iroquois have joined him/her for the duration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other twenty tribes are activated to support the French either by the activities of the Couriers de Bois, or by French bribes (&amp;quot;gifts and supplies&amp;quot;).  Except for the Iroquois, Native tribes usually &amp;quot;go home&amp;quot; after a victory (to celebrate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is determined by conquest.  The French must begin a turn, or end the game, holding Albany and one of New York, Boston or Philadelphia, or must deny the British their victory conditions.  The British must hold a total of three French cities from the list of Louisbourg, Frontenac, Duquesne, Montreal or Quebec (at least one must be Montreal or Quebec).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
