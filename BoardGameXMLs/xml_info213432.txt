							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Agent A - A puzzle In disguise</name>
									
			<description>Agent A is a spy themed puzzle game for Smartphones, Tablets and erm&amp;hellip; Shoephones?! Your mission (should you choose to accept of course) is to infiltrate enemy spy Ruby La Rouge&amp;rsquo;s secret hideaway and catch her! Uncover a stylish 60s themed world full of hidden contraptions and clever logic based puzzles. Oh and do be careful, Miss La Rouge has a taste for dismissing agents such as yourself...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins outside of Ruby&amp;rsquo;s secret hideaway. You need to work out how to get inside the lair and catch her. You play through the eyes of Agent A with interaction reminiscent to &amp;lsquo;The Room&amp;rsquo; but with more of an emphasis on logical inventory based puzzles. Collecting items and working out how to use them throughout the house is the core functionality of the game. We have really placed an emphasis on making clever puzzles that are logic based. Puzzles that reward the player for being observant and taking mental notes (like a good agent would) as opposed to those kind of adventure/puzzle games where you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re just trying out random items until they work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 15 rooms to explore, 30 inventory based puzzles and 20 puzzle screens. The game is built in 3D; however, the art is designed in a 2D illustrative style based on a 1960s retro feel to add some charm to the visuals. As you traverse through the space, panels and objects all open or reveal in a 3D way while still looking quite stylized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
