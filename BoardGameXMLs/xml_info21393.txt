			<description>The chess-like board is mostly water, with &amp;quot;islands&amp;quot; in the middle. Each player has a homeland in a corner of the board with 3 ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are naval vessels, aircraft, air/naval bases and construction units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players purchase units with money and fight it out their military units to become the richest player by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full set includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 fact sheets (purchase prices, move/fire/range info)&lt;br/&gt;Money (play money)&lt;br/&gt;Equipment pieces for 4 countries&lt;br/&gt;4 Flag markers&lt;br/&gt;Generic air &amp;amp; naval base markers and damage markers&lt;br/&gt;2 air-range measures&lt;br/&gt;4 dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not sure how many of these were produced; mine is an original, mimeographed in a printed folder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
