							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hastings 14 Ottobre 1066</name>
									
			<description>One of the only two tactical wargames produced by the New Deal company. Italian language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Hastings is one of the few truly decisive battles in history. On a single day Duke William of Normandy conquered a kingdom that had resisted Viking invasions for years on end, ending a line of Anglo-Saxon kings that claim decent from Alfred the Great. This conquest altered the whole outlook of England, taking a nation that had looked towards Scandinavia, especially under three Danish kings, and locking her into a partnership and a struggle with France that was to last for centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
