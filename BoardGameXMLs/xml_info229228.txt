							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Spider: A Fellowship Expansion Pack</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am here to help. You do not believe me yet. But you will, in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have common cause. We are very different. We are all the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death lies before us. An Overlord's cunning plan. Soon, devastation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But not yet, not now. We can be more cunning still. A chance lies with us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New hope blossoms here. This fellowship needs many. We have but a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am here to help. Spiders know much and see more. My webs keep you safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am the Spider. I await our victory. I await our prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spider is the fifth Fellowship expansion pack. The Spider specializes in traps, surprises, and lies, using trickery and patience to get things done. They have the tools to get the upper hand in any situation. They watch, they wait, they plan, they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spider is a hero unlike any other. They are strange, different, out of place. They don't like taking center stage, preferring to watch from the shadows and strike at the perfect moment. Play as the Spider if you like planning and traps, if you want to be strange and weird, if you like to tell lies and play tricks, or if you just think spiders and bugs are super cool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion also adds Traps to the game. Traps are an item tag that requires you to set up in advance to make use of them, but allows you to trigger them later no matter where you are or what else you're doing. Traps are very powerful, but require forethought and planning to use effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every core Fellowship playbook has new Gear options in this expansion, giving them access to these new toys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
