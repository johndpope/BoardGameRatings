			<description>Blindes Huhn: Maus &amp;amp; Habicht adds mice and hawk cards to the Blindes Huhn base game, along with job cards that &amp;mdash; if completed &amp;mdash; provide as many points at the end of the game as the number of players who contributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion brings two options which can be implemented to the base game independent from each other, but can be added to the game both together too right from the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;Mice and Hawks: Take a mouse for every chicken card you acquire during the auction phase showing a mouse. Take a hawk for every hawk on a chicken card you get during an auction (not in case of payment by another player). At the end of the game, every hawk eats a mouse (and a blind hen, if there is no mouse in your display) and every surviving mouse eats a corn.&lt;br/&gt;Mission/Job cards: draw randomly two or three of these cards and keep them secret from the other players. When scoring, prove that you have met the requirements of your mission cards and earn additional points. Missions are different, for example collect a minimum of specific cards (value 1, 2, 3 or 4) or a sequence in a common color (green 1-2-3-4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
