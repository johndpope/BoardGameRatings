			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are defined by Vocation (somewhat like a very loose Class), which in turn provides a template for the types of things the character is good at doing.  Characters also have several Traits that identify their unique abilities, as well as demographic data and a visual depiction.  It is possible to introduce a character to the game mid-scenario (essentially by &amp;quot;calling for reinforcements&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution (and elements of plot development) involve a card game played with a stripped pack of French playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
