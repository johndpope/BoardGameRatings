							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deathstalkers (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deathstalkers is a very unique game. It is designed around a rules system that allows Players to create customizable characters that are life-like and unique and build them into powerful beings of their own imagination and crafting. In combat, Players must use strategy and cunning to overcome their foes - not just dice rolls - and it also allows experienced Players to pull off combination maneuvres that will utterly devastate their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;Even weak, low experience characters will be able to take on powerful adversaries provided that the Players are masters of the Deathstalkers system of combat and use tactical teamwork! Deathstalkers rewards clever Players; not just those who get lucky with the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deathstalkers is set in a dark, mysterious, horror filled world that is teeming with ghastly creatures and horrific monsters. The lands have been elaborately brought to life, as described in the World Guide, and such things as monsters, beasts and Gods have all been detailed to bring you a full-fledged world of terror, suspense and fright. The rules and combat system have been seamlessly woven into the adventuring atmosphere to bring mature gamers the best action, adventure and treasure seeking excitement they could ever ask for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are based on a race and a skill. You race (choice of seventeen different ones, plus some variations between subraces and genders) will determine what dice you may roll to determine you attributes. In addition, it will give you some special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;Your class will determine what skills you have access to, your combat bonuses and magical abilities, if any. In addition, there is an optional rule to determine a birth sign for each character, which will give some further bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features an elaborate combat system (the Strategic Combat System), and the book includes a big list of equipment and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
