			<description>Bear's Claw is two-games-in-one; featuring two separate and standalone, operational-level treatments of the German advance and the Soviet counter attack from July to August 1941 during Operation Barbarossa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kiev-Uman covers the action of German Army Group South, from the beginning of Soviet bold counterattack on 26 June led by the Soviet South-Western Front comprising four full mechanized corps (more than 2,000 tanks), to the closing of the Uman Pocket on 6 August.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smolensk covers the action of German Army Group Center, from the German 2nd Panzergruppe's crossing of the Dnepr on 11 July, followed by numerous Soviet counterattacks of the Soviet Western Front led by Marshal Timoshenko, to the climax of operations at Smolensk on 9 August.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both games share a common set of rules and deliver a quick, yet intensive gaming experience as BOTH sides will have the opportunity to initiate attacks during play. In essence, these are not one-sided affairs as the pendulum will swing in the Soviet's favor as well as they attempt to mount several counter blows to thwart the German advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE (8 Dec 2013): Consim Press is upgrading the components to the game. The half map sheet will now be a full 22x34&amp;quot; map sheet and the counter size is increasing from 1/2&amp;quot; to 9/16&amp;quot; counters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE (26 Feb 2015): Check out both counter sheets in the Images section. These are the new, larger 9/16&amp;quot; counters for the game to complement the larger, full-sized map. Bear's Claw will be released in 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now available for preorder from Consim Press&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
