							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Ten Football Game</name>
									
			<description>Rules for this game were extrapolated from the AGPC Online rules archives;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Ten Football&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice driven football game from the late 1920's produced by the Sanwah Keen Game Co., 625 East Market Street, Stockton, California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is played over a 20 minute time-frame divided into 10 minute halves. Game has board with results listed depending on if a pass or run is called by the Offensive player. Different codes show Penalties, Fumbles, Interceptions etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One unusual feature of the game is a connotation at the bottom of the rule book which states that; &amp;quot;The Big Ten game board provides an excellent medium for following football games as they are broadcasted play by play over the radio. When used for this purpose the dice are of course discarded. By following the broadcasted game in this manner an accurate picture of every situation is presented to the audience at all times.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
