			<description>Reel Fishing III (known as Fish Eyes 3 in Japan) is a fishing game about a man and his dog. You get a letter from your friend from your childhood. He says that he will be going out of town for a bit and requests that you look over his lodge, named &amp;quot;The Aqua Lodge.&amp;quot; You eventually befriend a dog and find pages of your friend's journal as a reward for accomplishing fishing goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reel Fishing III is based around freshwater fishing.Unlike Reel Fishing II, players are restricted to fish in freshwater, as to make the story feel more realistic.It ranges from bass fishing, trout fishing,mountain fishing, stream fishing and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Reel Fishing III&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
