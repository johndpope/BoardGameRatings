			<description>Entour is a roll and move travel game with an educational objective. The board is a linear track of 38 destinations starting from a Port of Departure and ending in a Port of Arrival. There is no rhyme or reason to the order of the destinations, which are literally all over the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player or non-player acts as the Tour Director, and holds the pack of Destination Cards (which list a variety of information about each destination. There are three piles of Itinerary Cards labelled Day 1, Day 3, and Day 6. Each player starts with $3,430. Each destination has a landing fee, starting at $300 for the first destination, Antigua, and rising to $1,000 by the final one, Tokyo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls two dice and advances that many destinations. First he pays the landing fee to the bank. Second, the Tour Director asks him what he knows about that destination. If the player supplies any of the information on the destination cards, he gets rewards. Third, he may buy the destinations Investment Certificate, which pays dividends each time a player lands there. Finally, he then takes an Itinerary Card, from the Day 1 pile on turn 1, Day 3 on turn 2, Day 6 on turn 3 and rotating from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they reach the Port of Arrival, players must pay $500 and start over. The game ends as soon as one player runs out of money, and the winner is the one with the most money left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
