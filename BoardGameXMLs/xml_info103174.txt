			<description>Reise ins Tierreich: Mitbringspiel distills the essence of the board game Reise ins Tierreich, also released in 2011, into a tinier package with players once again trying to play animal cards that best other animal cards in certain values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 33 animal cards &amp;ndash; with a card showing one of six continents and one of five types of animals: mammal, amphibian, reptile, bird, fish &amp;ndash; a set of ten category tokens and four &amp;quot;dice tokens&amp;quot;. Each card shows the animal image on one side and has stats about that animal's weight, height/length, longevity and number of offspring on the other. Each player starts the game with three animal cards in hand, and the category tokens are placed in a circle with a shared pawn on one token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, she throws the dice tokens, then moves the sum of the pips being shown. If she lands on a regular category token, she can use the side showing &amp;ndash; say, &amp;quot;longevity, oldest&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; or flip the token to the other side &amp;ndash; which might be &amp;quot;offspring, fewest&amp;quot;. Each player then chooses a card in hand and reveals it simultaneously. The player whose animal best fit the category places that animal card before her and draws a replacement card. Everyone else returns their card to hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player lands on a continent or animal token, she chooses a specific continent or animal type as well as one of the four animal stats and whether players want to be high or low. Each player then chooses an animal card and reveals, with the winning player(s) placing that card before them and drawing a replacement. (A player can swap out an entire hand of cards, but must sit out the next challenge.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have five cards before her wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
