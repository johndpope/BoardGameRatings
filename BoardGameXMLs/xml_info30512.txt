							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pigeon Poop</name>
									
			<description>Mr. Boneyhead is late for work.  He just lives down the road from his office.  It'd be all so easy except for the pesky pigeon who has taken such a dislike to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the pigeon you must drive Mr. Boneyhead off the street's end.  Use any of the tricks that your cards may allow you or... well... use what nature gave you in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Mr. Boneyhead you must make it to work period.  Use your umbrella and whatever the street offers up to you in order to get there.  And if you're of a nasty frame of mind... pluck that pigeon's feathers for him.  Take enough from his tail and he'll leave you alone while the other birds laugh at his fashion faux pas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pigeon Poop... you're in my sights now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
