			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Temple of Doom! To Defeat the Ancient Evil is a short, light, RPG of adventurer archeologists and their exploits, in the style of Indiana Jones, the Mummy, and many other action films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an expert archeologist. In fact you&amp;rsquo;re the best in your field. Until now you&amp;rsquo;ve spent your days buried in musty tomes, toiling on dig sites, and studying artifacts to save the past. Now, you must save the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ancient evil stirs, waking deep within the bowels of an untouched temple.  An evil that will end the world as we know it. Only you and your fellow archeologists can examine the clues, unravel the mysteries, and uncover the method to subdue this terrible threat.  Yes, it is up to you to enter the Temple of Doom, find its secrets, and defeat the ancient evil before it destroys the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
