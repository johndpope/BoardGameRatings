			<description>Score a Word  --  The Crossword Game Craze&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is remarkably similar to Scrabble.  Players have racks of letter tiles which they use to build words, crossword style on a board.  The letters have point values according to their frequency in the language.  &lt;br/&gt;The Board does not have the Bonus spaces as the Scrabble board does, however. Instead, every space has two Premium letters written in the corner.  Players able to play a matching letter on premium space during to course of play scores double or triple for that letter.  Players successfully placing two or more premium letters in a word score double or triple for the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
