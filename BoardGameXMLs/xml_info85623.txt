							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fantastic Science: A Technologist Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic and technology have a complex relationship in Fantasy d20 games, and seldom are both powerful in any given setting, since the ideals of modern science can clash with the style of fantasy roleplaying. In these pages, however, you will find an entirely new spellcasting tradition that wields elaborate technology and commands the laws of fantasy pseudo-science, designed to let this particular brand of science make sense in the hands of classic sword-and-sorcery adventurers. The Fantastic Science presents hundreds of devices of varying power levels, from clockwork-and-alchemy gadgets to reality-warping artifacts, as well as a 20-level base class, the technologist, which is designed to take advantage of these technological wonders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fantastic Science &amp;ndash; A Technologist Sourcebook is a sourcebook for Fantasy D20 (with a rules appendix including variants for Modern games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust off the ol' atomic discombobulator. Ready your portable zoogrammaphone. Slip into your cross-phasic cloak. The Fantastic Science is here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
