			<description>&amp;quot;Can Superboy Escape The Deadly Green Kryptonite?&amp;quot; Board has great action scene showing Superboy with spaceship as missiles fly toward him, and Krypto rides a rocket at the corner. The game ends on a &amp;quot;Kryptonite&amp;quot; square. There is a spinner attached to the cardboard insert and from the board it appears to be a simple spin and move game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was one of three games published by Hasbro in 1965 - one each for Batman, Superman and Superboy. SUPERBOY appears to be quite rare and is clearly valued by collectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
