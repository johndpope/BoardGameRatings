			<description>A trivia game produced by &amp;quot;Deutsche Wanderjugend&amp;quot;, a German hiking organisation for young people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 360 cards, a frog clicker and 50 chits. The cards are used to build a one-meter long path. The card backs have path segments, bridges and turns printed on them. In order to be allowed to add a card to the path, one has to complete a task or answer a question from the card. The cards come in 4 different categories, but they are all related to hiking, conservation, youth politics and youth culture, and knowledge about the &amp;quot;Deutsche Wanderjugend&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Questions come in different levels of difficulty and players earn different numbers of chits (&amp;quot;Wandertaler&amp;quot;) accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the path has been completed. The team with the most chits wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
