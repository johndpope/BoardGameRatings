							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms &amp; Encounters: Gormoth the Ever-Hungry</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even as you approach this darkened chamber, you are overwhelmed by the offensively pungent odor of rotting dung. The stonework here seems different then the rest of the dungeon, strangely out of place, as does the symmetrically awkward structure of the room. Pillars line the room, spaced 5-feet from the outer walls in 10-foot intervals. Unfortunately, your examination of the room is cut quick by several monstrous bellows and the pounding of feet as a huge, multi-headed saurian beast charges at you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover Gormoth the Ever-Hungry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive The Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 9, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
