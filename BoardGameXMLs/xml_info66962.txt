							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Orchard</name>
									
			<description>An orchard is an artificially cultivated land where fruit trees are grown mainly to serve as human food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The orchard has a variety of fruit species found but in particular apples, pears and cherries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high harvest costs, the difficult years and disease control make fruit trees fall into disuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;You're a fruit farmer who harvests fruit (apples, pears and cherries) from a common orchard, where you struggle with fellow growers to meet the specific demand of the market to harvest healthier, tastier and better quality fruit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good fruit is scarce, harvesting expensive and not enough ladders available but only fruit growers know how to preserve fruit quality even when fruit tree abandonment takes place due to difficult years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a fruit grower you need to make sure that the quality of your fruit will be rated as high as possible and need to keep fruit harvesting costs under control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
