			<description>The Tell Your Story RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to New Worlds, an easy-to-play role playing game that lets you tell the story you&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to tell. In the game, each player creates a character, a fictional identity that exists in the world of the story. Each character has certain strengths and weaknesses, defined by his or her player as the game begins. In New Worlds, the players&amp;rsquo; characters are heroes like those found in movies and books. They can be just like your favorite novel or film hero, or a completely original creation. New Worlds is designed for characters of all types, from children and their animal friends exploring the world around them, to &amp;quot;super cops&amp;quot; busting drug dealers and gangsters, to mythological gods and goddesses struggling over the fate of planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
