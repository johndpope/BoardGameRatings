			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do when all has been done?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tiny, folded storytelling game. Beyond the Beyond is set in the most distant imaginable future, where life takes on an infinite variety of form and all things are possible. The story's protagonist faces many foes and challenges, but none more deadly than those who were once considered friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print it out double-sided. Fold in half, then in half, then in half, keeping the game's title visible after each fold. Heck, you can even make copies and hand them out at your local gaming store! The whole thing is covered by a Creative Commons license, so as long as you don't sell it or remove the author's name, you can do whatever you want with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
