							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OPFOR Insurgency II</name>
									
			<description>OPFOR Insurgency II is the new, solitaire version of the old OPFOR Insurgency series from Warcoach Games.  The new version is not only solitaire but incorporates all the best features of the previous Insurgency versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this version, you lay down a grid of cards representing various terrain in your command area.  Underneath are secretly placed a variety of cards that could be decoys or real insurgency units of various sizes.  One card is a HVT (High Value Target). You draw a random hand and have 3 turns to find and destroy the HVT using those resources.  Your resources could include intel units to help you locate the HVT, combat units to destroy it or any insurgents, support units to add strength to your combat units, or local national units to help in both intel and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
