			<description>&amp;quot;The most versatile game of the century&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's an exciting and fast paced word game where everyone has an equal chance to play every turn. It's a game you can play with your grandparents or your grandchildren and everyone in between. Best of all, it's a family fun game where the only limit is your imagination.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the base game, three random letter cards are revealed, and first player to call out a word containing all three of the letters gets to add it to their score sheet. First player to 11 words wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five other variant rule sets included, such as &amp;quot;Point Jomack&amp;quot;, where longer words are better - you get additional points for each added letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
