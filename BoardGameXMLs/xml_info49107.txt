							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demons of the Dying Earth</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Demons of the Dying Earth' does not offer reckless instructions on how to create and play witches and warlocks, nor how to use demonic forces to casually attack your foes - for such would make a mockery of the dangerous and blasphemous nature of the awful demonic legacy of previous aeons. Instead we provide the resources to fully describe occult horrors, insane archenemies, cruel and secretive demonic cults, and dangerous journeys to the bizarre sub-worlds. Those magicians who do wish to take up demonology as magical specialty can expect to suffer awful consequences for their taste of power &amp;ndash; possibly to turn up again as a superior henchman to the campaign&amp;rsquo;s most intractable foe. For the path of demonism soon turns its adherents to utter evil! (In advanced campaigns, Diabolist characters may to some extent break this ruling - but even they study demons and sub-worlds as an abstract pedantic specialty &amp;ndash; rather than through personal involvement.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents specifically include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     numerous demons (various types &amp;ndash; and their drives and powers)&lt;br/&gt;     new spells (for demons, witches, diabolists, and witch-finders)&lt;br/&gt;     an overview of several subworlds&lt;br/&gt;     the Kaiin Witch-Cult&lt;br/&gt;     the Green Legion of Valdaran the Just&lt;br/&gt;     demonic (and anti-demonic) magical items&lt;br/&gt;     new tweaks to enhance the demonic elements of your campaign&lt;br/&gt;     several highly detailed scenario outlines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expect in Demons of the Dying Earth to discover a brand new angle on Dying Earth RPG: foes that even the most jaded of magicians and adventurers will find sufficiently abhorrent to unite them in their attempts to outwit, evade, thwart and destroy their mutual enemy. But beware, for your most favourite spells may prove useless against beings of other dimensions, and even your precious magical adjuncts may lack efficacy. A new world lurks amidst the shadows of the old!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But perhaps the greatest change is in the overall tone of the game. Gone are the tales of flashy bravado and erudite linguistics (although please feel free to keep them if you wish; after all, this is for your entertainment). Instead there is danger, intrigue and great reward for those brave enough to search for it (as long as they are prepared to pay the often heavy price). The boundaries are less clear, the morals potentially more dubious. The noble succeed and the wicked fall prey to their vanities. Are there shades of grey? Perhaps, but perhaps the world is more clear-cut than you previously thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
