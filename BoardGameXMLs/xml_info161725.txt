			<description>SpeeDeck includes a set of cards, chips, cubes, and a stick. With these simple components you can play 5 different and unique games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Chicken Run (2 players - 15min)&lt;br/&gt;Each player is the driver of a car hurtling toward their opponent. Two cards are played from the players' hands each turn to determine the car mileage and position in a wall of fog. Without hitting, who can get the closest? Who will blink first?!?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Best Pitching (3-4 players - 30min)&lt;br/&gt;In this speedy trick-taking game, players take on the role of a baseball pitcher attempting to win a game! The number of tricks which can be taken in a single round is determined in advance. Players compete for the specified number of rounds to get the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Tumbling Dust (3 players - 15min)&lt;br/&gt;Attempt to read the hands of the other players or you'll be at the mercy of the strong winds! Players can change the wind strength, direction, and movement of other players with the goal of collecting the most wind blown garbage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Document Sort (2 players - 5min)&lt;br/&gt;This is a real-time card sorting race between two players. Players compete to make a set arranged in numerical order before their opponent. Quick judgment and hand speed will be needed to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Parachute Dive (1 player - 10min)&lt;br/&gt;Sky diving solitaire! Is it possible to land safely by controlling your rate of fall!? This game is played in two rounds. In round one, the player attempts to successfully deploy their parachute. In round two, the player has to land with their feet on the ground! Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
