			<description>A fun and exciting real-time party game where you work to discard all your cards by matching with other players and performing island themed actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the same time, everyone flips the top card of their deck face-up and shouts the name of their card searching for another player who has the same card.  If more than two players shout the same action the first two players to connect with each other complete that action and then discard their cards to the center of the table.  They each flip their next card face-up and shout that action looking for a match. Players can match with any other player, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve already matched before. If you can&amp;rsquo;t find a match with another player, move your top card to the bottom of your deck and flip over a new card. Continue playing until one player has discarded all their cards and says &amp;ldquo;Mahalo!&amp;rdquo;  They are the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
