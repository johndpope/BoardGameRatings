			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of multi-classing, just to get one ability from a certain class? Perhaps you wanted to be a Rogue with a few spells, but the &amp;quot;Singing&amp;quot; Bard was not appealing. Maybe you wanted to be a nature warrior, but did not desire all the spells from the Ranger class? Have you ever wanted a mage who could rage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever thought it was silly to adventure for weeks and weeks without ever showing improvement, but then you hit a ?magic? number of xp and BAM: all of your abilities increase? Has your character ever traveled into a new land and you asked the GM if you could try and learn the local language? But the GM had to respond &amp;quot;Sorry, you can't learn anything new until you get 4,500 more experience points.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, you no longer have to purchase libraries full of supplements, just to find a pseudo-class that suits your needs. Now you can gain skills, abilities, spells, as you go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of waiting to gain enough XP to 'level up' your character, now you can spend them 'as you go' to pick up abilities one at a time instead of en masse, allowing flexibility, customization, and noticeable improvement after every gaming session!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready to change the way you think of character advancement. Get ready to have unprecedented freedom of choice! Get ready for: Buy the Numbers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
