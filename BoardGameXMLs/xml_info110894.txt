			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Running with the dead is an entry to the 1km1kt 24hr RPG contest. This year&amp;rsquo;s flavour is a Movie Mashup competition. There is an extensive list of movies to choose from, all of them very good ones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d decided not to choose before hand, but select two at the beginning of the 24hr period. Some called this &amp;ldquo;going in cold like an echo&amp;rdquo;. However the truth is, I&amp;rsquo;m so busy with work, study, fatherhood and everything else life throws at you, I decided not to pressure myself with the competition, until I was ready to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I present to you; Running with the dead, a mash up of Blade Runner and Dusk till dawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to adhere strictly to the source material. I consider it inspiration. Almost like a ronnies competition. This game is inspired by the movies and not a deliberate attempt to fuse them wholesale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you&amp;rsquo;ll find the setting, the rules and a sample adventure. I hope you have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feedback is encouraged and should be delivered to 1km1kt.net/forum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
