Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rising Thunder is a cancelled free-to-play fighting game released on August 11, 2015 in the form of a technical alpha. The game is designed using simplified controls while maintaining depth and balance. The current build includes training mode, ranked match, and custom match. The game utilizes Tony Cannon's signature GGPO3 as a rollback netcode, making sure that matches are lagless. The game will also auto-detect frames per second.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On March 8, 2016, Radiant Entertainment was acquired by League of Legends developer Riot Games. The Cannon brothers Tom and Tony announced that Rising Thunder would be closing down on March 18, 2016 as well as saying that they would be focusing on a new game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
