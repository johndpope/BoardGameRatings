							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not long after research began at RAND in 1946, the need arose for random numbers that could be used to solve problems of various kinds of experimental probability procedures. These applications, called Monte Carlo methods, required a large supply of random digits and normal deviates of high quality, and the tables presented here were produced to meet those requirements. This book was a product of RAND's pioneering work in computing, as well a testament to the patience and persistence of researchers in the early days of RAND. The tables of random numbers in this book have become a standard reference in engineering and econometrics textbooks and have been widely used in gaming and simulations that employ Monte Carlo trials. Still the largest published source of random digits and normal deviates, the work is routinely used by statisticians, physicists, poll-takers, market analysts, lottery administrators, and quality control engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
