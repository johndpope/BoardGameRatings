			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ego Hunter  is a short adventure for Eclipse Phase. Players take on the role of different forks of the same person who work together to track down their original (alpha) self, who has gone missing and be wanted for murder. They soon find the situation is even more complicated and dangerous than it seems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ego Hunter was designed as a one-shot scenario using both provided characters and sample characters from the Eclipse Phase core rulebook but can also be modified for use in an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ego Hunter is a 40 page PDF (with repeated sample characters from the EP core rulebook for ease of use) and includes one map and some player handouts. A landscape version is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
