							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HWRS: The Hero Wellness Reward System</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles can be won or lost during the HWRS inbetween...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group makes it to the town of Lakeside just before nightfall. They head to the tavern where they&amp;rsquo;re given the choice between a common meal (2sp) or a feast (5gp). Then they head to the Inn where they can either sleep in a typical room (5sp) or surround themselves in luxury (2gp). What&amp;rsquo;s the difference? Other than the cost (and the possible role-playing opportunities that food poisoning or bedbugs present) food is food and a bed is a bed right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing the Hero Wellness Reward System for 4th Edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. HWRS (pronounced hours) is a downtime/upkeep system- rewarding players Reroll Tokens based on the quality of their time spent between adventures. The system contains 4 separate phases: Recovery, Rest, Repair, and Replenish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why else are the adventurers adventuring? There may be other motivations involved but accumulating wealth plays some part in it. At the very least it&amp;rsquo;s a beneficial side effect. Part of being a successful adventurer is having the money for the fancy meals and the luxury accommodations. And if you&amp;rsquo;re going to treat yourself to the best shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you benefit from it in return? Otherwise where&amp;rsquo;s the incentive to spend the gold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is quick and easy, using a series of modified skill challenges and a 'pay one price' mechanic, to speed the group through the process, yet its deep enough to allow plenty of roleplaying opportunities to be built around it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of the document contains a section of new magic items that can be used with the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
