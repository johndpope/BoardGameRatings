			<description>In this issue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     States of Decay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every planet in the Babylon 5 universe is a sophisticated, teeming metropolis, awash with the latest technology and confident amongst the stars. Some worlds didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make the grade. These are the Death Worlds, places just waiting to lure unwary explorers to their dooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Gangs of the Sprawl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the Mag-Lev Fluxers, the baddest street gang from the Aftermath campaign background for OGL CyberNet that we published in S&amp;amp;P #9. As well as these high-flying hoodlums there are full rules for creating your own street gang and integrating them into the OGL CyberNet Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     How It All Began&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roleplaying godfather Gary Gygax looks back at the circumstances that brought about the development of Dungeons and Dragons in the first of a new series. Get the inside story of just how the original roleplaying game came into being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Mighty Sorcery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our new tabletop wargame is going down a treat with fantasy gaming fans, and S&amp;amp;P will be providing monthly support to keep the game fresh and exciting. This month we have extra rules for new magic spells with which to vanquish your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Assassination Contracts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How often does the assassin I your party suddenly give up his day (or night) job to trundle off down dungeons in search of loot? All too often in our experience. This article gives some ideas on jobs o keep any respectable killer occupied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Mastery of the Land&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adrian Bott just couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop writing spells when he produced Encyclopaedia Arcane: Sovereign Magic. Under cover of night (or caffeine) daring S&amp;amp;P agents seized the unpublished spells and we produce them now for your delectation. Reckless, aren&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Green Unpleasant Land&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange goings on in Mansford Beck on Sea, a rural English community where some of the people appear to be related before they get married&amp;hellip;Just the sort of place you want your car to break down, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Pop in to see the local vicar or take a walk by the sea in this eerie background for OGL Horror. Just don&amp;rsquo;t get caught by the vergers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Going Underground&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first part of an exciting new series for the Judge Dredd Roleplaying Game, entitled Geography of the Undercity. Contract Big Smelly fever, meet Drek Walkers and generally hang around with the scum of the earth. It&amp;rsquo;s the back end of beyond, where only the bravest judges go...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Mighty Armies Reinforcements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stats and rules for this month&amp;rsquo;s new Mighty Armies releases, including the barbarian berserkers and war mammoth, and the Orcs&amp;rsquo; giant trebuchet and fearsome hydra tamer. Expand your armies with these great new models and drive your enemies before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     What&amp;rsquo;s In A Name? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complications of the various Hyborian cultures in Conan the Roleplaying Game can cause confusion, but fear not, for Signs &amp;amp; Portents begins a new series designed to guide you through the naming habits of the countries that make up the Hyborian world, starting with Conan&amp;rsquo;s adopted home of Aquilonia, the flower of the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Sex Presidents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s scenario is an adventure for Macho Women With Guns. In the tradition of the game it is course, irreverent politically incorrect and pretty much everything else to boot. Cloned presidents, farmyard frolics and gay bikers quoting Oscar Wilde. You&amp;rsquo;ve been warned! If you are easily offended you may want to give this article a miss. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this is the first page you will turn to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
