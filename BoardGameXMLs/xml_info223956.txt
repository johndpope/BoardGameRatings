							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Drakonheim (Savage Worlds)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Drakonheim, a three-part adventure for Savage Worlds set in the fantasy city of Drakonheim, which can be played as a stand-alone setting or incorporated into any larger fantasy world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Chapter 1: Rats in the Sewers, the heroes are asked to solve a series of mysterious disappearances. They follow the trail into the sewers, find the goblins responsible, and learn that they are selling dead bodies to a shadowy group of humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Chapter 2: Skeletal Society, the heroes discover that the group purchasing the corpses is a cabal of necromancers calling itself the Gray Society. In the process, they may stumble upon a nest of wights, some of the society&amp;rsquo;s storehouses, and perhaps even one of their initiation ceremonies. These encounters lead to a final confrontation with the leader of the Gray Society, who implores the heroes to end their grudge against them. The Gray Society is animating a host of undead to combat an even greater threat: a mighty force of hobgoblins and their allies marching towards Drakonheim. Without additional defenses, the city will surely fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Chapter 3: Defense of Drakonheim, the heroes must protect the city from the hobgoblin army. They have several days to prepare defenses and seek out allies before the enemies reach Drakonheim. Once the foes arrive, the heroes defend the walls and lead the charge against the hobgoblin war chief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
