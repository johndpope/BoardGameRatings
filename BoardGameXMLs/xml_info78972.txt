			<description>Source: Wikipedia, SOCOM: Confrontation , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation (also known as SOCOM: Confrontation) is a third person tactical shooter video game for the PlayStation 3. Slant Six Games developed the game instead of the original SOCOM developer Zipper Interactive. The game was released on October 14, 2008 on the PlayStation Network and Blu-ray Disc in North America and March 2009 in Europe. The game is the fifth title in the SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs series and the first for the PlayStation 3, as well as the first SOCOM game since 2005 that is rated M by the ESRB. An online-only shooter in the same vein as Warhawk, Confrontation came packaged the same way as Warhawk, with the retail version coming packaged with the official PlayStation 3 Bluetooth headset or as a standalone game, and also released as a downloadable title from PlayStation Network. Teamwork is essential to success in the game, as this phrase says: &amp;quot;Alone I'm Lethal, as a team I Dominate&amp;quot;. The player is able to customize their character, choosing from a list of pre-defined items, using mix and match. This includes armor (light, medium and heavy; both leg and torso; for commando and mercenary), camouflage (head, shirts, pants, armor, straps and mask), and weapons attachments (two slots, weapon specific; e.g. front grip and suppressor on the M4A1 assault rifle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
