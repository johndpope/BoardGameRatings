			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Having launched Undead, a successful game, the software engineers take vacation in Alaska. They travel up the Kvichak River in winter to Lake Iliamna.  On the lake, they set up camp and search for the Iliamna monster, nessy of the north. Unknown to the engineers, the code in Undead has opened a tunnel to the spirit world. There is no going back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Note: this was submitted in response to the Undead Software Engineers in Alaska Challenge, issued by Bully Pulpit Games in 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
