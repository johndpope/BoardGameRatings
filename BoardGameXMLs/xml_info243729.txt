			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A regional sandbox 5e adventure for 1st-2nd level characters in 2099 Wasteland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desperation and death lay before you in the nearly lifeless expanse, the ruins of civilization stretching as far as the eye can see or to the very edge of the murky waters that take up the horizon. In the lowlands along the coast you can pick out a few dozen structures that have survived the devastation, signs of possible salvage and recovery. Your options aren&amp;rsquo;t great but this is the most promising thing you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon in days out here. There could be food, water, or maybe even some weapons to gather from these old buildings&amp;mdash;provided of course that they aren&amp;rsquo;t inhabited by anything tough enough to survive out here. An old highway sign hangs above the ground in the distance, its original message long since gone and replaced by a phrase hastily scrawled in red graffiti: Bally n&amp;rsquo; Tour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have 2099 Wasteland this adventure is going to leave you slightly confused&amp;mdash;grab the free Settlement Rules PDF to get an understanding of the world-building aspect of the apocalyptic campaign setting generator. By the end of this module the survivors (our adventurers) should have established at least one settlement in the region, ready to use that as their base of operations as they stake out other (also randomly generated) territories nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game should be dominated by exploration, the party gradually uncovering enough from the rubble to make something worth fighting for in the Wasteland. Parties of survivors should utilize the classes, archetypes, races, and player options from 2099 Wasteland (or the other free PDFs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you get in Bally n' Tour:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A longform example and walkthrough adventure for how to utilize the setting generator tools in 2099 Wasteland and the free Settlement Rules PDF.&lt;br/&gt;    Maps for the region of Bally n&amp;rsquo; Tour, an abandoned refinery turned factory, dwarven caves, a wasteland house, and a crossroads battle map.&lt;br/&gt;    Fast Searching rules for quickly canvassing the ruins of homes in Bally n&amp;rsquo; Tour.&lt;br/&gt;    10 NPCs and monsters ranging from brain slugs (and the slug-brained template) to walkers, technomages, and even the new radcow!&lt;br/&gt;    VTT versions of the maps and extensive hyperlinks for digital readers. When we tell you to use an existing NPC or monster from the core rules, we make their statblock only a click away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
