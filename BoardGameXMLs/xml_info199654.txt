							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return of the Centaurs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Centaurs have returned and are waging war on the three races again after almost three centuries. Can you, a hunter from a small hamlet help turn the tide of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;Pathorus is a continent in the world of Taragon, approximately 400 miles from its icy northern tip to its southern deserts and split almost completely in half by a range of mountains affectionately named after its inhabitants &amp;ldquo;OGRES&amp;rdquo;. Once a major discomfort to the rest of the populace of Pathorus the Ogre community has been rather quiet the past few decades and so using the various passes and mountain paths has been with relatively little incident. Trade has boomed and for now, everyone has had time to enjoy life without the worry of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were born in the hamlet of Hupton and have rarely ventured very far, when you came of age just a few years ago, you joined the hunting group, to experience some life outside of the hamlet. On that first year being a little over confident, you got yourself separated from the main group and in a tangle with a very large wild bear. You walked away from the fight with three things, firstly it taught you a valuable lesson of strength in numbers, and now you do not stray very far from your group. Secondly, during the fight, the bear caught you with one of its massive paws and now you have four long claw scars down your left cheek and lastly you have a very nice bearskin cloak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
