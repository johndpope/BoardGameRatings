			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Will he be a heartless seafaring scoundrel... or the Captain of her dreams?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...] Friendless in the midst of a turbulent sea, Abigail finds herself utterly defenseless. She must face the tyranny of a merciless task master while burning with a secret desire fueled even by his slightest touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...] Like most sea captains, Lord Jonathan expects his women to be like his ship... at his total command. [....] However, could a smoldering tide of passion provoked by Abigail's innocent sensuality transform the arrogant master into a willing servant?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Rapture's Voyage is a pair of coordinated gamebook scripts for two player characters, Abigail Marie Charington and Lord Jonathan Coulter. Players read aloud from a script and make choices when prompted. Sometimes a spinner dictates the character's disposition (bold, cautious, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
