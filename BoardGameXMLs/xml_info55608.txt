							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Control: The Game of Absolute Corruption</name>
									
			<description>[Back cover]&lt;br/&gt;Invisible hands reach across the world, playing politicians like violins, using corporations as puppets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is CONTROL: The Game of Absolute Corruption.  Hidden conspiracies decide the path of history.  Who are they?  What do they want?  How can you get in on it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on the role of men and women caught up in a whirlwind of intrigue, deception, and danger.  A world where your wits are your best weapon, and even your closest friends can't be trusted.  The only way to face the conspiracy and live is to not only take them down, but to take over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an exiting [sic] new rules system, Control characters can be created in under five minutes.  A truly character-driven game, Control is easy to learn and will provide endless hours of good, clean, cynical fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's all about Control: Who's got it?  Who wants it?  Who will you kill for it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
