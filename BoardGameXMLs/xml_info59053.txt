			<description>Be the first on your block to bankrupt America by playing matching sets of Pork spending cards.&lt;br/&gt;This is a variant of Go Fish.  Players take turns asking other players for cards, and trying to make sets.  There are special cards that can be played at different times, for various results.  Pork falls into one of five categories: Arts &amp;amp; Entertainment, Transportation, Housing, Financial, and Private.  You may ask for a suit instead of asking for a specific card.&lt;br/&gt;Each matching set has a dollar amount associated with it.  When the cards run out, player with the most pork $ wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
