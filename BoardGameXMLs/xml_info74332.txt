							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbie Says</name>
									
			<description>In this electronic tabletop game, Barbie calls out a series of colors and/or icons. All the players try to follow the pattern she calls out, but only if they hear Barbie Says. If they successfully complete a pattern during the game, players win rings, bracelets and hair clips they can really wear. The first person to collect enough jewelry wins the game. Cool music, lights and the voice of Barbie add to the fun. Three levels of play appeal to a broad range of ages and abilities. Girls will enjoy fashion, friendship and fun while playing Barbie Says.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
