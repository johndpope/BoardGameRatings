			<description>&amp;quot;The A-Typical Card Game of B-list Inventions&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proto-Typical is a &amp;quot;Simply Epic, Free-Market Parody.&amp;quot;  Everyone knows that what the world needs now is MORE STUFF! And what's the best kind of STUFF? You guessed it! NEW STUFF! You have just inherited a somewhat successful, multi-national corporation with access to a handful of cutting edge patents that will help you build some AMAZING NEW STUFF! Of course, it just so happens that your friends have also all suddenly (and suspiciously) inherited their own companies as well. Now, you must race to finish and begin production of as many prototypes of NEW STUFF as possible. The inventions are bizarre, corporate espionage is inevitable, and the profit to be made is unfathomable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proto-Typical is played with two different decks of cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Blueprints Deck contains double-faced cards with the invention and its value in millions of Globos (The global currency of the future) on the reverse, and blueprints for the invention on the reverse.  The blueprint also lists component types needed from the Resources Deck.&lt;br/&gt;     The Resources Deck contains single-faced cards, which are either component inventions listed by type, or other resources (Scientists, Venture Capitalists, Celebrity endorsers, Advertising Agencies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Player performs one of three actions:&lt;br/&gt;         Obtain resources - Draw one resource card from Resources Deck&lt;br/&gt;         Build a prototype - The player plays all the resources needed for one buildable idea (this may include resources in the public domain and resources from your hand modified by scientists), along with any value enhancing resources. Player takes the buildable idea OBVERSE-SIDE UP and any cards used from the player&amp;rsquo;s hand and places them as the completed prototype into the player&amp;rsquo;s asset pool&lt;br/&gt;         Kill an idea - Permanently discard (obsolete) a buildable idea by placing it and one or more resource cards needed for it from player&amp;rsquo;s hand into player&amp;rsquo;s assets, REVERSE-SIDE UP.  This is a liability. (Liability amount is the value of the idea less the resources used)&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Discard or draw cards so that player has exactly 5 cards&lt;br/&gt;     Reveal blueprint if any are still available so that exactly 3 show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play continues until there are no more buildable ideas, i.e. all blueprints have been prototyped or obsoleted.&lt;br/&gt;     Each player then tallies the total of their assets by adding the $G values of completed prototypes (as modified by human resources), $G4 for each resource card and subtracting obsoleted ideas.&lt;br/&gt;     Highest score wins the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
