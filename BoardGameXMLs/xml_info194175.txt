			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters in this game are all Soviet super-spies stationed in and around the Texas research facilities during the 1980&amp;rsquo;s. The Soviet Union was beginning to collapse and Premier Gorbachev ordered that the secret American plans for the U.S. Star Wars program to be stolen at any costs. Anyone who retrieved this information would be handsomely rewarded. The characters in this game are highly trained, crack spies who are the best the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have to offer. There was no doubt at the Kremlin that this group of spies would accomplish their mission. They were the nonpareil. Until something went wrong. The game begins where it went wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
