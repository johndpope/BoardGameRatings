			<description>Part of the Signal close Action Series, using on the Fast Play Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast way to play the armada using fast fun historical rules, that dont compromise speed for accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written to cover the period of the Second Anglo Dutch War, with appended information for use in the First and Third Anglo Dutch Wars. The size of game is variable, from single ships to large fleet actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast, fun game that gives the right atmosphere and authentic results. It uses the Ability Chart system devised by Rod with his original Napoleonic rules. This is a tried and tested method of reducing dice throwing and paperwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideal as an introduction to Sailing Navy Wargaming and written in an easy to follow format. They are perfect also for Club Games, where players who are familiar with naval wargaming can invite fellow members to join in with a minimum of explanation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
