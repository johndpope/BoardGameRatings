			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poisoned Pages for Shadow of the Demon Lord&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all wear masks. We wear them to conceal our true selves, to become what others expect us to be, navigating the murky waters of social interaction to forge relationships, find love, and avoid enemies. For most of us, masks conceal uncertainties and doubts, ambitions and desires, and all the little secrets that make up what we think of as our true selves. For a few, masks conceal darkness, a dangerous beast just barely restrained by the chains of self-control. Sometimes, the chains break, the mask slips, and the horror begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skinchangers in Shadow of the Demon Lord encompass a variety of shapeshifting creatures, from werewolves to ratmen and everything in between. The animal form a skinchanger adopts can be anything you need it to be without having to alter anything other than how it&amp;rsquo;s described. For Game Masters, this approach provides a great deal of freedom, but from the perspective of players, especially those who contract the Skinchanger Curse, a bit more information can be helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entry into the Poisoned Pages series takes a closer look at skinchangers, revealing their secret origins, how they spread their curse, and everything else you need to know to play a skinchanger character. Unleash the beast inside you and bark at the moon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
