			<description>R.A.T.Z is a supplement for Injurius Games. The RATZ are a genetically-engineered slave race that earned its freedom in the months directly preceding the rise of Injurius I to the throne of the Empire. Those months were enough for the little guys to spread to nearby systems, and become unkillable - as a race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Injurius might still have gone to the trouble of wiping them out, for surely there are no more troublesome creatures in the universe than RATZ - but his scientists have told the Emperor that these creatures, though their lives are often shortened by brutality, are effectively immortal. Barring accident, starvation or plague, these creatures don't age once they reach adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Emperor decided to use the RATZ as test subjects for his experiments - after all, an immortal Emperor would be a great asset to the Empire. Allowing the creatures to fight in the arena is simply a bonus: any RATZ that are felled in the arena go into the Special Program, and work goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Injurius Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
