							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Camelot Cosmos: Our Honoured Blood</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of the realm of Pendragon is, in many ways, the history of its noble houses, the long, bloody, often glorious and sometimes shameful record of the ambitions, victories and defeats of the powerful individuals who have steered their families to greatness and schemed and fought their way to the very apex of Pendragon society. Noble houses have determined which among their number have held the crown, and have always competed against each other to ensure nearness to or control over the throne. They have also influenced the election of Arch-Bishops of Camelot, placed their second sons in senior positions within the church, formed the backbone of the Pendragon Legion, prosecuted the war against Morgan le Fay, betrayed their King and raised rebellions or saved their monarch&amp;rsquo;s life and crushed uprisings against him. No monarch of Kingsland can be successful without the support of the great noble houses, and yet each must also be aware that if he allows them too much power or grants them too many concessions his own royal authority is irrevocably weakened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Honoured Blood is a supplement for Camelot Cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
