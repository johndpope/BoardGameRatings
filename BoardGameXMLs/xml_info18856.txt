			<description>The Burger Card Game is a colorful, easy to play memory game that children will love so much, they'll always come back for seconds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on a theme that attracts all children the Burger Card Game challenges players to construct the biggest Burger of all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin, all the cards are placed face down. To get into the game a player must turn up a bun. Then he goes for a Burger, followed by as many different toppings as possible until another bun comes up, thus ending his turn. But watch out! The moment a duplicate topping is turned up, all the cards go face down again, back into play. The trick is in remembering where everything is. The winner is the player with the most cards at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
