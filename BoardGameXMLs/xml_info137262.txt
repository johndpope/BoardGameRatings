Beginners can use the graphical online help to get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shih Dao offers 256 color high resolution graphics and also includes background music and digitized sound effects for owners of SoundBlaster (or compatible) sound cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules only take a few minutes to learn but game strategy, especially in trying to find two, three or four way matches always keeps the game interesting.
