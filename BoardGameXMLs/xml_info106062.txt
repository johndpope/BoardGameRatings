			<description>PlayStation Move is a motion-sensing game controller platform for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) video game console by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). Based on a handheld motion controller wand, PlayStation Move uses the PlayStation Eye camera to track the wand's position, and inertial sensors in the wand to detect its motion. First revealed on June 2, 2009, PlayStation Move launched in mainland Europe and most Asian markets on 15 September 2010, in Australasia on 16 September 2010,in North America and the UK on 17 September 2010, in Japan on 21 October 2010. Hardware available at launch included the main PlayStation Move motion controller, a supplementary PlayStation Move navigation controller, and an optional PlayStation Move charging station. It competes with the Wii Remote/Wii MotionPlus and Kinect motion control systems for the Wii and Xbox 360 home consoles, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although PlayStation Move is implemented on the existing PlayStation 3 console, Sony stated that it treated Move's debut as its own major &amp;quot;platform launch&amp;quot;, with an aggressive marketing campaign to support it. The tagline for PlayStation Move from E3 2010 was &amp;quot;This Changes Everything&amp;quot;, including partnerships with Coca-Cola, as part of the &amp;quot;It Only Does Everything&amp;quot; marketing campaign which debuted with the redesigned &amp;quot;Slim&amp;quot; PlayStation 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navigation controller&lt;br/&gt;The PlayStation Move navigation controller (originally referred to as the PlayStation Move sub-controller and also known as the navi-controller) is a one-handed supplementary controller designed for use in conjunction with the PlayStation Move motion controller for certain types of gameplay. Replicating the major functionality of the left side of a standard PlayStation Wireless Controller, the PlayStation Move navigation controller features a left analog stick (with L3 button function), a D-pad, and L1 and L2 analog triggers. The navigation controller also features Cross and Circle action buttons, as well as a PS button. Since all controls correspond to those of a standard Wireless Controller, a Sixaxis or DualShock 3 controller can be used in place of the navigation controller in PlayStation Move applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;PlayStation Move&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
