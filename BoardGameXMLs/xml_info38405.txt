			<description>Wizards and Warriors is a collection of five fairly simple games all set in a generic fantasy environment. The game was published in a fold-out cardboard folder on which the five different boards are printed. Contained within are the rules booklet and a counter sheet. The boards and components are illustrated by Cathy Wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wizard's Chamber (2-4 players)&lt;br/&gt;Simple roll-and-move game with set collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curse of the Tomb (1-2 players)&lt;br/&gt;Basically a race game, where one player controls an adventurer  and the other player controls the tomb and deploys hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from the Troll King (2-6 players)&lt;br/&gt;Roll-and-move race. First player to reach the end of a long cave tunnel wins. Monsters pop in and out of caves along the way and act as obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mines of Aslok (2-6 players)&lt;br/&gt;Basic roll-and-move movement, where the first player to escape the Mines with treasure wins. On their way out they need to evade traps and fight demons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vault of Illusion (2-6 players)&lt;br/&gt;More dynamic and complex game, compared to the others. The adventurers move across a multicoloured hex grid at random, dictated by a coloured spinner. The goal is to acquire a magic weapon and then battle one of six different monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
