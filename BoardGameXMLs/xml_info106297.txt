							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Entente Cordiale Card Game</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">L&#039;Entente Cordiale</name>
									
			<description>Set collecting game, with both French and English rules. The Entente Cordiale was an expression to describe Britain's relationship with France. There had been several wars between the two countries in the past so a cordial agreement like this was popular in both countries. Jaques saw this as a chance to publish a game which, whilst being fun, was also a vehicle to teach a little French language skills.&lt;br/&gt;The cards are in six sets of nine cards.  The player who has the House Card in his hand starts. If he has a number one card of any set, he lays it on the table. The next player must play a number two card of that set. The next player number 3, and so on. If you cannot play the required card then you have to pass. When all nine cards of that group have been played, a new set is started, and so on. The first player to play all of their cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;Each card has the name of an object in French and English, plus the name where you might find the object, again in two languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
