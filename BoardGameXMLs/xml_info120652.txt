			<description>The object of the game is to be the first to score 5 points by sending the frog in the pond of your opponent with the  Smatcho.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a side and stand behind.&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player begins to play and serves first.&lt;br/&gt;He places the foot of his racket on the playing area and place the frog on Smatcho the tip of his racket. Finally, he places his thumb on the trigger and pulls it trying to send Smatcho&lt;br/&gt;above the pond into the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;The game-round ends when the frog fell into one of two camps.
