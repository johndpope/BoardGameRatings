			<description>From Selecta Speilzeug's website: &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;acute;s lots of shopping fun for younger children with the variation for children from 3 years:&lt;br/&gt;There are up to four friends in the village, who will drive to the shops in their cars and take their shopping lists with them so that they don't forget anything. Each one needs to buy 1 melon, 1 pizza, 1 carton of milk and 1 packet of cannelloni.&lt;br/&gt;One of the four will have the luck of the dice to help them be the first to bring home all the goods on their list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern times have arrived for children from 4 years. The animals living in the village have ordered their shopping and are waiting for their deliveries from up to four distributors from the town. The deliveries should come quickly with their lorries.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to find your way through the village. Take care not to lose your way - otherwise the pizza will be cold and the milk sour when you finally find your customer&amp;acute;s house.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the distributors are distracted by the wonderful things on sale at the bakery and take long breaks instead of delivering their goods.&lt;br/&gt;With the help of Mrs Piggy, the dice and a good memory though, the distributors will find their way to deliver the goods to the waiting customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high quality contents include:&lt;br/&gt;1 round game board &amp;Oslash; 44 cm, 4 cars, 6 melons, 6 cartons of milk, 6 pizzas, 6 packets of cannelloni (pasta), 4 shopping lists, 12 door cards, 1 point dice, 1 symbol dice, instructions&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
