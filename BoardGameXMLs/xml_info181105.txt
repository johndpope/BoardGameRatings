			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been developed as a fast-paced, fun and exciting method of playing Napoleonic Skirmish Games set in the Peninsular War. The rules are easy to play, allowing the War Gamer the creativity in designing or modifying the rules to their own standards utilizing their own scenarios or using the numerous scenarios included based loosely on many historical skirmishes and some fictionalized accounts throughout Portugal and Spain. The game uses a random card generating system, in which each miniature figure is matched to a game card shuffled into the card deck. Figures are assigned a random number of Action Points each turn based on a 1d6 die roll at the start of each round so their action abilities also change each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
