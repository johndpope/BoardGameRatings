			<description>According to the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Object of the game is to be the only player not to become bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Set Up the game each player chooses a token and begins on the start square.  Each player is given two each of the $500s, $100s and $50s; six of the $20s; five each of the $10s, $5s and $1s.  During the game the bank cannot go broke.  The bank sells and handles the bankruptcies of the businesses and charges for the customers.  If the bank runs out of customers, no more can be obtained until some are sold back to the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win the game, a player has to be the only player not to declare personal bankruptcy.  When a player owes more money than he can raise by selling customers and bankrupting his businesses, he is out of the game.  Any bankrupt businesses a play has, goes to the persona or bank that he owes money to.  The player who receives the bankrupt businesses immediately has to pay the bankruptcy charge plus 10% for any business he wants to own.  If he does not pay the charges, the business goes back to the bank to be sold to anyone who lands on the square.  Players may trade and sell businesses between themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
