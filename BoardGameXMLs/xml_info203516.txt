Don't want to be an ELF? I can't BLAME you. So, all you have to do is risk LIFE and SOUL as a GOETIC MAGE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe you're MORE INTERESTED in DIVINE POWER, SLOW and SAFE? For taking the LESS COMMON path of the GNOSTIC PRIEST, you can SHRUG OFF rival magics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OR perhaps you want to FLEE the POWER of QLIPPOTHIC ENTITIES, who wish all to be STILL, SILENT, and GRAY? There are HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of these Qlippothic things, thanks to COMPACT yet MIND-TWISTING TABLES! How would YOU react to a DEMON made of SALT CRYSTALS with an EXPOSED BRAIN that LAYS EGGS in your MEMORIES?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IVANHOE UNBOUND is PROUD to present TWO NEW CLASSES and A QLIPPOTHIC DEMON GENERATION SYSTEM for SWORDS AND WIZARDRY WHITEBOX or ANY OTHER OLD SCHOOL GAME based on or compatible with the 1974 three booklet version of the WORLD-FAMOUS RPG whose name rhymes with &amp;quot;TRUNCHEONS AND FLAGONS!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AND SPEAKING OF BOOKLETS, this supplement comes in POCKETMOD FORMAT. Print out a SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER which can be TRANSFORMED with FOLDS and a single cut into a TINY EIGHT PAGE BOOKLET with EVERYTHING YOU NEED to use this material in your OSR game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, while THE TINY BOOKLET IS ADORABLE, there's also a larger-size version so you can KILL MORE TREES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as a SPECIAL BONUS, the actual supplement doesn't use EXCESSIVE CAPITAL LETTERS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
