			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SideQuests are a collection of short adventures designed for Fifth Edition Dungeons and Dragons. These one-shot style campaigns are designed to be compelling standalone stories that can be implemented, played through, and completed in just a few sessions. Whether you're using them as a filler adventure between major story arcs, as a continuation of your own adventures, or just because you forgot to plan the session last Wednesday... SideQuests are an invaluable tool for any Dungeon Master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kobolds have grown strong - surely strong enough to overthrow the local abbey that they've been eyeing! This SideQuest begins as word has spread about the Kobold army that is planning to lay siege and take control of a humble monastery. The only thing that stands in the Kobolds' way is, of course, your group of brave adventurers. This is a perfect introductory campaign to the world of D&amp;amp;D; it is designed to give your first-level players their first taste of combat and dungeon-crawling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insurrection At The Abbey was originally written for a party of Level 1 characters, though is primarily narrative-based and may be adapted to all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
