			<description>A Space man has been killing Alien Zombies for what seems like an eternity. It's natural that all his hard work would pay off at some point. So... we at PomPom feel it's time to reward the little idiot with a brand new game! That's right Space dude, you can now keep on killing Alien Zombie scum... in glorious HD on the PS3. How cool is that? There's more...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not that it's only blasting you'll be doing. Oh no. There's bombs to defuse. Space babies to rescue. Jet packs for flying silliness. But still... lots of blasting. LOTS. Spread out over 70 levels combining both one shot adventure levels and to-the-death survival modes. All flavours of violent blasting catered for, and all dressed up in traditional PomPom silliness, as to avoid traumatizing any small children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available on PS3 via the Playstation Store&lt;br/&gt;Intense shoot em up action&lt;br/&gt;Both survival and one shot adventure levels&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer Co-op gameplay&lt;br/&gt;20 Zombie types to contend with&lt;br/&gt;70 levels to pillage or die on&lt;br/&gt;Bonus UFOs and Coin pickups&lt;br/&gt;Powerups&lt;br/&gt;Medals awarded for achievements&lt;br/&gt;Unlockable space suits&lt;br/&gt;Decoy pods &amp;amp; Jet Packs&lt;br/&gt;Bomb defuse tasks&lt;br/&gt;Baby rescue tasks&lt;br/&gt;Surely that's enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
