			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for 4-6 Characters of Levels 1-3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Great War may be over, but the battles continue. Rumors and facts are often confused in the aftermath. Depending on who you listen to, Prinzfeld is either under attack or perfectly safe. Turrosh Mak is on his way, with hordes of orcs at his command - ridiculous, he would never attempt an invasion at this time. Graf Twembly is being held hostage, and near death - no, he's just under the weather and hasn't felt like coming out of the castle lately. A dwarven prince has requested your party's aid in quelling the coming invasion (if there is one, of course). Do you take him at his honorable word, and gird yourselves for battle? Or do you listen to the street talk, and take the side of those who disbelieve the warmongering? Most importantly of all: what if you make the wrong choice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patriots of Ulek is the first module following the release of GREYHAWK Adventures Wars, last year's landmark boxed wargame.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
