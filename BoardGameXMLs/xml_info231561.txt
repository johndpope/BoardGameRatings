							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chronicles of Aerthe Core Book</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all ended in moments, reality was torn asunder and with it the Aerthe, the oceans rose up and the mountains crumbled, cities were buried or wiped away as if they never existed. Many of the races that once flourished became extinct instantly, the Akin-Ya with their crystal cities and their advanced knowledge, the Halflings who brewed their ales and kept to themselves, the Avrin and their corrupt souls, existed no longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the tremors stopped and the skies cleared the survivors crawled from their hiding places into a new world, a world changed from the one they knew, alternate Aerthe&amp;rsquo;s at one-time unseen and separated by reality had converged and moved through each other leaving echoes of themselves and fractures in space time. With these echoes came new cities and races and with the fractures came doorways to other realms, doors that swung both ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Chronicles of Aerthe a world of adventure, of horror and intrigue, where nothing is quite what it seems and other realms beyond your own exist to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
