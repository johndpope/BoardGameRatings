			<description>Cooperative game about protecting wildlife in little ponds. Each player has a pond and tries to fill it with different animals (frogs, dragonflies, etc.). There is a special die showing which animal to put into one's pond, but it also has a digger side. If a player rolls this symbol, a piece is added to a digger puzzle. For the neutral clover leaf side, one can put an environmentalist (pawn) in front of the digger. If eight protesters are in front of the digger before it is completed, the first player to fill up his/her pond with eight animals, wins. Otherwise, everybody loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only two of each animal can be in a pond. A player who rolls an animal that is already in his/her pond twice, has to &amp;quot;donate&amp;quot; the roll to another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
