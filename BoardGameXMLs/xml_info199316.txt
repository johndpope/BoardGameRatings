							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower of Skulls (DCC)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dangerous cancer lurks in the shadowy crevasses of the land, spreading death and misery like a weed chokes the life out of a garden. Its foul presence spoils the natural order, creating pestilent beasts that stalk the unwary and grim hauntings to terrify the brave. It is known as the Tower of Skulls, an unholy site that rises from pitch-black soil, and it always hungers for fresh life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BF1 Tower of Skulls is a Fantasy Renaissance Adventure Module filled with horror, darkness, undead, and nightmarish plants. It has been designed for a party of four to six level 6 or 7 characters. This adventure presents a twisted, evil dungeon for a party of adventurer&amp;rsquo;s to explore and hopefully destroy, though in doing so they unwittingly release an imprisoned evil back to the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this insidious site are the pits and perils of the imprisoned Demon Lord of Graveyards, where you will find among its rooms and levels ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    ... a frost giant zombie covered in brown mold ready to strike down intruders ...&lt;br/&gt;    ... bone golems ready to tip hanging cauldrons of dangerous liquid onto opponents ...&lt;br/&gt;    ... a domed chamber filled with blowing snow, yetis, and an undead druid ...&lt;br/&gt;    ... a garden of unusually magical and potent berries guarded by shambling graveyards ...&lt;br/&gt;    ... a titanic mushroom beneath which dance demonic mushroom men spreading their vile disease ...&lt;br/&gt;    ... new magic items tied to the Demon Lord of Graveyards ...&lt;br/&gt;    ... and so much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
