			<description>Take a trip down memory lane in this game of fads and fashions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate taking turns answering questions spanning the 50s thru the 80s covering fads/fashion, people, music, and television/movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player is asked a question from one of the categories. If they are correct they will advance one space and be asked a question from the category depicted on that space.  A player may answer up to 4 questions correctly and then their turns ends.  If they answer a question incorrectly, their turn is over immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player (or team) to reach 'finish' wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
