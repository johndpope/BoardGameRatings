			<description>Ichi - Game of Dragons is a modified version of Last Card/Mau Mau/Crazy Eights, a public domain card game played with a standard 52 card pack of playing cards. Ichi (pronounced ee-chee) is Japanese for &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to empty your hand of cards before your opponents do by playing one per turn. If you have no cards that match the rank or element (suit) of the top card of the discard pile, you can't play a card and have to draw one instead. Special cards like Skip, Draw, Exchange, Reverse, and Dragons will change gameplay regularly making for an exciting new spin on the classic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are printed with both English and Kanji, making for a learning experience while you play, a pronounciation guide is included in the rulebook as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
