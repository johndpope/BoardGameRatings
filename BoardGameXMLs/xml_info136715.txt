			<description>This is described as a fun tongue-twister game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nicely illustrated cards are shuffled and placed face down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player picks the top card from the pile, notes the text, place the card face down in front of him and speaks the tongue-twisting sentence aloud. If he is deemed to be correct, without pause or error, he gets to keep the card. But if he has made ​​a mistake or speaks too slowly, he has to pass the card to his left neighbour, who makes the same attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If none of the players could recite the phrase correctly, the card is placed under the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the player with the most cards after the deck has been exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
