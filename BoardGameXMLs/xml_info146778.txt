			<description>Card game from the &amp;quot;Dubbel en Dwars&amp;quot; series. All cards are printed on both sides. During the game you need both sides!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Luna, each player tries to get rid of his cards as fast as possible. Each card shows a moon or a hat. One card is turned over, and players simulteanously look through their cards for two or more cards with a matching object, and place them in apile. Now, other players may lay cards in this pile as long as the target object on the layout card is similar to that on the top card from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who has played all his cards wins the game immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
