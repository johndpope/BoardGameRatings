			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your keen eye has not yet spotted the faint glimmer of raw gold that will spell fame and fortune, but you know it is out there. Suddenly, off to the left, you see what looks like the finest specimen of gold ore this side of the Pecos mountains. Cautiously but quickly, with six-gun drawn, you make your way north toward the shiny treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait! You soon realize that you are not alone! Your arch rival has grabbed the gold and is headed for the Assay office to turn it into cash. You must stop him before he is able to deposit the money in the bank or spend it on more ammunition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just then you remember your allies, the rattlesnakes. Strategically placed they can help you recover what is rightfully yours. Can you out-fox your arch rival, or is he too clever for you? Can you continue to avoid the deadly man-eating tumbleweeds? The vision of fame and fortune again appears before you and gives you renewed strength and will. The gold is yours and no CLAIM JUMPER is going to take it from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
