							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conan: Rise of Monsters</name>
									
			<description>Conan: Rise of Monsters (CROM) is a new skirmish miniatures game based on the Conan stories by Robert E. Howard as well as the amazing Marvel and Dark Horse Comics. The game features exquisite 28mm plastic pre-painted miniatures in Starter Boxes supplemented with separate warbands, leaders, and monsters. It is a completely scaleable tabletop miniatures game with rules, special dice, and markers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thoth-Amon has assembled the blasphemous Legion of Set to bring the Serpent God into the world of Hyboria. His sorcerers, swordsmen, and serpents scour the lands gathering ancient artifacts and destroying the icons of those gods who might oppose his apocalyptic plans. King Conan of Aquilonia has forged an alliance to stop them--the Circle of Iron. His knights, archers, pikemen, war mammoths, and other beasts are all that stand in the way of the dread sorcerer and his unholy minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
