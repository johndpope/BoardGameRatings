							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Creepy Things and Events to Encounter When Travelling</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collection of creepy items, events and occurrences that could be experienced by players whilst travelling. Some of the encounters are suitable for any setting, but many require the technology of at least the 19th and sometimes the 20th century, due to needing forms of mass transit that are outside the characters' control or to be travelling at speed to be effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some encounters will be immediately obvious as being disturbing, whilst others will require thinking about or for players to be paying attention. The encounters may have a negative effect on characters, but this is up to the GameMaster. Some of the results are more gory than others, with many evoking cosmic or supernatural horror instead,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The list has one hundred results, which can be chosen randomly by using a d100, but appropriate ones can also be chosen. The results are laid out in a table with the various entries having the type of encounter then details of the encounter itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passengers - This is only appropriate for vehicles that carry a fairly large number of passengers that the players are not in control of. Trains, especially underground trains, are most suited, but it could also include coaches and aeroplanes and possibly ships. The vehicle in question will arrive at a stop or its destination and passengers will start to get off. After a while, the player(s) may realise that not only do they not recall having seen many of the passengers before, far more have disembarked from the vehicle than it could possibly be capable of holding, far more than the player(s) remember being on board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter, one page is the introduction and one page is ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
