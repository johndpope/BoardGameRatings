							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walt Disney&#039;s Pluto&#039;s Lost Bones Game</name>
									
			<description>A spin-and-move game, this licensed bit of randomness has the players spinning to move (selecting which direction they move each turn), with the goal being to get the most bones, gaining one bone each time you land on one of Minnie Mouse's garden spaces.  The game ends when all bones have been removed.  However, each turn you land one one of the garden spaces, you have roughly a 1 in 3 chance of being swatted with Minnie's broom, being sent out to the surrounding pathway and having to give up one of your bones rather than taking one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
