			<description>The Crypt: A Solitaire Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in TSR's R.I.P. Comic #7 (Part 3 of 4 of the R.I.P. Brasher Comic Module)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consists of 30 tiles you cut out from the comic. You need to provide a token to represent you on the board, 1D6, and paper and pencil to keep track of your character and the number of turns spent in the tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this solitaire game, you are the explorer, seeking treasure in old tombs. Each turn, more of the crypt is revealed as you travel along the dark and dusty tunnel. Each game is different, and danger lurks around   every corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this quest is the recovery of the Pharaoh's Scepter.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the starting tile face up. &amp;quot;The character moves through the various rooms and corridors depicted on those tiles. Each turn, when the character wants to move in a direction not yet explored, a tile is picked at random from the unused pile and placed in the direction the player is moving. Make sure the corridors line up with each other. If there is more than one possible way to align the corridors, the orientation is up to the player. The token representing the player is then moved to the new section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a player has moved, look at the new tile. If it has a letter in the center, refer to the lettered paragraphs at the end of the rules. If the tile has a door, it must be opened. If the tile has no letter, then a roll must be made for Wandering Monsters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, you explore the crypt (looking for the Scepter), fighting monsters and picking up magical items when you can. The tiles in my copy are missing the identifying text on the tiles that are not supposed to be blank; however, you can figure it out without them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must complete your quest - to return alive with the Pharaoh's Scepter - within 40 turns. For more of a challenge, reduce the number of turns allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
