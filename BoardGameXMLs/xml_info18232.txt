			<description>This is another roll and move cycling game where each player controls a team of 3 cyclists. The twist here is that you can divide results of the dice thrown over your cyclists as long as they stay together in one group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual in the genre, there are some cards with positive effects (burst of speed) and negative effects (flat tire, having to take a leak)...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system allows multiple races with an overall ranking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A neat aspect of this game is a semi-&amp;quot;collectible&amp;quot; element whereby for a modest sum you can buy teams in each of the team strips of the major pro-cycling teams. Whilst not as satisfying a game as, say, Um Reifenbreite, it does make for a good visual recreation of the peloton in action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
