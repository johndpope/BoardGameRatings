			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divus Ex is a roleplaying game. Players take on the roles of&lt;br/&gt;powerful gods and goddesses in other universes ranging from mythological Greece to the fantasy world of the Mystic Domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're reading this, you probably know what a roleplaying game is. While most roleplaying games are played around a table, with a arranging a plot or scenario for his players to wind their way through, Divus Ex is a little different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First off, Divus Ex is best played as a &amp;quot;Semi-Live Roleplaying Game,&amp;quot; or even as a full live-action roleplaying game. Each player becomes an actor, roleplaying a deity or archon, and like an actor, all of the personality quirks of the god should be performed. Breaks are occasionaly taken for the Fate-Decider, the person who runs the game, to announce events and handle any rules questions that may come up. Unlike other RPGs, the Fate-Decider's primary job is not to set a scene and invisibly guide the players through the adventure, but to be a player himself. As Fate, his role is literal; he is very powerful and omnipotent, but the players are ultimately out of his control. He is definitely not omniscient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fate-Decider has little control over time in Divus Ex. The game moves forward at a steady rate. Usually one year of game time equals one hour of gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divus Ex is not a game about slaying monsters, recovering treasure, and saving the day. Gods have no need for any of that. Instead, Divus Ex is a game about politics. Influence and strength is what gods desire, and the only way to get it is at the expense of other gods. The most successful gods are the ones who know when to use diplomacy, when to rely on intrigue, and when to throw that all aside and flex some divine power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, unlike many RPGs, Divus Ex isn't necessarily cooperative. Each player has his own goals, and must be selfish in accomplishing them. This doesn't mean alliances, or even long-lasting friendships, can't be formed. All gods, however, should always keep their own best interests at heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
