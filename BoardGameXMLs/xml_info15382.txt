							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">George of the Jungle</name>
									
			<description>George of the Jungle fearless ape man! A protector of the weak and innocent, lurching through the tree tops he somehow outwits his opponents as he saves his friends...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple track game based on the animated TV show. The object is to reach George's Jungle House. On your turn you roll a die and advance around the board the number of spaces indicated. You may collect Elephant cards (that add or subtract from your die roll) by taking branch paths to tiger spaces. If you land on a Hazard space, you are stuck there until released by George. On your next turn, you roll the die and advance a George pawn down the George Track the number rolled. When he reaches your space you are freed. The first player to reach the finish space by exact count (Elephant cards help here) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
