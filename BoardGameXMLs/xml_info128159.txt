			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the hero of the hour, you need to use a huge hovering crane to create, assemble and control hoards of tanks to protect your base from The Evil Black Tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You travel back through time to an age before they had established their iron grip, and then fight your way forward, destroying their influence in each era of history and ultimately, freeing the world from their tyranny forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protect your Part-O-Matic while destroying their Receivers and roam the fully 3D landscape searching high and low for anything to recycle into a useful weapon - even poor fluffy innocent sheep!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
