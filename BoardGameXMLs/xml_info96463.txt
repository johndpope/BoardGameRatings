							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anno 2070</name>
									
			<description>Anno 2070, the latest iteration of the award-winning real-time strategy and simulation franchise, takes players into a world inspired by today&amp;rsquo;s challenges and tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s technologies, and takes the Anno franchise into a new era. In a near-future environment climate change has forced humanity to adapt to rising sea levels that have left stretches of once-fertile land completely inhospitable. Players will need to master new technologies while facing numerous ecological challenges to build their empires. Anno 2070 offers players the ability to be architects of the future and create the world of tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anno 2070 is a very ambitious game that will feel both familiar and fresh to fans of the series. Due to the game&amp;rsquo;s futuristic setting, the development team wasn&amp;rsquo;t restricted by historical boundaries and was able to dream bigger than ever before. It&amp;rsquo;s a new take on a great franchise that both newcomers and longtime fans will love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
