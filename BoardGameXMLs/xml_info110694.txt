			<description>Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit (known in the United Kingdom as Crash Time and in the rest of Europe as Alarm f&amp;uuml;r Cobra 11: Crash Time) is a mission based driving game released for the PC in 2007 and Xbox 360 in 2008. It is based around the German television series Alarm f&amp;uuml;r Cobra 11 &amp;ndash; Die Autobahnpolizei, and features several characters from the show working their way through criminal cases based around the road network of a small area of Germany. The developers created a &amp;quot;Pathfinder&amp;quot; to ensure that the AI vehicles do not always follow the same path during a pursuit. It was not received well by critics, with graphics and plot being of concern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of one of several officers in the fictional Cobra 11 team, from the television series Alarm f&amp;uuml;r Cobra 11 &amp;ndash; Die Autobahnpolizei, a police unit in Germany assigned to patrol the Autobahn and other road networks. The player usually takes the role of either Chris or Semir, but there is one early mission where the player take the place of the &amp;quot;rookie&amp;quot; The officers are charged with stopping and questioning suspects about various criminal activities. The game presents the player with a series of fictional &amp;quot;cases&amp;quot; which need to be solved in order to progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
