			<description>Game description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bomb Arena is a party game. Friends can team up to fight against each other. Players work together to put bombs to rival's field and do their best igniting them.  Boom!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's fun and exciting to use bomb cards and accumulate explosion power with skill cards and team member's help.  On the one side, you have to do your best to deal damage to your opponent's team, on the other side, you have to rack your brains removing the bombs in your field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players of Bomb Arena usually love to have one more match, two more matches right after the 1st game because it is really fun.&lt;br/&gt;Players keep mesmerized when they play Bomb Arena because every player's movement would affect each other dramatically.  You would be excited during the whole game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOw to ignite bombs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 ways to ignite bombs devil&lt;br/&gt;1. 11 kings of Bomb Cards : No.2 ~ No. 12&lt;br/&gt;We deal 3 bomb cards and 2 skill cards to each player.&lt;br/&gt;Each player take turns placing one bomb card on enemy's field.&lt;br/&gt;When players work together and put 5 bomb cards in a row on enemy's&lt;br/&gt;field, !!BOOM!! It will deal 2 damage to enemy's team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;for example, when you and your team member put&lt;br/&gt;No.2, No.3, No4, No5, No.6 bomb cards on your enemy's field, it explodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Skill card: Time Bomb&lt;br/&gt;A player can put a time bomb and attache it on a Bomb on enemy's field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;for example, a player can put time bomb on No.7 Bomb card which is already on the filed. then every next player needs to throw 2 dice to&lt;br/&gt;check if it will explode or not. Every player needs to throw 2 dice during the beginning of his turn until the time bomb explodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. When 3 bomb cards of the same number are piled up.&lt;br/&gt;the 3 bomb cards explode immediately can cause 1 point damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can use counterattack, remove, provoke, designate or other skill cards to make the game more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
