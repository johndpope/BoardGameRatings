			<description>La Grande Opera (italian for &amp;quot;The Great Work&amp;quot;) is a game which may be found only in a giant-sized version in two museums, in Tuscany, both dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Museo Ideale, Vinci (near Florence)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Museo del Bigallo, Florence (city)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose actions in order to build inventions and collect victory points. Each invention is a step to complete the &amp;quot;Great Work&amp;quot;, the never-ended deviation of a river near Florence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other actions may include the making of artworks, pledging the Medici family for gold and resources, or just project new inventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many schools and tourists came to the museums to play the game, that is in fact a diceless, strategical eurogame, the first one set up inside a public and cultural place such a museum, at least in Italy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is up to 4 players/teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The art design is by ICT Solutions, and the images are all original drawings of Leonardo, provided by Museo Ideale's archive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
