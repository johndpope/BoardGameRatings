			<description>Grow: The Organic Building Game is a three-dimensional building game in which 2-4 players guide the constant growth of a tree and compete by blossoming flowers around it. The game features a simple-to-learn set of rules, ideal for younger children, while offering a deep level of strategic nuance for more seasoned players. The core mechanisms have been designed to lightly simulate the life of an actual tree, complete with seasons, flowering, and even bugs! Players are given the ability to grow the board, or tree, in any way they choose &amp;ndash; resulting in a unique and interesting play experience every time. The game's length is completely adjustable and can be set up to last anywhere between 20-60 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is represented by a flower color. The goal of the game is to have the most point-worthy flowers of your chosen color before the seasons &amp;mdash; represented by stacks of leaves &amp;mdash; run out. To do this, you perform one of three simple actions: place a bud which will blossom into a complete flower the next turn, place a leaf to help guide the tree's growth, or use a beetle to attack or protect flowers. Since flowers can connect only to leaves, and leaves can connect together to form chains, points are determined by how many leaves each flower is from the nearest branch. The game also features several unique, seasonal events that can be very beneficial or harmful to the tree's growth including locusts swarm, bee pollination, and wood rot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grow: The Organic Building Game was created by Tap Pribbenow, Chris Hassebrook and Kyle Bromley on the idea of blending traditional sculpture with tabletop gaming, while providing a fun way of incorporating plant ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
