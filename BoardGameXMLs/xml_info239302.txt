			<description>Float ashore on a strange island&lt;br/&gt;Ittle and Tippsie crash onto yet another island filled with loot, puzzles and mysterious inhabitants! With the help of a magical map, they set out to steal eight pieces of a raft from increasingly improbable locations including beaches, prairies, an art exhibit and some dude's basement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wield magical weapons&lt;br/&gt;Discover four weapons that double as puzzle solving items, and upgrade them by finding additional copies. Secret artifacts abound in the island's many hidden caves, all of which can be found and solved with your starting equipment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure your own way&lt;br/&gt;Who needs a map, anyway? Tackle the first seven dungeons in any order, and use your items to open various shortcuts within. The craftiest of adventurers have more than one way to open a locked door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
