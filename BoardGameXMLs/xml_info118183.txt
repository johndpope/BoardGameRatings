							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bram Stoker&#039;s Dracula (DOS)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the 1992 movie &amp;quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&amp;quot;, this game borrows the name of the movie for its title.  Unlike the other games released under this name however, this game is similar to exploration and puzzle-solving games like Alone In The Dark.  The game was fairly early in its adoption of the first-person perspective and also includes a shooting element.  The plot of the game tries to be as true as possible to the course of events in the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
