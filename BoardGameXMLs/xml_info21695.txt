			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Checkpoint is a collection of four 'gimmick' road rallies.  However, these events are not run on a road or highway, but on a game board, the World Wide Web... and in your mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each of the four Checkpoint road rallies is sort of an elaborate game of 'Simon Says' played out by moving your tiny car across a road map/game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In each, you will follow a series of route instructions that the devious Rallymaster has specifically designed to mislead you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You shouldn't lose your way because all the various routes across the map lead to same ending.  However, the player who is best at remaining on the one true course... by spotting the Rallymaster's sinister tricks... will become the eventual winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes instructions for entering an online contest that started in November 1997.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
