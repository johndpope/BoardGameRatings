			<description>Super Play Action Football is an American football video game developed by Nintendo for the Super NES. It is the follow-up to NES Play Action Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was commercially unsuccessful as it faced fierce competition from competitors such as Electronic Arts' Madden NFL series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to obtain the ball and reach the other end of the field to score a touchdown, while avoiding opponent players who can pile onto the character possessing the ball. If the opponent players do manage to pile onto the character holding the ball, the play stops and the team goes back to the previous line. A quirk in the gameplay allows the defensive player to get an easy sack if they dive with the nose tackle at the precise moment the ball is snapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the only football game to date to feature high school, college (97 Football Bowl Subdivision &amp;amp; Football Championship Subdivision teams), and NFL (28 teams during the 1992 NFL season) teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Play Action Football&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
