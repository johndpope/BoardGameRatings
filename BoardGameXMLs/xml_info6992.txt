			<description>See you later ... is a racing game for gamblers: Each player gets a pawn, puts it on the starting field of a race track, the first one in goal wins. In the middle of the board is a circle of 12 fields, where five different colored crocodiles are placed (belonging to no-one). There is also a deck of cards showing a number in the color of a crocodile. In their turn, a player reveals a card from this deck and sees if they can pull the corresponding crocodile the number of fields indicated by the card in clockwise order. This is possible, if the landing field is empty. After success, the player can decide to reveal another card and do the same. They can also decide to stop and move their pawn one field for every crocodile card which was revealed. But if it is not possible to move the crocodile, the player has to stop and give all cards already revealed to the next player. This player must reveal at least one card (if successful, they can move their pawn for all cards!). If a player in last place moves their pawn, they can double the value; a player in first place must move back, if they are not successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some special action cards can also be used; they allow a player to stop only after an even number of cards revealed or force them to move back, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is in German, but all components except the rules are language independent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
