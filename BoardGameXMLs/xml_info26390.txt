			<description>Imprisoned in the net - the spider can catch their booty by tactical acting. &lt;br/&gt;The wooden gameboard (ca. 61x61 cm) consists of 64 playing fields and 4 center zones for the spiders. The goal of the game is to catch as many flies as possible (in the form of stones). The spiders may move horizontally and vertically. They try to reach and catch a fly according to the rolled dice.&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced variant one can intentionally limit the course  of the spider.&lt;br/&gt;This spider game is suitable to learn the useful aspects of these animals. In the testing phase we could state that many humans could diminish their shyness and fear of spiders and become curious about these creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
