			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love is a powerful thing. It can bring joy and inspire great deeds, but losing the one you love can break something inside you, especially when it happens before your eyes. Trying to bury the past only goes so far. Shame and grief can haunt a person no matter how far they flee, and nothing stays buried forever..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While checking in on an old acquaintance the players get more than they bargained for. After being attacked during the journey, they settle in for a night at a roadside inn, but must defend themselves as the inn is assaulted and their friend kidnapped. Can the players rescue their friend from the ghosts of his past before it's too late?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A story of twisted love from beyond the grave for 5th level characters using the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
