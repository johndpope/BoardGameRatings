			<description>Captain Tsubasa 5: Hasha no Shōgō Campione (キャプテン翼Ⅴ 覇者の称号カンピオーネ &amp;quot;Captain Tsubasa V Campione Champion Title&amp;quot;?) is the fifth and final instalment of the original Captain Tsubasa video game series by Tecmo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game differs greatly from its &amp;quot;Cinematic Soccer&amp;quot; oriented predecessors. It adopts a new gameplay with a classic view of the pitch and improved graphics. It features various RPG elements with special techniques of characters, known from Captain Tsubasa manga and anime series. Players strongly resembling real-life stars of the time: J&amp;uacute;lio C&amp;eacute;sar da Silva, Jean-Pierre Papin, Peter Schmeichel, Franco Baresi, Ronald Koeman, Tomas Brolin, Dennis Bergkamp, or Gabriel Batistuta are present in the game. Tecmo also introduced its own characters, like Brazilian ace Signori, ultra-fast forward Alcion, and world class goalkeeper Savičević, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's story mode focuses mainly on Tsubasa's Serie A season with Lecce and international campaign with Japan. In addition, other characters like Kojiro Hyuga, Genzo Wakabayashi, Lui Napole&amp;oacute;n, Carlos Santana or Karl-Heinz Schneider have their less-expanded scenarios as well. The competitions in the game are based on real major international tournaments, like Asian Cup, Copa Am&amp;eacute;rica and World Cup. In the All-star mode, the players can create new characters, arrange a friendly match (with all the teams, or by composing an own squad from all the players available in the game), and create a league with national or club teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Captain Tsubasa 5: Hasha no Shogo Campione&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
