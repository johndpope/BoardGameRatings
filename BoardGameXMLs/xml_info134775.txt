							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Task Force Trickster</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all a trick! History, mythology, reality... all of it a prank gone out of control. There&amp;rsquo;s only one who knows this though-- Coyote (or Loki, Raven, a rose by any other name...) and he&amp;rsquo;s not telling. It&amp;rsquo;s all just too fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadly, a universe full of tricks, schemes and illusions is a lot to manage, even for someone as powerful as Coyote. It just couldn&amp;rsquo;t be handled alone any longer. At first, just a few agents were recruited, sent here and there to keep up tricks that needed maintaining. Soon, there were more and more, but being taken from the human world, they were often too involved in the tricks themselves. It often caused the agents to get too wrapped up in their assign-ments. Coyote then decided that agents would not longer be recruited, but created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now packs of agents swarm all time and space, adjusting, repairing and creating tricks at Coyote&amp;rsquo;s bequest. Coyote has given them a wide range of tricks of their own to help them with their assignments and occasionally pops in if sees fit (but being Coyote, more trouble is often brought!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, throw on your jumpsuit, grab your gear and head over to the gate platform! The joke&amp;rsquo;s on you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
