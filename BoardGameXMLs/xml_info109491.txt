			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goblin known as Krazy Kragnar has a long and colorful history, not all of which has yet to be chronicled. Always quick to make a deal, take a risk, and turn a profit, Kragnar first came to prominence when he began a line of used-chariots yards (the merchandise for which is detailed in The Genius Guide to Loot 4 Less Volume 7: Krazy Kragnar&amp;rsquo;s Used Chariots). When that operation was shut down by angry dwarves, he turned to a new business plan with Krazy Kragnar&amp;rsquo;s Surplus Alchemy Shop. Buying post-dated alchemist&amp;rsquo;s fire and remaindered thunderstones turned out to be savvy trade, and soon Kragnar was dealing in fully legitimate alchemical materials, boosted in part by a sudden influx of alchemists throughout the world. Kragnar set up a large shop and bought a house in the Silk District of the city of Refuge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In return for going entirely legit, Kragnar got to watch the town guard do nothing as his Alchemy Shop went up in green flames after a patron carelessly tossed a still hot tindertwig into the half-off bin. The guard claimed the prismatic smoke pouring out of the windows was too dangerous to risk getting a bucket brigade near the flaming shop. Kragnar strongly suspected the human guard simply didn&amp;rsquo;t like seeing a goblin make more money in a week than a guard earned in a year. When the flames, peals of thunder, and random bursts of lightning and acid rain finally subsided around Kragnar&amp;rsquo;s shop, the goblin was bankrupt and no longer welcome in the homes of wealthier patrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was, thought Kragnar, a sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turning to some old friends who didn't care about his current circumstances, Kragnar quickly began building a new financial empire. This one paid more attention to high profitability and customer demand, and less to the rules of tariffs, taxes, recorded transactions, and craft-guild rules. In short, Kragnar joined a Goblin Market and started selling black market magic items. And in a matter of months, the canny goblin was once more rolling in coin...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
