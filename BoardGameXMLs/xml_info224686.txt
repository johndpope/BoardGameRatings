							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twilight Struggle Turn Zero and Promo Packs</name>
									
			<description>Note: This entry is compatible with the Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle. The card backs have the same art as the GMT Games published Deluxe Edition printings from 2009 onwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you who'd like to expand your Twilight Struggle experience, we present the Twilight Struggle Turn Zero and Promo Packs expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We offered these expansions initially only to backers in the Kickstarter campaign for the digital edition of Twilight Struggle. Based on customer requests, we have created sets of these expansions that are identical to the Kickstarter packs in every way, except that these were printed with card backs in the standard style of the TS Deluxe Edition card backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the two Promo Packs includes four new cards for the game, some including &amp;quot;What if&amp;quot; alternate history additions to the game. The Turn Zero expansion adds twelve new cards and a new starting point for Twilight Struggle. Also included in the expansion pack are rules for a new Optional Space Race Track, to add variability to your Twilight Struggle experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See the Wiki page below for a full description of the contents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
