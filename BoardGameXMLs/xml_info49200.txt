			<description>From the back cover...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excerpts from notes made by Ydal Eilffik, professor at the University of Horn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All know that there is much to worry about in these difficult times, but the skies have grown darker in the past few weeks, as if an omen of destruction hangs over us all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Baron Jemmas, the Warder, has been very preoccupied in the recent weeks.  This bothers me, for the mind of the ruler of the Barony of Horn ought to be clear, since his decisions affect us all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I can only hazard a guess at the problem that afflicts him for only vague rumors of the trouble have reached my ears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In the past several weeks there have been raids on several outlying towns of the Barony by mysterious golden marauders.  Whether these creatures are robots, mutants or men, none can be sure for reports are scarce.  The monsters are rumored to have struck from nowhere, then vanished without a trace, leaving only destruction in their wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Warder fears that unless something is done the very heart of the Barony will fall victim to this threat.  It is rumored that he had offered a substantial reward for the destruction of this 'Legion of Gold;.  I only hope it is not already too late.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first GAMMA WORLD module to be produced by the Game Wizards at TSR Hobbies, Inc.  This module includes the main Legion of Gold adventure, several mini-adventures which lead up to it, background information, suggestions for the referee, a special players' map and numerous referee's maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
