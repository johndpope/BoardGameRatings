							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great City, Dock Ward</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This shady ward extends in the southwest side of the Great City. The Dock Ward features many small alleys and streets that eventually end down to the docks. The docks are the trade link of the city; here there is always bustling activity as the ships come and go at every time of the night and day. Here, of course, many illegal activities are hidden and shady individuals move in and out the salt-smelling alleys and tavern of the Dock Ward. Numerous taverns and inns are placed on the very front end of the buildings, facing the great harbor of the city. Diving in the back alleys you can find even more entertaining places, such as houses of pleasure, gambling houses and so on. This blueprint features six of these buildings. The number of the building refers to the map available in the Great City blueprint. Some descriptions of these buildings follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 - Lighthouse: Two of these lighthouses flank the entrance to the Great City harbor. These tall structures mark the entrance of the harbor at night and during the stormy weather days. A single guardian takes care of each building, feeding the fire of beacon lantern on top of the building. The lighthouse features a wood storage that is loaded every day from local woodcutters. An elevator lifts the wood up to the beacon lantern.&lt;br/&gt;     2 - The Golden Eel Inn: This is the best Inn of the Dock Ward. The inn features a large reception hall, a restaurant (which is often visited even by people who are not inn&amp;rsquo;s guests) and a small parlor. The first floor features guests&amp;rsquo; bedrooms and a private meeting room for wealthy patrons.&lt;br/&gt;     4 - Warehouses: This set of buildings houses three distinct warehouses. The first one functions as boats garaging; the fishermen of the harbor pay a little fee to keep their boats here. The second one is a warehouse of salted herrings. The third one contains various tools of the trade for mariners and fishermen.&lt;br/&gt;     5 - Djanna, House of Pleasure: This is a well-known house of pleasure of the Dock Ward. The house features a large foyer and some private parlors where guests can entertain and talk. Often these places become secret meeting places for most of the organized criminals of the city. On the first floor there are many large bedrooms as well as storerooms.&lt;br/&gt;     6 - Dock: This is a typical pier of the Great City. Different types of ships usually crowd the water near the pier: drifters, rowboats, fishing boats and merchant ships.&lt;br/&gt;     10 - The Shy Mermaid Tavern: This tavern is located in the north end of the harbor. The tavern is the favorite meeting place for people who conduct shady activities. The tavern has a private meeting room and a back courtyard with stables where not-so-legal goods are delivered during the night and exchanged by these outlaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
