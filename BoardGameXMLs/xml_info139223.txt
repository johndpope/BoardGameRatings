			<description>Eurofighter Typhoon is a combat flight simulation game that models the jet fighter of the same name. Digital Image Design was in process of developing the game when the company was bought by Rage Software. The game is the successor to Total Air War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back story of the game posits Russia quickly invading the eastern countries of Europe. Iceland is the next one on the list, however NATO has basically abandoned the country in an attempt to protect the Western countries of Europe. The &amp;quot;ICEFOR&amp;quot; is outnumbered, but is able to deploy a small number of the new Typhoon aircraft. It's up to you to turn the tide of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a very extensive virtual battleground on and over Iceland, one of the most advanced of its time. A dynamic camera enables you to watch the war in realtime - be it a Saab JAS 39 Gripen dogfighting with Sukhoi Su-27, a Boeing AH-64 Apache attacking tanks, or a Panavia Tornado going on bombing runs. As the war unfolds, news reports will be delivered via an electronic newspaper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most interesting aspects of Eurofighter Typhoon is that it allows you to take over the destiny of six pilots. Pilots are assigned different missions depending on their abilities. Mission types include bombing, interception and Wild Weasel (anti surface to air missile operations) - several of these missions may even be going on at the same time. You are able to switch at any time between your pilots, taking charge of the most critical and dangerous tasks and leaving the others to the AI. As the war goes on, each pilot can suffer a variety of fates - including injury, being lost behind enemy lines (after an unlucky ejection and waiting for the rescue helicopters), or getting taken prisoner (and perhaps even being interrogated by the Russians).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Eurofighter Typhoon (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
