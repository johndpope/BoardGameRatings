			<description>Era of the Ninja is a game of stealth and combat in which players take on the role of ninja attempting to eliminate the lord of a castle in feudal Japan. Players may sneak through the castle or fight, but must be careful as the enemy is actively searching for them. As the players succeed, they gain ingenuity, which can be used to increase their arsenal of equipment or gain new skills for use in the search for the lord. Combat against enemy units has a wound mechanism that allows players to weaken their enemy before dealing a final blow and characters also have the use of mystical ki to help them overcome the obstacles ahead of them. Players must be careful though as the enemy gains strength in numbers. Players must find a way to survive long enough to locate defeat the lord to claim victory. In the end, only one player can be declared the victor &amp;ndash; the one who defeats the lord!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Era of the Ninja comes with multiple levels of play from Basic for new players to Advanced, which increases the challenge for veteran players. There are also different modes of play from Regular play, True co-op mode, Death Match, Team Death Match, and Head of the Lord allowing players the ability to choose their favorite type of game and play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
