							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Construct Codex</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Creepiest Creatures Ever Created&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constructs at first seem like such simple creatures, mindless automatons brought to a semblance of life by the power of magic. Yet consider them again, in light of a horror-themed campaign. These are not creatures but things, soulless, pitiless, without fear, judgment, or mercy, brought to a horrifying mockery of life by forces beyond comprehension. Their animus bound unwilling by the eldritch experimentation of madmen, the accursed invocations of apostate heretics, or risen into being by the tormented hauntings of spirits unable to rest and unwilling to forget or forgive the miseries they suffered or perpetrated in life. And what of those constructs that are not mindless at all but possessed of a malign and calculating intellect that makes them all the more hateful of those that live. These are what constructs can bring in a horror-themed adventure or campaign, and the Construct Codex brings you 11 brand-new creepy creations ranging from Challenge 1 to 17 to menace and maul your heroes, each one lavishly illustrated, along with optional rules using these fearsome creations as instruments of terror in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beasts of Legend series from Legendary Games are not your usual bare-bones bestiaries, but bring you richly detailed and evocatively described monsters drawing upon the myths and legends of the real world with a double dose of fantastic flair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
