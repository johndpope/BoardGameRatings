			<description>The gameboard showing 5 compartments each illustrating a sailing ship. 5 large cards also showing the same ships. 35 small cards representing the captain, pilot and cargo of each ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has played all his cards, he is out of the game and may lay his ship and cards aside. If it should happen that only two players remain at the last, the winning player sweeps the board, that is takes all the counters in the five compartments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
