			<description>This is a Swedish football (soccer) themed card game for two players from the 1930's.&lt;br/&gt;There are red attack cards and black defense cards. The first player plays an attack card. If the second player has a defense card he can save otherwise the first player scores a goal. The winner of the round (the scoring or saving player) has the next attack. The game ends when all the cards have been played and the winner is the one who has scored most goals.&lt;br/&gt;A variant for four players is also given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
