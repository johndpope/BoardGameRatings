							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cannonball Charlie</name>
									
			<description>Players spin to see what type of plastic brick to add to the wall being built in front of Charlie, who patiently bides his time in the shaft of an elastic-band loaded cannon.  When a certain weight threshold is exceeded, the elastic band trigger is released, propelling Charlie into the wall and eliminating the player who caused this to occur from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining players reset the cannon, replace Charlie &amp;amp; rebuild the wall from scratch, again trying to prevent Charlie from crashing into and collapsing the wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player remaining is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
