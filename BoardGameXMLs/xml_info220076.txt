			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost and separated in an abandoned castle set in a frozen wasteland. Your only possession left is a walkie-talkie, with a familiar voice on the other end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is always played with two people in the same game, but doing separate things. Player One is confined to a small secluded part of the castle. Player Two roams the castle trying to find Player One. Every room challenges your wits and ability to communicate clearly, using only your voice. There is no other way to communicate with each other, so make sure you have a microphone ready before starting the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
