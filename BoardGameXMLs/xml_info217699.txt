			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looper is a ring world found out on the Fringe.  Inside you will find all the details of the fantastic creatures and dangers that wait explorers of this strange new world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a special bonus with this new series of IF Treats, this new series of creatures of the Infinite Creatures series come with their own unique Fringe world (thus allowing for a wider range of environments than are currently cataloged in the populated worlds of the Fringe.)  Of course, this in no way means that these creatures must be used with this new world, nor that they even must be used in the Fringe setting. This new Origin World is, instead, intended to be a way of introducing strange and otherworldly sci fi creatures into a campaign within their own unique world with as little need for work from the Gamemaster to make that happen. These oddities come with a world ready made to receive them, a world which can be plopped down ready made into any Infinite Futures campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
