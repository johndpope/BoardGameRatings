			<description>A Hungarian game in which you will have to create a forest containing different kind of trees. You will have to buy saplings, plant and grow them up, chop them out to sell them so you can buy more saplings, and you will have to manage wild animals.&lt;br/&gt;It's a simple roll-and-move game, but in several fields you can draw cards that can contain questions about the forest and foresters, or you will have to recognize pictures of animals and plants for an extra roll.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is who is the first having a full grown-up forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
