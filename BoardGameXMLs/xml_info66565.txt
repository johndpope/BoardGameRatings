							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Well of the Twice-Born</name>
									
			<description>From the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the characters travel along an unremarkable and somewhat desolate road, strange events begin to plague and haunt the group. Pursuing the mystery of these events leads the adventurers to an ancient stone circle, a curious and ancient watering hole and the group of unusual woodland creatures that guard this sacred place, the Twice-born!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Drop Zone encounter is not designed as another quest for the material wealth of the characters, but as a test of their moral/ethical mettle. Will the party abide by the wishes of the Twice-born and simply leave the area? Will they attempt contact with these unique creatures and kindle a lasting friendship? Or will the group try to eradicate these guardians and plunder the site for all they can scrounge? This encounter is not meant to be a hack-n-slash, but an exercise in diplomacy. However, if the situation does degrade into combat, the Twice-born will give most adventuring parties a surprise or two and perhaps even a run for their money. Hopefully, in the end, the group will gain a new experience and perhaps some new friends and an ally in the Clan of the Twice-born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
