							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Short and Long Vowel Dominoes</name>
									
			<description>Short and Long Vowel Dominoes is an educational twist on traditional dominoes designed to teach short and long vowel sounds.  In this game, dominoes have combinations of short vowels, long vowels and pictures. Each player draws six dominoes. Dominoes are played in a single line. Dominoes may be laid down by matching vowel to vowel, a vowel to a picture with the matching vowel sound, or tow pictures with the same vowel sound. If a player cannot make a match, he or she draws a domino and passes to the next player. Double dominoes are played sideways in the line, and afterward players may play on either end of the original domino line or off either end of the double domino. If necessary, a list of vowel sounds for each picture is included so players may check their plays. The first player to place all his or her dominoes wins. If no player can lay a domino, the player with the fewest dominoes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
