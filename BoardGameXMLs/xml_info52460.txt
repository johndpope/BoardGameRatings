			<description>From Box Back:  18 holes of golf with nine holes on the front and nine holes on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Golf Game gives you everything you could ask for in a round of golf. Longest drive, iron shots, pitching, putting water hazards, out of bounds, sandtraps, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is as close to real golf as you can get without ever leaving your home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge Cards: With 3 levels of play: Junior, Amateur, and Professional.  All questions are golf related to help you eliminate penalties, teach you all about the game of golf, and challenge those who know everything about the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also Included are: Score Cards (to register all the strokes of each player), Easy to follow instructions (to give you all the help you need to play the game), The Golf Club Spinner (used for your drive, iron, pitching, and putting... even that hole-in-one you have been looking for).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Options: Skins game, Point system, and Best ball are alternate ways to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
