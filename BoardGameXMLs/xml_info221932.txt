At the same time, the street gangs of the slums have risen up to in a wave of theft and violence that have the city on edge. When their predations strike a bit too close to home for your heroes, you must seek out the hidden masters of the city's seedy underbelly to put a lid on this urban uprising before things get out of control!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orphans of the Hanged Man is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 1st-level characters.
