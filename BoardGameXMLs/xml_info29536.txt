			<description>This anti-drug program game for children between the ages of 8 to adolescence was &amp;quot;designed&amp;quot; by the creators of the popular television cartoon show &amp;quot;Ren and Stimpy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was never sold in stores and was only distributed to schools.  It was sponsored by the Coca-Cola company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed to be played with an adult leader as an educator and non-player &amp;quot;mission navigator&amp;quot; who was to explain the game and encourage a discussion among the &amp;quot;sun troopers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the game contents include a set of instructions, a game board, six-sided dice, colorful spaceship markers, stickers, and 200 various cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
