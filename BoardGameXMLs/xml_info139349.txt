							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hodge Podge, It&#039;s Not Just Trivia</name>
									
			<description>It's not over until the game picks the winner.  This game incorporates several mini-games that are played as you make your way to the End Game.  Success in the mini-games help increase the possibility of winning the End Game ans thus be selected the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trivia, memory, dice rolling luck, and use of resources are combined to create a fun and challenging game.  Not being good at trivia won't be a major stumbling block in this game, unlike other trivia games.  And not having a good memory won't mean you are doomed to lose the game either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game plays differently and there are several aspects to this game that adds excitement and fun.  No matter how badly the game is going for you, you will still feel you have a chance right up until the winner is determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
