			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP is an early Playstation 2 game developed by Namco. The game makes use of Namco&amp;rsquo;s arcade motocross design for 500GP. MotoGP features real bikes and tracks from the championship, and includes manufacturers such as Honda, Suzuki, and Yamaha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin the game with the ability to choose from 12 different bikes and 5 tracks. Completing Season mode by racing in the championship will unlock more difficult tracks. Players can also opt to play single races in Arcade mode against a number of computer opponents or a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional tracks and riders can also be unlocked in Challenge Mode.
