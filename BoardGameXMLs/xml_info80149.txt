							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Homeland Defense National Security Patrol</name>
									
			<description>The security of the nation is in your hands!  &lt;br/&gt;Plan, construct, staff and maintain border command centers, conduct city patrols and engage in anti- smuggling investigations. Do you have the intelligence and courage to handle the responsibility?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Maintain traffic checkpoints, train tracker dogs and investigate smuggling operations. But are you able to do it all within budget?&lt;br/&gt;     Use NEW technology to secure America - listening devices, satellite surveillance, remote cameras, helicopter patrols and more!&lt;br/&gt;     Review your daily briefing to determine which threats pose the most danger. &lt;br/&gt;     Interrogate detainees to gain information about future plans of smugglers or terrorists seeking to harm America.&lt;br/&gt;     Set an alert level based on the Homeland Security alert levels.  Increase the amount and level of agents patrolling the border at higher risk periods.&lt;br/&gt;     Reassign agents to new locations and patrol routes and monitor them using the electronic satellite map.&lt;br/&gt;     Outfit, arm and train your guards with top-of-the-line life-saving security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
