							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warehouse</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built almost completely from bricks with cast iron girders instead of wooden beams and sheet metal for roofing this is one of the more modern warehouses in the district. Its construction minimizes the risk through spreading fires in the warehouse district that would usually consume old and cheap wooden warehouses by the dozen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the back entrances are kept locked with sturdy metal doors and the first floor windows are secured with iron bars only to provide good ventilation as well as some security. The front doors were removed soon after the construction was finished as usually crates of goods arrive and leave at all times, day and night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
