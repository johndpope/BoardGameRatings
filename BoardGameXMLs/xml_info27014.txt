			<description>THE $64,000 QUESTION is a board game based on the UK version of the TV Game Show.  The aim of the game is to work along a question path answering questions and enter 'the isolator' to answer the $64,000 question.  The first player to get the $64,000 question correct is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions are categorized into 10 subject areas which are selected by the roll of a 10 sided die.  An additional category is provided when playing with younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
