							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron Lady&#039;s Fleet 2</name>
									
			<description>This game is a remake of Japanese publisher Technical Term Game Company's 2007 title, Iron Lady's Fleet. Like its predecessor and others in the publisher's series of modern naval conflict games, it is based on the Victory Games Fleet System of tactical and operational naval warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Lady's Fleet 2 takes a fresh look at the Falklands War conflict between Britain and Argentina, with a new mapboard, a new strategic movement grid, some new units and counters, and rule updates to bring this nine-year-old game into line with the company's more recent titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a ziplock package with Japanese rules, and Iron Lady's Fleet 2 is packaged with a new, smaller game, Andes Fleet, which looks at possible naval conflict among Peru, Colombia and Ecuador.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
