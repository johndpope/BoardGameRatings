							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scoop&#039;s Surprises</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's game based on the classic three-shell game.  One player takes the role of Scoop, an ice cream vendor promoting &amp;quot;his surprise ice creams.&amp;quot;  Four wooden ice cream cups are used to hide stacks of three wooden counters each.  Each wooden counter represents a scoop of ice cream in a particular flavor--vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, or mint--with all of the scoops of a particular flavor being hidden under a single ice cream cup.  The cups are then switched around--from 4 to 8 switches per round depending on what the players agree on beforehand--and the first player to Scoop's left tries to guess which cup a particular flavor (it's a little unclear from the rules, but apparently Scoop selects the flavor to be guessed) is under.  If they're correct, they get one of the &amp;quot;scoops&amp;quot; of that flavor, and they become Scoop (i.e. they get to switch the cups around) for the next round.  If they're incorrect, they lose one of their &amp;quot;scoops&amp;quot; from a previous round (if available) and the player to their left gets to guess.  Players have the option of passing if they don't want to risk losing a &amp;quot;scoop.&amp;quot;  At the end of the round (after either a player has guessed correctly or all players have passed or guessed incorrectly).  All of the cups are lifted and any lost &amp;quot;scoops&amp;quot; are returned to their respective stacks.  The game continues until all of the &amp;quot;scoops&amp;quot; have been won.  Cups with no &amp;quot;scoops&amp;quot; under them remain in the game.  The player with the most &amp;quot;scoops&amp;quot; (wooden tokens) is the winner.  The game comes with attractive wooden components, and ice cream vendor's hat to designate Scoop, and a sturdy box that's really quite a bit larger than necessary to hold everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
