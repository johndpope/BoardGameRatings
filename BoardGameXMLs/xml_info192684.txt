			<description>Venture out of the quarantine zone in Tokyo and continue the main story as you explore new areas, fight new enemies, meet a new cast of characters and uncover old secrets. A virulent new strain of the ever evolving Filth is spreading from the Tokyo docks. But new Orochi research is ready to meet this menace. Get your hands on the all new AEGIS shields, which will help defend you from the monsters in Tokyo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This update opens up big new areas of Tokyo. Explore the haunted Orochi Tenements. These houses used to be filled with the workers of the Orochi corporation. Horrors and demons now stalk the corrupted streets. Travel to the docks and take on all new monsters and an evolved strain of Filth. This new threat has been spreading from a cargo ship, containing creatures from another continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can now get your hands on even more powerful Orochi technology. The all new AEGIS shields will give you an added defense against the powerful creatures of Tokyo. You can swap between three different types of shields, depending on which type of enemy you face. All new upgrades for these shields have also become available, so you can customize your character's AEGIS equipment as you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
