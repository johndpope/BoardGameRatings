							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Curious Deck for Extraordinary Liars</name>
									
			<description>This is the first of a series of games based on some simple rules...  Here's the description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Curious Deck for Extraordinary Liars contains 56 peculiar cards depicting surreal and unintentionally hilarious Victorian art from ads and postcards dated 1880-1910.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructions for play:&lt;br/&gt;The first player takes a card from the deck. The card holder may choose to describe what they see on the card or lie about what is on the card. It's up to the other players to determine whether the card holder is lying or telling the truth. Players are permitted to ask questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have guessed Lie or Truth, the card holder announces the correct answer and reveals the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to the left then takes a new card from the deck and continues the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players who guess correctly get 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to 10 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
