			<description>Conquer the galaxy in an evening! Defeat your friends! Make alliances, only to back-stab your allies when the time is right!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warp Lane is a fast paced science fiction strategy game for two to six players, employing a simple rule system and no record keeping. It features a simple ship to ship combat system and five ship classes for balanced deep space fleets. Players build their ships, engage in commerce, and confront their enemies with one goal in mind: total domination of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board consists of a representation of the galaxy on a hex grid. Every dot on the board is a star system, with the stars grouped in a spiral having six arms. Some of the star systems are connected by warp lanes. The warp lanes have the effect of bridging distant star systems and speeding travel across the galaxy. On the edges of the galaxy are the home systems, which are the bases from which the players start their conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will develop and defend commercial empires, and force concessions from enemies by deploying powerful warships and fleets. The game progresses until one player dominates the galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now free!
