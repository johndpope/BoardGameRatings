			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gwendoline, daughter of Lord Angkor has been taken prisoner and is trapped in a brass plate armour at the bottom of a dungeon. Your goal is to find the keys to unlock the pieces of the armour and free Gwendoline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forteresse is an icon-driven adventure game. The player moves from location to location (each represented by a digitized photograph), collecting items as she goes. There are only six different items, each allowing to unlock new locations and the player can only carry three items at the time. The game also includes three labyrinths that must be crossed before a timer runs out. In order to win the game the player must draw a map and find the correct sequence in which to use the different items and cross the different labyrinths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
