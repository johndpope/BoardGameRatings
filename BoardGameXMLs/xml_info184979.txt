							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS Core Module: All American I â€“ Capture of the La Fiere Bridge 1944</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All American 1 - The Capture of La Fiere 1944: A brand new take on the battle at La Fiere, the ultimate small-unit struggle, a microcosm of a much larger battle. In addition to the Amercan airborne soldier, the star of the battle is the bocage country located along the Merderet River between Ste. Mere Eglise and the UTAH Beach exits. Securing the battlefield on D-Day 1944 was the responsbility of the 82nd Airborne Division, an elite unit with the drop into Sicily already recorded in the annals of airborne warfare the year before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the ATS CORE MODULES, all new for 2014. New map, larger, on cardstock, folding with no trimming needed -- did we mention new terrain art throughout AND larger hexes? Perfect for those classic -- YET ALL NEW ATS COUNTERS -- the you'll have on the map deciding history ... all ... over ... again! This module is for owners of the ATS 2014 Color Rules plus ATS Standard Small Markers + Large Markers but may also be used easily by owners of any past edition of the ATS rules. All Special Rules and AFV Cards needed for play are included, along with ALL NEW FOLIO STYLE packaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
