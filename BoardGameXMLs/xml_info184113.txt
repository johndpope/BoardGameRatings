							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Attack of the Mutant Rules System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack of the Mutant Rules System is heavily influenced by the Amber Diceless RPG, but is focused exclusively on superhero action.  Character creation uses a &amp;quot;point buy&amp;quot; system that allows players to allocate (usually) 50 points among attributes, pseudo-attributes (if any), and powers.  Negative score can be allocated to attributes to boost something else (for example, a -20 score could be taken in strength so that 70 points would then be available).  Attributes range from -30 to +100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pseudo-attributes include things such as appearance, wealth, perception, and luck.  Pseudo-attributes range from -5 to +10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powers are purchased for one point, when they are considered latent and undeveloped.  They can then be increased by purchase or through play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
