			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Lysa knew more than she had dared to put in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters to ruin, and if it came to war, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash;George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets and Schemes is the first Chapter Pack in the &amp;quot;Wardens&amp;quot; cycle for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords and ladies across the Seven Kingdoms have fought for the Iron Throne. Many have died. Still others have held back, aloof and apart. In Secrets and Schemes, you will discover sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) that touch upon the schemes these patient individuals have concocted. Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how they make their opening moves with a host of new Knights, attachments, and the agenda, Aloof and Apart, which encourages players to revisit some of the game&amp;rsquo;s most expensive, powerful, and recognizable characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the first chapter of the Wardens cycle, Secrets and Schemes also begins its exploration of the House Arryn trait and the introduction of the Castle plot type, which offers powerful rewards, but only when your plot enters the used plot pile. Additionally, a number of card introduce powerful new &amp;ldquo;Limited Response&amp;rdquo; abilities, which add new dimensions to this game term by moving it to the center of more meaningful decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
