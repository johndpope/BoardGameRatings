			<description>A fiery apparition stalking the college library. A space-faring circus. Murder on the Reykjavik Express. These are adventures you could have playing StoryCards, but you won't: you'll create your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StoryCards is a roleplaying game that is played from start to end in four hours or less, with no prior preparation. It uses a special deck of cards to inspire creativity, enabling you to quickly create richly detailed characters and adventures for a setting you invent together. And it uses minimalistic, common-sense rules to keep the adventure moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are inspirational tools which can be used in any game, any genre. As a gamemaster, you can flesh out complex NPCs in a few minutes with rich personality, goals, and backstory. As a player you can use them to create new characters, or bring life to old two-dimensional heroes. During play they provide quick inspiration, and players can use them to help each other perform amazing feats, or even to tweak the storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to infuse creative energy into your roleplaying, become inspired by StoryCards, and take your story in a new direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manual is downloadable from the publisher's website:  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://storycardsrpg.com/files/manual.1.0.1/StoryCardsManual.1.0.1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://storycardsrpg.com/files/manual.1.0.1/StoryCardsManual...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playsheets are also downloadable from the publisher: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://storycardsrpg.com/files/manual.1.0.1/StoryCardsPlaysheets.1.0.2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://storycardsrpg.com/files/manual.1.0.1/StoryCardsPlaysh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
