			<description>The gift machine has broken down and has to be repaired! This is done by connecting the machine parts with a line of dominoes (standing up, so that they can be toppled, not lying down).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of Tims T&amp;uuml;ftel-Team, several cardboard tokens representing the machine parts are scattered along the table. The game is played in rounds; in each round, two tokens have to be connected. At the start of the first round, one token is selected as the starting token, and this also dictates which token will be the destination token. In later rounds, the destination token from the previous round becomes the starting token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the players take turns placing dominoes in the line from the start token to the destination token, building past any other tokens. Each turn, a player rolls a die, which allows him to add zero to three dominoes to the line. When the destination token is reached, the round ends. The player whose turn it is gets to topple the dominoes by pushing the first domino in the line. First, though, the other players have to predict whether or not the entire line of dominoes will fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After predictions have been made, the first domino is toppled. If the entire line falls, then the toppling player receives a gift token, as well as any player who made the right prediction; if some dominoes remain standing, the players who predicted that receive a gift token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After six rounds, the game ends, and the player who has gained the most gift tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the expert version of the game, various contraptions for connecting two lines of dominoes are included, and in each round, one of these is included in the line of dominoes connecting the start and destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
