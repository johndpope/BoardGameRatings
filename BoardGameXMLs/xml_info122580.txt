							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Petz Dogz 5</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simulation game where you take care of a number of dogs. The player can take the dogs to different locations and play with them there. Included ar five very simple mini-games which give the players new toys for their dogs. Toys won can be stored and used in all the environments. Rather lo-fi pixel graphics but maybe because of that the series has spawned a community modding the game. &lt;br/&gt;Small kids enjoy it much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
