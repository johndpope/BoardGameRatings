			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City of Birds is an innovative story-telling game where you and your friends play citizens of an ancient empire&amp;rsquo;s capital city. Your characters deeply enmeshed in their society and bound to one another. They have histories and paths in life; but when these are interrupted, they will be forced to react and change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In City of Birds there are no dice, and no statistics. Characters are defined by their roles and connections to other people. Stones and coins regulate the flow of play, while players share various GM-like duties. Little preparation is needed: you can be up and playing in half an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
