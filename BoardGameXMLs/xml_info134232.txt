							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exodus: Supplies bonus card</name>
									
			<description>Supplies is an extra Bonus Action card which was designed to be used together with the base game, Exodus: Proxima Centauri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Supplies bonus action allows every player to receive one free Upgrade of their choice, provided they have already researched the required technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that, as is, this card is not compatible with the Revised Edition of the base game (it is larger than the other cards and the card back is also different). However, this card was reprinted in 2017 with new artwork and matching card back as part of the Exodus: Event Horizon expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
