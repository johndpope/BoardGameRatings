			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 3226, revolutionaries have freed Taiw...St. Ives from the oppression of the Third League. But are the people of Taiw...St. Ives really free? Or are they just trading on {sic} oppressor for another? With the Third League unlikely to stand for treason, Taiw...St. Ives will be the center of the universe for a brief period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third League Turning Points: Free Taiw...St. Ives fleshes out the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Third League Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of forces fighting for control&amp;mdash;and survival&amp;mdash;of this instrumental world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a &amp;ldquo;Taiw...St. Ives flavor.&amp;rdquo; The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of Taiw...St. Ives, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players&amp;rsquo; imaginations are the limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;Turning Points&amp;quot; pdf was published as 2012 April fool's joke and is not part of the regular setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
