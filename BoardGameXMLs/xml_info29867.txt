			<description>The game is played on 7&amp;times;7 grid game board. The 4 corner spaces are the home harbours, where the players start with their ship. The 45 other spaces form the sea, which is filled with 45 wave chips. A red(!) pirate ship is placed in the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The harbours contain 3 of 4 merchandise with prices that are defined by a dice throw at the beginning of the game. A player can load his ship with up to 2 merchandise and must deliver them in another harbour than they are bought from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player must make 3 moves: 1 wave, his ship and the pirate ship. Waves are stacked upon each other, ships cannot jump over other ships. Movement is determined by the number of waves and playing pieces on the starting space, but a wave must be left back at every crossed space during a move. In this way, the waves shift constantly over the sea giving a really floating sea feeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the player who has earned a previously fixed amount of gold pieces the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
