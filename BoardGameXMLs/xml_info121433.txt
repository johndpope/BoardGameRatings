							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Racing Gears Advance</name>
									
			<description>Racing Gears Advance is a combat racing game for the Game Boy Advance system released in 2004 and includes licensed vehicles from GM, Dodge, Mitsubishi and Lotus Cars. It was the breakout game for Orbital Media Inc. and received high ratings from the likes of GameSpot and IGN, staying in the top 5 GBA games for 2005.&lt;br/&gt; The soundtrack is notable for having been composed by Neil D. Voss, known for his prior work on Tetrisphere and The New Tetris.&lt;br/&gt; This game may be conceived as a mix between Gran Turismo (for the sim racing part) and Impact Racing (because it uses weapons in the game). All circuit cups (there are five total) take the name of letters from the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Omega), with each cup having five tracks (so 25 tracks total).&lt;br/&gt; Characters such as Spacewave, Jack Speed, Throttle, etc., drive the following cars:&lt;br/&gt; Cadillac Escalade&lt;br/&gt; Chevrolet Corvette&lt;br/&gt; Chevrolet SSR&lt;br/&gt; Dodge Viper&lt;br/&gt; Dodge Magnum&lt;br/&gt; Hummer H2&lt;br/&gt; Lotus Esprit&lt;br/&gt; Lotus Exige&lt;br/&gt; Lotus Elise&lt;br/&gt; Lotus 340R&lt;br/&gt; Mitsubishi Lancer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Racing Gears Advance&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
