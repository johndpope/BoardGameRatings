			<description>This is a roll and move game across a map of the world divided into a grid 52 spaces wide (E-W) and 33 spaces deep (N-S). There are four start spaces, two on each of the east and west edges, and travellers (wooden triangles) must use a variety of vehicles (wooden cubes and cylinders) to get to the opposite edge of the board and on the other side of the equator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea squares are blue, with some light blue squares that are impassable. Land squares are green, red, yellow or purple. There are eight modes of transportation, each restricted by color: cars and trains (green); aeroplanes (green, red and cross-hatched yellow, blue or purple; horses (red); camels (yellow), porters and pack animals (purple); and vessels (blue). These are scattered across the map on designated squares at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players throw three dice on their turn. The red die and one white die are normal D6, the second white die is directional (N,S,E,W, and two blanks). Travellers must be on some form of transportation to move, and the white dice determine how many squares and in which direction (blanks are player's choice). The red die is used to move empty vehicles to where the traveller can intercept them and change modes. Players must move the full amount unless it brings them to a terrain border, and must change modes if they encounter an unoccupied vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game is undated, it appears to be a 1930s design, since aeroplanes can only move short distances across water (Mediterranean, Caribbean, SE Asia) and not across oceans. Also, as common in the 1930s, the game comes in a small box with a separate board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
