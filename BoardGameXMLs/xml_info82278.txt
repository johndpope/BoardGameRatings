			<description>not to be confused with the 1990 scrolling action game of the same title&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hunt for Red October - video game based on the book The Hunt for Red October. It was released in 1987 and was available for the Atari ST, Amiga, Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and IBM PC. A port for the Apple IIGS was released in 1989. The player must navigate the Red October towards U.S. waters while avoiding the Soviet Navy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a combination of submarine simulator and strategy game. Computer Gaming World described it as an excellent submarine simulator, controlled entirely by mouse. The replay value of the game was also praised, as the Soviets change tactics with each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Hunt for Red October (1987 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is for the player, as captain Ramius, to navigate the Red October towards U.S. waters while avoiding the Soviet Navy. The game is set in the later days of the Cold War and is a (fictional) submarine simulation, with strategy elements. The player operates the &amp;quot;Red October&amp;quot;, a nuclear missiles carrying submarine with a futuristic propulsion system as described in the novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with any reasonable modern sub simulation, the play is focused on monitoring instruments, maps and the like. However, for the very inquisitive players there is a periscope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
