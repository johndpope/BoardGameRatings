His beloved Helium was one of the greatest kingdoms on Barsoom and its allies flourished. New heroes arose, such as Cathoris and Llana of Gathol. This book focuses on those later days of Barsoom, including the characters, events, and locations vital to stories set during this period. Also included are expanded discussion and character background options for playing mixed heritage characters and legacy characters&amp;mdash;those descended from great heroes of Burroughs&amp;rsquo; world or perhaps even your earlier campaigns! Includes advice on running adventures during this period, where Carter and his allies are prominent, but the dying world of Barsoom still needs new heroes and champions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
