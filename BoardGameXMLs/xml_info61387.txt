			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thou shalt have no other gods before me.&lt;br/&gt;-Exodus 20:3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lord is displeased with Bethbeer. This village in southern Israel has been experiencing a series of strange occurrences, from inordinately high birthrates to mysterious sightings in the wilderness, for three years. Visitors from afar have taken a keen interest in the isolated roadside town, and shadowy figures conspire with powers alien to the Lord. Will you discover the secret of Bethbeer and help redeem the village from its downward spiral into heresy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Other Gods is a challenging adventure set in the world of Testament: Roleplaying in the Biblical Era for heroes of 1st- through 3rd-level. Set in the time of the Judges, it can be easily adapted to any era between the Conquest and Exile, as well as scaled for higher-leveled parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Other Gods is the first adventure in the Terra Mythica line, and the first licensed adventure for Green Ronin's Mythic Vistas setting Testament: Roleplaying in the Biblical Era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
