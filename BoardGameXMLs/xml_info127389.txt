			<description>Professional is a dice rolling game where players go around the board &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; themselves in any of the four sports in the game: golf, snooker, tennis and track. It has a board resembling a Monopoly board with spaces with sports competitions, training, and both specified and random events. The game features five decks of cards: One for each sport and one for random events, much like the Chance cards in Monopoly. Also included is a variety of paper currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to train oneself and compete in the various sports to gain a million dollars. The first player to obtain that amount wins. The tournaments are divided into minor and major competitions with varying prize amounts for the first two places, as well as a &amp;quot;walkover&amp;quot; prize which will be handed out if only one player were to enter the competition. Training cards can be obtained in the training spaces. These cards are not only necessary to gain access to competitions, but can also boost the &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot; of the player when dice are rolled. Throwing dice is done to move on the board as well as determine competition winners, with the highest rolls winning unless card modifiers are in play. Other spaces include sponsorship funding, income taxes, injuries, travel fees, sporting luck (chance cards) and the start square, which trains a player in all sports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game cover says that it supports 2-6 players, the rules inside the box mention 3-6 players. While it can be player with only two players, the game works much better with more players. Even 3 is quite few and in order to really play well, at least 4 players should be present as the competition dynamics really require that many players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was made and printed in South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
