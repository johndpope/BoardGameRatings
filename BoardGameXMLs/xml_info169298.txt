			<description>To train children's growing understanding of playing games with relaxing fun and social interaction.&lt;br/&gt;The game also stimulates children's recognition, helps them understand abstracts and, not least, trains their language skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a memory game, but instead of matching two face down cards as in the classic Memory, the player need only to remember one; the player board contains three objects similar to those in the game, and the player need to find the object from their player board(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn (starting by the youngest player), each player flips over one face down card and show it openly; if the player see it matches his/her player board (s)he can take it and place it there, if it is wrong the tile is flipped and the next player have the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When matched three items, the player now needs to find (or remember where to find) a &amp;quot;happening&amp;quot;. First to match three (or six if played with two boards) items and a happening wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
