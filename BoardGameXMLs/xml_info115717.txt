			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While traveling north, you eventually end up in Neverwinter, a large, bustling city that, while located in an area of constant frigid cold, remains pleasantly warm due to the fire elementals that make their home under the river that flows through the city. The city itself is a pleasant place, very accommodating to strangers; especially those with money. A warm bed, hot meals, and supplies await any with the means to afford them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While staying the night in Neverwinter, the PCs are in a tavern or inn having dinner. Along the wall near the front door are dozens of small posters with hand-drawn faces. Upon further inspection, these pages are wanted posters displaying various criminals wanted by the law of Neverwinter. Rewards are listed beneath each picture, ranging anywhere from 400gp to 5000gp each. The only catch is, most of the wanted criminals are required to be brought back alive in order to face prosecution for their crimes, and for the captors to receive the reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
