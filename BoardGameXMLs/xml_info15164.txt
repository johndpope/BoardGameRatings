			<description>From faraway Shamir, in the heart of the desert of Syharhalna, the Alchemists of Dirz have introduced a mysterious enchantment, the Ritual of Dawn, which may very well turn the continent&amp;rsquo;s future upside down&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;Aarklash has now entered the Age of Darkness. All peoples are already gathering their forces and raising their armies for the apocalyptic conflicts to come. &lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to take up the challenge of Rag&amp;rsquo;Narok ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rag'Narok is Rackham full scale battles miniature games based on the Aarklash world background previously introduced with Confrontation. The rules itself are much more involved than many other fantasy game out there, with a lot of new ideas, including orders and strategy cards usable by the various formations, a much involved fighting system that allows combats to develop as they continue, instead of the classical static melee that stands still until one or the other formation routs. All the miniatures and cards from Confrontation can be used with this game. The game includes two books, one containing the rules, and the other one containing a lot of background infos, and both are beautifully illustrated. Also various cards and counters are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Confrontation: The Age of the Rag'Narok&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
