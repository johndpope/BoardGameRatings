			<description>The small players thread the animals one by one according to the order of the cards. Once all animals have been threaded in the correct order and are placed in the middle of the table the game is over and all the players have won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game with our Funny friends is convenient for the youngest. Even at two years children are able to follow easy instructions and the game figures are extra big so that the small hand can grasp easily. The clear shapes and colours are especially age oriented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 6 animals (dog, cat, sheep, horse, cow, pig) &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 6 wooden cards &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 string &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 lacing stick&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 coloured Beleduc Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
