			<description>VEX - Exciting Game of Strategy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (2 or 4 may play) attempts to line up 5 pieces of the same color, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES OF PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player selects a group of like-colored pieces and gathers his pieces to his position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The group picks a Starter who begins the hand by placing one of his pieces near the center of a table or a flat playing area.  After the first hand, the winner of each hand may be the Starter for the next hand. Action then continues around the playing area to the Starter's left, with each player placing one of his pieces on the playing area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. EACH PIECE THAT IS PLACED ON THE TABLE OR PLAYING AREA MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE COMPLETE SIDE TOUCHING ONE COMPLETE SIDE OF AT LEAST ONE OTHER PIECE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PLAYED!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. A player may place a piece next to any other piece, thus blocking the other players' attempts to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Players may warn each other that someone is about to win, but the game is especially exciting if the players agree not to warn each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. The first person to win 5 hands wins the game.  If the group wishes, a time limit may be set, and the player who wins the most hands in that time wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. If all the pieces are played, but no one has won, the winner is the one who has the most groups of 4 pieces, or the hand may be replayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
