			<description>Commodity is a buying and selling game that is not meant to simulate real life, although there are some similarities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 12 and up can play Commodity.  Younger children can play with an adult and may even win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Commodity is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To make money by buying and selling.&lt;br/&gt;2. To pay off all debts.&lt;br/&gt;3. To manage your company to gain wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commodity can be played to different limits which the players can set at the beginning of (or during) the game.  For example, an average game would be set at $1,000,000, a shorter game at $500,000 and a longer game at $2,000,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win Commodity, a player must:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Be debt free.&lt;br/&gt;2. Reach the limit set by the players.&lt;br/&gt;3. Declare a win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to declare a win, a player must state, ON HIS TURN, that he has met or gone beyond the set limit.  This player then completes his turn.  The other players now have one more turn to try and defeat the declaring player.  The player with the most money at the end wins.  A player DOES NOT have to declare a win until he chooses to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.markallangames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.markallangames.com&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
