			<description>In this free game that is part of the German magazine Spielbox (number 3/2007), all players rush from start to finish. But at the end of the game it's not the fastest the winner but the player with most coins.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 12 coins. Every player has always three cards with values of 1/2/3 to move his pawn accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;The first player chooses a card, all other player try to guess what value he has chosen. This first player will move his pawn according to the value of the card but the other players have to compare their guesses.&lt;br/&gt;Were they right, then they have to move one field further than that first player. The first player has also to give them a coin. &lt;br/&gt;A player that guessed wrong only moves one field ahead ignoring the card he has played.&lt;br/&gt;The First player changes every move around the players. The game ends with the first player reaching the finish field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
