							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FreeSpace Tactics</name>
									
			<description>FreeSpace: Tactics is the official licensed miniatures game for two or more players based on the FreeSpace video games from Interplay. The core set includes four different ships (Apollo, Valkyrie, Anubis and Horus) from the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FreeSpace: Tactics uses cards for movement and combat. During set up, players customize their movement decks with a number of Ace cards based on their ship types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each turn, players simultaneously select one card from their hand for each ship. Cards are revealed in initiative order and that ship moves and attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system uses d6, d8 and d10 dice - the exact pool comes from the attacker ship type and card used. Damage reduces shields and inflicts hull damage. Missiles roll a special die and may deal critical hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six scenarios come in the core set, and there are guidelines for expanding those scenarios or creating your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
