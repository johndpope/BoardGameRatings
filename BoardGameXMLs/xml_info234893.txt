			<description>Welcome everyone to humiliated the game where you will laugh, cry, and be humiliated. The first person draws a duel card and go against someone and they play(rock paper scissors, flex off to a macho song or head bang to a rock song.) The winner gets a point and the loser has to draw a humiliated card which is where the real fun starts. Having to pick a humiliated could be something that is not that bad or it could be something awful (someone throws a hot dog at your face, draw a 70s porno mustache on your face with a marker, or the bukake party) Win the most duels and you're the winner . The stories you will have after you play will be unforgettable. Grab this game, get some laughs, and tell your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
