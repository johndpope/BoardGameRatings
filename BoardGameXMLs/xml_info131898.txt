			<description>Sands 500 is a motor racing game for 2-6 players. The object of the game is to be the first player to have their racing car cross the finish line after an agreed upon number of laps of the circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin the game the first player to spin a four on the Spinner goes first and has their choice of which coloured lane to place their racing car. Then the player to the left has their choice of lane and so on until all players have had a lane allocated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who goes first spins the Spinner and whoever has a racing car on the same lane as the colour indicated by the dial moves the number of spaces shown in that segment. The leader can then change lanes to whatever colour they think will come up next. After the leader has chosen a lane the next player in position order can do likewise (it is permissible to have two or more racing cars in the same lane).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game progresses with each player following the direction of course until the leader crosses the finish line either by a 'flying finish' (crossing the line on any number) or finishes on exactly the right number as decided before the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1x Board&lt;br/&gt;1x Spinner with rules&lt;br/&gt;4x Racing cars (one each of red, blue, green and yellow)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
