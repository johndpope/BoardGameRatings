			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hollow Sea is a dangerous place, especially for an 80-foot Side-wheeler steamer like the S.S. Gambit. Her decks are low to the water, making her crew easy targets for Plesiosaurs, and her hull is not made for the battering that could come from even &amp;ldquo;incidental&amp;rdquo; contact with the great beasts of the ocean. Rivers, lakes and coastal waters she would be good, and her ability to use coal to power her steam engines would be a plus in the Hollow Earth, where processed fuel oils would be at a rare to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what shore is she beached upon, and what will become of her if her crew chooses to travel by foot around this land? Perhaps another group of stranded adventurers will find her and bring fire to her cold boilers. Only time will tell...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
