			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve already read the rules to the Warriors Adventure Game, you may find it a little cumbersome to keep flipping back and forth between the Skills and Knacks and other areas as you create or improve your cat character. The rules are designed to teach and explain the game, so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of extra information you may not need all the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Quick Start Guide has been created for players who already know the rules and are looking to get at the meat of the information quickly. There are very few explanations or details&amp;mdash;just the facts about what you do during the character creation and improvement process, plus a quick overview of the game rules. In order to make use of these details, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to understand the main rules for the Warriors Adventure Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
