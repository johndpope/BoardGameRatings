			<description>In this game the object is to reach a goal at the end of a long track with colored spaces. These colors correspond to the bases of several figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player takes a figure (each has a sports theme - soccer player, race car, etc.) At the start of a turn you may exchange your figure for any that remain free in the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After exchanging or not, a die is rolled and the player moves. After movement the figure may be exchanged again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on squares that match the base color provide a bonus, while trying to move from squares with a different base color is difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
