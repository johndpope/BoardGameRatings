			<description>You are a teenager who was getting ready for your first trip with the Junior Hikers. When you attempted to spin the globe that your eccentric great-aunt gave you for your tenth birthday, the globe didn't turn. Instead, either you shrank or the globe grew until you found yourself standing at the north pole of a small world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are wearing your backpack, hiking boots, and socks. A large key is stuck in the ground. The unturning world to the south is split into various time zones: midnight, evening, twilight, etc. You'll probably want to explore this world you now find yourself on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small World (Andrew D. Pontious; 1996; TADS 2).&lt;br/&gt;IF Comp 1996: 4th place of 27 entries.&lt;br/&gt;XYZZY Awards 1996: Winner of Best Individual NPC (the devil), Best NPCs. Finalist for Best Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: IFWiki, &amp;quot;Small World,&amp;quot; available under Public Domain License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
