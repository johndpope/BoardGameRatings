			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Refuge is a role playing game for both beginner and advanced Gamers. With a revolutionary new &amp;ldquo;Magic&amp;rdquo; system called The Leyas, all characters have their share of power. Unlike the limp-wristed mages of other game systems, characters in DR can use their magical abilities every round and are skilled warriors as well. Characters can Shapeshift their bodies, Summon monsters to their aid, and turn their Enemies powers against them. Set on the planet Refuge, a world of lost technology and high magic. Easy to play, Dark Refuge will appeal to gamers of all backgrounds. The Revised Edition clarifys rules, has additional monsters and gear and expanded information on the Colonies of Refuge. With the fastest paced combat and magic system to date, Dark Refuge the Adventure Game is a must have for all gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides unique, easy to learn game mechanics and a setting that stands on the edge between Sci-Fi and High Fantasy, complete with its own expansive mythology. Great for the casual gamer, who is looking for a fun way to spend a night with friends. Yet it allows a level of customization of characters that will keep the hardcore gamer playing for years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
