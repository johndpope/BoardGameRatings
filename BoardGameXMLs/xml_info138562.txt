			<description>Quiz game about M&amp;uuml;nchen (Munich) landmarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a map of the city, with a track wandering through it. If a player is the first to land on one of the numbered spaces, he draws the card from the deck of 30 cards and reads out the information on the blue side of the card. Then he turns the card over to see what instructions he has to follow. This are fairly predictable; Miss a turn perhaps, roll the die and move backwards, and so on. The player then takes the card and keeps it in front of him where all the players can see it. The card will have a value ranging from 5 to 30, with the value being commensurate with the penalty value of the instruction on it. If a subsequent player lands on a numbered field that has already been taken, then he treats the space as a normal space without number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the numbered space 30 has been reached, that player has finished. The others play on. When all the players have reached the 30 space, the 'won' cards are added up and the winner is the one with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
