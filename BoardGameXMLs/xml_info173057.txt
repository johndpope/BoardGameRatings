			<description>Go Fish Yourself is a party game that takes the familiar Go Fish card game and twists it into something that is actually fun to play.  Players try to get one another to make pairs of dirty-sounding, nautically-themed cards.  Each card comes with a challenge.  The more pairs a player makes, the more challenges that player must face.  Before long, players are standing on chairs with socks on their hands and cards on their heads.  As soon as a player fails or forgets to perform a challenge, that player is out of the game.  The last player left in the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go Fish Yourself is more than just one deck of cards.  It comes with a series of expansions that will allow players to keep the nonsense going.  Each expansion comes with 52 new cards and challenges.  These expansions (or editions) can be played as standalone games or combined with the original.  Players are able to mix and match their favorite pairs from all or any of the expansions to create customized decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
