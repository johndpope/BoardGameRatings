			<description>This game is a fantasy based game with strong gameplay ties to Battleship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player secretly sets up his own dungeon; there's a stand-up cut-out castle to use as a shield between the players. You place the square-shaped walls all over the place in your dungeon, along with stairwells to the smaller 2nd level of the dungeon. You also place your monsters and various treasures for the other player to discover, fake treasures (mimics) and your boss monster. You cannot place the weapons in such a way that they're impossible to get to (either cut off by walls or the boss monster). Your then tell the other player which space the entrance to the dungeon is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn calls out the space he wishes to move to. You must call out each space one at a time. If there is a wall there, the player's turn ends. If the space is clear, they may continue on. If there is a monster, it must be fought. If the player is victorious, he gains a reward card for defeating it and may continue on; otherwise his turn ends. If there is a treasure chest, the player may examine it. If it's a treasure, he may keep it and move on. If its a mimic (a monster that looks like a treasure chest), then he must fight it as if it was a monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play alternates between players until one player gets all 3 necessary treasures and then fights and kills the boss monster; that player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is minimal text on the components; as long as one player knows the rules and what the cards do, it is easy to show the other player (the cards with JPN text on them have distinctive pictures to make it easy to remember once told what it does)..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
