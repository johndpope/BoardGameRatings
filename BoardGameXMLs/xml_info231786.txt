			<description>The debates in the history of the church were heated, but the game based on them is fun to play! You, your cards, and your opponents will determine what is in the canon - but it is up to you to be the player whose own canon matches the central one most closely and most often, to earn the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with a hand of five cards.  Throughout the game, players will collectively play cards into and take cards from a set of seven central canon cards.  Players also play into and take cards from their own personal set of seven canon cards. On a turn, players can draw a card or play a card.  Cards can be drawn from the central canon, personal canon, draw stack, or discard pile.  Cards can be played into the central canon, personal canon, or discard pile.  Matching cards can be placed on top of each other in subsequent turns, which can make it more difficult to remove a card from the central canon or make that stack of cards in your personal canon worth many more points.  The game ends the turn after the draw pile is depleted.  Final scoring is determined by the number of cards in each player's personal canon that match the central canon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Testament Edition includes passages from the Christian Old Testament and the Jewish Torah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
