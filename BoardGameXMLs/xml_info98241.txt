							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Videocart-18: Hangman</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game of Hangman, the computer selects a secret word, from a predefined vocabulary or a list of words you have entered yourself. You try to guess the word, letter by letter, and save the figure from being hung. Each wrong guess brings the figure closer to hanging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1 - 1 player, no score&lt;br/&gt;Game 2 - 2 players, no score&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player guesses a letter. If it is correct, the same player guesses again. When he misses, the second player tries a letter and continues guessing until he misses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 3 - 1 player, scored&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The green score on the top of the screen tells the number of words guessed correctly. The blue score on the bottom of the screen tells the number of times the figure is hung.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 4 - 2 players, scored&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds as in game 2. Players get 1 point for each letter guessed correctly; if the letter appears twice in the word, the player gets 2 points. There is a bonus of 2 points for getting the word right. When a player gets hung, the opponent gets 1 point.&lt;br/&gt; The right-hand player's score appears at the top of the screen in green. The left-hand player's score appears at the bottom of the screen in blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the hand controller to select Mode A-N for the desired combination of the following features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: Normal Game&lt;br/&gt;B: Free Letter&lt;br/&gt;C: Unknown Length&lt;br/&gt;D: Free Letter / Unknown Length&lt;br/&gt;E: Squeeze&lt;br/&gt;F: Free Letter / Squeeze&lt;br/&gt;G: Unknown Length / Squeeze&lt;br/&gt;H: Free Letter / Unknown Length / Squeeze&lt;br/&gt;I: Where Does it Belong?&lt;br/&gt;J: Free Letter / Where Does it Belong?&lt;br/&gt;K: Unknown Length / Where Does it Belong?&lt;br/&gt;L: Free Letter / Unknown Length / Where Does it Belong?&lt;br/&gt;M: Mix Them Up&lt;br/&gt;N: Enter Your Own Words&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
