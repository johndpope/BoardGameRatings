							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frontier Marshal / Star of India</name>
									
			<description>Two games are included in the box: Frontier Marshal and Star of India, both of which use a different side of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frontier Marshal is a standard roll-and-move game where players move their pawns and carry out whatever action is printed on the space they land on.  The game is themed as &amp;quot;deputies chasing a bandit&amp;quot; - one player is the bandit, the remainder are deputies.  The game ends when the bandit is either captured or becomes trapped (by certain spaces on the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star of India is also roll-and-move, with players this time attempting to secure the precious &amp;quot;Star of India&amp;quot; ruby from the House of Gems and return it to the Maharaja.  The game features a cardboard ring that the player can hang around their pawn's neck to show ring ownership - the winner is the first player to return home with the ring.  Alarm spaces and thefts from other players add some complications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
