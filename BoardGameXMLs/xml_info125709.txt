			<description>RoboRiot is a light, family-friendly card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In RoboRiot you are competing with the other players in the Worldwide RoboRiot Tournament, in which Robot Engineers such as yourself are tossed into an arena full of mismatched Robot pieces. Your job is to scramble to put together the best bot you can, as quickly as you can, and hope it is strong enough to beat all of the others. If you win, you gain Medals. If you lose, you forfeit medals. Be the player with the most medals when one or more players runs out of them to claim victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
