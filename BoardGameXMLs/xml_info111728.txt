							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Comic Action Heroes Game</name>
									
			<description>Boardgame released by Denys Fisher in the seventies as part of the Comic Action Heroes line of toys. &lt;br/&gt;It's an official DC licensed version, and includes the heroes Superman, Batman, Robin and Shazam against the villains Joker, Riddler, Mr Freeze and the Penguin.&lt;br/&gt;It's a fairly basic roll and move game, where the object is to reach the top of the 3-d cityscape that clips onto the board, but the playes also control the movement of the villains to hinder your opponents progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
