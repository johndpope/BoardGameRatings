							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Necromancer&#039;s Almanac: 2012</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sixty pages of combined archetypes, alternate class features, and feats is a pretty weighty book unto itself. Just shy of 300 feats, spanning a further sixty pages, is hardly anything to sneeze at, either. And when you add a further sixty-five pages of magic items of all sorts, and well over 200 additional spells, you have a sourcebook of truly titanic proportions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Almanac: 2012 is a compilation of all the material produced in 2012 for Necromancers of the Northwest&amp;rsquo;s popular article lines Best in Class, Extraordinary Feats, Magic Market, and Obscure Arcana. Clocking in at 300 pages, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to believe that this book was a full year in the making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll find exciting and experimental new spells, which toy with taking magic in strange and unusual directions. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a feat for just about every occasion, and a magic item for virtually any need, plus dozens of in-depth archetypes for lots of exciting and evocative staples of the fantasy genre. With A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Almanac: 2012, you&amp;rsquo;ll have all the options to make exactly the character you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what&amp;rsquo;s more, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to search through dozens of articles to find it. Everything has been collected, archived, and gathered in an organized fashion, making finding what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a breeze, including an extensive network of built-in links within the .pdf itself, which allow you to go straight from a spell list or magic item price table to the thing you&amp;rsquo;re looking at, without even needing to use the also thoroughly-prepared bookmarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
