			<description>From cover&lt;br/&gt;Wanna job?&lt;br/&gt;There's a weird one going in that famous house at the end of London's Mall. Yes, this is your chance to be a really creepy, crawly flunky in Buck House!&lt;br/&gt;But you'll need a few qualifications to make the frade as menial mansercant. Any good at bomb disposal, fighting rats, avouding homicidal guards and chatting up the Royals? Quick reactions and strong nerves will earn you your pay. But win or lose, remember - life is never dull for a flunky!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Don Priestley game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flunky (sometimes known as Mad Flunky) is a computer game programmed by Don Priestley and released in 1987 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. It was published by Piranha Games. It is notable for Priestley's large, colourful graphics which, on the Spectrum, avoid attribute clash problems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of a flunky in the service of the British Royal Family. The flunky is given orders by various members of the family which he must carry out. When he is successful in completing a task, he can obtain an autograph from the satisfied individual. Once he has successfully completed tasks for several persons he can go on to perform the final task for The Queen herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls the flunky as he moves around Buckingham Palace, carrying out orders that members of the Royal Family will give him. The flunky can only be given one task to do at a time. The solutions needed to complete the tasks range from the correct use of items in the correct places to tasks requiring skillful playing more reminiscent of action games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flunky_%28video_game%29 Flunky (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
