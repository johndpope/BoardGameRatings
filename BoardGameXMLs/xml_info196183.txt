The wedding at a Catholic Church was extremely formal but everyone is shaking that off at the reception on the first floor of the hotel. Unfortunately for Veronica, Blake is a wanted man due to a criminal past as an assassin that he has long left behind looking for a second chance. But his old enemies haven&amp;rsquo;t forgotten or forgiven him. After finally tracking his new identity down, his former employers have sent assassins to kill him. The assassins have taken up positions on the second floor balcony and wait for a chance to snipe Blake during the party without being seen. If seen they have to kill everyone at the hotel as their assassins code demands no witnesses or their own death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group can get involved as friends or family members invited to the wedding and reception , wedding crashers who are crashing the party, etc. who are suddenly thrust into  an extremely dangerous situation unprepared. They could also arrive at the scene afterward as police officers, detectives, or medical examiners that are here to investigate the case after the homicide occurred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
