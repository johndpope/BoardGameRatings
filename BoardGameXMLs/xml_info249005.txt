			<description>A simple set of generic SF miniatures combat rules freely available from CP Models. Should easily handle modern-day combat too, actually. An optional background set on the planet Kometenmelodie is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for 6mm figures, but should be easily adapted for other scales if measurements are scaled up appropriately. For example, could be used for 15mm figures if all measurements in cm are taken as inches instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate activating squads or vehicles, using dice to see if their troops successfully execute orders and to resolve combat. Troops are very simply defined by their quality (determining how responsive they are to orders and their accuracy), their armour rating (determining how likely they are to survive being hit), and what weapons they're carrying (determining range and rate of fire). A few extra rules exist to handle special weapons and vehicles: most notably, most antipersonnel weapons can't harm armoured vehicles at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
