							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cargo for Victory</name>
									
			<description>From the rules: Each player tries to have his Cargo Ships safely deliver cargoes to certain ports, using his submarines both to protect his Cargo Ships and to sink enemy Ships and submarines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cargo ships are chosen randomly so their destinations change.  Subs start on the S Marked on the map.  Ships and subs move 1 space in any direction but cargo ships can gain distance by jumping friendly ships/subs and enemy cargo ships.   When a sub jumps an enemy cargo or sub then it is considered sunk and taken for scoring purposes.   Ships that make their destinations are set aside for scoring as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play ends and scores are totaled when the last Cargo Ship makes it home port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
