			<description>This game was published in 2004 and never made it to stores. This game was given as gift to the partners of firm Limonaad and to some random lucky people who got it from Limonaad's mascot.&lt;br/&gt;This is a short Estonian discovery game, where the main character is Limonaad's mascot called Limpa. He starts discovering Estonia and things happen with him on the way. For example: Limpa gives fihes too much soda to drink, so they die or Limpa gets abducted by aliens and wakes up in a random place on the game board. This humors game is for children mostly and you win this game by going through all the red spots on the game board first. It doesn't matter in witch order you go them trough, just be first to do so. Sometimes you may need to work together with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
