			<description>Every Party (エブリパーティ?) is a party video game developed by Game Republic and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was a Japanese launch title for the Xbox 360.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays as a board game in which up to four players compete to be the first to reach a goal. Each board features multiple routes, with some being shorter and riskier, while others are longer but potentially more lucrative in terms of prizes. There are a number (30+) of different mini games which can be triggered during play, similar to the Mario Party series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before play begins, players select a character and customize the character with a variety of items and accessories unlocked during previous sessions. When playing online via Xbox Live, this helps provide a unique appearance as compared to other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Every Party&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
