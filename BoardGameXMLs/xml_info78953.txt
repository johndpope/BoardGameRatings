			<description>The evil &amp;quot;Black Bug Empire&amp;quot; are marching lines of good Bugs underground to be enslaved forever. You must launch vividly coloured bugs at the never-ending line of prisoners, when three or more ofthe same coloured bugs are matched they are saved. The simplicity of the gameplay, simply aim and fire, makes it easy for anyone to pick up and play but difficult to put down. Further depth comesin the form of power-ups, two different gameplay modes and the game's unfolding plot. So get on down to the garden and join the bug resistance in this beautifully realised puzzle game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
