			<description>Players take turns launching a metal ball with a sprint loaded rod up a ramp and into one of the holes beyond.  Each hole is labeled with point values ranging from 10 to 50.  After 10 shots by each player, the highest score win.  A perfect game is 500 points.  Players can play on teams or cooperatively to try to beat the high score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skill of the game is primarily in how far back you pull the launcher, and thus how much force is applied.  A little looseness in the launching mechanism also permits a small amount of additional control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
