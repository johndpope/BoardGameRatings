			<description>This a noncollectible card game designed and printed by a joined effort of friends from all around Poland. We used to meet for a week or so under the ruins of a castle Ogrodzieniec, Poland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the characters and pictures of actual persons from this group and requires several k10 dice and any suitable counters to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal for each player is to gain 20 victory points (originally called 'morale') over 4 location cards, which represent various actual locations around the castle and our tent camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the unique features of the game is that if player plays a card representing him/herself he/she gains special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full deck consists of around 60 cards and can also be used to play standard card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
