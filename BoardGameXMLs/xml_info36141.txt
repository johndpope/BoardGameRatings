							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Celtic Saga</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Players take the role of Celtic Warrior Heroes in ancient Ireland. Players compete to make their Hero the most famous of all. The winner will be sung about by bards for generations and his exploits will be written of in the Book of Kells.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in two versions, Ulster and Fionn. A separate deck of custom cards is used for each version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players accumulate cards to score points in four categories: Blessings, Fortune, Victory, and Prophecy. The player who has accumulated the most points in the most categories after seven turns wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
