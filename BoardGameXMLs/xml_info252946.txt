			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s trouble in the bone-strewn streets of New Heaven and the creaking shanties of Perch: addiction to a new drug known as dreck is hitting epidemic levels. Drow are being snatched from the streets and not returning. A serial killer who calls himself The Swan is vivisecting his prey and writing cryptic letters to the Torch, taunting the guard to catch him before he claims another victim. And last week, rumour has it, a demonic incursion tore apart a tower of silence and drove everyone nearby mad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the Ministry &amp;ndash; sworn to protect the dark elves of Spire and take advantage of every possible opportunity they can find. The players&amp;rsquo; cell is led into a conspiracy that goes far, far above their heads, and that could change the face of Spire forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign frame for Spire takes the ideas we developed in Blood and Dust and develops them further &amp;ndash; Eidolon Sky is a series of prompts, suggestions, factions and personalities that players and GMs are free to explore as they wish, culminating in an occult showdown that will determine the future of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
