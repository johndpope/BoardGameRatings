			<description>Publishers Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Post-Apocalypse20 is the ultimate resource for taking your modern game to the end of the world and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new, full-length resource for Modern20 adds new Backgrounds, Occupations, Feats and Character Disadvantages. It also contains rules for Mutations, equipment condition and radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An extensive equipment section adds new weapons and armor to the game. Some of these are common household items adapted for use after the apocalypse while others are the futuristic weaponry of an advanced civilization that succumbed to their own technology and collapsed into barbarism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, Post-Apocalypse20 contains advice for the game master as well as several brief campaign models. Each of these campaign models contains pre-generated NPC opponents or monsters with rules for creating your own mutant horrors to populate the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, whatever your vision of the end of the world, PA20 has something to make your grim vision easier to realize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
