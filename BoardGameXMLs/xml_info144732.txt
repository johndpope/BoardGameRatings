							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Extraterrestrial Grail</name>
									
			<description>The universe is teetering out of control and the aliens that inhabit it are getting restless. Rumors about total annihilation have spread through every corner of each galaxy. The rumor is that if one particular object can be obtained, then that alien's race and home planet will be saved. Otherwise, their race will be exterminated and their home planet will be destroyed. One alien whispers to another, &amp;quot;What are we looking for?&amp;quot; The other alien snaps back, &amp;quot;The Grail, of course.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extraterrestrial Grail is a turn-based strategy board game for 2-4 players. Extraterrestrial Grail takes place in outer space in which you are an alien searching for the Grail. Only one player gets the Grail at the beginning of the game, so the other aliens must find out where it is by fighting each other and exploring planets for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives attribute cards at the beginning of the game. A player can only hold a maximum of 6 attribute cards in their hand at a time. All of the attribute cards that the player has chosen to not place in their hand must go into their planet boxes. Some attribute cards are weapons which remove life points from an enemy alien (bomb, missile, laser rifle, and etc.). Other attribute cards are designed to steal cards from other aliens (mug gloves, rope, and etc.). There are also attribute cards that let you safely search and give you the ability to search foreign planets (respiration headgear, flashlight, thermal garment, and etc.). There are many more kinds of attribute cards as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn Options:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Roll die and move your alien (only once per turn)&lt;br/&gt;     Search a planet for attribute cards (if your alien token is on a planet)&lt;br/&gt;     Start a battle with an enemy alien located on the same space as your alien&lt;br/&gt;     Use attribute card(s) in your hand&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Turn Options (choose one per battle turn):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Use natural attack&lt;br/&gt;     Flee from battle&lt;br/&gt;     Use an attribute card in your hand&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have the Grail in your hand when the alarm goes off or have the Grail in your hand when all the other aliens have been eliminated. If no one has the Grail in their hand when the timer alarm goes off, then everyone loses. For example: If there is time still left on the timer and only one alien is still alive, then that alien must find the Grail before time is up to win the game (the game will end when the last player standing finds the Grail).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
