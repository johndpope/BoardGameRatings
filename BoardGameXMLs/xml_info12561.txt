			<description>preference: &amp;quot;a greater liking for one alternative over another&amp;quot; New Oxford Dictionary of English.&lt;br/&gt;We make choices every day - the things we like, the things we don't - and our behavior is powerfully influenced by our preferences. Even simple things can reveal a lot about a person, things that perhaps weren't known before or had always been taken for granted. Our preferences give insight into individual tastes, values and beliefs as well as reflecting aspects of personality.&lt;br/&gt;Using luck and judgment, the race is on to travel the length of the game board by predicting other players' choices.&lt;br/&gt;Mercedes or Porsche? Christine Aguilera or Britney Spears? New York or Los Angeles? Eat-in or Take-out? The choices we make can be relatively straightforward; but sometimes they may be a little more tricky. Would other people be able to predict your preference? preference will reveal how well people really know you and maybe even how well you know yourself.........&lt;br/&gt;Contents:300 preference cards,24 Explain Yourself! cards,8 magnapads,8 counters, game board, rules of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.playpreference.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.playpreference.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
