							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mutant Bikers of the Atomic Wasteland (Fudge)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to MBAW, the post-apocalypse game of big guns, big bikes and diminutive IQs. In MBAW you play the role of a Wastelands bikers (mutant optional). Wasteland bikers are free spirited individuals who live a nomadic existence roaming across the Atomic Wastelands. They travel on their powerful motorcycles, sometimes alone, sometimes in small groups. Bikers ride from the ruins of one town to the next, searching for fuel and spare parts so that they can ride on to the next town and search for fuel and spare parts. Bikers value their freedom (to ride from town to town...) and their bikes above all else. They hate the gangers, who threaten their freedom and pity the 'peds' ( pedestrians - poor sods without wheels). A Wasteland biker lives in terror of losing his bike and becoming a ped himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
