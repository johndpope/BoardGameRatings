							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sentinels of the Multiverse: Cosmic Omnitron Villain Promo Card</name>
									
			<description>After Omnitron's defeat at the hands of the Freedom Five, its various pieces were collected in the Eaken-Rubendall lab for study by Dr. Meredith Stinson.  She was not the only one interested in studying the automaton which brought about its own sentience, however.  A mysterious cosmic entity had observed as a simple factory transformed itself into a being of great intellect and order, and this entity was disappointed to see it brought to so swift an end.  &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Stinson's lab was rocked by cosmic rays as the entity sought to give self-made self-awareness a second chance.  The cosmic force gathered the many technological advancements of the lab together, making them available to the processing core that was once Omnitron, and bound them all together with wires and connections of pure energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMNITRON was reborn.  Planet Earth was in grave danger.  And a cosmic force watched from a vast distance away, almost disinterested in the outcome of its own experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Omnitron is a promo card that was given as part of the Kickstarter project for Sentinels of the Multiverse 2nd Edition &amp;amp; Infernal Relics expansion. The oversized version is available as part of the Sentinels of the Multiverse: Villain Oversized Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
