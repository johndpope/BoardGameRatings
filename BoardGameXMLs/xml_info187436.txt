			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SeeD is a difficult rules set to summarize because of its modular design; character generation, for example, can follow one of six major methodologies:  Class, Crystal, License, Job, Eidolon, or Limit Break.  The method selected will depend upon the video game that is begin emulated as the basis of the table-top role-playing game.  The Skill system is similarly modular, presenting three major systems:  Talent, Reel, and Fortune.  Inventory and outfitting will follow either: Equipment, Remodeling, or Bare.  Finally, any of these various modules may be combined with any other combination to form a final basis of &amp;quot;pick and use&amp;quot; components that are selected primarily because they are the closest match to the emulated video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, action resolution is percentile based and features a target number called the &amp;quot;Chance of Success&amp;quot;.  Players then roll percentiles and attempt to &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; the target.  Depending upon which system(s) are being utilized, there are few to many modifiers that may apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principle design goals of the system-of-systems are to 1) allow for the close emulation of nearly any video game roleplaying experience, and 2) present a fast-paced &amp;quot;video game&amp;quot; like playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
