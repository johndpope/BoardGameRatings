			<description>Settlers arrived in a valley in the desert Colorado, San Luis Valley. They have to fight for everything, but eventually farms, rich grass pastures and pasturing cattles fill the unusual wasteland with life. &lt;br/&gt;Become the most skilled farmer! Get the most pastures for your cattle! With smart tactics, avoiding storms, using your golds well, with the Indians in peace, you will surely be the king of the prairie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective of the game:&lt;br/&gt;With the help of farms occupy areas and all five cows should be placed on occupied pastures. The first player places his fifth cow on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players must use pasture-shaped triangular cards for the game so that they can build farms in their corners. If one player is in the majority on a pasture - his own farm is in the two corners of the front leg - that player can place one of its cows on this pasture so can take it. The figure remains in the game until the end of the game, regardless of whether the player may have it the majority of the area around the area disappears on the way. Only one cow can be placed on a pasture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts. From the 4 cards in his hand he can play as much as cards he can or want. There is only one limit: You can only play one card type in one turn (for example, there is a player holding two farm cards, only one of them can be placed in one turn). Exception is possible with golds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
