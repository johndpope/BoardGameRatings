			<description>Nya ordjakt is a word-finding game. It is obviously a newer edition of Ordjakt. The mechanics are the same, but the subjects are different and the card designs differ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a letter is selected by pulling one of the cards at random and looking at the reverse side. Then you select a suite and find enough cards from that suite (all alike) so that each player gets one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each card there are 10 categories. The players' task is to find one word that starts with the selected letter for each category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publishing year of 1950 is a guess, mostly from the general appearance of the game and the fact that is has categories like &amp;quot;Star in the 1948 Olympics&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
