							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Find Your Partner</name>
									
			<description>A party game designed to persuade your guests to mingle during the evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each guest either gets a blue or red badge for their lapel. The blue badgesfeature a number. The red badges have a clue to a number. The idea is to find the clue you think that might be the answer to your number, or find the number that you think might be the answer to your clue. The first pair to 'match-up' are the winners (and, I suspect, will get a small gift from the host).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The matching pair are now partners for the evening and must partner each other for things like Novelty dances (such as the Gay Gordons).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
