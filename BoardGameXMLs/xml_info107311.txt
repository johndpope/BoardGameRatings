			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This baseball game transports major league players into the neighborhoods of US cities. The game's presentation is very playful with all of the player's sporting &amp;quot;big heads&amp;quot;. Gamers can only control the batter or the pitcher. You time the swing with a meter. You pitch by choosing one of the 4 pitches that are tied to the controller's face buttons. The gamer cannot control the AI fielders. Each of the neighborhoods has its own set of rules that determines how points are scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 120 MLB players that can be unlocked by spending points in the in-game store to buy packs of baseball cards. These packs unlock new players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
