			<description>Molecularama is a pattern-matching, set-collecting chemistry-themed card game similar to Gin Rummy and Ticket to Ride. Collect and swap element cards to build up molecules and score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 24 different molecules and 75 element cards. Each player is trying to collect the correct elements to build them. Build six molecules to win the game but beware of attempting to build too many molecules, any unfinished molecules by the end of the game will penalise your score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two modes of play to choose from; play with a secret selection of molecules in your hand where everyone is trying to guess what you're building, or play with a selection of molecule cards open on the table where two people could be racing to build the same thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each molecule card comes with a witty joke or and interesting tid-bit. Remember, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the precipitate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
