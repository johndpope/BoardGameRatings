			<description>A very simple baseball simulation game, with only the 1976 or 1977 current teams rated based on previous season performances.. A calculator was used and players came on roster sheets, instead of individual cards. There are no dice, markers, spinners, expensive play situation boards to get lost, everything came in compact packaging: instructions, scoresheets, rosters. &amp;amp; play results sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
