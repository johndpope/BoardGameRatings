							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feats of an Adult Nature</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning! Adult Mature Content Ahead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title pretty much describes all you need to know about the OGL d20 supplement Modern Basics: Feats of an Adult Nature. It's a must-have game product if you want to add some texture to characters' love and sex life. The 14 feats contained in it are the perfect addition for a game with &amp;quot;mature themes.&amp;quot; They are an absolute neceseity in this day and age where sex and sexual content is everywhere. More than ever before, sexuality is an element thqat must be present in games and stories if you want to taken seriously intellectually and be seen as socially relevant. You want to be taken seriously intellectually, don't you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although &amp;quot;adult content&amp;quot; has been present in many NUELOW Games products from our eariest days, Modern Basics: Feats of an Adult Nature is the first time we've dished up a concentrated dose of it. It's our bid to establish ourselves as Couragous and Serious Artists, with feats like Adventuresome, Gay, Gaydar, and Staying Power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
