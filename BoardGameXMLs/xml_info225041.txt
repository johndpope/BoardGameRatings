							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Save the Penguin</name>
									
			<description>Percy the Penguin is stuck in an igloo and can't get out.  By removing the ice blocks, one by one, you must find the one which will Save the Penguin.&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts by inserting the trowel into the slot in any block f ice.  Make sure that the trowel is pushed in as far as it will go.  Carefully remove the trowel.  In doing so an ice block will also be removed.  If Percy does not jump out, that player's turn is over.  Play passes to the player on the left who repeats the action of inserting their trowel and removing an ice block.  The winner of the round is the player who removes the ice block which sets Percy free and so has Saved the Penguin.&lt;br/&gt;Play an agreed number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;Note: There will be only 1 ice block which will Save the Penguin in each round.  To start the next round, replace all the ice blocks and make sure you rotate the Penguin.  Remember, a different ice block will release the Penguin each time you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
