			<description>In the card game ワイルドゴールド (Wild Gold), players create tools from cards and use them to dig a gold mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start, each player has a &amp;quot;small axe&amp;quot; made of one stone card and one wood card. In the play area are item cards &amp;mdash; wood, stone, iron, and fire &amp;mdash; and treasure cards. As players collect item cards in their hand, they can assemble various tools, such as a &amp;quot;big axe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;small pickaxe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;spear&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;wood bomb&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tool is assembled by placing the item cards in the shape of the tool. With the &amp;quot;small axe&amp;quot;, a player can draw one card from the play area. With the &amp;quot;big axe&amp;quot;, a player can draw two cards. With the &amp;quot;small pickaxe&amp;quot;, players choose and take one card from the discard pile. With the &amp;quot;spear&amp;quot;, a player can draw one card from another player's hand and snatch it if it's a treasure card. With the powerful &amp;quot;wood bomb&amp;quot;, players choose to draw four cards from the play area or draw one card from each player's hand and snatch the cards if they're treasure cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player can have only up to seven items in total of the cards in their hand and their tools. Because of this, the player may have to discard some tools or treasure cards in their hand. The game ends when a player gains 10 points through treasure cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
