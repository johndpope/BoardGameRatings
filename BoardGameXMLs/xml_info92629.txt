			<description>Escape from an alien spaceship by overcoming obstacles and helping the visitors to learn more about the planet Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement on the map can only be done between adjacent spaces. Every space you land on has a play card that reveals quests, grant items, or pose challenges, such as finding a key, competing with another player, drawing a picture, acting out a pantomime or really anything. The outcome of any performance or challenge is decided by one of the othere players or by voting with special cards. Try to pass it as many times as you wish or just find your way around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be first to the finish square after opening a certain number of play cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very engaging and requires some logic and strategic skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
