			<description>A witchcraft-themed memory game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 25 cards are printed on both side. One side shows one of five magic objects (elixir, charm, magic hat, spell book, owl) on a white background. The other side shows one of five hiding places (bed, grandfather clock, chest, tripod, fire place) on a coloured background. There is one card for each magic object/background combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are laid out on the table, with the coloured hiding place side facing up. The start player rolls the two dice. One die shows what object the players are trying to find. The other specifies what hiding places they players may search to find that object (i.e. if one die shows the owl and the other the bed, the players are allowed to turn over the bed cards to find the owl). If the active player manages to turn over the correct card, he/she gets to take the card and rolls the dice again. His/her turn ends when he/she turns over a wrong card.&lt;br/&gt;The sixth side of the dice is a joker - the lucky player gets to choose the magic object, hiding place, or both (if he/she rolls the joker on both dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player rolls a combination that has already been found and he/she remembers, he/she gets to steal it from that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all five cards of one type of hiding place have been claimed. The player with the highest number of cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
