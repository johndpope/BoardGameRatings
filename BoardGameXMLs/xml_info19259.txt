			<description>Kumare - The Game from South America&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You are at Amazonas and the Shaman Serpent Head has stolen the spirit of your tribe. By [consulting] the Shaman Jaguar Eye you have obtained the amulets [your 6 playing pieces] which will help you to recover the spirit. Now you must reach the Kumare [the central 4 squares of the board], place one of your amulets there and [place] another three amulets on one of the lines of the sun. You will have to confront other players who, like you, are endeavoring to rescue the spirit of their tribe. However, only one will be successful.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 24 Amulet Chips (6 of a distinct design for each of up to 4 players), Gameboard, 1 D6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard is an 8x8 grid, with the central 4 squares making up the Kumare. It is separated into 4 levels. Amulets (pieces) start off the board and enter at the arrows. You must move your amulets onto the board and move by the roll of the die within a level. You may only move up a level if you move one of your amulets between two other amulets belonging to any player(s). You may also send another player's amulet off the board (thereby needing to re-enter the first level) by surrounding it with 2 of your amulets or 1 of your amulets and one of another player's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win by forming 4-in-a-row with your amulets following the 'lines of the sun' (vertical, horizontal or diagonal lines which include the Kumare (the 4x4 central Sun space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made in Mexico - Rules in Spanish and English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
