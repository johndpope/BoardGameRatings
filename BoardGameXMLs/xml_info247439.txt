			<description>A trick-taking card game of cave drawings before the hunt!&lt;br/&gt;Before the great hunt, shamans of the tribe gather in the cool dark of the sacred caves. There, in ochre and ashes, they draw images of their ancestral spirits on the walls in the hopes of great bounty. Who will find the greatest prizes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aurochs is a trick taking, point scoring card game for 3 or 4 players. Each round, each player in turn plays a card from their hand. The person who played the highest ranking card takes all the cards played that round and sets them aside for later scoring. Rounds continue until all cards are played, then they are scored. The first player to end a round with over 200 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
