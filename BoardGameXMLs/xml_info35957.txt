			<description>&amp;ldquo;Two player card game simulating modern Jet Fighter Air Combat. Objective: Kill all of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s planes. Setup: In the standard game each side has 2 planes: A flight leader and his wingman. For a quick game play one-on-one. A dogfight involving many planes is referred to as a Furball. Use coins or dice to keep track of planes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a deck of seven different types of cards: Pilot, Initiative, Tactics (Team), Maneuver, Attack, Defense, and Kill. The players attempt to play a superior number of Maneuver and Attack cards, and ultimately score a kill with a Kill card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
