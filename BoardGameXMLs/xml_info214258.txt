							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Military Decisions</name>
									
			<description>Military Decisions is a strategy game in the vein of wargames, but units have no stats. Each player dispatches 100 military units on their side of the board. There are land, naval and air forces. Players have a choice of either moving units or drawing a card that will dictate what the player must do. The card may benefit or penalize them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are placed on the map's intersections, so every unit usually has six directions in which it can move in. You can capture (i.e. remove from the board) enemy units by encircling them. Any enemy unit(s) isolated by your own units or immobilized (no exit paths available) is automatically removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The edge of the board, the shoreline for naval units and the waterfront for land units all count toward the capturing rule if they can't escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either player occupies the opponent's Capital on the board or when the Supreme Command unit is encircled by enemy units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
