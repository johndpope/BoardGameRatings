							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pairs / Space Rendezvous / Logic</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Collection of three game games: Pairs which is a game of Memory which can be played by one or two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next up is Space Rendezvous, a Lunar Lander variant for two players: Land your lunar module on the surface and return to the mother ship fastest (and safest) as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And third game on cartridge is Logic: A random number is generated by the computer, and some clues are given: Try to guess the number in as few tries as possible. Kinda like a number version of Mastermind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games are without text, but the manual is as usual with Videopac games made in many languages (English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Finish, and Spanish)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A release by Siera for the Siera Videopac G7000 (one of many branded clones) were also made, but lacking of information about the company Siera made it not able to be added as a release&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
