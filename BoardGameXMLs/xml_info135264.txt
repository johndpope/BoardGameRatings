							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">We Wow Wang</name>
									
			<description>We Wow Wang is played with a deck of 54 cards, each with a letter.  24 cards have a W, and 6 cards each have an A, E, G, N, or O.  The words We, Wow, and Wang can be formed 6 times from this deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 5 cards with the remaining deck placed faced down on the table.  Players begin drawing cards, saying &amp;quot;Wow&amp;quot; before the next player may draw.  If the player likes his chances of completing enough of the words We, Wow, and Wang to beat his opponents' hands, he says &amp;quot;Wang&amp;quot; and all players show their hands.  Scores are tallied according to each players' hand, with an advantage being given to those who have all three words We, Wow, and Wang.  In a 2 to 4 player game, a player with 500 points wins.  For 5 or 6 players, the total needed to win is 1000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
