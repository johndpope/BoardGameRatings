							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Thaumatology: Chinese Elemental Powers</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wield the Might of the Five Elements!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chinese view of the elements (xing) is rich and nuanced, with cycles of creation and destruction: earth refines into metal, smothers fire, is covered by wood, and absorbs water. These interactions are as flavorful as they are balanced -- perfect for a magic system! GURPS Thaumatology: Chinese Elemental Powers blends the concepts of qi (chi) and magic, empowering elementalists with gifts that truly capture the feel of xing mastery. With it, you'll be able to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Master more than 60 fully worked abilities -- and 20 new perks! -- spread across the five elements, from the literal (summoning water as fog) to the metaphorical (using water chi to target the heart's fire).&lt;br/&gt;     Combine Talent, Meditation skill, and the new Focus technique to push your elemental abilities beyond their limits and use them in powerful ways.&lt;br/&gt;     Supplement cinematic martial-arts skills with peaceful but equally fantastic feats of Alchemy, Erotic Art, Esoteric Medicine, Fortune-Telling, and Herb Lore.&lt;br/&gt;     Use the expanded advantages, disadvantages, and skills to build the magician you want -- or just adapt the sample elementalist, Wang Laowu.&lt;br/&gt;     Learn how the concepts of xing, qi, and yin and yang permeate Chinese culture, and then use that understanding to work this magic into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're playing mystical wu and brave xia in ancient China, modern martial artists locked in a secret street war, or classic fantasy dungeon delvers questing after a unique power-up, GURPS Thaumatology: Chinese Elemental Powers puts the power of the elements in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
