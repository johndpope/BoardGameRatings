							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bionicle Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>This is an abstract, skirmish-level combat with Bionicle theme. Each figure (unit) represents a single Bionicle. One player controls the good Toa Nuva. The other player controls the evil Rahkshi. You win if you destroy all opposing Bionicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bionicle Skirmish is played on an 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combatants. Both teams consist of seven unique Bionicles, and each Bionicle has a special power. However, the Rahkshi player only starts with six units on the board. The seventh evil unit, the powerful Makuta, does not appear unless the other six Rahkshi units are all eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, defend, or use special powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
