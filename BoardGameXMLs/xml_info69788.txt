							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Son the Doctor</name>
									
			<description>Want to make Mama proud? Become My Son the Doctor.  Let Mama impress her friends.  Become My Daughter the Movie Star.  Maybe you'd rather have money and influence.  Become My Son the Tycoon.  How about...would you like to rule the world?  Become My Son the Politician.  All it takes is a little luck...a little concentration and knowing when to keep your mouth shut!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From front page of the rules.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on traditional Jewish humor, this game encourages players to aspire to their Mama's dreams of becoming somebody.  Players begin at home with Mama and through the course of the game, pick up Odd Jobs and Tools of the Trade.  Once the player gets to their target profession after acquiring 4 Good Tools for that Trade, they win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement on the board is via dice, one specifically for each dimension, with the player choosing the direction.  Landing on a free Odd Job gains the player both a random Odd Job card and a random Tool from a profession of their choice.  If a player lands on someone else's Odd Job and they get to steal a Tool.  Being lazy will cause a player to lose a turn, and sometimes it's best just to Go Home to Mama.  However, if a player can catch a Lucky Break, then end up on a square of their choice, which is the best way to land a profession!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics are simple, but remembering who has what can be more difficult as cards are constantly being exchanged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
