							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Griddly Headz Football Game</name>
									
			<description>One of seven in the line of Griddly Headz Boardgames, Football sees a different cast of &amp;ldquo;Griddly Headz&amp;rdquo; (regular Joes) duking it out on the gridiron for ultimate supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played on a large, two-tiered board, Griddly Headz features the chance to choose both your team and how your individual players match up against your opponent&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of numerous dice challenges that take place when two players meet on the same play square of the board; the loser forfeits a piece of gear (represented by puzzle pieces).  If a player loses all twelve pieces of gear, or one of their Griddly Headz is ejected from play, they are immediately eliminated from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, you must score 10 touchdowns (either touchdowns or kick returns) &amp;ndash; one point for each touchdown or kick return dice challenge won by your &amp;ldquo;regular player&amp;rdquo;, and two points for each  challenge won by your &amp;ldquo;quarterback&amp;rdquo;.  Points can also be gained through special cards acquired during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available in Deluxe, Family, and Mini editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
