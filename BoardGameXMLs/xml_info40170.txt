			<description>DOGFIGHT @ ALAM HALFA&lt;br/&gt;Rommel's Strike for Cairo, Sept. 1942&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rommel's last offensive in the desert was a compelling one. He knew his past successes were waning for a variety of reasons and that unless&lt;br/&gt;something changed, he would be at the end of his logistical tether. By August, 1942, he was fast approaching a turning point and he feared&lt;br/&gt;his luck might run out. Thus, once he secured promises of adequate fuel supplies that would be delivered by the Italian Navy and Luftwaffe,&lt;br/&gt;this Fox planned for a knock-out blow that some call Gazala II in strategy. A wide sweeping ride though sands of the desert during the&lt;br/&gt;night, a ride some 40 miles in the moonlight to rear of the British forces at Alam Halfa. Rommel chose the night to hide his movements, his&lt;br/&gt;intelligence indicated the mines were nil and no British forces were so far south. The Italian armor divisions, the Littorio and Ariete,&lt;br/&gt;with over 150 M13 tanks (its 47mm gun could knock out most of the British tanks) would help seal the flanks of the 15th and 21st Panzer&lt;br/&gt;Divisions (with over 100 tanks) along with the 90th Division. Rommel was banking on the British performance at Gazala, which showed when&lt;br/&gt;cut off, the British acted in a confused state. Once the pocket was dealt with, each panzer would strike for the Nile, Cairo and&lt;br/&gt;Alexandria. Besides, Hitler insisted Rommel attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex is one mile.&lt;br/&gt;AFV units equal 8 AFV&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is 4 hrs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
