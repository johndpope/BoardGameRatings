			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Bite Me Cutie' is a card game combining pop-culture, Japanese anime, adorable animals, and food! 'Bite Me Cutie' contains chibi animals that meet delicious foods only to be fused together to make a collectible &amp;ldquo;Cutie.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s a fast-paced game focused on collecting cuties and trapping other players' cuties. Feed them, collect them, and buff them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 3 separate decks: the cutie deck, the flavor deck, and the effect deck. The Cutie deck contains kawaii-style cutie cards you collect. The flavor deck contains food bites to feed and collect the cuties you want. The effect deck has trap and buff cards to save your cuties from harm, or keep other players from collecting cuties they want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have the most valuable collection of cuties when the last cutie is collected. The player with the highest tallied cutie class points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
