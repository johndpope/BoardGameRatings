							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neiyar: The Ruins of Dazu</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six Centuries ago, the great Krakodonian capital of Dazu was destroyed, and with it the heart and soul of the Krakodonian empire. Since then, the race has fallen apart, with warring clans struggling for dominion over each other. The once great empire has been carved into fiercely defended territories. But factions are forming that seek to rebuild the empire anew, and new battle lines are drawn to see who will earn the right to reclaim the lost city, and with it command of the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neiyar: The Ruins of Dazu, takes you into the heart of the former capital. The Shaman, astrologers, and Wise Ones have been receiving visions of a strange orb somewhere in the ruins, and they believe it may be the key to forever vanquishing the mighty dragon that prowls the ruins and thus reclaiming the city. But is the orb truly the key to  victory, or is something else in play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the once great capital. Fight against the monsters that lurk within the shattered walls. Outwit other clans that are also seeking the orb. And above all else, avoid the great dragon that prowls the area, for he will not take kindly to those who seek to remove a treasure from his domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
