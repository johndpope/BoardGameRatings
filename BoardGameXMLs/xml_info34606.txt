			<description>From Old Silk Road:  A voyager in the game finds himself on the trade routes which existed at the height of the Tang Dynasty in China (c. 750 AD). He sets out from Chang An, the cosmopolitan Chinese capital. Traveling across northern China and then to Central Asia, with a lucky roll of the die he will arrive at Samarkand, an important trading center. There, glass, fruit and horses may be purchased. At Merv, the traveler must decide whether to follow the overland or sea route. Going by sea, one has the opportunity to buy incense at the port of Hormoz, collect rubies, sapphires and pearls in the kingdom of Anuradhapura (now in Sri Lanka), visit the wondrous temples at Elephanta and Kancipuram and buy spices in Srivijaya (Sumatra). But beware! There are mighty perils on this route. On the overland route, the traveler visits magnificent Buddhist temples in India and beyond, encounter tigers in the jungles of Bengal and purchase luxuries such as kingfisher feathers and rhino horn at Angkor. The final leg of the journey passes through the the bustling port of Guangzhou (Canton) and then off to Japan and Korea where the traveler will be able to visit foreign temples and complete final trading before returning home by way of the Grand Canal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each location includes a special paragraph of text describing what happens to the traveler there. Often they include special trading opportunities. Major trading centers have specific products which they sell and also another list which they want to purchase. Commodity holdings are shown by cards which list the differing values of these items at various locations. Includes short history and glossary of terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
