			<description>From the Kickstarter entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World's 1st Multiplayer Sudoku Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;D&amp;uuml;-KO is like Sudoku, but only funner! Many efforts have been made to turn Sudoku into a board game, but the integrity of the puzzle always ended up being compromised. It was always a pain to setup and the truth be told not a real fun board game - with no real advantage for you the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here comes Du-KO taking the concept of Sudoku to a whole new level, allowing for multi-players but still respecting the integrity of the solitaire player too. From 1- 9 players of all ages from 8 to 88 can easily and happily play Du-KO for a guaranteed good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to finish your section of the Sudoku grid first before your opponent(s). Each player takes their turn placing a peg in an open space within their designated portion of the puzzle. You'll go from clueless to competent your first game, and by your second game you'll have advanced from competent to competitive. Here's where it gets cut-throat and smokin' hot! You've been warned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The amazing part about Du-KO is that it is self-checking! When you play, the game will tell you instantly that whether you&amp;rsquo;re wrong or right. If the peg is correct it will set all the way down, if incorrect it will remain slightly elevated and then must be removed and replayed on your next turn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
