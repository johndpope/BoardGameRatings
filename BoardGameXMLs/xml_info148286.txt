							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">imagine I Can... Cheese Chase</name>
									
			<description>The small games in the imagine I Can... collection of mini-games-in-a-tin are geared at children 3 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheese Chase plays 2. The game contains two red and two blue wooden mice, two wooden cheese pieces and 1 die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once players choose their colour mice, each player will place his/her mice in a row, one after the other, at the starting line. The cheese pieces are placed 12 inches (or more for a longer game) from the mice across the table. Players take turns rolling the die and move their mice forward according to the number they rolled; the mouse in the back moves immediately in front of the mouse in the front, the number of times indicated on the dice. Game is over when a player's mouse reaches a piece of cheese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
