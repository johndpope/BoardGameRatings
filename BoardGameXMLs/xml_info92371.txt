							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: The Fall of Terra</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the Battle of Tukayyid, ComStar has been torn asunder. The misguided Blakists still adhere to the old ways that shrouded technology in a veil of mysticism for hundreds of years. While the Inner Sphere was caught up in the Jade Falcon attack on Coventry, the Word of Blake struck Terra  quickly and without mercy, using deep-cover agents to cripple us from within. From this terrible blow, ComStar&amp;mdash;and Terra&amp;mdash;may never recover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From the diary of Sharilar Mori, Primus of ComStar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lies of Focht's ComStar have gone unanswered long enough. The time has come to drive the heretics from the cradle of humanity. Then the purifying light of Blake's True Vision will shine again on Terra, the gleaming gem set at the heart of the Inner Sphere. Then all will know that the true ComStar, the Word of Blake, has returned to guide them through the darkness of ignorance.&lt;br/&gt;- From an address to the Word of Blake Militia by Precentor Demona Aziz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fall of Terra is a BattleTech scenario pack that describes the struggle for control of the Earth between the warring factions of ComStar. Sixteen scenarios and special weather rules recreate the major battles of this campaign. Also included is a sourcebook section describing the history and features of 31st-century Terra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario pack is the second one to feature the Com Guard, this time fighting their opposite number.  The scenarios in the pack cover a range of geographical areas drawn from around the world, and there are various weather rules covering areas such as fighting in deep snow to make life more interesting for those playing.  The scenario pack finishes with a reasonable amount of information for setting follow-up games on Earth after the events covered, and in addition to these genreal game rules also adds profiles for a new (and fairly unexciting) vehicle and two new 'Mechs. The fact that this scenario pack is set on Earth makes it entertaining in it's own right, and it's one of the scenario packs available as an electronic download from the current licence holder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
