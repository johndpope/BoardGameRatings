							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Daughter of Nexus</name>
									
			<description>Daughter of Nexus is the first entry of Exalted on the SAS (Storytelling Adventure System). The story, with 14 scenes and a medium difficulty level, runs around a young lady of God-blooded that it is raising to prominence and power on a city with few apparitions of the Emissary of Nexus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nexus: jewel of the Scavenger Lands. Though precious, it is a jewel is stuck in the earth, covered in dirt and eroded from the worms and the other vermin who live in the mud. Every time someone tries to dig the jewel up and wash off the mud, they usually find out the vermin have teeth. Nexus has too many stakeholders and schemers who don&amp;rsquo;t want  their muck exposed. From Guildsmen  to Anathema, Nexus is a safe bet to find a scheming source of trouble or a hidden Exalted hero. Even the gods of Nexus aren&amp;rsquo;t above the petty personal power plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above all, Nexus is the center of the free. Free will reigns here, ranging from the cutthroat economy  to  the  increasing numbers of open Anathema. As  for Nexus&amp;rsquo; gods, even they are examples of free will, representing freedom from the Celestial Bureaucracy. This freedom is the ultimate expression of Nexus, what makes the jewel shine, and the strongest trait of its city god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
