			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;School&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;oh those long days and the drudgery of class. What unbelievable thing will happen to break the kids out of this funk! Will the kids rally to overthrow the school bully? Or maybe investigate the strange Science teacher Mr. Steinbottom who supposedly keeps kids locked in the school basement?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;School Daze can be played by anyone not just kids! Get some friends together for a quick game or an adventure that takes place over a few gaming sessions. The adventures can be anything imaginable or unimaginable! Unsolved mysteries, evil teachers and even aliens posing as students!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for creating and playing games in School Daze are easy and fun. Pick one person to be the Narrator who creates the story that the players will adventure through while everyone else plays characters that are kids whose dreary school days are interrupted by unbelievable adventures (unbelievable to the adults that is!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you will need to play School Daze are a few pieces of paper, a pencil, and a six-sided dice and you can be ready to go! After the rules section there&amp;rsquo;s a sample game to give you an idea about how the game is played and a free adventure so you can start right away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
