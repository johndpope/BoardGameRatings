			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finances are hard. Tracking your purchases, shopping for deals, and making sure all your bills are paid is difficult enough. It&amp;rsquo;s worse when you can&amp;rsquo;t remember who is holding onto the Chalice of Malachi or if anyone sold that potion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There must be an easier way! After all, this is a game we&amp;rsquo;re talking about. While some games might benefit from keeping track of every last silver piece, most games don&amp;rsquo;t. Most games barely even care if the party has 5 healing potions or 50. Enter the Wealth system: a simplified way to track how rich you are without having to keep track of three pages of treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wealth System, like all Straight Path products, is short and sweet - only five pages of pure content when printed, plus a one page quick reference sheet. However, if you're reading it on your computer, as you likely are, the desktop version is optimized for desktop viewing in gorgeous two-column landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
