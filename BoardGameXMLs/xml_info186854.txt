							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fate of the World</name>
									
			<description>Humans are gone and Earth is up for grabs. In Fate of the World you lead an alien army battling for control of the planet. Deploy your minions to build and populate cities as you expand your empire across the globe, or unleash a monster on one of your opponent's cities to stop them creating a sprawling metropolis of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each creature card has two colors. Players collect sets of creatures with the same color to populate cities. Cities are constructed by sacrificing creatures and can be further expanded as the population grows. A limited hand size means the player must constantly balance collecting and sacrificing creatures in order to maintain their empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures can be deployed from your cities to attack an opponent's city. If a city's population is reduced to zero it is razed and construction must begin again. Players earn points for building cities, winning battles and expanding their empire. Fate of the World is a game of strategic depth that is fun for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
