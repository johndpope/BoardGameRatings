			<description>Cover/Jacket Text:&lt;br/&gt;Tired of thumbing through book after book and scribbling notes on notebook pages while designing your Rolemaster character?

Wait no longer!&lt;br/&gt;The Rolemaster Character Records are here.&lt;br/&gt;Each profession's individual character sheets provide:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Specific development point costs and level bonuses for every Rolemaster skill, integrated into individualized character sheets for every Rolemaster character profession, up to and including Rolemaster Companion IV.&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded space for skill areas that are frequently broken down into more specific areas for professions which use them most.&lt;br/&gt;     Plenty of room to detail all of the facets of your favorite character, such as Armor Type, stats, Resistance Roll bonuses, physical and personality traits, equipment, spell lists, background, and modifiers of every type.&lt;br/&gt;     Extra room left for you to add your own original skills, spell lists, stats, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolemaster garners now have an entire fantasy world at their fingertips.
