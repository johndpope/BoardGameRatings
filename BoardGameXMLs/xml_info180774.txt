			<description>I Spy In a Flash Card Game is a matching game where players compete to most quickly match pictures on the cards in their hand with pictures on a group of shared cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards in this game have pictures of a number of different objects. The same objects appear on all cards, but most objects on each card a silhouettes, with only two being actual pictures.  At the start of the game, cards are dealt evenly to all players.  Each player then turns up three cards to serve as his or her hand.  Each player then turns up a fourth card into the center of the table. Players look at these cards and try to match one of the objects (silhouettes don't count) with one of the objects on a card in their hands. The card can then be played on top of the middle card, as quickly as possible. Players may play on any card in the middle, not only their own. Newly played cards cover the old ones, thus constantly giving other players new objects to match.  Once all three cards in a player's hand are played, three more cards are drawn for a new hand. The first player to play all his or her cards onto the center cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
