			<description>A sort of homemade miniatures game.  Each player's units (infantry, cavalry, cannon) and the board terrain (hills, houses, trees) are made in a prescribed way from construction paper and household items including matchboxes, egg cartons, pencils etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 6' square cloth divided into a 9&amp;times;9 grid, with some squares occupied by terrain.  Players alternate turns moving all their units each turn &amp;mdash; cavalry can move 3 squares per turn and other units 1, and infantry cannot enter squares with terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to destroy all the enemy infantry and cavalry using one's cannons.  A cannon can be fired only when there are four friendly soldiers in the same square as it.  To simulate the effect of firing a cannon, a player shoots a &amp;quot;bullet&amp;quot; of rolled-up paper directly over the cannon using a rubber band in his or her fingers.  Any units which he or she knocks over are considered &amp;quot;destroyed&amp;quot; and removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is from the book The KnowHow Book of Action Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
