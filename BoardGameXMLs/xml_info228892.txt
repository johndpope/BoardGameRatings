			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood and Dust is a game of strategy and adventure enabling players to participate in fierce battles between armies of Medieval times. The game faithfully reenacts the harsh combat reality of this period - heavy cavalry charges breaking enemy lines, lethal salvoes of archers or brutal infantry melees. Players have to choose the right tactics making flank or rear attacks as well as organize their regiments in proper formations. It is also important to take advantage of the lay of the land and use special abilities of commanders and units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played in three different game modes for 2 to 4 players: standalone Scenarios designed by the author, standalone Scenarios custom-build by the players and the Campaign. In the Blood and Dust Campaign, the players become captains of mercenary forces who sell their military services in a world full of dangers, intrigues and brutal battles. Your heroes start from commanding a small detachment of units, but as the Campaign progresses, they will muster additional units for their armies. They will improve skills and search for fresh recruits, while their soldiers will gain experience in uncountable skirmishes. For a sack full of gold they will accept commissions, helping the wealthy and the powerful attain even more influence. Alternatively, they will seek glory and money on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
