							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crisis of Faith</name>
									
			<description>Storyline Book One (1933-1935)&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a series of plot books which seek to advance the Heavy Gear storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;Storyline Book One: Crisis of Faith traces the events on Terra Nova from TN 1933 through TN 1935.  The planet lurches towards a global conflict and the words of Terranovans themselves betray their machinations and true intentions.  Dramatic events that were only hinted at in previous books start to take form with world shaking consequences.  Letters, private conversations, journal entries and official reports expose the true face of history, from the deadly secrets of master spies to the fears of those caught up in a conflict beyond their control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terra Nova grows older and more mature, but at the cost of the precious innocence and peace won at the end of the War of the Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
