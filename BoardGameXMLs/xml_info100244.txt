			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secrets and mysteries abound in a classic Asylum Pack, which is emerging from the shadows to crawl back into the light. Conspiracies of Chaos, the fifth Asylum Pack in the Forgotten Lore cycle of expansions for Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game, returns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conspiracies of Chaos reintroduces to the Living Card Game environment this intriguing Asylum Pack, updated to the 60-card per pack format (three copies each of 20 unique cards). The included cards have been updated to incorporate the most recent FAQ. In addition, the text on a number of cards has been altered from its original printing, adjusting for game balance and rules clarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among Conspiracies of Chaos' features are six faction-specific conspiracies. Conspiracies are story cards that players can play from their own decks and win to further their goal of claiming three stories. The six conspiracies included within Conspiracies of Chaos play into one of each faction&amp;rsquo;s particular strengths. Also featured are an assortment of characters that thrive in a world of conspiracy&amp;ndash;characters that grow stronger when a conspiracy is in play. In addition, this Asylum Pack also includes support cards and events that can wildly alter the tempo of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
