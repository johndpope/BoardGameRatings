							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flunk</name>
									
			<description>Flunk is a sort of Dummy Contract Whist for three. It doesn't claim to be a form of Bridge. Three-handed Bridge is a contradiction in terms, as it lacks co-operative bidding between the partners, which is one of the two defining features of that game. But it does offer its other defining feature, namely, that of declarer playing from dummy with a view to selecting a trump suit (or announcing no trump) and declaring a contract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
