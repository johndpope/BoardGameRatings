			<description>Publisher's descriptions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Drag racing fun for the entire family with DRAG RACING-the Board Game. Don't let rain dates get you down. Now you can drag race anytime, anywhere. In the trailer or at home on the kitchen table, drag racing action like you have seen at the track. Our game is played with dice and charts. We've included plastic game pieces in the shape of dragsters, funny cars, and pro stockers. You can match race or qualify a 16 car field and run through eliminations. But watch out for the racing gremlins. Blown motors, broken transmissions, tire shake, or smoking the tires are just some of the problems you might run into on our track.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;. . . you can race in a Top Fuel Dragster, Nitro Funny Car, or in a Pro Stocker.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Want to be the number 1 qualifier? Run in 'power' for a shot at 'low e.t.' Watch out though, you might smoke the tires, grenade a motor, or get out of the groove. Tire shake or a broken blower might also do you in. With a little luck you can make a clean pass on your way to victory. Great fun for the entire family.
