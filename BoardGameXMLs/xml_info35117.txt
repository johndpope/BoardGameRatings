							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicken Out</name>
									
			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;The game of scramblin' eggs!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve life-size plastic eggs, eleven containing small foam 'yolks' and the other with a foam chicken are placed on a circular battery-powered vibrating plastic tray.  In turn, players select and open one egg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the egg contains a yolk, the yolk is kept &amp;amp; the empty egg is replaced on the tray.  If the egg is empty, the player must put one of their yolks in the egg &amp;amp; replace it on the tray.  If the egg contains the foam chicken, the player is eliminated. All other players must yell CHICKEN OUT  &amp;amp; the eliminated player must return the chicken to the egg &amp;amp; replace it on the tray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect the required number of yolks (varies according to the number of players) or the last remaining player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
