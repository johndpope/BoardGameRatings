			<description>So you want to join the Infernal Club? Do you have what it takes? The club members are an unusual bunch to say the least. Drawn from diverse backgrounds, some are explorers, others are scholars, but all the ladies and gentlemen are drawn together by one thing &amp;ndash; the occult!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their curiosity and thirst for knowledge of the arcane arts draws them towards it like so many moths to an open flame. In their plush and exclusive London Club they meet to discuss their latest exploits - the artifacts uncovered, the diabolical schemes foiled, and the supernatural terrors they have hunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unofficial motto of the club is &amp;rsquo;Possession is 9/10th of the lore.&amp;rsquo; An offhand joke maybe, yet many say it perfectly captures the club&amp;rsquo;s healthy spirit of competition and the very real danger its members face every time they set out on another paranormal investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ghost Hunter players take on the role of  new Infernal Club members and set out on a quest to the notorious Blackmoor House to compete against their fellow hunters to capture as many of the unholy spirits that haunt it as possible without succumbing to the terror and ending up haunted for life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Hunter is a card game for 2 &amp;ndash; 7 players that should last between 10-30 minutes. Players take it in turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&amp;rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on the stack then they have to pick it up. If a player manages to lay a group of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Plenty of the cards come with special rules that you can manipulate to turn the game your way. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game and then players count up the scores of all of the cards that they captured minus all of the cards that they didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple but the strategies can be complex. Skill and luck play their parts in equal measure in this short but engaging card game. It pays to get rid of your cards and be the Ghost Hunter who ends the game but victory is never assured until the final scores are counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
