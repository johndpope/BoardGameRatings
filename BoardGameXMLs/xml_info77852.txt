							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Young Merlin</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is such a cool game. You play the young blond hero Merlin. During the game you go around helping the locals Melody &amp;amp; her father, a vain fairy &amp;amp; the old wizard. The game is very linear as you need to find jewels to get weapons &amp;amp; such to help you go forward in the game. In the end you find the baddie that's disturbing the land is the Evil Shadow King, so of course you must defeat him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is fairly easy but it's fun, bright &amp;amp; colorful. About the hardest part are the mine cart levels as you must lean or jump in time. To bad this was only made for the Snes, this game would have done well on a touch screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
