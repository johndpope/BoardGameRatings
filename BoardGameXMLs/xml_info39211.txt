							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gro√üwildjagd in Afrika</name>
									
			<description>A game about hunting animals in Africa. Players roll dice and move their meeples. On many spots on the gameboard they can take a chance and shoot at elephants, lions, ...  For each &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; animal they get counters worth from 1 point for a jackal up to 80 points for an elephant. Animals, which give many points are harder to kill than animals which give less points. All in all there are 29 different animals. During some actions the hunters also can die. When the surviving hunters are back in the native village, the one with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
