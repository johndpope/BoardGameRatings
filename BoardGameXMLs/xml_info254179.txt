							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drop Racers</name>
									
			<description>You are a Drop Racer. Your goal is to be the best racer in the land and get the Great Drop Trophy. But this isn't any normal race. Instead of who can go the fastest or farthest, you are trying to be the first one to earn enough points. To earn points, you must collect special Drops that litter the race track while avoiding the Black Drops. Collect the right Drops, score points, win the trophy. Welcome to Drop Racers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drop Racers is a fast, family-friendly game about flicking and nudging small cars around the table and trying to bump into different colored drops. Each player is trying to use the drops they've bumped into to score cards in their hand. The first player to score 15 points worth of cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;______________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was one of the 4 finalists in the 2016 Mayday Games Design Contest held at Geekway to the West (game convention). Thanks to all the folks at Geekway, the judges, and Mayday Games for giving us the chance to create and show off our game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
