			<description>Big Fight (ビッグファイト), fully titled as Big Fight: Big Trouble in the Atlantic Ocean, is a 1992 arcade game developed and published by Tatsumi, and is one of their last arcade games before focusing on sticker printing business. Due to the beat 'em up and fighting game genres being popularized by the successes of Capcom's arcade-hits Final Fight and Street Fighter II, Tatsumi added two different modes to Big Fight: a beat 'em up mode and a versus fighting game mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Mission Mode&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;STORY Mode&amp;quot; according to the official website and arcade flyer), similar to Final Fight, one or two players must choose between three characters Kevin, Gear or Zill, before beginning the game simultaneously. Each character has their own fighting style, special moves and statistics. Players control with a joystick and two buttons: one for attacking and one for jumping. Like Final Fight, players can press both buttons to perform special moves that attack in both directions, which costs health. Players are also able to attack their opponents laying on the floor, throw their opponents, pick up health items for health recovery and use weapons as additional ways to protect themselves while fighting enemies. Some weapons can be used several times, some only once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Final Fight, at the half of the first level, players will have to choose between three routes to walk through, each having their own difficulty. At the end of each later level, players will face a boss, and when he or she is defeated, he or she will join in and become playable while the players can select whoever teamed up with the last characters players played, except for the last two Dr. D and TX-No.3. Another feature that differentiates it from other beat 'em ups is when a player is knocked to the ground, an &amp;quot;Angle Power&amp;quot; bar appears, requiring the player to rapidly press the punch button to fill it up before it vanishes. When successfully filled, the players' characters will be lightning charged and automatically perform their special moves while setting any nearby enemies on blue fire and stay charged up for a short time. Players are also able to shoot blue flames with the punch buttons while charged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to access &amp;quot;1P vs. 2P Mode&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;VS. Mode&amp;quot; according to website and flyer), players must insert two coins to access this mode similar to most fighting games at the time, choose between the three heroes and five bosses and knock out one another in two-out-of-three rounds. The winner will either move on to fight against CPU players or another real player will join in and choose a character, while the winner will not be able to select another character. The fighting rules are the same as &amp;quot;Mission Mode&amp;quot;, but in versus-style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Big Fight: Big Trouble in the Atlantic Ocean&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
