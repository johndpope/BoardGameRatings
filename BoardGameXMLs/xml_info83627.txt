			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high level adventure for not less than 3 PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the History:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ava-Terrel, the father of this great kingdom who vanished a millennium ago, was a great warrior (and a wizard although not many know of it). He was reputed to have fought off a whole band of evil orcs armed with only his famed sword, the Myrmidon. His past is dark and shrouded in mystery but under his wise rule the people prospered and did not ask many questions.&lt;br/&gt; On the fateful night of his bicentenial, he mysteriously vanished, never to be seen by his people again.&lt;br/&gt; The legendary Myrmidon, the glowing symbol of this great kingdom, was lost with Ava-Terrel. Its malevolent beauty is now but a memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
