			<description>&amp;ldquo;A two player game of Fantasy battles using Dice to represent individual units. Object: Play continues until one side routs or is utterly destroyed. Dice: Dice are also referred to as troops and units.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each type of die represents a different type of Unit in the game. A four-sided die is a General Unit (Leader or Warlord), a six-sided die is an Infantry Unit, an eight-sided die is an Archer Unit, a ten-sided die is a Cavalry Unit, a twelve-sided die is a Mage Unit, and a twenty-sided die is a Monster Unit. The players start with an equal number of dice, but each may choose a different assortment (with each player being limited to one type of monster).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn begins with the players rolling all of their dice. Combat is then resolved by first consulting the Monsters followed, in sequence, by combat separate resolution for Leaders, Mages, Cavalry, Archers, and Infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
