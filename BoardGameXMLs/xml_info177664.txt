							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">National Network Game</name>
									
			<description>The National Network Game is played on a wooden board printed with a 5x5 grid. Each player has five pawns of the same colour. The game starts with a row of pawns in alternating colours on opposite sides of the board. Players alternate turns, moving one of their pieces one square at a time in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.) The first player to manoeuver four pieces in a square or continuous straight line (in any direction) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
