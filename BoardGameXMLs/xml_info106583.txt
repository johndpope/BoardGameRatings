							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frogger 2</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game continues the tale of Frogger. No longer content to merely have the gamer make a frog hop across the screen, the developers have added a story to the game. Pico, an alien, crashes his UFO into Firefly Swamp and Frogger decides to help out by collecting all the scattered bits of the ship. The levels are no longer a single-screen layout, they now span multiple screens and scroll as the player reaches the edge. There are a variety of themed levels including robotic, lava, aerial, and forest. The art design if very colorful and kid-friendly, but the game is challenging, and many young gamers might get frustrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On-line multiplayer allows for up to 4 players. There are two game types: jewel duel (a type of &amp;quot;keep-away&amp;quot;) and race (traditional race to the finish line.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
