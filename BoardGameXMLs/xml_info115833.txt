			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;Snow White made a little party for her friends. She is still waiting for the seven dwarves, who are on their why home from the mines. Help the all get home as fast as you can. Road is long and Snow White is waiting them badly.&lt;br/&gt;Snow White's Party - fun game on 3D game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays one dwarf and game is simple roll and move game. On the way to the house, there are many paths and on each path there are many spaces for a dwarf to land on.&lt;br/&gt;Butterfly stone - roll more than 4, you get +3 moves, you roll less then 4, you miss 2 turn, you roll 1, you go back to the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;White cloud - change places with who ever on the board.&lt;br/&gt;Rabbit - +2 moves&lt;br/&gt;Mushroom - -2 moves&lt;br/&gt;Squirrel - miss a turn&lt;br/&gt;Little bird - miss a turn&lt;br/&gt;Evil witch - miss 2 turn&lt;br/&gt;Sleepy - whoever reaches him first, must carry him with himself.  Trick is that with Sleepy, you only move when you roll odd number (1,3,5), so be wise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to reach Snow White, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
