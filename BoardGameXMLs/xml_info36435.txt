			<description>&amp;quot;Another boring day at the Heroes Guildhall. There's only so much pointless killing, looting and drinking one can do before it becomes boring. What's the solution? Find a reason to kill, loot and debauch! So you have decided to quest for the legendary Keys of Fate which will open the Door of Fate in the Tower of Fate (are we sensing a theme here?), which holds the wondrous Scepter of... you guessed it, FATE! With this Scepter you will be able to rule the kingdom, which will stave off the boredom for a while at least. Unfortunately, some of your &amp;quot;workmates&amp;quot; have had the same idea (talk about coincidence), so it is a race against each other to find the keys and rule your own destiny... or at least kill a few hours in the most violent ways possible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Winning: There are six magical keys in the artifact deck. In order to win the game, a player must find at least four out of the six keys and are on the Tower of Fate space at the beginning of the turn. If they achieve this, they have unlocked the power of the tower and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: Hex map of the continent, 2 six-sided dice, 20 card Hero Deck, 28 card Spell Deck, 25 card Artifact Deck, 44 card Dungeon Deck, 50 card Equipment Deck, 15 card Villain Deck, 12 card Quest Deck, 114 card Adventure Deck, 60 Hit tokens, 60 Experience tokens, 60 Gold tokens, 20 Muscle tokens, 20 Whack tokens, 20 Magic tokens, 20 Guts tokens, 20 Sneak tokens, 20 Luck tokens, and a playing piece for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
