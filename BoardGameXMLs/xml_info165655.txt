							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Accelerated Book of Approaches</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approaches are one of the most accessible and easy to learn parts of the Fate Accelerated Edition system, familiar to players of traditional games as well as players brand new to roleplaying. While the FAE Core Rulebook provides an excellent set of approaches, they may not work for all games. This book hopes to remedy that by providing new approaches to replace those found in the Fate Accelerated rules, including approaches familiar to those using the D20 system, the D6 system, and the Traveller system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also looks at the traditional approaches found in Fate Accelerated and examines how they can be used differently in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
