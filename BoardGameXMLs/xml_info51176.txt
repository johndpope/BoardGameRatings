			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir: The enclosed files report on the status of the personnel and facilities at the Belle Reve Federal Penitentiary. The documents describe those accomodations designed for the containment and holding of prisoners with paranormal powers. For your reference, maps and layouts of the prison grounds and surrounding areas are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reports are primarily intended to update you on the current standing of the branch of Task Force X known as the Suicide Squad. Complete psychological, historical, and power evaluations on all Squad personnel are included, I would personally bring to your attention those files on Amanda Waller, Colonel Rick Mag, Captain Boomerang, Bronze Tiger, and Nightshade. These individuals have formed the core of the Squad, and are largely responsible for the success of several important missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Squad's history has been updated, and specific details of all missions are enclosed. These include its recent foray into the Nightshade Dimension and the Squad's successful defeat of the terrorist group called the Jihad in New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have completed reading these files, please destroy them in accordance with Standing Order TFX-PA1. Thank You.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
