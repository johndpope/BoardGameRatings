							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Facility</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Facility is a full-color, 48 x 30 inch, floor plan of a facility, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The two contestants have entered the ring. The hissing and popping of the electric field tells us the fight has begun!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Facility is a single large room map of a futuristic prison facility. The Facility includes a 360 panoramic view from the middle of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Facility is intended for near or far future games. It would also make an excellent high tech prison for super villains in a super hero game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Facility could be used as a futuristic gladiatorial arena. A voracious public demands bloody entertainment and the prisoner on prisoner fights in the ring thrill the populace. Not everyone is happy with this. The senseless violence for the sake of entertainment may force some to act to stop the bloodshed. Perhaps a person whose family member is scheduled to fight hires the group to free them before it is too late. They want the group to break into the prison and save their family member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another idea is that the group is made up of super villains and has been imprisoned in the facility. The super villains need to observe the security measures in place to stop their escape, formulate a plan of escape utilizing their powers, and break out of the facility for revenge on the super heroes who put them in there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
