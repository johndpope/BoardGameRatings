			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the finest fighting forces during World War II was Easy Company of the First Infantry Division.  Now, FIELD OF FIRE takes you back into time to assume command of these heroic men, retracing eight of their historical battles in North Africa and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dividing your company into fireteam units of six men each, you'll direct a night raid in North Africa, lead the storming of Omaha Beach on D-Day, even conduct a defensive delaying action in the Battle of the Bulge!  Every aspect of this tactical simulation is historically accurate, from the realistic rules covering line-of-sight and hidden movement, to the infantry weapons of World War II such as 30 caliber machine guns and M1 rifles.  Even your soldiers' abilities will improve through time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To heighten the realism and immediacy during play, special attention has been paid to the High-Res color graphics and lively sound effects.  But the thrust of the game is toward planning and execution.  You'll need to apply such military concepts as concentration of force, cover fire, flanking and selective maneuver.  And you must recognize the strengths and weaknesses of your various units: Tanks, rifle and bazooka teams, engineers, artillery, forward observers and machine gun crews.  The enemy is directed by your cunning computer.  With three levels of difficulty, it will challenge novices and battle-hardened veterans alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Roger Damon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
