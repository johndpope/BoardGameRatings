							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Riders: Chronicles of Pern</name>
									
			<description>The game takes place on the fictional planet Pern created by science fiction writer Anne McCaffrey for her Dragonriders of Pern series of novels. The story, divided into four chapters, follows the dragonrider D'kor who, with the help of his dragon Zenth, searches for girls to be candidates for Impressing a new young gold dragon. Various side-plots are developed throughout the game including a bit of intrigue involving an epidemic sickness that is somewhat reminiscent of the storyline in McCaffrey's novel Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern. The game contains over 120 locations on three continents. The player interacts and speaks with over 170 characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game did not sell well, and was derided both by the gaming community and fans of the series for inconsistencies, poor storyline, and poor gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Dragon Riders: Chronicles of Pern , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
