							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kick-Ass: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>New York City is being overrun with criminals. The Police Department either can't handle this new wave of crime, or has been corrupted from the inside and refuses to help. In these troubled times, certain individuals have stepped up to keep the streets safe...while making sure they aren't late to work, or they don't miss another dinner date. Saving the day isn't easy when you've got an active social life to maintain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kick-Ass: The Board Game, players take on the role of one of seven masked vigilantes trying to keep New York City safe. Working together, they must keep the Evil Boss' plan from coming to fruition. Each round, they travel to the various districts on the game board, beating up minions, doing good deeds for the citizens, and trying to keep their personal life from falling apart. It's a difficult task, but luckily, they've got their friends to help them out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes five different bosses, and all of the different heroes, bosses, mini-bosses, and minions are represented by miniatures. Each of the seven heroes has unique gear and activation cards that they can use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
