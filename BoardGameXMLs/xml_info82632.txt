							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Recettear: An Item Shop&#039;s Tale</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An RPG in which the player runs an item shop, as found in most towns in RPG games.  The player can buy items wholesale, from customers, or sponsor adventurers to retrieve them from dungeons.  The player must meet certain money thresholds at the end of each game week, or be abruptly evicted - but if this happens, it turns out that the previous week was &amp;quot;all a dream&amp;quot; and the player begins from the start of the same week again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Especially notable as one of very few Doujin games to be localized into English and the first such game to be available on Steam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
