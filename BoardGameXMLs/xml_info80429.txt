							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SuperPower 2</name>
									
			<description>Like it's predecessor, SuperPower 2 is a geopolitical simulation game built around the following three aspects: political, economic and military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players set their own objectives and try to achieve them within a set time. For example, a player might decide to balance resources, hunt rebels or conquer the world. The computer controls the other countries which have their own objectives. When objectives come into conflict, the player must manage these relationships, form alliances and go to war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to the original game, SuperPower 2 has been generally improved, both in gameplay and graphics, and now features multiplayer support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
