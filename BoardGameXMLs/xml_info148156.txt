			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the mummy: one of the most iconic forms of undead, though one that is often difficult to reconcile with the medieval European themes of the average fantasy roleplaying game. Though we often think of Egypt when we think of mummies, the fact of the matter is that mummies of various sorts have been found historically throughout the world. For the purposes of this book, we focused on three different aspects of mummies in popular culture. The relic-bound mummy (CR 7) focuses on the concept of mummies as guardians of relics and treasures, and it is virtually impossible to steal a relicbound mummy&amp;rsquo;s relic and live to enjoy the spoils. The curse lord mummy (CR 10) instead focuses on the link between mummies and curses, and is loaded down with some very nasty and creative curses that are incredibly difficult to remove. Finally, the possessed mummy (CR 12) is actually nothing more than the corpse of an ancient warrior, who has been possessed by a fiendish entity, which uses it as a foothold to spread evil and terror through the material plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
