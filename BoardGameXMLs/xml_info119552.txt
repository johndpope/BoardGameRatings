			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Reality is an illusion.&lt;br/&gt;Those who seek to understand it corrode their understanding of it. In na&amp;iuml;vet&amp;eacute;,&lt;br/&gt;objects are solid, ideas are true or false, sensations are real, and&lt;br/&gt;communication conveys information. To the adept, these things are as fading&lt;br/&gt;dreams.&lt;br/&gt;There is no object that is not also emptiness.&lt;br/&gt;There is no arbiter of truth.&lt;br/&gt;Sensations are the lies of Maya; they are the shifting of electrical patterns in&lt;br/&gt;the brain; they are signifiers without referent.&lt;br/&gt;Communication is violence.&lt;br/&gt;Reality is false.&lt;br/&gt;It does not matter how many layers one peels back. It does not matter what&lt;br/&gt;revelations one has. This is because there is no truth.&lt;br/&gt;We are things that we have dreamed, and there is no sense in it, and when the&lt;br/&gt;sleeper wakes we shall be washed away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
