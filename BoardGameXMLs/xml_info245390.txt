			<description>Yojimbrawl is a local multiplayer fighting game originally prototyped during a Ludum Dare game jam in March 2014. We&amp;rsquo;ve spent another few months developing it further for Humble Bundle Monthly December 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The updated version of the game is exclusively available to Humble Bundle Monthly subscribers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the makers of Genital Jousting and Broforce, comes a deadly serious local multiplayer samurai fighting game that recalls classic gameplay where split second decision making and quick reflexes are the key to victory, while the slightest misstep could lead to your demise. Set in a bleak, blood splattered landscape where hope lives and dies by the sword, you and up to three combatants will fight to death and beyond. Master complex combos and gain newfound power with each reincarnation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
