							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures Darkness Under Glimmerdale</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark times have come to Glimmerdale.  The Glimmerill runs foul and people are falling ill.  The apparent source, the effluence from a tunnel that drains into a secluded cove along the Glimmerill.  The residents of Glimmerdale need help.  And that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness Under Glimmerdale is the first scenario pack in the Universal Adventures product line and includes six adventures, nine Encounter cards, nine Event cards and nine Dungeon cards, for use with any fantasy roleplaying game.  Each adventure includes Background, Objective and Start information and lists of the Dungeon, Encounter and Event cards which comprise the adventure.  A storyline links the adventures together and many of the elements introduced can be included in an ongoing campaign.  The cards are reusable and can be used in future adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the adventures for solo or group games without a Game Master, with a Game Master, or as the core concepts for your own campaign.  Like all Universal Adventures products, these adventures can be played with any fantasy adventure rules.  With Universal Adventures Scenario Packs, you&amp;rsquo;ll always have adventures to play with your favorite fantasy roleplaying games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For complete use, Universal Adventures Darkness Under Glimmerdale requires the Universal Adventures Dungeon Deck, Encounter Deck and Event Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
