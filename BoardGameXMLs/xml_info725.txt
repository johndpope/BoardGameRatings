			<description>Described by the Publisher/Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triple Threat Baseball! is a dice baseball board game designed for family play.  Replicates the play-by-play action of a traditional baseball game.  Is not a real player, stats-based game.  Includes two levels of play:  beginning and advanced.  Both levels feature the throwing of two batting dice which result in 15 standard batting outcomes and 6 situational play outcomes.  In addition, the advanced level utilizes 14 different strategy offensive and defensive play cards which are used at the descretion of both managers/players in order to influence the flow of the game.  Also in the in the advanced version, the fielding team manager interacts and intervenes using a single fielding die.  Both versions include the use of a standard baseball scorecard record keeping method.  Triple Threat Baseball! is packaged in a wood box which converts into a playing field complete with a wood scoreboard.  Game pieces are enhanced with baseball action photography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
