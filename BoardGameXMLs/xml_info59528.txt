			<description>In Grandpa's Woods is based on the children's book &amp;quot;In Grandpa's Woods&amp;quot; by Sharon Hart Addy.  It is published by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in celebration of 100 years of forestry in the state of Wisconsin.  In Grandpa's Woods consists of two simple games, for two different age groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For younger children, suggested ages 4 to 8, the game is a basic roll and move.  The first player to take 100 steps and reach Grandpa's cabin is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For suggested ages 9 and up, a trivia element is introduced.  Players may not move forward until after they have correctly answered a trivia question about one of the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;Forest Animals, Insects, and Plants&lt;br/&gt;Forest Managemnent&lt;br/&gt;Forest Facts&lt;br/&gt;Forest History&lt;br/&gt;Forest Benefits&lt;br/&gt;People, Places, and Organizations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
