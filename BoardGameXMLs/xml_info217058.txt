							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wrath of Denethenor</name>
									
			<description>Description from back of game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Deledain, an imaginary world ravaged by the torrents of war. The four lords of Deledain once ruled their kingdoms independently and peacefully, but a small border skirmish mushroomed into the destruction of their four lands. Like a phoenix from the ashes, the evil Denethenor rose to dominate the weakened world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin the game by taking on the role of the most unlikely of heroes, a scoundrel explorer out to pillage the war-torn countryside. However, with every successful raid on castle, town and village, you take another step closer to the ultimate battle with Denethenor, the prince of evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrath of Denethenor is a fantasy role-playing adventure game featuring superior graphics and programming plus a plot elaborate enough to hold the interest of even the most sophisticated adventurer. Animated magic spells and traps provide a visual spectacle, while elaborate sound effects complete the scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
