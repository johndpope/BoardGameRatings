			<description>This 1949 game is subtitled &amp;quot;The Football Game Used by Coaches to Train Their Squads. The football field inset in the box is marked to individual yards, and has peg holes along the side to mark scores, quarters and downs. Other parts include a cardboard 10 yard marker, a plastic football and three dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although each play requires a roll of the dice, with the total compared against a list of plays to determine net yards gained or lost, the key to the game lies in two sets of cards. The defensive player each play secretly chooses one of five formation cards (6-2-2-1, 6-3-2, 7-1-2-1, 8-3 or 5-3-2-1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The offensive player then calls one of eight possible plays and turns over the top card from the 80-card play deck. Cross-referencing the play row with the defensive column provides a modifier to the die roll, as well as possible fumbles and interceptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
