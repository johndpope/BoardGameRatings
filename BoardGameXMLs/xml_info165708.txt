			<description>Today is the big day!  Team leaders in Monsterland will choose their teams to go infest dungeons and castles. Will you pick the best team?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must play tiles face down. If a player forms a line of four tiles is allowed to reveal one tile; when tiles are over, players choose a row and a column to score points: the monster leader with the most powerful team is the winner... but be careful! Some heroes are trying to infiltrate Monsterland to put a spoke in your wheel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mostrilli is a tile placement involving a bit of memory and basic strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
