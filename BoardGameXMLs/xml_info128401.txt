							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The World of Burn</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burn is the name of a star system between the Loop and Katmandu systems. Burn is a red sun and thus fairly cool, but the only planet in the system, also called Burn, lies in a close orbit around it and is rather warm. The world of Burn orbits its star at a radius of 52 million miles, or nominal Orbit 2. The orbit of Burn is slightly elliptical, and is synchronized with it's orbital inclination (25 degrees) so that perihelion always occurs during the southern winter. This means that southern summers are cooler than northern summers, and southern winters are warmer than northern winters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burn is a thoroughly terrestrial world. The atmosphere is composed of 25 % oxygen, 70% Nitrogen, and various trace gasses. 66% of the world's surface is covered with liquid water, much of it locked in the polar ice caps. The land is generally lush, covered with a sprawling green forest which looks black under the red sunlight. The life forms are also astonishingly terrestrial, but this is a case of convergent evolution rather than transplantation of Earth ecosystems, as happened on Adma, Faren, Jalan, and Tamana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
