			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Many musicians, even those of considerable experience, frequently have difficulty in sight reading music and it is often necessary for them to play a selection a number of times before they can be assured of rendering it with accuracy. This is due largely to the fact that many musicians are not sufficiently familiar with the positions of the notes of the musical scale to be able to recognize instantly a given note from its position, which is essential in sight reading. This is especially true of beginners or persons inexperienced in reading music.&amp;quot; This game aims to teach the notes of the scale through game play. Includes board, 48 cards and 16 playing pieces, four of each color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has the treble staff and the bass staff running continuously around the board with the musical notes of the scale on them, with the name of the note in small letters. Players have four game pieces each. The object is to move through the notes of the scales to get all four game pieces to the W-I-N-S zone. The players turn cards to determine what letter of the scale to move to. At first they may need to refer to the names of the notes, but as the game is played, they will begin to recognize the position of the notes, aiding in their sight reading ability. Players may move any of their pieces, and may have to move backward in order to get to the note indicated. The first player to get all his pieces in the W-I-N-S zone is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
