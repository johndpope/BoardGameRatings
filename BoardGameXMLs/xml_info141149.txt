			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't just fire at those enemy battle cruisers--you better blaze away! And you better be fast, because they close in quickly and the end is fast and clean. If you think you have quick reflexes, you may have just met your match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the sole pilot of a Class-T defender ship whose mission is to prevent malicious aliens from entering the solar system.  It is up to you to defend Earth from the onslaught of these aliens, so we're counting on you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this, you must use your advanced targeting device to pinpoint certain invaders, and then destoy them!  Moving your targeting device is quite simple: merely use the arrow keys on your ship's control panel.  Once you think you are lined up with a ship to destroy, press the SPACE key to fire!  If you can hit the ship directly, it will be destroyed.  Be careful of the aliens, though, for if they get too close to your ship, they will destroy you.  You can prevent this in an emergency by pressing a SHIFT key to activate one of your three shields which you have in reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of alien ships: (1) The H-Class, which resemble the shape of the letter 'H', (2) The Saucer class, which look like flying saucers, and finally (3) The Destoyer class, which are easy to spot because of their ominous appearance.  You are awarded 50, 75, and 100 points for the destruction of these ships, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck on your mission....we're depending on you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
