			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If anything, Bah Ke'gehn is yet more alien than NagaWorld, with genuinely alien intelligent creatures who in the tradition of the best fantasy teach us about ourselves. Even if you've never seen nor read The Prisoner of Zenda, you'll recognize this tale of the man who has to stand in for the king and rescue him from his evil brother, and enjoy giving a player this role. The Farmland is a quiet, rural, pre-industrial world; but depending on which version you play, there is danger here. When The New Ice Age was a free playtest version here on the site, it got positive reviews; this frozen wasteland survival scenario has been expanded for inclusion here. Post-sympathetic Man gives a bleak alternate present in which survival of the fittest is taken to mean that the weak should die.  A different kind of post-apocalyptic world, one in which civilization fell quietly by laziness, is portrayed in The Industrial Complex. Finally, M. Joseph Young's time travel story The Perpetual Barbecue becomes the basis for a Groundhog Day-like setting in which one day keeps repeating, but in two different versions, and the player has to unravel what has happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
