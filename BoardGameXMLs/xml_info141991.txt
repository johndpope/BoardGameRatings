			<description>Yorsh is a liquor game helping to have a great time in a group. Inside the box there are task and bonus cards. The main principle is as follows: you either complete the task or you drink. Bonuses are for making tasks harder or easier. During the set you will have to propose toastes with difficult words, remember car brands, football players and countiers, give a massage and swap clothes, text &amp;ldquo;I'm pregnant. What now?&amp;rdquo; to a random number, drink two glasses simultaneously, drink while jumping, drink upside down etc. All in all, you are going to have a great party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points for tasks written in the corner of the cards.  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
