			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Strike is an arcade game similar to After Burner, but with an added strategic element in that the loadout and fuel must be selected for each mission. Different weapons are effective against different targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is no ordinary plane - in fact, some say it is the ultimate conventional air-combat weapons system - and it's all yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is to carry out raids against specific targets in enemy territory, running the gauntlet of hostile aircraft, missiles and land- and sea-based forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, you will be promoted; but in a first strike situation, only the most accomplished pilot will win through. Flying by day and night, from bases as far apart as the Arctic and the Mediterranean, it is up to you to select the weapons you need for the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But don't overload your plane or take too little fuel, even though you can restock and effect repairs at designated rendezvous points, you must calculate the odds exactly to survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coding: Dave Thomas&lt;br/&gt;Graphic Design: Bob Thomas&lt;br/&gt;Design Coordination: Peter Cook&lt;br/&gt;Sonix: Mark Cooksey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
