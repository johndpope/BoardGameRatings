			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures: Plucky's Big Adventure is the third Tiny Toon Adventures-based game, released on the PlayStation, released on September 21, 2001, and developed by Warthog and published by Conspiracy Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;The game's focus is on Plucky Duck, the green feathered co-star of the Tiny Toon Adventures cartoon. Based around an actual episode of the series, Plucky is attempting to build a time machine because he forgot to do his homework. However, he needs the help of his show co-stars to find the needed parts to finish the time machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this mission, the player controls one of four characters, each in their own chapter, Plucky Duck, Hamton J. Pig, Babs Bunny, and Buster Bunny. Then the player hunts around Acme Looniversity finding the required items using clues picked up in the game. The player must then trade out items as found before finally finding the required item needed for the chapter. Familiar faces from the series appear during the mission and often offer their help. However, Elmyra Duff and Montana Max are hindrances, capturing the player if they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
