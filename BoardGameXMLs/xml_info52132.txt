							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dominion Tank Police</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This RPG is based on the classic 1989 four-part anime OAV series, from the mind of Japan's prominent storyteller artist, Masamune Shirow. Now you can join the ranks of the Tank Police in their fight against crime, or be part of the Buaku Gang in their quest for power and glory. The game features the intuitive and easy-to-learn Tri-Stat System(TM) game mechanics, which is fully compatible with Guardians of Order's other anime role-playing games.  Additionally, the book offers extensive resources and references for Dominion fans (including complete episode summaries), and a full-colour gallery of spectacular animation art.  The ideal RPG for gamers and Shirow fans alike!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
