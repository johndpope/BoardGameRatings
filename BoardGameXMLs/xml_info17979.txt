			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;City Go, The Big City Discovery Game is a great way to discover New York City's many treasures! Are you ready to search &amp;amp; find, draw &amp;amp; rhyme; do a little dance and sing some songs? Along the way, you'll find pianos and violins, planets and playgrounds, skyscrapers and skaters, jewels, dinosaurs, clocks, sculptures and more! As you play City Go, you get to travel through the fabulous City Go Map filled with over 100 original illustrations, drawn just for you! We've included museums, landmarks, performance venues, sporting arenas, parks, bridges and much more! The game involves risk, chance, guts, imagination and a good sense of humor! Players must first locate the illustration(s) on the city map and then perform the task. You score points for all of the tasks you do and whoever has the most points when Sam is freed wins!&lt;br/&gt;City Go is for Ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
