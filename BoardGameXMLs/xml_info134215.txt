							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tell Me a Story: Mystery In the Forest</name>
									
			<description>Melissa Sweet has painted scenes and characters full of intrigue and suspense. Storytellers will find plenty of images to develop a mystery and solve it, too. Will they connect the squirrel eavesdropping on chipmunks with the squirrel hiding golden coins under his acorns? Which happened first? Recurring characters, locations and props encourage linking the cards in endless combinations for fresh, new stories every time it&amp;rsquo;s played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are variations involved in this card deck game. In each variant, however, the players must use a certain number and combination of cards to create a story. Gameplay proceeds a bit differently in each case, but one must build a hand with the appropriate card types and then be the first to create a story with them. The winner is the first to reach that goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
