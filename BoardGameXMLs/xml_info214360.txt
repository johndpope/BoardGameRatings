							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Archetypes of Bokrug</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doom That Came To Your Enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eldritch, the strange, and the weird are often relegated to the domains of villains and NPCs in fantasy, with the good guys being the ones who stand in the way of the dark things that remain just beyond our perception, which we can never truly understand. But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&amp;mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&amp;rsquo;t fit in with normal society&amp;mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this book, we focus on Bokrug, the patron deity of the beings of Ib, who wreaked terrible vengeance upon the men of Sarnath. A great water lizard and one of the terrible Great Old Ones, Bokrug features most prominently in H.P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s The Doom That Came to Sarnath. Whether they mention Ib or Bokrug directly or not, each archetype in this book builds on themes of amphibious creatures and patient, overwhelming vengeance against those who have wronged you. This book contains the following archetypes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The judge of Sarnath, an inquisitor archetype that focuses on turning enemies&amp;rsquo; attacks against them, and delivers powerful punishment against the enemies of Bokrug.&lt;br/&gt;    The avenger of Ib, a paladin archetype that can smite any creature who commits a terrible crime before her, and which radiates powerful retributive auras.&lt;br/&gt;    The Bokrug spirit, a shaman spirit with many abilities thematically relating to doom, vengeance, and watery depths.&lt;br/&gt;    The blade of Bokrug, a slayer archetype that focuses on slow and patient combat to eventually deliver overwhelming and devastating attacks on his foes.&lt;br/&gt;    The keeper of memory, a spiritualist archetype whose phantom is one of the long-dead beings of Ib, which whispers ancient secrets of Bokrug to her, and gives her the power to control plants and water.&lt;br/&gt;    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who worship Great Old One Bokrug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
