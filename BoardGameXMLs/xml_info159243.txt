			<description>Back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1945, GERMANY... the heart of Germany is threatened by the remorseless advance of Allied armies from the east and west. From the borders of France, Belgium and Holland, US and British armies fight their way through the West Wall and on to the river Rhine, then over it and into Germany's industrial heartlands. In Poland, the unstoppable tide of the Red Army sweeps across the Vistula river and strikes for the Oder, beyond which lies the ultimate objective - Berlin, and the final bitter battles of the Second World War in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;A general history of the war from Germany's borders to the streets of Cologne, Konigsberg, Bremen and Berlin, covering the period from January 1945 to the ultimate defeat of the Third Reich in May.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARMY LISTS&lt;br/&gt;Four army lists designed to play with the character of the principal combatants: German 'Defenders of the Reich', to create the ad hoc battlegroups thrown to fight the invasion. These scratch units, mixing a few veteran survivors with Volksturm and armed civilians, must face the power of Russian, British and American armoured spearheads as they drive ever deeper into Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also game data for all the late war tanks, guns and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPECIAL RULES&lt;br/&gt;New special rules to adapt core Battlegroup game to the battlefields of 1945. The rules recreate the desperate last stand nature of much of the fighting in 1945 whilst retaining game balance, despite the German Army's collapsing morale. Special rules include a new battle counters set as well as new innovations like jet fighters and infra-red sights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCENARIOS&lt;br/&gt;Four new general scenarios, including an 'Urban Assault' and a mini-campaign 'Breakthrough to Berlin', of six linked historical refights set on the Seelow Heights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
