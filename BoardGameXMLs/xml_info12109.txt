							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silverstone Grand Prix</name>
									
			<description>This is the official game of Silverstone. It combines both luck and skill. There are variants of the game from basic to advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game, players are given 12 cards (each with a number on from 1-12) and they shuffle them and place them face down. Each player turns a card over in turn and moves that many spaces - there are overtaking areas and opportunities to block. The car that reaches the finish first is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advance level allows for more skill to be involved. Each player has their 12 cards and they choose which one to play. Therefore, you can be more tactical by blocking and attempting overtaking moves. You choose the number of laps, whether pit stops should be used etc. Once all players have used their cards, the process begins again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents Silverstone and the cars are folded cardboard inserted into tabs. Each card has a different Silverstone fact on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
