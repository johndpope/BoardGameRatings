			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh my God, Kelly, you look exactly the same! I can't believe how long it's been, but you're just gorgeous. Me? I'm married. He's a werewolf.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years ago, we were awkward and pimpled, or gorgeous and popular, or angry and rebellious -- but we were all monsters. Now, we're pushing thirty, and it's time to gather once more. The monsters of Alucard High School are going to a reunion. We've all changed, some for the better, and others, not so much. Amid howling wolves, punch bowls full of Type AB, and receding hairlines, we try to figure out what happened to our youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
