			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;Keeping in mind that in order to know which way we are headed, we need to know where we've been, this game has trivia on the battles, soldiers, and different aspects of the American Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Noggin's series of educational games encourages kids to learn interesting facts about their favorite subjects. Each of the thirty game cards combines trivia, true or false, and multiple choice questions.&lt;br/&gt;A special three-numbered die is included which creates interaction and promotes communications between players. Easy and hard levels keep kids interested and challenged - while of having fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card topics include:&lt;br/&gt;Famous Military Leaders&lt;br/&gt;The Civil War Starts&lt;br/&gt;Confederate States of&lt;br/&gt;America&lt;br/&gt;Before the Civil War&lt;br/&gt;Raising Armies&lt;br/&gt;Uncle Tom's Cabin&lt;br/&gt;African Americans during the War&lt;br/&gt;Jefferson Davis&lt;br/&gt;Fun and Games&lt;br/&gt;Ford Theater&lt;br/&gt;The Hardships of War&lt;br/&gt;Battle for the Sea&lt;br/&gt;Battle of Gettysburg&lt;br/&gt;Life as a Union Soldier&lt;br/&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;br/&gt;Battle of Manassas&lt;br/&gt;Rebuilding After the War&lt;br/&gt;Nursing the Wounded&lt;br/&gt;Siege of Vicksburg&lt;br/&gt;Life_as_a_Confederate Soldier&lt;br/&gt;Famous Battles&lt;br/&gt;Famous Women&lt;br/&gt;The Underground Railroad&lt;br/&gt;Food and Agriculture&lt;br/&gt;The Civil War Ends&lt;br/&gt;Technology&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of the Civil War&lt;br/&gt;Ulysses S.
