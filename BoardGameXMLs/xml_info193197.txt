			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A StoryCube: RPG Adventure for the Heroes of the Tortoise Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been nearly a decade since The Squid, the most successful crime lord in Tortuga City's history, had his city-wide organized crime ring toppled by The Heroes of The Tortoise, but for the first time in years crime rates had began to rise again in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was two years ago, and now criminal efforts culminating in a number of shadowy organizations have reached such a fever pitch that a New Heroes of The Tortoise has begun to rise in response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the original crime-fighting group who disbanded when their purpose came to an end, these new heroes are disorganized and banded together into loose cells formed by individual former Heroes who still had fight in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Return of The Squid, a team of not-quite-super heroes joins a cell run by Skye, a seemingly new hero who bears a stunning resemblance to Blue Punch, one of the youngest members of the old Heroes of The Tortoise, as she attempts to stop the creation of a doomsday device by one of The Squid's former lieutenants that could be used to hold the entire city hostage or even destroy it in retribution for the loss of the crime lord to whom so many were loyal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this first of a campaign of adventures centered around stopping this device and the plans of its creator, a group of one to six players will take on the roles of new heroes to infiltrate the corporate office building in which the plans for the device are believed to be stored and attempt to stop their creator, former Squid agent Mr. Gray, from passing them on to whoever he's working for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure spans, on average, seven scenes and should take a team of 1-5 players between 2 and 4 hours to complete. In addition, the adventure introduces the Heroes of The Tortiose setting conceived by Greg Schulze and developed by Stone Lovecharm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
