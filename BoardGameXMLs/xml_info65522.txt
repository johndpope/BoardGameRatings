			<description>&amp;quot;In 1836 Texas was still a part of Mexico. But the Texans revolted against the autocratic rule of President Santa Anna. The most famous battle of the Texas War for Independence occurred at a crumbling old Spanish mission on the outskirts of San Antonio. Davy Crockett reportedly said that the Mexicans would 'eat snakes' before they got into the Alamo.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This miniatures wargame is intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale miniature figures or paper figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's notes: &amp;quot;The rules for this battle are adapted from 'Remember the Alamo!' by George Knapp, which appeared in MWAN 100 . . . For the most part the changes I have made are to simplify the game so that they will work well with my students aged 10-13. The battle can be completed in less than two hours. The Mexicans will suffer a much higher casualty rate than they did historically, but the game moves quickly and is fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
