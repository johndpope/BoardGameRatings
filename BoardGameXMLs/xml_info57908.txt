							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Currents</name>
									
			<description>In the west, the energies that crisscross the land are called Lei Lines.  In China, they are referred to as Dragon Currents.  As with all things in the universe, the Dragon Currents mirror the five elements of the Wu Xing: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players represent powerful Geomancers attempting to harness the five energetic attributes of the Dragon Currents in such a way as to bring harmony to the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Currents is a strategy game for two players, in which players place two-sided energy tokens on Dragon Current lines.  Based on the relationship of the Wu Xing, elements either enhance or diminish other elements.  Well placed tokens can increase the player's score while decreasing his opponents.  The player who best harnesses the relationship of the energies wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
