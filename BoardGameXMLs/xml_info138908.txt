							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dagger: Supplemental Rules for Classic Role-playing with Children</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DAGGER is designed to introduce kids five years and over to classic-style fantasy role-playing. This supplement uses common, core mechanics found in most old-school fantasy role-playing games. However, these core mechanics are reduced to only the most basic elements necessary for play. This effectively simplifies the game so that players as young as five years can easily grasp the basic concepts. The rules presented here are supplementary (i.e. they are not all-encompassing) and it is assumed that the Referee already possesses a general knowledge of some form of classic fantasy role-playing. Any aspect of play not covered in these rules should be handled by the Referee, &amp;ldquo;filling in the gaps&amp;rdquo; as necessary with his own rulings, or rules from another classic fantasy system. This is a practice that is expected and encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:&lt;br/&gt;Although the subtitle says &amp;quot;Supplemental Rules&amp;quot; this book contains everything needed to play.  The rules cover character advancement up to level 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
