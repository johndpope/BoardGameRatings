			<description>Information from the publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play BOULOMANIA:&lt;br/&gt;First of all, each team throws one dice to see which team starts. The one with the higher number goes first (Team A). Team A throws on dice to determinate the position of the jack (one of the spaces 1-6) and so places the jack. Then, throwing a choice of two or three dice, Team A determines the position of its first bowl - the total number of points indicating which space its first bowl should be placed in. If the total number of points thrown is less than seven, the bowl counts as dead and is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it is Team B's turn to place its first bowl. If Team B is better here, in other words, if its bowl is nearer to the jack - then it is Team A's turn to go again. If Team B doesn't succeed on the first go, then it throws again until on of its bowls is nearer to the jack than the opponent's best-placed bowl or until Team B has no more bowls left. Then it's Team A' turn again... and so on and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are extra rules for things like trying to remove an opponent's well-placed bowl and other stuff that a Boules player might expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
