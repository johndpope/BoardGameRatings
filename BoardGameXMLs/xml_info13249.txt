			<description>Two decks of cards (one for each team)  representing the flip red and the flip blues are used by the players. &lt;br/&gt;The sets of cards have attacking positions, for the player with the ball, and the opposite side of the cards has defending positions for the player trying to get the ball. The attacking player needs to make three successful passes past the defending payer to have a shot at goal, where a separate set of cards is used, in a rock paper scissors style to try and beat the goalkeeper. The game lasts until the decks have been used twice, representing each half of the match, and the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
