							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainous Archetypes Volume II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Good to Be Bad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sick of saving the world? Tired of being expected to leap at the chance to solve everyone&amp;rsquo;s petty problems? Have a thing for twirling mustaches and overly-elaborate deathtraps? Why not mix things up with a villainous character! At some point in their gaming career, everyone has considered playing an &amp;ldquo;evil campaign,&amp;rdquo; but with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game being devoted to goody-two-shoes heroes, it can sometimes be hard to find support. Want some evil options for your character? You&amp;rsquo;ve found them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new villainous archetypes for five different classes. Included are the brutal oppressor, a barbarian archetype focused on savagely demoralizing her foes, the elemental defiler, a kineticist archetype that draws elemental energy from places and even living things, harming them in order to gain power, the extortioner, an investigator archetype that uses the secrets he learns to force others to do what he wants, the villainous bloodline for sorcerers, with a variety of special powers suited for a dark lord of magic, and the eldritch slavemaster, a summoner archetype who enslaves the eidolons and creatures he summons against their will, and can sacrifice them for great benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on an evil-themed campaign (such as Way of the Wicked, by Fire Mountain Games, or the first official Paizo adventure path made specifically for evil characters), or you just want an excuse to play an unrepentant, irredeemable villain, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for villainous NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
