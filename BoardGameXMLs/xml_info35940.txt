							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pharaoh&#039;s Heir</name>
									
			<description>The setting is ancient Egypt. Pharaoh is dying, and, in a break from tradition, has decided that he will name an heir who will best serve Egypt's interests rather than hand the nation over to his handsome but rather dim-witted first-born son. Each player is the leader of a powerful Egyptian Noble Family with the ambition to rise to the level of Pharaoh. Rival Families will provide stiff competition, and all will have to contend with the force of nature that dictates the pattern of Egyptian life -- the River Nile. In flood the Nile can provide increased harvests but may also damage structures, whereas severe drought will cause starvation and suffering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pharaoh has issued several decrees. He demands a great harvest, sufficient people to build yet another mighty monument to himself upon his death (most likely a pyramid, although occasionally the Pharaohs preferred big cat-like things), as well as in increase in the worship of (read: sacrifice to) his favorite gods. In return for excelling in these areas of ancient Egyptian life, Pharaoh is willing to make you his heir. Oh, yes, one last thing -- Pharaoh also rewards the Families that develop the most valuable buildings and the most desirable land districts...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules can be found on the Piecepack Wiki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Piecepack Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
