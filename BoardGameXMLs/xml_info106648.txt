							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ascension of the Prophet</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ascension of the Prophet, written by Mario Barbati, is part of an ongoing series set in the Great City. This is not a numbered adventure in a path, but instead, it concerns a mysterious event that will forever alter the Great City, setting the tone for future events. Throughout the year, &amp;Oslash;one games will release a number of short adventures whose various plots are all somehow entwined with the event. Each will be a stand-alone adventure, designed to be played independently without a specific sequence and can be completed in a single evening&amp;rsquo;s play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wake of the catastrophic sinking, seers and prophets have swarmed the city&amp;rsquo;s streets like eager autumn moths crowd a flickering candle. Standing out among the wild-eyed doomsayers walks Lazarus. Different from the others, he claims to have entered the Sinkhole and returned from the experience altered. Now someone wants to kill Lazarus. The mysterious prophet&amp;rsquo;s right arm, a man called &amp;ldquo;The Mouth&amp;rdquo;, desperately needs adventurers to perform a dangerous mission. Should the mission fail, it might well cost the newly risen prophet his life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ascension of the Prophet is designed using the Pathfinder RPG System for 2nd&amp;ndash;level Player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
