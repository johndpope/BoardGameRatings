			<description>Operation Orient was a relatively obscure plan conceived by Adolph Hitler and Hiroshi Oshima, Japanese ambassador to Nazi Germany, that set forth a unified strategy for the two great Axis powers.  It called for the seizure of ports at Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Diego Suarez, Madagascar to disrupt Allied operations across the Suez Canal and Indian Ocean.  There were plans to invade Siberia in concert with the climax of the Wehrmacht's Operation Typhoon.  In it's most ambitious form, it proposed a land invasion of India by the Imperial Japanese Army, with great assistence from Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.  Meanwhile German forces would seize Egypt and the Caucusus but not stop until panzers could parade in front of the Taj Mahal!  In the end, Yamamoto and the Imperial Japanese Navy won the internal power struggle - the American Pacific fleet and Allied colonies in Asia became the target of the Rising Sun and Operation Orient became just a footnote in history books.  But what if Yamamoto didn't have his way?  One can only imagine the frightful threat of a truly coordinated Axis effort.  Now you have the chance to rewrite history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Orient is a grand strategic simulation, currently in pre-production, that recreates the Pacific Theater of Operations during the Second World War.  It can be played as a standalone game or serve as an expansion to Sturm Europa! to create a truly global conflict.  The combined campaign game is a five player game, that will introduce a unique arrangement of sides, each with independent victory objectives and only ONE winner, to realistically depict the international and interservice rivalries that threatened to shatter the fragile alliances of all the major combatants of World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PTO Only&lt;br/&gt;Player 1 - Japan (Imperial Japanese Navy, Imperial Japanese Army)&lt;br/&gt;Player 2 - Allies (United States Navy, Commonwealth Nations)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ETO + PTO (Requires Sturm Europa!)&lt;br/&gt;Player 1 - Land Axis (Germany, Imperial Japanese Army)&lt;br/&gt;Player 2 - Naval Axis (Italy, Imperial Japanese Navy)&lt;br/&gt;Player 3 - ETO Western Allies (United States Army, Great Britain)&lt;br/&gt;Player 4 - PTO Western Allies (United States Navy, Commonwealth Nations)&lt;br/&gt;Player 5 - Soviets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be combined with Sturm Europa!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
