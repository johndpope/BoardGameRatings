							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Historic Charleston Game</name>
									
			<description>The Charleston Game plays a lot like Monopoly with one catch: players must answer Examination Questions about Charleston's history or culture correctly to purchase properties when they lands on them. Knowledge of Charleston is the only currency in this game. Acquired property cards contain information that can aid owners in answering future questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on an already owned property, there's a Showdown between the player who landed on the property and the property's owner. (If one or both players have no property, no Showdown occurs.) To resolve a Showdown, both players put up a property as a Wager, then roll the dice. The player with the highest roll (reroll any ties) draws an Examination Card and attempts to answer the question. If he answers correctly, he wins both properties. If he answers incorrectly, the properties go to his adversary. The answers to all of the questions on the Examination Cards are in the Official Rule and Answer Booklet that comes with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all property is claimed by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game states that it was Authenticated by Historic Charleston Foundation, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;Cover picture &amp;quot;Adapted from a Lithograph by Smith, Painting by Hill 1850. From the Collection of the South Carolina Historical Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from Rules:&lt;br/&gt;The Charleston Game is a family-type game which reflects Charleston's beauty, history, and culture. It may be enjoyed by all ages and should provide an exciting educational benefit to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the Charleston Game is to obtain  the most property by correctly answering Examination Questions concerning the history and culture of Charleston and South Carolina. Players travel around the board landing on various types of squares. Fact Cards contain important history information which will aid a player in answering Examination Question. They also provide instructions for a player which may be helpful or harmful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all of the property is claimed by the players. The winner is the player with the most property cards. There are no losers in this game. Everyone goes away with a little more knowledge and appreciation for the cultural and historical background of Charleston.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
