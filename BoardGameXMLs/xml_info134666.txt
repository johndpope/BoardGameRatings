			<description>About the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the time of the great collapse of the Old Kingdom and the rise of the Federation,Arxlandia was ruled by The Knights. The Knights were the warlords whom held power over the four&lt;br/&gt;lands of Arxlandia.

There will be obstacles that the players cannot cross. Obstacles such a rivers and mountains; players can only move from hexagon to hexagon. In places where there are bridges or mountain passes, the player may go from one the hexagon where the ridge/mountain pass begins to the where it ends. The movement will be determined by the roll of the dice. The players may move in any direction but may not cross the same hexagon in the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several hexagons that will be marked including the starting position of each player.
