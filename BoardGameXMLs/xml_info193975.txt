			<description>This expansion pack introduces &amp;quot;bounties&amp;quot;. There are two ways to have a bounty placed on your head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firstly, when you fail an Adventure, instead of taking a Failure card, you may take an appropriate Bounty card. Taking a Bounty card this way means you avoid the immediate penalties of failure, which can be quite an advantage. Secondly, you may succeed at one of the several new Adventures included in the expansion, that while lucrative, are a little bit shady, and also &amp;quot;award&amp;quot; you with a Bounty card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in the expansion are Bounty Adventures. These are adventures that players may go on to claim bounties placed on other players heads -- to bring them to justice, if you will. Claiming a bounty rewards the player claiming it, and incurs a penalty on the player that had the bounty on them. If you get to the end of the game without a bounty on your head being claimed, you have succeeded in avoiding your dark past being unearthed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as a successful bounty hunter, you will add to your Legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
