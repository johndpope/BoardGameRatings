							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Arena</name>
									
			<description>Dungeon Arena is a frenetic dice-rolling arena battle for two to four players. Players construct a dungeon randomly from available tiles containing hidden bonuses, obstacles, and other features, and then select the class of their fighters. Each class receives a specific configuration of dice that contain some combination of movement, attacking, and turning that is unique to that class. Then, in real-time, players roll their dice as many times as they want to and &amp;quot;lock in&amp;quot; each of their desired dice and take the actions shown on the dice. After a time limit, whichever player has removed the most other players' pawns from the board while sacrificing the fewest of their own is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
