			<description>Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball is a baseball sports game (1983), designed by Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower and published by Mattel for the Intellivision Entertainment Computer System. IWSB was the first video game of any kind to use multiple camera angles, and the first sports game presented in a 3D (as opposed to two-dimensional) display. The title marked the beginning of the end of board game style single screen or scrolling playfield games. It was also the first statistics-based baseball simulation game on a video game console; all prior console baseball games were arcade-style recreations of the sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's full formal title (due to licensing requirements) was Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball. It was typically shortened to World Series Baseball in use to differentiate it from the prior Mattel baseball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although IWSB was the first sports game ever created that showed the action in 3D, the underlying mathematical models were not three-dimensional due to the very restricted available RAM on Intellivision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Replacing a fixed top-down camera with multiple field-level cameras also allowed the game to show fly balls for the first time in any baseball game, with a ball-sized shadow tracing the ball's path when it was off-screen above the field of view. All prior games showed only ground balls, since the baseball field was laid out to fit the TV screen, much like a pinball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Intellivision World Series Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
