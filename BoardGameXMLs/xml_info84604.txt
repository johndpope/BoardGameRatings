							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jewel Quest Mysteries: Curse of the Emerald Tear</name>
									
			<description>Jewel Quest Mysteries seamlessly combines a jewel-studded, hidden object game with a Match 3, mystery-solving adventure. Travel with Rupert and Emma to mystifying Egyptian locales, and take along an eye for hidden objects and your jewel-matching prowess. En route, collect coins and gems which can be exchanged for hints and added abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the land of King Tut's ancient secrets, Rupert and Emma hunt for the Emerald Tear, an olden Jewel Board rumored to have unexplainable power. Rupert and Emma are not alone in their search, and after a chance encounter with rival archaeologist, Philip Westing, Rupert falls into a sudden coma. With Rupert's jewel notes as her only guide, Emma delves into the history and haunts of Alexander the Great for clues that could save her husband. Emma soon learns of the Emerald Tear's inextricable ties to the rise and fall of the boy-king Tutankhamun. Can Emma trust the dubious characters who offer help? Familiar friends and foes emerge as the plot unravels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
