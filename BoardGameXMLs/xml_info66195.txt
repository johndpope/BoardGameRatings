The player that wins the toss begins the game. To pass the ball the player has to play a card with the number equal or higher than the number on the white lines. If a player plays the ball to a white circle he/she can play another card. Otherwise there is a duel between the two players.&lt;br/&gt;Duel:&lt;br/&gt;Each player has four cards (if a player doesn't have four cards, complete the cards, till you have four) Then both player place a card on the table, face down. When both players have chosen a crad, turn around the cards. The player with the highest number on the card, has ball control. That player can pass the ball along the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To score points, the player plays the number (or a higher number) indicated on the board in front of the goal.
