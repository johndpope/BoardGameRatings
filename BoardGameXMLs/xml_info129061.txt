							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">&#039;NAM 1965-1975</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VIETNAM: The longest and most controversial conflict in the US history. A war fought as much in the corridors of power of the White House as in the steaming jungles of South East Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can use your political and military skills to change the course of the war and rewrite history. As President of the United States you must balance military commitment against public opinion back home. Will you be a hawk or a dove?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This emotive war simulation has two main objectives: to prevent South Vietnam falling to Communist power, while at the same time walking the political tightrope to remain president of the United Sates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As invading Viet Cong guerillas fight to topple the South Vietnamese Government, you must air-mobilise units, set ambushes, even pull in your forces to protect Saigon - just some of the decisions you must take as commander-in-chief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-enact three of the war's major battles - the hard fought campaigns at Tet, Khe Sanh and the 1975 Offensive. In each incident the terrain dictates the mobility of your units and the outcome varies according to the constantly changing conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Nam is an extremely accurate strategic model of the Vietnam war and combines historical detail with playability to produce a highly entertaining simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
