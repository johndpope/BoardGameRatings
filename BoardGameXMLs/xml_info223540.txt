			<description>Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;Nine Beasts and Crusaders in Moosingal (Moosingal no 9 Hiki no Maju to Tennku no Kishidan) is a Japanese card game set in a mythical land, a place where the Makai and the local world meet Moosingal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There, nine animals were gathered as an Order, to recapture humans who won't grow old. But to protect the area from monsters, the Sky Knight appears in various places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Order joined the Moosingal, they heard a horrible legend. &amp;quot;Do not hunt the Dragon of the Five Heads, the Dragon of the Five Heads will attack as a zombie.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the battle, the cursed soldiers become monsters, and attack as zombies. Even while in the mercy of the humans turned demonic beasts, the Order must defeat them with the help of angelic humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jealousy and desire are the most horrible monsters swirling inside humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine Beasts and Crusaders in Moosingal is a trick-taking card-game in which players must co-operate to help defeat the monsters, but also try to compete for the highest final score. The cards have an Art Nouveau design to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
