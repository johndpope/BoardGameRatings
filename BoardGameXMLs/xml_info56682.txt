			<description>Orlando Edition - &amp;quot;The new World&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In May 1965, major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of Orlando in Osceola County. Rumors say that large investors will start to develop this large land area and that large themeparks and other commercial projects are planned. This will open for great opportunities by being part of the large expansion that now will follow. You and other investors establish your business in the area, build hotels, restaurants and create the necessary infrastructure. There are a lot of prioritizing and strategic decisions to be made and it will be an interesting and challenging mission to be number one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Resorts board game is played over a decided number years (10, 15 or 20) and can be played with the full rule set or with a more simplified rule set, appropiate for a family game with younger players. Every year a number of actions are allowed for each player decided by the roles chosen. Players buy vacant land from the government, build and expand on owned properties and connect them by building roads. The current economy affect the prices and yearly generated income. Commercial projects will be built every second year which creates benefits for nearby properties. The winner of the game is the player with the most incomepoints (IP) when the last year round is finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
