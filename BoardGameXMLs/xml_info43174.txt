			<description>Can you get players to guess an emotion just by using facial expressions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Trading Faces, players quickly swap Emotion Cards until one has three of a kind. Then, that player makes the expression on the matching cards, only using their face! Guess correctly to win points. Will you be happy or surprised with your guess?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 13 numbered sets of 3 cards each; each set is showing a feeling (happy, said, afraid, etc.). Each player starts with a number of cards and passes one of them on to the next player (simultaneously). All cards are picked up and a player who has a complete set calls &amp;quot;Stop&amp;quot;. Then he or she shows the feeling on the set (only with his or her face, no words or hands). The other players take turns guessing. The first player who guesses correctly gets one of the cards as a point; the player who showed the emotion gets the other two and draws a new card. Then the next card is passed on. Repeat until there are no more cards in the stack and a player has less than 3 hand cards. Whoever collected most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A completely different game is described for 2 - 4 players. It is a Memory variant in which cards are flipped over so only the next player can see it and has to show the emotion as above. As in the traditional memory, a player who can flip over two matching cards gets a point, whoever has most points in the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
