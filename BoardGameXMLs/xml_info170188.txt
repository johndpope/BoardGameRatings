							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blueprint For Imagination: Canned Food</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something doesn't seem quite right about Pinnacle Airlines Flight 121. Passengers aboard the &amp;quot;red eye&amp;quot; flight from Los Angeles to New York have complained of fatigue, headaches and dizziness following their flight. Officials have concluded that these symptoms are simply the result of jet lag and stress experienced by over worked business travelers. The strangest occurrence on the aircraft has to be the recent death of one passenger who decided to jump out of the aircraft without a parachute while at cruising altitude. However, the aircraft and crew have been cleared to resume normal operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is really going on aboard Flight 121?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canned Food is  a modern horror adventure and the first short adventure in the Blueprint For Imagination line. Canned Food uses the Passenger Jets floorplan from Fabled Environments. Blueprint For Imagination adventures are short modules designed to be played on their own in just a few hours with your local gaming group, at a game store or at a gaming convention.  We hope you enjoy this great adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
