							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dash Hounds Game</name>
									
			<description>Just like the game's name...these four adorable, &amp;quot;growable&amp;quot; hounds really &amp;quot;dash&amp;quot; to win the race.  The dogs are small at the start of the race...but as the race progresses they grow longer and longer.  Unlike other races - the dog whose TAIL crosses the finish line first wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin the spinner and move their dogs the appropriate number of spaces toward the finish line.  If the front legs of a dog should land on a colored space, the player whose dog matches that color must add a section to his dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
