							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lair of Amzuulan the Sphinx</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Egladhon is an ancient city of the Elves nestled deep within a well tended but sprawling forest. Most of the buildings in the city are constructed from living trees. These tree homes are the abodes of the Elves and the Elves alone. All other races must live on the ground in buildings of stone and salvaged wood from the few dead trees within the forest. Most of the non-Elf population are halflings who build their dwellings beneath the roots of the ancient and massive trees of the Elven city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Egladhon is governed by a consortium of wealthy Elven merchants, who are secretly backed by a sphinx named Amzuulan. The Elven merchant princes rule the city with a benign authoritarian air. They govern fairly but within strict accordance of the law. The Elven city manufactures delicate and rare magic items. These items are so expensive or powerful that the elves are extraordinarily discreet and discriminating in who they allow to purchase their wares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sphinx Amzuulan assists the merchants in the creation process but the exact means or methods is not known to anyone outside of the few merchant princes and their chief wizards. Amzuulan does not reside within the city but has a lair somewhere nearby in the forest. Sphinxs typically guard some powerful item or artifact and may be helping the Elves in accordance with its divine mission.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Side Quests pdfs provide GMs with interesting NPCs and locations to use with or against your player group. Side Quests can be interesting stops along the road or a one shot side quest if the full party isn't present for the evening of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of a Town including a tavern, meals and costs, patrons and some rumors, town goings on, any stores, brothels or other significant places of interest in town as well as a short adventure or dungeon crawl to fill a evening or two of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
