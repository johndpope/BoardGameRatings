							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mascha und der Bär: Chaos vor der Party</name>
									
			<description>Tidy up the room along with Masha. Before the guests turn up, each and every object must be in its own place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player is allowed to turn over one tile such that it is visible for all players. Once you have remembered your pictures, turn the tiles back face-down.&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player casts the die and performs the action. The die is then cast in a clock-wise direction. Each die has a different action.&lt;br/&gt;You all play together, so you are allowed to give each other tips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the objects are in their right places, face-up so that they can be seen, you have tidied up Masha&amp;rsquo;s room in time and, therefore, have won!&lt;br/&gt;Once Bear, Rabbit and Squirrel reach the front door, you are allowed to turn over all the tiles. If all the objects happen to be in their right places, you have still won. If, however, you haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to tidy up in time, sorry but you have lost this round and the only thing to do is play another round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
