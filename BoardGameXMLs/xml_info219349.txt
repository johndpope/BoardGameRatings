			<description>In Sheep Sheep, players are trying to collect the most sheep of a particular color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player has 1 minute and 30 seconds to exchange sheep from their own line of 4 with one from the 3x3 common area. Once time's up, they collect all the sheep in a row and/or column that have the same color in the common area and tuck them under their own personal goal sheep. They are then replaced with ones from the draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players tally up their score. Every sheep they've collected is worth 1 point but those that match their goal card are worth 2. Whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
