							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salus</name>
									
			<description>Salus is the Latin word for &amp;quot;well-being&amp;quot;. The game consists of 26 pairs of cards, giving a total of 52 cards. Each pair shows an everyday scene which could cause an accident. One card of the pairs shows the wrong behavior in red, the other marks the corrected situation in blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 7 cards and tries to collect as many pairs as possible. The player who ends the game by emptying his hand first gets a bonus and all card remaining in the hands of the other players give minus points. Winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, a player can choose to take a card from the stock or from the discard pile if he has a matching pair to one of the cards in the pile. But in case he chooses the latter, he must take all cards lying on top of the matching card. This small rule gives a real twist to that else wise simple card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
