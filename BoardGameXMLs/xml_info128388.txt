			<description>Librium is a unique game for two or more people from ages 14 to 100!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a method of placing &amp;lsquo;construction&amp;rsquo; cards on to a pivotable base that is either mounted on a tripod, a magnetic base or hung from a &amp;lsquo;hanger wire&amp;rsquo; as in the 'Pro2&amp;rsquo; version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to add the cards to each other in turn without collapsing the structure. No two games are the same and many large structures can be achieved with strategy, nerve and balance, but... the game will ultimately end in chaos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four models are available:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Family game with attitude!&lt;br/&gt;LIBRIUM Lite+&lt;br/&gt;For those wanting the challenge of a 30 card game where stability allows for more complex structures... This is the game for you!&lt;br/&gt;Start easy with the Fulcrum card clamped, then when you think you have mastered the dark art of LIBRIUM, unclamp the Fulcrum card and allow it to turn.&lt;br/&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not all...!&lt;br/&gt;Try tilting the Fulcrum card when it can turn freely and &amp;lsquo;hey-presto&amp;rsquo;, another level of &amp;lsquo;Balance &amp;amp; Chaos&amp;rsquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    30 building cards&lt;br/&gt;    LIBRIUM Tripod (with extendable legs)&lt;br/&gt;    Fulcrum card&lt;br/&gt;    Top Ten Tip card&lt;br/&gt;    Card Storage Box&lt;br/&gt;    Instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party the night away with&lt;br/&gt;LIBRIUM Lite+M... The Pocket Pack of laughter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just when your friends thought they were going to have to endure another boring night out talking about old times, you slap the pocket sized Lite+ game down on the table and challenge the lot of them!&lt;br/&gt;(It&amp;rsquo;s hoped by now you have had at least a small bit of practice before you show them the art of LIBRIUM!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are not advocating that you should use the Lite+M as a drinking game, but... The Mag Mount does look particularly magnificent attached to the top of a beer or other drinks bottle!&lt;br/&gt;(For a more sedate game or when younger players are present...use a bean tin!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    LIBRIUM Mag Mount&lt;br/&gt;    Fulcrum card&lt;br/&gt;    20 classic LIBRIUM cards&lt;br/&gt;    Top Ten Tip card&lt;br/&gt;    Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Serious Competitor or Closet Balance &amp;amp; Chaos Junkie!&lt;br/&gt;Librium Pro2...&lt;br/&gt;Just when you thought pub games were getting boring, and the thought of another game of block balancing was becoming too tedious for words, someone somewhere will be getting all the laughs, spills, thrills, balance &amp;amp; chaos having embarked on the dark art of LIBRIUM Pro2!&lt;br/&gt;After a small amount of assembly you will begin to see how addictive this game version can be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virtually unbreakable supplied Pro Clamp has a jaw of 50mm allowing easy fixture to tables, chairs, bars or any other stable structure. The clamp post can also be angled to make the game more central on a table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Varying degrees of difficulty can be factored into the game with only slight adjustments as detailed in the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;We already have a World Champion... Maybe you will be next!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pack Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    30 Classic LIBRIUM cards&lt;br/&gt;    Fulcrum card&lt;br/&gt;    Suspension Rod with Tilt Pivot &amp;amp; Hanger Ring&lt;br/&gt;    Free Turn Connector&lt;br/&gt;    Pro2 Clamp&lt;br/&gt;    2 Part Hanger Wire Ass&amp;rsquo;y&lt;br/&gt;    Top Ten Tip Card&lt;br/&gt;    Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treat yourself to a... &lt;br/&gt;Tin &amp;lsquo;O&amp;rsquo; LIBRIUM!&lt;br/&gt;Guaranteed calorie free, in fact you will probably burn calories playing it!&lt;br/&gt;The classic LIBRIUM cards offer a rich and meaningful form of entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;The cards are a good source of moral fibre, low in fat (they are very thin), and are great as part of a balanced everyday helping of laughter! &lt;br/&gt;Each Tin &amp;lsquo;O&amp;rsquo; LIBRIUM comes packed with goodness including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    LIBRIUM Mag Mount&lt;br/&gt;    20 classic LIBRIUM cards&lt;br/&gt;    1 Fulcrum card&lt;br/&gt;    1 Top Ten Tip Card&lt;br/&gt;    Instructions&lt;br/&gt;    Storage Tin/Base&lt;br/&gt;    Sealing cap&lt;br/&gt;    Pop-able piece of bubble wrap to annoy people with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
