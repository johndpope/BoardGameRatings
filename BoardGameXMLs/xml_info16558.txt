			<description>This is a simple track game based on the classic children's story. The gameboard depicts Mr. McGregor's garden. Vegetable chips are mixed and placed near the board (number side down), and the Mr. McGregor pawn is placed on a random garden space. On your turn you turn over a Vegetable chip and advance your Peter Rabbit pawn along the garden path the number of spaces shown on the bottom of the chip. If you land on a &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; space, you lose your next turn. If you land on the Mr. McGregor pawn, you move backwards to the nearest &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; space. After you move, you place the Mr. McGregor piece on any &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; space (hoping to block an opponent). Vegetable chips are removed as they are used so it's possible to deduce which move numbers remain. The first player to make it through the garden and reach THE END wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
