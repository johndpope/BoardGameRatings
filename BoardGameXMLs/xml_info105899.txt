			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Mac Steele, a seasoned archaeologist, adventurer and treasure hunter. Your latest acquisition: a pre-Columbian artefact from Central America that is surrounded by legend and intrigue. Delving into the secrets of the artefact, you discover to your surprise that it may somehow relate to an even more valuable and coveted artefact: the Mask of the Sun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly tragedy strikes. While probing a small crevice in the artefact, a pale green gas escapes and sends you reeling into unconsciousness.
