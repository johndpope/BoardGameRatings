			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Meets New&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the southernmost city in the world, thousands of people come and brave the unforgiving weather to watch the World&amp;rsquo;s Edge Arena, a televised bloodsport for the modern era. Thanks to the Arena&amp;rsquo;s success, the once-quiet town of Punta Arenas is now an industrious boomtown where warriors compete for prize money, entrepreneurs compete for a share of the tourism, and locals compete for the scraps of what&amp;rsquo;s left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you come seeking fame and fortune at the risk of finding an early grave, or are you an old-timer who wants to see the city returned to its old ways? Whether you&amp;rsquo;re here to compete or you&amp;rsquo;re just trying to eke out a living in this rapidly changing city, one thing&amp;rsquo;s for certain: your life will never be the same thanks to the World&amp;rsquo;s Edge Arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed look at the city of Punta Arenas, Chile, in the year 2096. A look at its interesting places, people, night life, and other features which make the city a prime place to set a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;    Guidelines for running an Arena tournament using Psi-punk. Characters battle in ever-shifting terrain against all manner of beasts and warriors.&lt;br/&gt;    A new &amp;ldquo;Fan Favor&amp;rdquo; mechanic for players to earn bonuses by wooing crowds and earning fan loyalty.&lt;br/&gt;    New statblocks for over two dozen opponents, including psychically-controlled, cybernetically enhanced beasts such as kodiak bears and komodo dragons. Plenty of human opponents for use in any Psi-punk game.&lt;br/&gt;    Sample background hooks for new character archetypes such as the Beast Trainer, Controller, Promoter, Street Rat, and Security guard.&lt;br/&gt;    6 new adventure seeds set in and around the city of Punta Arenas. Inspiration for Game Masters who&amp;rsquo;d like to craft non-combat encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
