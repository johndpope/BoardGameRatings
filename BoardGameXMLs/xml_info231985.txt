							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alwin - Captain of the Guard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruzyk was laughing. Commander of Baron Ranulf&amp;rsquo;s guards, Ruzyk was almost always laughing, or at least smiling. It was one of the things Alwin loved best about his friend and mentor. They were jouncing along on top of a wagon under the bright midday sun, within sight of the next small town on their way to Narwick. &amp;ldquo;Always have the back of your comrades, and trust them to have yours. Cherish your friends. And if your friends happen to be your comrades, so much the better!&amp;rdquo; Then there was an ugly black arrow sticking out of Ruzyk&amp;rsquo;s throat, and he was falling backward off the wagon toward the hard roadway below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alwin.  From lowly guard, to commander, to Captain of the King's Guard.  A good man to know, whether you're an adventurer or a citizen in trouble.  He throws himself into becoming the best Captain he can be.  History, law, or swordplay, he gives it his all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wouldn't you want Alwin standing by your side?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with the 5th edition of the world's most popular role playing game.  Easily works with other games as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
