			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;MONSTERS OF MYTH FOR THE LANDS OF LEGEND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Warriors game contains many extraordinary and terrifying monsters drawn from folklore, superstition, the mythology of Europe&amp;rsquo;s past, classic fantasy, and the imaginations of authors Dave Morris and Oliver Johnson. Now for the first time all the non-human races and beasts of the world of Legend are gathered under one cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans think they rule the Lands of Legend, but they do not. Even the most powerful live in terror of the things that lurk in the shadows, or prowl the wild country, or creep into the depths of a guilty man&amp;rsquo;s dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spirits of long-dead kings and chieftains guard their ancient barrows, or lie waiting under the soil for the call to protect their homeland once again. An Eaves Phantom can torment a family for generations. Sailors live in terror of the Blue Men whose rotted longships rise from the deep to issue fearsome challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stranger still are the automata, created by the scholars of ancient empires, who may reveal lost secrets for an awful price; or the Obsidiak, a human head carved from granite, with tentacles for a neck; or the malicious creatures of the faerie: goblins, caitshee, spriggan and many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the less said about the Jumbees, the Hellrots or the terrifying Grey Hood, the better. In the Lands of Legend, being eaten alive is often the least of an adventurer&amp;rsquo;s fears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Warriors Bestiary contains full descriptions and game-information for more than 120 of the races and species that inhabit the Lands of Legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is divided into seven sections including the man-like races, the monsters of folklore, the supernatural, strange beings created or summoned by sorcery, the inhabitants of the Abyss, and the undead in all their ghastly forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be warned that the creatures of the Lands of Legend are not what you expect. The Dragon Warriors Bestiary takes classic monsters back to their roots in mythology and superstition, puts a new spin on well-worn fantasy archetypes, and introduces new races and species that will challenge and threaten your players. The rich background and atmosphere in the descriptions is perfect for building exciting adventures and rich, evocative campaign-settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also contains information on creatures&amp;rsquo; habitats and treasure, random encounter tables for different environments, and great artwork from Jon Hodgson, Scott Purdy and Erik Wilson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
