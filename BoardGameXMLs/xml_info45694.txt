							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secret Societies of Barsaive</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OF SECRETS AND SILENCE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They work in the shadows, behind the scenes of everyday life. They may be the village blacksmith, the rug merchant down the street, or the simple old woman next door. They are members of Barsaive's secret societies, clandestine groups of every description whose anonymity is their safeguard and their strength. Unseen and unsuspected by most ordinary folk, they pick at the threads that hold the tapestry of Barsaive together. There are the Keys of Death, silent killers who spill their victims' blood on the ground in hopes of freeing Death from imprisonment beneath Death's Sea; cultists of the Horror Verjigorm, who aid their dread master in his quest to destroy all dragons; and many more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secret Societies of Barsaive sourcebook describes fourteen of the most significant secret groups operating in Barsaive, including their goals, plans and potential roles in the coming conflict between the Kingdom of Throal and the Theran Empire. Secret Societies of Barsaive will add intrigue and excitement to any Earthdawn campaign; these cults, spy networks and other secret groups can serve as antagonists, allies, movers behind the scenes and sources of adventure hooks galore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
