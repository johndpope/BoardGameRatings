			<description>From the appstore description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MEMORIES: &amp;ldquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll have a &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo; please Bob &amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;You grew up watching Bob Holness on ITV and BBC grilling contestants and playing the Gold Run and now it is your chance! We have made every effort to replicate the look and feel of the original show&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This app includes Bob Holness, the original music and game sounds, original question content and the original title sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blockbusters was a highly popular British TV show (though originally based on an American format) hosted by Bob Holness. Students, one single and one team of two, would compete to answer questions to fill in hexagons on a grid. Each hexagon was filled with a letter, and the answer to the question started with that letter. If a team answered a question correctly it would turn their colour (white or blue) and they could then choose the next location on the grid, leading to the famous catchphrase &amp;quot;Can I have a 'P' please, Bob?&amp;quot; (having a Pee is British slang for urinating).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is for the single student (playing white) to connect from top to bottom, a minimum of four spaces, and for the pair of students to connect from left to right, a minimum of five spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning would allow the team to progress to the Gold Run, where a single student (the pair would alternate if they won multiple times) would attempt to cross a more complicated version of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version recreates the TV show in its entirety, including the music, title-sequence and sound effects. It even lets the player choose a mascot for their desk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played single-player against a computer opponent, or two-player as pass-and-play, using Bluetooth, or over the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing two-player, the board is switched to a 5 by 5 grid, to take account of the fact that the blue team does not have the same advantage as on the TV show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional question packs are available as in-app purchases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
