			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astonishing Worlds is a systemless setting designed to be used with tabletop RPGs capable of handling a retro-style space opera. This work is inspired by the science fiction of yesteryear when good and evil were clear and Pluto was still a planet. Astonishing Worlds is a nod to the retro science fiction found in comic books and television from the 1950s and 1960s. Imagine an alternate reality in which the fantasies of this era of speculative fiction were real, and the only limit was human imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    28 outlined worlds spread out over four solar systems.&lt;br/&gt;    12 Character Archetypes to spark the imagination.&lt;br/&gt;    Guidelines on the three types of races: Humans, Near-Humans, and Beastmen.&lt;br/&gt;    5 Terrifying villains known as the Galactic Lords, each with their own sinister empire.&lt;br/&gt;    A planet, alien, and adventure generator. &lt;br/&gt;    And much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
