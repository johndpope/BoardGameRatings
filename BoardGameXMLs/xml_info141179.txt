			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A computer opponent that allows you to play Monopoly against your TRS-80. A copy of the Milton Bradley board game is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unusual feature of this software is that it was &amp;quot;backup limited&amp;quot; (a fact announced by a sticker on the ziplock), allowing only one backup copy of the disk to be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recent interview with MONTY revealed some important points you will want to know before accepting his challenge to a game of MONOPOLY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: MONTY, is your game played according to the official rules?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M: Yes, I adhere strictly to the official rules. The only exception I allow is the option to put money on FREE PARKING, which I know is a popular &amp;quot;house rule.&amp;quot; If we will be using this option, please have the banker tell me the amount that will be awarded each time a player lands on the FREE PARKING space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: Are Auctions a part of your play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M: This is one rule which is unfamiliar to most people. When someone lands on a property and chooses not to buy it, the property must immediately be put up for auction. I'll begin bidding automatically if I'm the one who has chosen not to buy. Everyone can bid on the property, and the banker should tell me, in response to my request for a Counterbid, the amount of the highest bid from the other players. And, if I outbid everyone else, just enter a Counterbid of $0 (zero) to complete the transaction. In addition, when a player goes bankrupt, and the debt is to the bank, that person's mortgaged properties are immediately auctioned off as if they are free and clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
