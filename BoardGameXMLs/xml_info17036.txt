							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Picture This Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the obscure Summer 1963 game show, players are divided into teams of two. When it is a team's turn to play, one player is designated the &amp;quot;instructor&amp;quot; and another member is designated the &amp;quot;artist&amp;quot;. The instructor chooses a game card not seen by the artist. The instructor has sixty seconds to describe to the artist how to draw the object on the card in terms not related to the object. The artist has to guess what the object is to score. Players play a predetermined number of rounds and the team with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture This is the only home game based off a series that aired only as a Summer replacement. The copyright date appears nowhere on the box, but we assume it was released to coincide with the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
