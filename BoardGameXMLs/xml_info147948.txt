							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ancient Temple Interior</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full color floorplan 48 x 20 inch, of an Ancient Temple Interior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Card version contains twelve, double-sided card tiles. Each over-sized tile is 8&amp;rdquo;x10&amp;rdquo; and printed on sturdy 12 point card stock. The UV coating on the tiles keeps them spill resistant, lets you peel transparent tape on and off them without damaging the tile, and allows you to mark the tiles with dry wipe markers then wipe them clean. As you can see in the images below, the card version has the square grid overlay on one side and the hex grid overlay on the other side. We recommend getting the Zip File combo as well (or at least download the PDF Preview) so you can see how the tiles all lay out. The full layout map is not included with the printed card pages to reduce their cost to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ancient Temple Interior is an expansion to our Ancient Temple product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A secret door leads to the interior of the ancient temple from outside. From the secret door, descending the eastern staircase leads to a surprisingly well-lit area underground. Light from torches in sconces illuminates the floor below. Debris and skeletons lying on the ground serve as warnings to cease your journey now. Ancient statues look into the room from the corners, their eyes warning you to go now, for they will bear witness to your trespass and threaten to do something about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient temple leads to many different adventures. Perhaps the Player Characters are captured investigating outside the temple and are brought in as a sacrifice to the gods. They have to escape their bonds during the ritual and fight their way out of temple to freedom. &lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters could also find the secret door leading below and have to fight off temple cultists and traps. They could also have to thwart an attempted sacrifice of other people captured outside and help them escape by defeating the high priest. After fighting off the high priest, his cultists, and his traps, they could find a great treasure and procure it. But what if the treasure is trapped? Or what if the angry god of the temple curses the treasure as punishment for killing his high priest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
