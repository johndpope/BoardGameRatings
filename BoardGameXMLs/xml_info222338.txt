							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Midnight Legion: The World Reborn</name>
									
			<description>Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Midnight Legion is a highly advanced, color illustrated gamebook trilogy in the style of the classic Choose Your Own Adventure series, but with MUCH more control over your character and world&amp;mdash;think of an advanced version of SORCERY or LONE WOLF, with deeper character generation. An interactive story is combined with combat, strategy, puzzles, diplomacy, stealth and role playing elements. Collect information, knowledge, and goods from the world around you to advance your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-player Version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this variation, one player reads the entries like a game master to another player who experiences the world of Midnight Legion. All the rolls for the encounters are handled by the reader and the player handles all of his or her character's dice rolls. This is also a good way for the game master player to introduce the game to someone who doesn't know all the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must choose whether to complete your objectives using combat, stealth or sixth sense and diplomacy. You can solve the puzzles that unlock the base&amp;rsquo;s secrets using logic, or you can try to recover your lost memories for clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever you decide, your actions change the world around you and determine the encounters you face next. Every game you play will be different &amp;ndash; and you will need all of your skills to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme of The World Reborn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than four centuries have passed since the Devastation engulfed the Earth. The species that remained were fused and reborn in the alchemy of atomic fire. Now their diverse descendants have claimed the planet. You are an agent of the Midnight Legion, tasked with preserving life and rebuilding civilization. Only one other agent remains, and she is somewhere ahead of you, racing for your last remaining base. Unless you can reach it before she does, she will seize the command center and use its ancient weapons to unleash a second Devastation. This time, if she succeeds, nothing will survive. Your chase will lead you to new creatures, lost technologies and possibly even the clues your adversary leaves behind. But beware&amp;mdash;there are no established paths across this constantly shifting land, and nothing is what it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
