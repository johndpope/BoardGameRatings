			<description>This is a list of another 100 items that may be found in a survivalist's retreat, whether this be an extensive construction out in the wilds or a simple bunker or room in an urban setting. Although there are 100 items on the list, many of these can then be split into further items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivalists don't just have guns; they also have other things needed to survive, such as food, supplies, hunting equipment, tools and power sources. These can be useful for any players in any post-apocalyptic setting, whether this be a zombie apocalypse or a traditional nuclear war. they aren't solely of use in those settings either, as they could also be used if the players are investigating or infiltrating a survivalist or survivalist organisation before the end of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;80. Solar Lights (Probably for external use)&lt;br/&gt;81. Spikes (For fixing ropes and cords to)&lt;br/&gt;82. Spinning Wheel (For making yarn from pet and animal hair)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
