							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chronicle of the Lesser Clans</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to play the lord of  akingdom, but really didn't want to have to keep track of every last farmer, man-at-arms and cow in your territory? This supplement features a fast and versatile system for running your own faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following a &amp;quot;kingdom-as-character&amp;quot; model, you create your clan, tribe or nation at character generatin or at any other point in the campaign. From there your faction becomes a sort of mission generator for your PCs. The noble deeds or epic failures of your characters have a direct bearing on the prosperity or doom of the clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for David Black's The Black Hack, and the Kaigaku setting specifically, this system is easy to port over to other OSR rule sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are three brand new lesser clans for Kaigaku. Each one teaches a powerful new school. Will you be a daredevil bisento-wielding Ginjisa warrior who carves through cavalry like a hot knife through butter? A serene Inari archer who can imbue her arroews with dazzling effects? A noble Tsuma martial artist with thunder-powered kama blades who stands up for the downtrodden? It's all up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
