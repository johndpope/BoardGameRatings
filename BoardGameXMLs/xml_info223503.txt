							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Air Combat: B-25J</name>
									
			<description>Table Air Combat is a fast, simple air combat game that can be played on any flat surface.  All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  Everything else can be printed from this ruleset. &lt;br/&gt;Each player has a flight of four fighters, represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &amp;ldquo;performance rulers&amp;rdquo; that represent the aircraft&amp;rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed.&lt;br/&gt;Each performance ruler is unique to each aircraft, and contains all the speed, cornering, and weapon information needed.&lt;br/&gt;TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set is a self-contained rulebook that includes miniatures for the B-25 and contains three scenarios that reference other aircraft:&lt;br/&gt;Railyard: Bomb the flak-defended railroad marshaling yards at Littoria, Italy.&lt;br/&gt;Dolittle Raid: Bolster American morale with a daring strike against Tokyo.  Ki-43 fighters defend.&lt;br/&gt;Bridge over River Po:  Cut supply lines by destroying the rail bridge into Piacenza, Italy. The bridge is defended by Bf-109G of the German Luftwaffe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
