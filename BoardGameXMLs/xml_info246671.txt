							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lines of Battle: Game of Napoleonic Tactics</name>
									
			<description>The battle lines have been drawn!  Lines of Battle is a simple yet clever Napoleonic game system that allows tactical situations to be played out with a minimum of rules in a short amount of time.  It's all here: Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery but also a challenging system of command/control that adds a chess like feel to an otherwise straightforward wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of your three leaders projects a horizontal, vertical and diagonal line of command.  The length of this line depends on a leader's rank. &lt;br/&gt; A simple and concise chit pull system determines initiative while a bare bones D6 combat system moves battles along quickly and decisively across a 13 x 13 square battle grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous ways to win include: Capturing your opponents objectives, eliminating leaders or simply inflicting more casualties than you receive.  Includes 6 scenarios or you may build your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a free print n play game, our way of saying thanks to a wargaming community that is both friendly and helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
