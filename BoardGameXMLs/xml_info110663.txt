			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;A Game of Steampunk Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass &amp;amp; Steel is a hybrid paper and pencil RPG, which blends elements of tabletop and LARP play, and can be used exclusively for either style of gaming, as a given group chooses. The game is set in a version of our own Earth where technology works a bit strangely, and where certain paranormal powers operate as well. Arcanists command elemental forces through willpower and dangerous chemical concoctions, while airships cruise the skies powered by ferociously energetic Hotaether and held aloft by the power of Slack (another technological marvel!) and lucid dreamers explore the mysteries of the dream realms, where they can pluck secrets from the shadows of other's daydreams and imaginations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game world itself features a tense geopolitical tussle between two major power blocks, as well as the final and most dangerous phases of European imperialism. Player characters can adventure in the capitals of the great powers, or in cities at the edges of empire, where powers clash and intrigue is never more than a whispered conversation or stolen secret away. Our initial focus is on the city of Constantinople, where the two great alliances jostle for position, and Greeks and Turks alike harbor ambitions and resentments. Also, there are attractive people in goggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
