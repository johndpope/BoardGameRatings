			<description>Beatmania IIDX11: IIDXRED (with RED standing for &amp;quot;Revolutionary Energetic Diversification&amp;quot;) is the 11th game in the beatmania IIDX series of music video games. The game features many new songs, some of which are unlocked over Konami's e-Amusement platform. As suggested by the title, IIDXRED's color scheme is red and black, and was one of the first versions to not use the word &amp;quot;style&amp;quot; to denote its version and have a legitimate theme (a pattern that would continue on later versions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core gameplay remains the same on IIDX RED. A new rating, a flashing 8 was added to the difficulty scale. The unused side of the screen during single player play is now used to house a score graph, containing a real-time comparison of the current player against the high scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIDX RED was the first version of IIDX to require the network for unlocking songs. Unfortunately, this move is seen as an issue for importers of IIDX machines as e-Amusement is not available outside of Japan. e-Amusement can also pull score for a player on a song onto the score graph over the network. Users with e-Amusement cards will also now receive notifications if they beat their personal best score. Using a special e-Amusement card shipped with the home version of Beatmania IIDX 8th Style unlocks 3 extra songs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player AA's 3 songs on Another mode with Hard enabled, the player will access the Extra Stage, 'GENOCIDE by dj Killer. If the extra stage is beaten, the player is sent to One More Extra Stage, ピアノ協奏曲第1番&amp;quot;蠍火&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Piano Concertino No. 1 Scorpion Fire&amp;quot;, although some translations including the LED marquee's translations reference the name of the song as Anti-Ares, a reference to the star Antares, also known as Scorpii, and its red flame in the sky - the origin of the translation and more commonly used name &amp;quot;Scorpion Fire&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayStation 2 version of IIDX RED contains all the new songs, plus a selection of new songs and revivals from other mixes. The game also features 2 songs from the US Beatmania game (Toxic and You Really Got Me) with new Another charts. One of the revivals, Gambol, received an Another chart, although it is rated an 8 - it is exactly the same as the Light7 and 7KEYS charts, with the only differences between the difficulty levels being increasingly strict timing windows, with Another containing very strict timing windows. It is considered to be a tribute to previous issues with the song's timing windows in previous versions (Gambol's problems were however fixed on Beatmania IIDX 12: Happy Sky).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Beatmania IIDX 11: IIDX RED&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
