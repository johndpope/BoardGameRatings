							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sessair</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sessair are the most battle-crazed of all the Tribes of the Earth Goddess. They are renowned for their eagerness to go to war - even without provocation - simply because they like to fight. However, they are not generally interested in conquest or rulership of other tribes for they value freedom above all else and barely tolerate the ambitions of their own Kings, let alone those of any hypothetical High King. Thus it is rare to find them pressing their advantage - they could probably conquer the whole of Tir Nan Og if they could be motivated to do so, but are likely to stop for a feast as soon as they have plundered a barrel of ale or cauldron of mead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sessair are also known as the Tribe that Stands Up, for their constant willingness to &amp;lsquo;stand up and be counted&amp;rsquo;. Whenever there are heroic deeds to be done or brave adventures to be had, you can be sure that the Sessair will be first to get involved. Whenever there is tyranny and oppression in the land, it is the Sessair who will rise up and fight it off. Even exiled Sessair retain an incredible pride in their tribal background, and are rarely quiet or unassuming. This pride in their own strength leads a great many Sessair to an early death when they attack more powerful foes, but those who survive begin to live up to their own self-images and truly become the mighty heroes the Sessair are famed for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most famous member of the Sessair tribe is Slaine mac Roth himself, the warped warrior, favoured of the Goddess, said to be the only mortal to have defied the Lord Weird Slough Feg and escaped with his life. Slaine is headstrong and violent, combining the most extreme features of the Sessair people and the warped one race in a battle-crazed oneman- army of a warrior. Full details on Slaine at various stages in his life can be found in the Folk of the Sessair chapter, which also includes game information for most of his comrades among the Sessair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tribe Books&lt;br/&gt;This is the second in Mongoose Publishing&amp;rsquo;s series of Tribe books for the Slaine RPG. Each Tribe book takes an in-depth look at one of the tribes in Slaine&amp;rsquo;s world of Tir Nan Og, covering their history and traditions, battle tactics and unique magic, as well as the most interesting personalities from each tribe. The Tribe books are invaluable both for any players considering playing a character from the tribe, and for Games Masters looking to expand the background information available for Non-Player Characters. Games Masters are also well served by the scenario hooks provided for every one of the tribe&amp;rsquo;s personalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
