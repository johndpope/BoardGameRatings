							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Period Prices and Extra Details</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prices of all items in the &amp;quot;T. F. Arkington's Lifestyle Emporium&amp;quot; chapter of Secrets of the Surface World were adjusted to take game balance into account. Additionally, some information had to be cut due to necessity, and other numbers, such as Speeds, were rounded for ease of use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Web Enhancement provides the actual period prices for use by any GMs interested more in historical authenticity, as well as extra details and information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that prices are not provided for the large multitude of military weapons and vehicles in the supplement as such weapons and vehicles are not for sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
