			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Repopulation is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. The action takes place on the planet Rhyldan, with the only known remaining human population fighting for their very existence. The indigenous life forms did not meet their colonization efforts with open arms. Worse yet, humans have managed to splinter themselves into warring factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a sandbox oriented MMORPG with an eye on innovation. Rather than forcing players down preset paths they are instead allowed to walk the path which they enjoy the most. With a variety of combat oriented and non-combat activities to pursue, we believe we&amp;rsquo;ve created a game that can stand the test of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     No Levels&lt;br/&gt;     Skills based gameplay which features 75 unique skills, and 14 tiers within each skill line.&lt;br/&gt;     Players are not forced into combat roles. Crafting, harvesting, diplomatic or other non-combat oriented skills can operate and progress independently of combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Skills increase automatically through use. Abilities are earned and not given automatically.&lt;br/&gt;     Fitting system allows players to customize their appearance and stats to their playstyle.&lt;br/&gt;     Player created city system allows players to form and design their own cities, structures and homes.&lt;br/&gt;     Settlements can turn into dungeons and towns can be overrun. Allowing this to happen can seriously alter the content available in an area.&lt;br/&gt;     An Advanced Generated Mission system allows us to create complex multi-stage missions which are tailored specifically for your character.&lt;br/&gt;     Missions can have branching outcomes based on a player&amp;rsquo;s actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
