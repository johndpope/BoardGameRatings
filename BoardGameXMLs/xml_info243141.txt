							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Axis Balkan Campaign</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early in the Second World War the Germany decided to bail out its Italian ally that was embroiled in a failed war against Greece. As an additional benefit securing Greece would protect the southern border of the Greater German Empire. Yugoslavia backed out of its agreement forcing Germany to subdue Yugoslavia on its way to Greece. Thus began the Balkans Campaign of 1941.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of the Germans and their allies in against the Yugoslavians, Greeks and the British Commonwealth. The player must take all of Yugoslavia and Greece to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created by Joni Nuutinen as part of the Conflict-Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
