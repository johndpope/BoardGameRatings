			<description>From Kickstarter Web Site&lt;br/&gt;Monster Crabs is a card game.  It combines war with rock, paper, scissors.  First you deal all the cards out.  There will be 16 different crabs in three different elements.  Each player says offense or defense and then flips up the card after they said offense or defense at the same time.  The person whose card has the highest value wins that round and gets the cards.  If it is a tie, you see if it's air, fire or water type.  Air beats water, water beats fire, and fire beats air.  Those are the basic rules.  A full rule set will be included in each box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
