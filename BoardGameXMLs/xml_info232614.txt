							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warfare: A New Game</name>
									
			<description>Very little has been found about this game. Looks to be produced around 1900.  The picture on the cover shows British Colonial troops on the attack but they could be in South Africa, Afghanistan, or some other part of the empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map leads me to believe the game is a representation of the Boer War.  It has two different sides, one of which appears to contain a British camp.  The other side has a town that appears to be more European and trenches manned by combatants that look to be Boer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
