							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conquering Hollywood</name>
									
			<description>Conquering Hollywood is the first board game about what it is really like to be in California making your dream of success in the movie business a reality. It's also the first game with &amp;quot;Personality Power,&amp;quot; a way to compete with other players outside of the game itself ... that counts in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of Conquering Hollywood is based on &amp;quot;Personality Power.&amp;quot; That means everything you say and everything you do counts in the game. Even things you say and do &amp;quot;outside the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquering Hollywood is a cutthroat look at the true ways and means of Tinseltown. Actors! Producers! Directors! Writers! Just a Nobody? Get a car and pick up a screenplay. Compete with other players to make hit movies. Whether you're a nobody or a player, everyone in Tinseltown wants to be King of Hollywood!  But there is only one King and his joy lasts only 15 minutes after an intense, hand-to-hand battle. To succeed at the game of Conquering Hollywood, you have to compete with the same people who used to be your friends. You have to compete all the time without losing concentration for a second. Compete for what? For possession of the things you need to make hit movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To &amp;quot;make it&amp;quot; in the movie biz in this game you need the following items: story, game, money, talent, style, vision, fight, grind, luck, call, wires, and looks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
