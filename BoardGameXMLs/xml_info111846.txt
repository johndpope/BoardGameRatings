			<description>Viva la ResistANTS! is an abstract boardgame. Main game mechanics includes area controll, set collection and 'press your luck'. It combines American and European styles of boardgaming design. The game has a unique setting. The forces of Resistance of Ants led by the mysterious Serg Ant try to help the civilians survive under the occupation of enemy forces, who perfidiously attacked the peaceful republic of ants. Now you must fight for your freedom. Let's say together: Viva la ResistANTS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a detachment of 10 ants. Each turn the player can send 2 of them to the field to participate in a special mission or withdraw 1-3 of them. At the start of the game the playfield is generated randomly. If 1 or more ants get status missing in action, players should shuffle the tiles of the playfield and generate it randomly again. Other ants return to players. The ants get status missing in action if a card from alert deck with the appropriate colour is revealed for the second time. One card from alert deck is revealed every time each player takes a turn. If the same colour is revealed for the third time the alert deck must be shuffled. If it must be shuffled for the second time, the game is over. The player who gets more victory points becomes a winner. In case of a tie, the winner is the player who retained more ants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
