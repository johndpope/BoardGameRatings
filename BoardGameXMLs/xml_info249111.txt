							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Restaurant Detective</name>
									
			<description>Restaurant Detectives is a party game that allows each player to act as the detective.  During the game, each detective investigates in the restaurant and gathers evidence.  Their goal is to find out who is the Food Thief, the one who sneaked our Guest's food, and meanwhile acts in the guise of a detective but actually protecting himself from being caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into three phases: Investigation Phase, Hints Phase and Catch Phase.  In Investigation Phase, players find useful information from the Food pool.  After that, the Guest will try to give hints to all players in the Hints Phase.  Finally, each player has one single chance to catch the Food Thief in the Catch Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guest should help the Detectives by giving correct hints of the Target Food /Key Clue through Hints Cards. He is NOT allowed to give any tips with other ways such as speaking/gesture/facial expressions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detectives can discuss with each others and cooperate to win.  However, not everyone is telling the truth with someone who is the Food Thief!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
