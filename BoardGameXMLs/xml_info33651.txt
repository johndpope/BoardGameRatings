			<description>Another light game from Asko K&amp;uuml;nnap &amp;amp; Priit Isok. The title roughly translates as: &amp;quot;The winner is the one who has the most stuff when he/she dies.&amp;quot; With a subtitle &amp;quot;Another absolutely useless item: a boardgame about owning!&amp;quot; In the game players madly run in a circle - like rats in a wheel - collecting useless luxurious items until the grim reaper stops the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game each player has five items (cards). Items come in 6 colors with value from 1-5. A player's turn is a three-step affair:&lt;br/&gt;1) Throw a die and move your pawn forward (clockwise in a circle). When you throw 1, the reaper also moves forward.&lt;br/&gt;2) Do the action indicated by the space where your pawn landed. Most of the spaces are malls where you collect additional items but some spaces, like robber and recycling, take cards away. &lt;br/&gt;3) Gift an item to another player. You can gift only an item that matches the color of an item that an opponent already has and is of higher value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the reaper makes a full circle of eight steps. All players total the value of their cards and the player with the smallest total wins the game. That is, contrary to what the title claims, the winner is the player who has the least stuff in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis of the game is obviously on fun. It is a family/party game which mocks the madness that takes hold of the &amp;ldquo;civilized&amp;rdquo; world just before any big gift-giving holiday. The items are titled such as &amp;quot;all types of USB cables&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;precious jewels for pets&amp;quot;. The game was published just before Christmas and the board design closely resembles the logo of one of the leading chain of malls in Estonia. Unfortunately the game is available only in Estonian. Knowledge of the language is not essential but you will miss the fun titles of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
