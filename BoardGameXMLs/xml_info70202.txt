			<description>The N-Gage QD  is a handheld game console and mobile phone by Nokia, and the successor to the N-Gage. It was unveiled on April 14, 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It revised the device's physical design, being smaller and rounder. It corrected the flaw of the cartridge slot with a more convenient one on the bottom of the device. This design also moved the earpiece to the face of the device, rather than on the side, as in the previous model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the revision, the unit drew quick criticism. Some noted that the rubber fitting side that closed the gap between the device top and bottom casing could be easily loosened over a few months. Once the rubber piece was removed, the device became more vulnerable to water or particles entering the internals unless the fitting was replaced. Replacement fittings were available at Nokia's service centers. Various third-party sellers also sold unofficial replacement fittings via online electronics suppliers or eBay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device retailed at a lower price compared to the original N-Gage device, aided by the fact that it was usually sold with service contracts and applicable subsidies. For instance, in the United States the N-Gage QD was available as a prepaid phone offered by Cingular for $99.99 at retail games stores such as Electronics Boutique and GameStop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;N-Gage QD&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
