							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Necker</name>
									
			<description>Necker is an abstract strategy game published in a limited 120 handcrafted production. It&amp;rsquo;s gameplay is based on abstract classic Backgammon. The board uses Necker Cube optical illusion giving the players the sense of each climbing a pyramid though they are all moving in different directions.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 5 pieces on the base of the pyramid, having to climb to the top in order to win. First player reaching the top of the pyramid wins the game. Each turn players must roll 2 dice which can show &amp;ldquo;advance&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;change&amp;rdquo; 1 or more pieces. Then the player must choose one of them and perform the actions. Advance mean going &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo; in the current pyramid the pieces are on, change means the piece will move in other color pyramid, being then able to take other player pieces but not climbing to win the game. A taken piece goes to the base of it&amp;rsquo;s color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
