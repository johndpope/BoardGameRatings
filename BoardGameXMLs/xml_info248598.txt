							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Laewas (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Laewas is inhabited entirely by ghosts. How did the inhabitants of Laewas die? You can ask them, but even they aren&amp;rsquo;t sure. From a distance, the village looks completely normal if a little ramshackle and decayed. Farmers, carpenters and housewives roam the streets, carrying baskets of apples or shepherding packs of dirty children. They laugh, gossip and greet outsiders under the heat of the sun. It&amp;rsquo;s almost easy to forget everybody here is dead. But as the days roll by, the ghosts lose their memories. They are stuck in an endless loop, doomed to constantly relive their final hours. These shades are totally unaware of their current plight. They are convinced they are still living, breathing creatures in a perfectly normal farming village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what happened? There are clues to be found, if one has the skill to look. Work orders for heavy machinery. Curious letters dissolved nearly to dust. Injured children and widowed wives. The clues all lead to the rotting manor which casts a permanent shadow over the village. And to something cold lurking within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
