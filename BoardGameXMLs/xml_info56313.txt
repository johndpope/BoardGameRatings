							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Prix Jumping</name>
									
			<description>In Grand Prix Jumping the players take on the roles of riders leading their steeds through a Grand Prix competition course which includes fences of varying rail heights, as well as a water jump. Getting through the course fast will help your cause but will not guarantee victory as the winner is not the horse that finishes fastest but the one with fewest fault points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You design the course before each game so the strategy will change with each play. You can make the course as demanding as you want. While Grand Prix Jumping is at its heart a card game, there is very little luck involved and the better skilled rider will be victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
