			<description>The Adventurer's Guild Needs a New Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns controlling the guild's adventurers to gain gold, hearts, swords, and spell books in order to fight monsters in the dungeon. The first player to gain 20 glory is declared the new guild master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guildmaster features an action rotation mechanism that puts players at the heart of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you select an adventurer and move them to a new location, taking the actions associated with both the starting and ending locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since every player controls the same adventurers, your choices change your opponents options on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
