							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cultists of Cthulhu: Art Gallery</name>
									
			<description>There is a gallery showing at Miskatonic University, and the campus is covered in pieces of art. Some are beautiful, while some are horrifying, but all will leave an impression. This contains a new type of card, the Work of Art, which are spread around the map. Examining them can grant you bonuses, or scare you out of your wits, depending on how discerning your taste is. Contains 25 Art cards, 1 Cultist Card (Pickman's Model). A subset of art cards are placed face down in rooms on the map, and when examined, are revealed, and have an effect on everyone in that tile, and remain for the duration of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
