							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue</name>
									
			<description>The player controls Buzz Lightyear as he tries to locate and rescue Woody after he is kidnapped by Al McWhiggin. He can execute a jump and a double jump, as well as two attacks: his wrist laser and his spin attack, both of which can be charged. In addition, there are 5 power-ups that can be unlocked to help Buzz complete certain tasks. Most of the voice cast from the film returned to voice their characters in the game with the exception of Tom Hanks, and Wallace Shawn, who did not reprise their roles as Woody,and Rex, respectively (being voiced instead by Jim Hanks for Woody and Earl Boen for Rex). The game starts out at Andy's house, as Al just kidnapped Woody. Buzz eventually leaves the house, then enters the neighborhood as he moves closer and closer to finding his friend, and once again needs to help his friends whilst achieving his goal to find Woody. Slinky, Hamm, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head are with you each level, to give you tips and bonuses. Other characters including Rocky Gibraltar, Bo Peep, Jessie, and Bullseye also will need your assistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
