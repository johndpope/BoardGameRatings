			<description>Matching colors and shapes is easy, right?  what about matching both at the same time, while keeping your opponents from scoring their best play? Look out for a possible spectrum bonus!  Add to the longest shape path!  And don't forget to pay attention to what pieces your opponents have left!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This strategy game is easy to learn, but challenging enough for many repeat plays.  Each player has his/her own set of colored shape pieces.  Players take turns placing pieces and scoring as they go. Will you have the most points when all the spaces have been filled?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
