			<description>La Corda d'Oro (金色のコルダ Kin'iro no Koruda) is a role-playing game series targeted at a female audience under the Neoromance series from Koei. The title comes from the Italian for The Golden String.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kahoko Hino is a student in the General Education section of Seiso Academy. One day she runs into Lili, a musical fairy, who grants her a magical violin and a place in the school's annual musical competition. Kahoko refuses, only to be pressed on by Lili until she accepts the instrument and place in the competition. As she practices, Kahoko is amazed that she can play any musical piece as long as she knows the tune and plays it with her heart. As the competition goes on, she becomes more and more attached to the people she is trying to compete with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;La Corda d'Oro&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
