			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An elderly Jarin toymaker from Leriel comes to Geldeheim, carrying sacks of toys which he hopes to take aboard ship to Thay and sell. The party helps him to realize that he will not get to Thay before spring, and maybe not at all. King Alegar has imposed &amp;quot;temporary&amp;quot; punitive taxes on Jarin goods in harsh reprisal for a recent brawl. The old toymaker decides to give all his toys away to local children, rather than surrender them to King Alegar's thugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any party can handle this adventure, although there is some need for stealth, and an understanding of the local political situation. Player and GM Maps as well as details about the residents of Geldeheim are on pages 5-8. The GM must convey the corruption of Alegar&amp;rsquo;s Geldeheim, and the sense of futility and oppression felt by the Jarin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
