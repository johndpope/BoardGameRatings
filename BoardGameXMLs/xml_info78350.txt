			<description>Command HQ is a real-time strategy world domination game.&lt;br/&gt;It was a co-winner of Computer Gaming World's 1991 Wargame of the Year award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a fully revealed map of the world with various terrain types. The number of cities determines one's income and therefore what can be built. In some scenarios the number of oil wells controlled affects the movement of a player's units. There are relatively few unit types and their availability differs according to the scenario. Units' movements and orders are plotted in advance. It has a number of facilities for zooming in to see action more clearly. Enemy units are only visible when they are in range of friendly units. This provides ample opportunity for surprise attacks on the unwary. The game is won when all the capital cities of the world has been captured by one side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command HQ supports head-to-head play by two players connected remotely via serial (RS-232) cable modems or locally via a null-modem cable. A plugin for IPX/SPX exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Command HQ , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
