			<description>Swissair is played on a large world map. It shows 90 airports of different values, where the 39 most valued ones can be purchased by the players. There are several flight routes on the map also; routes attended by Swissair can be run for free, while flying on other routes are with costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 1 airplane as playing piece. 30 flight cards tell the players, which routes they must fly with their airplanes. Money is paid when a route is completed. &lt;br/&gt;Purchasing airports can be advantageous also, because players landing on them must pay airport taxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when all 30 flights are completed. Winner of the game is the player with the most points; owned airports and money earned is converted to points for that reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
