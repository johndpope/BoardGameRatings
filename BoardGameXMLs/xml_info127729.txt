			<description>THK2 was Magmic&amp;rsquo;s first foray into multiplayer poker, offering tournaments and head to head play right from the user&amp;rsquo;s device. Using servers hosted by Magmic, players were able to play games of Poker with up to 5 other people live, at the same time. Like the previous version it was available on a variety of devices and is still being played due to it being pre-loaded on a variety of BlackBerry handsets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magmic also hosted a tournament in late March 2007 which the winner received an all-expenses paid trip to Orlando in May of the same year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ring game, Tournament and World Series modes&lt;br/&gt;    Standalone and Multiplayer modes&lt;br/&gt;    Online Buddy Lists and Friend Finder&lt;br/&gt;    4 Color Deck for suit visibility&lt;br/&gt;    Customize with dozens of avatars and 7 different designed decks&lt;br/&gt;    In game chat and chat macros&lt;br/&gt;    Tournaments for real prizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Texas Hold'em King&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
