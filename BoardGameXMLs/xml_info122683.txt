			<description>Looney Tunes: Marvin Strikes Back! (Looney Tunes Collector: Martian Revenge in Europe) is a Looney Tunes game published by Infogrames for the Game Boy Color in 2001. It is both a direct and spiritual sequel to Looney Tunes Collector: Alert!, as both share near-identical gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place after the events of Looney Tunes Collector: Alert!. Marvin the Martian sees a video of himself played by Porky Pig and Daffy Duck beating him in a humiliating way. Marvin is infuriated with this and together with his dog K-9 set off to get revenge on the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is very similar to that of the prequel. This time, however, the story is from Marvin's perspective. Marvin's basic controls are walking and shooting. Due to this, he needs to mainly rely on other characters such as Speedy Gonzales. There are a total of 45 characters to find in this game. These can be traded and won in multiplayer mode. It is compatible with its predecessor, giving the player a chance to connect the two games together and transfer characters collected in that game to the latter game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Marvin Strikes Back!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
