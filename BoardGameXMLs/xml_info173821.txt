							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bird&#039;s Eye View</name>
									
			<description>Rather clever party game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains 18 pictures and 12 answer cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pablo, always wearing his sombrero, (represented by thick black rings) is a man of many parts. Our artist has drawn his impressions of some of Pablo's activities as seen through a bird's eye from above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distribute the pictures about the room and give each player an answer card. They should then be allowed abouf 20 minutes in which to write down their guesses as to what Pablo is supposed to be doing in each picture. The most correct answers, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
