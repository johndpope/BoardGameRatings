			<description>He&amp;rsquo;s not a man, I tell ye! He&amp;rsquo;s a demon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halloween Night is known for being an evening filled with obscure happenings and strange omens. This time around is no different. A gruesome triple murder has taken place at the home of an eccentric family living on Elm Street. A man, a  woman, and their daughter were ruthlessly murdered with a kitchen knife. The son, a twenty year-old delinquent known around town as Hollow Man, is thought to be responsible. News of this tragedy spread like wildfire across the town, and the man presumed responsible was quickly renamed Hallow Man by the frightened populace. A grave keeper has just reported seeing Hallow Man enter a trapdoor hidden away in the graveyard. The people are frightened out of their wits, and the guards are dutifully helping to maintain order. Someone needs to bring this murderer to justice! Will it be you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 3-hour adventure for 7th-9th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF scenario is distributed with two PNG files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
