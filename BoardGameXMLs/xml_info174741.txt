			<description>Horizon is a turn-based space strategy game of galactic conquest. It is set in the not-so-distant future where humans have just begun exploring the edges of their solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As humanity's leader, you will explore deep space, find new frontiers and discover alien artifacts hidden on long ago abandoned planets. You will also learn more about the galaxy as you come into contact with other species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten major alien races are featured; each with their own unique culture, history and schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fully interactive galaxy allows you to navigate open space between stars and planets. Patrol your borders, and when the need arises defend your territory by engaging in ship to ship tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Develop new colonies, then watch them become galactic centers for trade, industry and science. And of course military bases, outposts and shipyards to build your battle ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Push your empire to its limits and go beyond the known horizon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: From The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
