			<description>Another game of the scarce Pepys double feature series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game box contains 14 high speed cards, 14 low speed cards, 7 hazard cards (black letter) and 5 hazards (red letter).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For movement players use 6 car cards: Jaguar, Sunbeam Talbot, Riley, Bentley, MG and Ford Zephyr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added are 3 long card strips depicting various towns, scenes and check points along the route of the real Rally Monte Carlo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a hand of 4 cards.&lt;br/&gt;In his turn, he can play a high speed or low speed card in order to move his car card 1 or only 1/2 length along the pictures of the movement strips.&lt;br/&gt;If another player has layed out a movement card there is the possibility to lay a hazard card upon it.&lt;br/&gt;The faster you travel the worser the hazards.&lt;br/&gt;Play ceases at every check point, the later you come the more penalty points you score.&lt;br/&gt;A new hand is dealt then.&lt;br/&gt;After the last checkpoint game alters, the players have to fix for themselves if they want to travel high or low speed until they reach finish; no other card is then allowed.&lt;br/&gt;After arrival at Monte Carlo a last point total is scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with most Pepys card games the graphic artwork is astounding and adds to the atmosphere of the game. Nice little filler...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
