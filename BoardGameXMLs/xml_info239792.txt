			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to Die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small town of Flenfeld was a prosperous farm settlement, blessed with good weather and harvests bountiful enough to keep its folk fed most years. But when the player characters discover the settlement deserted, with no immediately obvious signs of strife or skullduggery, they find themselves caught up in the dark aftermath of an unspeakable horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flenfeld&amp;rsquo;s shrine to the New God was built upon the broken ruins of an ancient monastery, beneath which are secret catacombs and caverns long lost to memory. Deep within these forgotten chambers a diabolical evil has bided its time, and is now set to rise once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for expert characters, the group completes the adventure when they defeat the evil that dwells beneath the shrine. Quintet makes use of creatures originally described in Exquisite Agony and Tombs of the Desolation. The statistics boxes for these creatures appear at the end of the adventure, but you might want to refer to the publications referenced above for more information about them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
