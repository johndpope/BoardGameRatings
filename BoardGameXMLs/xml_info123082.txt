							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bell&#039;s 64,000 Question</name>
									
			<description>Quiz game who pinched the name from a different American game related to $64,000. the names are the same but the games are completely different. The 64,000 Question is a party game where guests are asked quiz questions. No board, no playing pieces, just question cards. This game has a board and playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to four players attempt to get 10 questions correct and thus reach the spinner in the middle of the box. The spinner itself is used to determine the 'colour' of the question you have to face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are intended for children to answer, not adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
