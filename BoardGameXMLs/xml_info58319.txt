			<description>Up to four players start a top by blowing into a straw. The top then moves along a lane with obstacles which have to be passed by tilting the lane to move the top sideways, forward faster etc. The player whose top reaches a target point first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
