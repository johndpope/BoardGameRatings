			<description>To play, questions and answer cards are divided evenly among the players; or a dealer could give all Question Cards to some players, and the others all Answer Cards.  Either way, the cards remain face down in the two separate piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins by the first player drawing a Question Card.  He reads the question out loud for all to hear, and then &amp;lsquo;looks at&amp;rsquo; any player he chooses to receive an Answer from.  Whoever he &amp;lsquo;looks at&amp;rsquo; draws an Answer card from the faced down pile, and reads the answer on the card.  This is considered the answer to the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who gives the most correct answers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
