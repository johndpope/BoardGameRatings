			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Shattered, a grimdark roleplaying game filled to the brim with fantasy, horror, and steampunk elements. Nearly 3,000 years ago, a cult gathered to summon their god from another realm. Their failure tore the world apart and the remaining shards of humanity have only just begun to pick themselves up. Civilization is comprised of a handful of city-states that are bastions against the chaos and desolation of the outside world, where eldritch horrors roam. A roiling mass of these horrors, the Undead Tide, roves across the continent and consumes every living thing in its path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology is an odd mash-up of ancient, advanced machines, and&lt;br/&gt;discoveries equivalent to the feudal age. Swords and crossbows are the most prevalent tools of war, but humanity has recently rediscovered gunpowder. By marrying technology and magic, men and women have taken to the skies aboard airships. Magic, known as ark&amp;auml;na, has permeated and warped everything, including humanity. It is now split into seven distinct races: Humans, Alypse, Drones, Rekindled, Shades, Vampires, and Wretched. An eighth, the Florvana, are fungal colonies that only recently gained sentience and joined the ranks of Feneryss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are you? Who will you be? Will you subject yourself to grotesque biological modification to achieve physical superiority? Will you plunder and pillage your fellow Feneryans as a pirate sailing the clouds aboard your airship? Perhaps you will master the untold secrets of ark&amp;auml;na to usurp the status quo with destructive, primal forces. Wherever your adventures take you, the choices are yours, and your fate rests in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
