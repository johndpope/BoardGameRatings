			<description>Just when it seemed like things couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any weirder! The final push for Greenville is underway, and both sides call on heavy reinforcements &amp;ndash; and one or two oddities, in order to get the job done!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Science Division arrive to bolster the Martian Invasion effort. Under the direction of the insane genius of Chief Surgeon Gorl, they are here to finish the job that Tor started, whether he likes it or not. And as if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, they bring giant bugs with them as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet this threat, Novas Vira have called in their most elite commando unit &amp;ndash; the infamous Tiger Corps. Led by General Jaret, this mixed bunch of desperadoes have been fighting the Martians for years, and pack a punch that Tor and Gorl will not soon forget. Emerging from the ruins to help them comes the biggest terrestrial non-human defender yet, as Tunga the gorilla takes to the fight along with her keeper Craig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
