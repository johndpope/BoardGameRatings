			<description>A word game that has elements of Reversi in that you turn over letters to your colour when you form a word.&lt;br/&gt;2 player or a 4 player (partnership) game. Each player uses an identical set of 50 tiles, one marked with red, the other blue.&lt;br/&gt;The first player lays down a letter, the second player lays a letter beside it (at the back or front). Play continues like this. If a player forms a word, all tiles in that word are turned over to his colour. Words are built up crossword fashion.&lt;br/&gt;When all the letters have been used, the winner is the player with the most of his colour in the crossword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
