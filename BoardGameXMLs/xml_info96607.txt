			<description>Card game featuring characters from the Pooh stories by A. A. Milne.&lt;br/&gt;A variation of the traditional playing card game called Beggar My Neighbour in Britain.&lt;br/&gt;Players turn over a card from their stack. If it is a card without a number, the next player has a turn. If one of the numbered cards is drawn (they feature Christopher Robin, Kanga and Roo, Piglet and Winnie the Pooh) then the next player has to add cards to the central stack, how many cards being decided by the number on the previous card. If a player runs out of cards, he or her is out of the game. 'Last Man Standing' wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
