			<description>Described by the Publisher/Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M K Morrison developed Big Battle over a number of years. He fine tuned it by play testing against an international chess master in New Zealand. Big Battle is a chess variant played on a 10 by 10 chess board. It has two new pieces called Princes which combine the powers of the chess knight and the Big Battle Queen. The Big Battle queen in addition to the powers of the ordinary chess queen can also jump over an immediately adjacent piece. The pawns (called soldiers in Big Battle) can move one two or threes squares; not just on their first moves but for any move. It makes for a pretty sharp end game. Almost all the pieces in Big Battle have enhanced powers when compared to their chess counterparts. There have been a number of Big Battle tournaments in New Zealand, including two national tournaments. You can find out more about Big Battle at the Chess Variants page or at Zillions of games. They have a script for playing Big Battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
