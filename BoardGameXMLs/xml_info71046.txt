			<description>From the Introduction (Edited):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent behind the game is to provide a set of skirmish rules (one-on-one combat between characters) streamlined enough that games can be played to a satisfactory conclusion.  In a suitalbly brief amount of time, with considerably more figures than the usual fantasy role-playing game encounter.  In many ways, this is a military adjunct to a Middle Aesopian role-playing campaign, allowing the players to engage in actions larger than a simple dungeon crawl.  Even though the basic rules are bare-boned and straightforward in order to help achieve these ends, they provide a solid foundation for the addition of house-rules and additional material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although its roots go back a long way, the mythos of Middle Aesopia is a living story that contines to grow on the Skirmisher interactive forum and in it's soon to be released Quactica role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quactica: Battles for the Soul of Middle Aesopia was one of the new products Skirmisher released at Gen Con 2008 in Indianapolis. This innovative set of miniatures rules was created by veteran game designer and miniatures sculptor Steve Lortz, author of the famous Perilous Encounters rules released by Chaosium in 1978. Set in a world inhabited by various races of anthropomorphic animals - including Ducks, Dwargs, and Porks - the Quactica rules tie in with a beautiful line of miniatures created by Lortz and produced by Skirmisher Publishing LLC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
