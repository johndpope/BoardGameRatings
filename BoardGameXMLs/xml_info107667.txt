							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Combat Leader</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It used to be when we wanted to make a strategy wargame full of realistic rules, historical accuracy and challenging options, we had to give up a bit on speed.  And if we wanted arcade action, we had to take the edge off sophistication and detail.  Well, no more.  COMBAT LEADER combines the best of both worlds to give you one of the finest - and fastest - tank-battle games ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMBAT LEADER - as its name implies - was designed to put you in charge of a battle force of tanks and mechanized infantry against a similarly-equipped enemy (controlled by the computer).  The scrolling battlefield shows every detail a real combat leader would see: hills, forests, depressions and rough terrain.  Your troops are always on-screen while realistic visibility rules have enemy units flashing on or off (this depends on whether at least one of your men has spotted them or not).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can even choose the level of command you want: company commander, platoon leader, or squad leader.  At your disposal are over 70 tanks, each historically rated for armor thickness and strength, speed and fire accuracy.  You can choose from the classic Nazi Tiger tank to the ultra-modern Abrams M-1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you use the joystick and simple one-key keyboard commands, your men will execute your orders in real time.  They look, move, stop, retreat, advance, patrol and fire the instant you tell them to do so.  No waiting, no delaying.  In fact, there are eight levels of speed with the eighth so fast you'll be glad there are seven slower ones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
