			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years have passed since the end of the Sathar Wars, but skirmishes with Sathar raiders and infiltrators have continued. However, there has never been an opportunity to learn much about this wily and elusive foe&amp;mdash;until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Courageous volunteers are needed to carry the fight against the Sathar to the very edge of the unknown. The prize is a major Sathar base and, perhaps, a live prisoner. However, the least mistake will probably destroy the UFP strike force. A calculated risk, but well worth the gamble if successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volunteers&amp;hellip;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Face of the Enemy combines the Alpha Dawn role-playing rules with the Knight Halks space-faring rules. Both are needed for this module, which combines delicate negotiations and a daring boarding action in a rousing adventure for 3&amp;ndash;6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module can be played alone or as the second part of the Beyond the Frontier adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
