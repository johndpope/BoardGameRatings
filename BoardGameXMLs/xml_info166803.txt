							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Travelogue: A Tapestry of Tales</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are travellers resting for the night. While you relax, you share stories of your journeys and encounters. Your goal as players is to weave a web of stories together, and to explore the personalities of the characters as well as the world you create through your stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, agree on a genre and some basic setting information: Are you playing travellers in a medieval fantasy world or urban horror setting? Is some advanced technology important for the setting? If you can't agree, let the host decide or choose randomly. Also, agree on the tone of the game: Are you going for goofy stories, tall tales, epic adventures, gruesome reports or everyday experiences?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, create the round of characters. Pick three traits - these are the traits that will influence all your characters. You all share one trait in the same way. For the two other traits; each player is free to either have her or his character share this trait or an opposite of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick names for your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're the host, you may establish where the group of characters currently is. Are you sitting round a campfire on a glacier? Are you in a run-down tavern on a bustling space station?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now start telling stories!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
