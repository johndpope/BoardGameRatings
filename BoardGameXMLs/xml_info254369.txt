			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure module is meant to help the DM with providing content to their players.  This adventure is intended to run in the Forgotten Realms setting, but it can be compatible with any campaign setting, published module, or homebrew adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need to get your player characters to a higher level before beginning your next adventure?  Want a way to get some loot into the hands of your players before they start another long quest?  Or do you just need a little more content in the campaign you already have going?  Then Sword Coast Side Quests is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the hills near the Sword Coast, there lives a gang of ruffians and thieves known as the Flying Drunks. Their leader is a particularly well-known scoundrel by the name of Kragnoroth.  For a while, Kragnoroth and his gang has lain low, but not anymore. He is up to his old ways again, stealing, fighting, and being a dirty wretch. Kill Him! Do it for the good people of the Sword Coast, and give him justice from the gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended for 4 to 6, 1st to 3rd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
