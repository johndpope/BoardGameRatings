			<description>&amp;quot;It challenges your judgment and defies your sense of balance!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a 20&amp;quot; plastic circular maze which is supported by a single central 18&amp;quot; rod connected to a tripod base.  There are circular depressions around the circumference of the maze where steel balls are placed and thus affect the way the maze tilts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are nine balls in all - eight smaller steel balls and a larger 'counteract' ball which is placed in the maze.  The counteract ball must be manipulated into a depression located at the center of the maze by careful placement of the steel balls around the perimeter.  Players must move three steel balls per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who causes the counteract ball to roll into the central depression (the 'winner's circle') is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
