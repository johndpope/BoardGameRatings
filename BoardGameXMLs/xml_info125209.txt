							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crystal Quest</name>
									
			<description>Crystal Quest is an action computer game for the Apple Macintosh and Apple IIgs. It was written by Patrick Buckland for Casady &amp;amp; Greene in 1987, and was ported to the IIgs in 1989 by Bill Heineman. Ports were also made to the Amiga, Nintendo Game Boy, iPhone OS, and Palm. It was notable both for its fast-paced gameplay and for being the first game to support the color displays on the Macintosh II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was based on the original shareware version, Crystal Raider, one of the supporters of which had been Michael Greene, founder of Greene Inc (later to merge with CasadyWare to become Casady &amp;amp; Greene). A sequel, similar to the original game, Crystal Crazy, was created some years later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crystal Quest&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
