			<description>Tigacti is a geography game in which the players have to locate places on a world map. The active player draws a card which contains a location (like the Giseh Sphinx, for instance) and then places a transparent round disc on the world map, centering it where s/he believe the thing is located. Then an semi-circular marker is placed around the disk to show where it was placed and the disk is removed. The card is now turned around and reveals which quadrant of the board it belongs to. The quadrants are card-sized, and the cards show a cross with the precise location. Afterwards, the disc is put back on top of the cards - it contains concentric rings which mark how far the player was off. Points are scored depending on how close the player guessed the location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
