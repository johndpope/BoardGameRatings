			<description>Horse racing game that takes its game-play from the traditional British card game of Racing Aces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and a number are taken out of the deck and revealed to the players. In the race, cards will be revealed and the horse in that racing colours will advance one space. This is done for each card revealed until one horse crosses the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be seen that some horses will have less cards in the pack than others. This is because when you take out the cards before the race begins, those cards are no longer in the pack, so the horses affected have less cards available and thus have less chance of winning. The odds for them to win will be higher than the odds om horses with, for example, all their cards still in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bet on each race and after a pre-agreed number of races, the player with most money, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Rickman, British television's eccentric horse racing expert, pictured on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
