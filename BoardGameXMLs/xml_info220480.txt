							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lightning and Steel: The Battle of Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski, September 4-5, 1939</name>
									
			<description>The German attack on Poland, codenamed &amp;ldquo;Case White,&amp;rdquo; on September 2nd, 1939 was a gamble on Hitler&amp;rsquo;s part. He wagered Poland&amp;rsquo;s allies of France and Great Britain would once again cave-in to his demands and not oppose his invasion. Even if they did, a lightning-fast war (blitzkrieg) would make mote any of their objections once the rival to the east was subjugated. That a mutual defense treaty stipulating an invasion from the east by the Soviet Union only &amp;ldquo;sealed the deal&amp;rdquo; and further secured Hitler&amp;rsquo;s risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lightning and Steel is a war game simulation of the climatic battle fought near the town of Piotrk&amp;oacute;w Trybunalski during the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany. Taking the crossroads town was crucial to the German&amp;rsquo;s XVI Corps offensive. The Poles ordered their 1st and 2nd Tank Battalions, along with elements of two infantry and one cavalry divisions, to counter attack and cut off the Germans. The result was the war&amp;rsquo;s first major tank battle, and one that nearly thwarted the German&amp;rsquo;s plans. Can you do as well or better than you historical counterpart? Learn and enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Lightning and Steel is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets&lt;br/&gt;One sheet of 108 double-sided, unmounted counters&lt;br/&gt;One Players' Aid Sheet&lt;br/&gt;One 7 page set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
