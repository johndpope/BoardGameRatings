							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bonnie Prince Charlie</name>
									
			<description>A game of the Jacobite Rebellion, 1745.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonnie Prince Charlie is a game of movement, recruitment and battle.  It is playable in two versions, a two player game and a multi-player game.  The basic rules for the two player game are used with additions for the multi-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play occurs on a mapboard which depicts the British Isles.  Forces are represented by card pieces, the color of which indicates the Jacobites (blue) or Hanoverians (red).  Forts and artillery are also represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a mounted board and large colorful counters - graphically well ahead of it's time when published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
