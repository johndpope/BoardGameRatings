							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slaver&#039;s Ring</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Las Vegas is a working man's town, with several attractions to catch the eye and to empty the pocket on The Strip. However, there is a darker side of Vegas: the Vegas Mafia Families. A Tribal is seeking experienced hunters to help his village out by recovering Tribal slaves that are in servitude to the Vegas Families. Do you have what it takes to free the Tribal slaves of Vegas? The Slaver's Ring is an Exodus OPS campaign scenario for 4 to 6 characters of 2nd to 5th level and can easily be adapted to other post-apocalyptic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario has been updated from the original to reflex the new Experience system used in the Exodus OPS campaign.  OPS players that have already played this scenario, cannot re-play it, or gain any benefits from the changes within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
