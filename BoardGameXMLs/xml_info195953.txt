			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Aerial Recon Search Team:  The ARST are a specialized unit of mercenary airborne cavalry. The kinds of jobs on offer from such groups are often a bit dodgy and are under-compensated for the level of danger involved. But the mercs of the ARST will take those jobs, and they will do them well, because they are professionals. More than that, though, this is the only kind of life they care to live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust in the Wind: A group of oil executives were negotiating a deal in the oil-rich kingdom of Kudesh. It is unclear at this time whether the deal went south, the executives insulted their hosts, or a resistance movement infiltrated the meeting. What is known is: the oil executives have been taken hostage and need to be rescued before they are executed on camera. But, there's a problem. Kudesh is a pariah state. To send in the cavalry would be to tacitly admit to having trade talks with one of the &amp;ldquo;exporters of evil.&amp;rdquo; Which is where the ARST comes in, hired to go where others cannot, and to do what others cannot bring themselves to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
