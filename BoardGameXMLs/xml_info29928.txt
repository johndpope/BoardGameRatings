			<description>Object of the game is be the first player to visit three sites on each continent selected for the game, then return home free of debt. Players roll to determine the mode of travel they must use for their turn, then use a range finder to tell how much it will cost to travel to a destination served by that mode of travel. Players must travel if possible (unless they are on a Point of Entry space trying for a reward), and may go into debt while traveling. Reward spaces are scattered on the board to help players gain back money, and thus get out of debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
