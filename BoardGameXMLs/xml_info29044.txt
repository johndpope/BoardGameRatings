							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GOAL Fussball-Schach</name>
									
			<description>Issued in Switzerland by Tip Verlag Basel (publisher of the Swiss sports magazine &amp;quot;Tip&amp;quot;) on the occasion of the 1958 Soccer World Cup in Sweden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two teams consist each of 1 goalkeeper, 2 defenders and 8 normal players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's name &amp;quot;Fussball-Schach&amp;quot; (= soccer chess) is not very adequate, although no dice are used in this game. Unlike chess, all 11 players move the same way.  However, the goal keeper must stay in his goal and the 2 defenders cannot leave their own half of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movements can be done as far as wanted and movements with 2 players in one turn are also possible. There are some rules included, which preclude having the ball totally surrounded by players. The most unusual (and surprisingly simple) of these rules is the rule that; the ball always moves 1 space further than a player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
