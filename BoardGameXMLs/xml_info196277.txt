							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SuperSight</name>
									
			<description>Aimed at 14-19 year olds, SuperSight takes the player on a journey through Mount Wrong, pitching them against strange creatures intent on overwhelming and halting the player&amp;rsquo;s progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each creature in the game represents a different negative pattern of thinking. The Fearlines represent anxiety, the Stronghorns represent inflexibility, the Worriors represent worry, the Howlers represent isolation, and the Vermin represent feelings of hopelessness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guided by the Wise Guy, the aim is to learn how to see clearly and achieve Supersight in order to overcome the creature-based challenges and complete their training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is viewed from 3/4 perspective, and the character is controlled by touching or dragging around the game world. To stave off the onslaught of creatures, the player has a simple attach alongside a growing selection of techniques representing the superpowers of good thinking and reflection. These powers include area-effect attacks such as the Swipe, alongside more tactical move such as the Fakey. The game is being designed to be simple and instinctive and play with strategic depth and longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
