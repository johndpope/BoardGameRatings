							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die drei ???: Das verfluchte Schloss â€“ Die spannende Jagd nach dem Diamanten</name>
									
			<description>The goal of the game is to collect as many white diamonds as possible. The game board depicts the cursed castle with three floors, the top two of which are rotatable against the lower one(s). One of the investigators is put onto the top disk which is then rotated (as determined by a die roll). If the disk is rotated to a room symbol, the active player can try to obtain diamonds by rolling against an individual number belonging to each investigator.&lt;br/&gt;In some cases, the players find a path to the next level. If in investigator can find the way out of the lowest level of the castle, he gets some diamonds and is out of the game. &lt;br/&gt;There are red and white diamonds. Red diamonds can be used to manipulate die rolls, while white diamonds determine the winner at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with Die drei ???: Das verfluchte Schloss that came out in the same year, from the same publisher, about the same film, but from different designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
