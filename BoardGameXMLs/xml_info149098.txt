							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomb of Rils</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of Rils is a matter of considerable debate among the great scholars of necromancy. Some of the learned even assert that Rils never existed. Some claim that stories about different necromancers were combined over the centuries and this fictional composite was named Rils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the myths and historical accounts vary, a common point of agreement is that unlike many other necromancers of his caliber, Rils was not interested in spreading undeath across the world. Instead, Rils has been portrayed as devoted to the study of necromancy and the undead as a matter of intellectual curiosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholars who accept that Rils existed believe that because of his devotion to knowledge, he created numerous repositories holding his scrolls and books.  They also claim that Rils did not wish his knowledge to fall into unworthy hands or to be acquired too easily. As such, these repositories are supposed to be well guarded and thoroughly trapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rils&amp;rsquo; actual fate (assuming he existed at all) is not recorded in history. Some scholars believe that he was destroyed by adventurers who mistook him for an evil lich. Others contend he was destroyed by adventurers because he was an evil lich. Some say that he still exists and dwells within a vast underground library, penning necromantic tomes. Whatever the truth, from time to time the location of one of Rils&amp;rsquo; alleged repositories is discovered and adventurers brave the dangers within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomb of Rils is a Pathfinder Role Playing Game compatible adventure. It is intended for a party of 1st-3rd    level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some of the features of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New traps.&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed color map for the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;     Full statistics are included for all encounters&amp;mdash;no need to look up monsters.&lt;br/&gt;     New spells (Bone Dance and Glue).&lt;br/&gt;     New Monster (Bone Dancer)&lt;br/&gt;     Free Hero Lab portfolio.&lt;br/&gt;     Zombie fish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
