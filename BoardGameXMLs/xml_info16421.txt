							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Miss America Pageant</name>
									
			<description>This game recreates The Miss America Pageant with players competing in the Swimsuit, Talent, Personality and Evening Gown competitions. The game uses a spinner shaped to look like a television camera. On your turn, you spin the spinner and advance the number of spaces indicated. If you land on a competition space, you draw a card that tells you what score you received for that event. When you have cards from all the competitions, you place your contestant piece on one of the 3 Semi-Final spaces and start a new contestant. It is possible for a player to have 0, 1, 2 or 3 contestants in the Semi-Final judging. When all 3 Semi-Finalist spaces are filled, the player with the highest point score moves her contestant to a Finalist space. A new round is then played and so on until all 5 Finalist spaces are filled around the base of the camera. The spinner is then spun and the contestant in front of the camera pointer is named 4th runner up and removed. This process is repeated eliminating 1 contestant at a time. The remaining contestant is named Miss America, and the player who controls her wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
