			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Shift Lite is a quick start / fast play document to introduce players to the full Red Shift game.  Most of the document focuses on character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players begin with Character Points which are spent to purchase things during (and after) character creation.  Most games will play with 100-150 Character Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters first buy Scores in the fifteen Attributes and then select a Race which will limit or enable future options.  Red Shift Lite supports only two races: Human and Rhyrha.  Characters next select a Profession which is somewhat like a &amp;quot;light-weight&amp;quot; class.  Professions have minimum Attribute requirements and also provide Skills, possible bonuses, and bonus equipment.  Characters have Talents and Advantages, as well as Disadvantages.  Some characters also have Psionics; some Professions require Psionic ability for entry.  Combat utilizes a dice pool comparison to a target number and supports damage and other familiar aspects of role-playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
