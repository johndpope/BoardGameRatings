							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Body Party</name>
									
			<description>Body Party plays like a team Twister, with each team competing to hold a half-dozen body part cards between their bodies before anyone else can do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, players form teams of two or three players, with at least one person serving as referee. The referee keeps the card deck in hand to help facilitate gameplay; each card shows one body part on the front and another body part (or possibly the same one) on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the referee shows the active team the part depicted on the top card of the deck. This team can take this card or pass on it, but then they must take the next card. The teammates must now attempt to hold this card between the two players using the two body parts depicted. If they drop this card, their turn ends; if they drop other cards already held, however, they can continue to work with the current card, despite the tears that will inevitably ensue. Then the next team takes its turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until at least one team holds six cards. If all teams have had the same number of turns and only one team holds six cards, this team wins; if several teams hold six cards, play another round, continuing the game until one team holds more cards than any other at the end of a round. This team wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a variant, Body Party includes a half-dozen cards that feature a body part on one side and a household object on the other (table, wall, chair, floor). These cards must be placed between a player on the team and the depicted item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
