							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mad Doctor&#039;s Formulary</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mad scientists are a classic horror trope, and The Mad Doctor's Formulary brings them to life in an terrifyingly evocative way, focusing on all the awful possibilities of non-magical yet murderous medicine, sadistic surgery, and gruesome grafting. There are echoes of magic within these pages, as we explore how the cruel science of chirurgery and replicate or counter more common magical means of corrupting or altering body and mind alike with procedures like Implant Psychic Trigger, Lobotomize, Stimulate Adrenal Cortex, and Install Kill-Switch. Included within is a grimoire-tome, Regarding the Clockwork of Capillaries, explicating the application of chirurgical techniques not only to surgery with or without anesthetic, but also to the creation of chirurgical constructs. Implant a cyberphrenic tadpole and establish a subtle telepathic relay with your victim's mind, or simply command your cranial dissectibot to strap them down and have them open wide; each construct's vividly horrific illustration stands alone on its own page for optimal player display. Tell them not to worry; it won't hurt... much...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Jason Nelson and Clinton J. Boomer with the Legendary Games design team of Liz Courts, Crystal Frasier, Matt Goodall, Jim Groves, Tim Hitchcock, Neil Spicer, Todd Stewart, Russ Taylor, Greg A. Vaughan, and Clark Peterson, with amazing illustrations by Tim Kings-Lynne and Frank Hessefort. Who better to provide you with creepy constructs and alternate rules for creating and using them in your Adventure Path campaign than the very writers of those adventures themselves? Answer: no one. Legendary Games' Adventure Path Plug-Ins supplement and enrich your campaign experience, offering adventures and supporting products that incorporate and expanding upon unique concepts, themes, and rules subsystems introduced in the Adventure Paths while filling in the background characters, items, and locations that make those adventures come alive in delightful (and often dangerous) detail. Legendary Games combines stellar writing talent with innovative layout and product design and top-notch artistic values that we think will bring you back again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out this 15-page gothic-themed accessory and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
