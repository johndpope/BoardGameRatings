							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peel Colonies</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven worlds on the coreward frontier beyond Clement Sector!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peel Colonies are the only settled worlds in Ariel Sector.  Located to coreward of Clement Sector, Peel Subsector is the cutting edge of colonization into this new sector.  The last stops before heading into the unknown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laylah was the second world in the subsector to be settled.  The world was settled in 2280 by colonists from Minerva (Franklin 0401) seeking religious freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Perth is a former Australian colony which was founded in 2284.  New Perth is able to defend itself and project power through the use of Republic of Australia Naval Units which were left stranded here after the Conduit collapsed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peel is home to an increasingly unstable military dictatorship.  The most populous planet in the subsector as well as the namesake for the subsector was once a parliamentary democracy but is now inching towards chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neachdain is a world controlled by a rigid technocracy in which a group of fifteen people determine what is best for the entire population.  Some believe that Neachdans have delusions of grandeur while others feel that the world might someday be an expansionistic threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alverca is an independent colony founded by Portuguese settlers in 2282.  The world is both fiercely Catholic and famous for its wild Carnival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rocroi is a small colony founded by a French eccentric, Jean-Marc Savard in 2331. Savard is now the self-styled King of Rocroi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ariel is a joint Israeli-Palestinian colony on which religious differences have been set aside to form a new culture.  Ariel was colonized in 2286 and named for the sector itself in an effort to become the predominate world for the sector&amp;rsquo;s future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peel Colonies comes with detailed descriptions of each of these settled worlds along with information concerning the remainder of the Peel subsector.  Random encounters and adventure hooks are included for each world to get your characters into the action with a minimum of preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peel Colonies can be used as part of a continuing campaign within Gypsy Knights Games' Clement Sector background or as part of any Traveller or science fiction setting.  These worlds can be used in concert or be taken one at a time for your own Traveller universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure awaits in the new colonies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
