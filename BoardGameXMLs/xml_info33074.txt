			<description>A game created for BGG.con 2007, loosely based on Sid Sackson's original game of Haggle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1800 cards were created, numbered 1 to 600. Each card has five values corresponding to five different treasures. Each card also has a special ability which modifies one more values on one or more cards. The object of the game is to collect the best set of cards with the highest value in one or more of the five treasures. Cards and card information can be traded or wagered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special abilities include hidden information and logic puzzles, optional combat, and dozens of different themed avenues to combine cards that affect your final values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scott Alden of Board Game Geek helped clarify the rules, and contributed to components of the theme, names of the cards, card layout, and the game's name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
