							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Traps Set II</name>
									
			<description>Like all sets from the Master Maze range from Dwarven Forge this modular dungeon set is designed for use with 25 mm minatures, has a 1 inch grid integrated into the floor design, and comes fully painted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;If you loved the Traps set your going to go nuts over this second set of devious and cruel Traps! We saved the best for last and went a step further to bring you some of the KOOLEST devices in the known realms. There are Traps in this set that have ACTUAL working mechanisms! By using gravity, along with the clever use of hidden seesaws and rods, we now present traps which are set off underfoot! Also included are some classic Medieval fortification walls which prove useful in dungeons as well. Some of these awesome traps require simple assembly. Dwarven Forge is not responsible for the demise of Characters due to the contents of this Box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
