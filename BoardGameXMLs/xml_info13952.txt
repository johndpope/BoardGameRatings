			<description>&amp;quot;A Game Of Cunning Greed and Guile&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the jungle of Central America in a ruined temple complex, a chest containing the Gold of Mirador lies hidden in a subterranean cavern. Your quest is to be the first person to find that gold. However, to confuse you as to the whereabouts of the gold, there are also three other chests containing merely Lead Ingots. Your task is to find the Gold Ingot using the equipment retrieved from the six storerooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to enter any of the Treasure Caverns, each player must have collected a Bronze Key from the Crocodile Pit and an Iron Key from the Well. Crossing the crocodile Pit requires a Canoe, whilst going down into the well requires a Rope. Each player also needs a Log Bridge to reach the North Caverns and a Log Ladder to reach the South Caverns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And all of this before you even begin to deal with the sliding doors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
