			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something is sealed away. Something horrible. To keep it out of the world, a magical ritual takes place every sixty years to strengthen the bonds on the Great Beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five artifacts of power take shape within the world and are sought out as the means to complete the ritual needed to maintain the prison. The one who completes the ritual gets a boon of great power such that it could grant them dominion over nations or even immortality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result, every sixty years, the effort to seal the beast devolves into a war of supernatural power which has been called the Tournament of Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Myth Arc for use with the Monster of the Week game written by Michael Sands from Generic Games and revised and published by Evil Hat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Five sample artifacts each with its own bizarre power.&lt;br/&gt;    Four monsters which can be used as rival seekers of the artifacts or used for their own scenarios in your own campaign.&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for fighting the Great Beast should the Heroes fail to prevent its release.&lt;br/&gt;    Rules to run the final conflict of the five wielders as a one-shot scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
