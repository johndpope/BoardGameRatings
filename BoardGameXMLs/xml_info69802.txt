			<description>User Summary...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created as a follow-up to the Starbattles tactical space combat game, Starbattles (The Card Game) is described in its rulebook as &amp;quot;a beginner level card game of tactical space combat. It is a fast paced card game where all the action is in front of you and in your hand.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, only simply produced play-test versions of this game have been documented. It is unknown whether or not this game ever made it into full production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Rules Folder (6 pages on continuous paper)&lt;br/&gt;- 54 Ship Cards (all cards for this game are printed on sheets for players to cut out)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Set of Hit/Destroyed Counters (the sheet devoted to last minute changes indicates that these are not included)&lt;br/&gt;- 6 Play Sheets &lt;br/&gt;- 6 Player Order Cards&lt;br/&gt;- 114 Action Cards&lt;br/&gt;- (a six-sided die is required, but not included)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes on play:&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a Play Sheet where ship status and damaged is tracked. Essentially, the Play Sheet represents a player's home base... their ships (as represented on Ship Cards) are placed on areas on the Play Sheet that show the ship's position relative to their base. Players score victory points by finishing off other player's ships.  The game ends and victory points are totaled when only one player has active ships left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
