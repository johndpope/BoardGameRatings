							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Husky (1943)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;OPERATION HUSKY&amp;rdquo; (10 July &amp;ndash; 17 August 1943)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American, British and Canadian troops land in the South of the Island. Their aim is to reach Messina, as the final plan is to liberate Italy from the German occupation. It is likely that the Axis would begin to evacuate forces from the island in the very near future, and it is vitally important that they are destroyed or captured before they can leave Sicily. This ensures that any subsequent invasion of the Italian mainland would be faced by far fewer Axis troops. &lt;br/&gt;The most immediate objectives are airfields and ports in the advance towards Messina.&lt;br/&gt;Depending on his reinforcement schedule, the Axis player may attempt to delay Allies conquest of the island, or decisively defeat the Allies by a strong counterattack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;- Map Board&lt;br/&gt;- Sheet of Counters&lt;br/&gt;- Rules Handout&lt;br/&gt;- One 6 sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
