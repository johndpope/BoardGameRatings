			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sangokushi Koumeiden is the second title in the Eiketsuden spinoff series of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms strategy games. Zhuge Liang is the focus of the game, and the story follows his efforts in assisting Liu Bei establish the Shu Han kingdom, and his campaigns against the Nanman people and Wei kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the same base gameplay formula as its predecessor, but introduces some new features. Most notable is the player&amp;rsquo;s ability to affect the later elements of the game through skilful play. Each time that the player fails a mission or restarts a stage, it affects Zhuge Liang&amp;rsquo;s health. If too many failures are accrued, Zhuge Liang will die before the final chapter and a different ending will be shown. Additionally, players can control the statistic allocation for one of the officers in the late game (Zhuge Zhan) by choosing where his focus will be placed as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over 100 officers available for use in the game, each with unique attributes. Before each battle, the player must choose which officers will be deployed and equip them with various items that improve their abilities. Combat is turn-based, with each unit occupying a single tile on a square map. A number of objectives must be completed each stage, and the time required for completion will also affect Zhuge Liang&amp;rsquo;s health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
