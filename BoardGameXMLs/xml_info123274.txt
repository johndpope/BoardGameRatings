			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Japanese small-press card game about building a baseball team and then performing a match. The first part of the game is about recruiting team mates of which there are 27 unique ones; which are available and in which order varies. Each player has an attack value, a defence value, some special effect, how fast they run, where they hit the ball etc. In the second part, players use the team mates and the training cards they've collected to play out the baseball match; which includes comparing the different numbers and special powers on the team individuals, and using some hand management to play the right card at the right time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Players of all colours and with next to superhuman powers amass on the field, the devil curbs swirve through the air and the baseball bats burst out in fire!!!&lt;br/&gt;This is a game based on such baseball comics.&lt;br/&gt;With all the quirky rules of baseball, and using the characters' special powers, you can taste the charm of pitching and hitting in an easy way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time to PLAY BALL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
