			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Last Age, the ancestral homeland of the elven people has become a battleground. Armies of orcs, ogres, giant-men, and trolls mass in the North, preparing to spill out of the Highhorns and lay waste to the Veradeen, the snow-clad home of the Erunsil elves. In the east, trained and disciplined orcish armies set out from Eisin, burning their way into the fey wood along the mighty Felthera River. Standing defiant between the bloody pincers of this assault is Caradul, the capital of the elven nation and domain of Aradil, the Witch Queen. In the Night Kings&amp;rsquo; grand campaign is successful, it could mean the end of organized resistance to the Shadow in Eredane. The outcome is as yet undecided: Your heroes could be the ones that save the elven nations... or doom them to defeat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FURY OF SHADOW is a deluxe limited edition boxed set that will take your MIDNIGHT campaign to a whole new level.
