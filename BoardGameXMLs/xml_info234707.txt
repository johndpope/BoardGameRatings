			<description>The origin of this letter tile game is mysterious, as it bears no publication info or crediting aside from a private email address whence to direct questions and opinions. It may have been self-published and/or given away in some promotional context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 107 tiles, most of which contain a letter. Players randomly draw these one by one (optionally rejecting or exchanging tiles), aiming to form them into words, which are scored by length. A few special tiles result in extra draws or a lost tile. When all tiles have been drawn or no player wishes to draw any more, the game ends and unplayed tiles result in a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an advanced variant, the game suggests only allowing words that fit a certain theme, such as &amp;quot;sports and games&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;culture and entertainment&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;animals and nature&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;geography&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;names&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
