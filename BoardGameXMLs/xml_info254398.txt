			<description>Fighter In Sight is an aerial-based game for two players or more, which recounts the WW2 battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minimum length: 45 minutes (Playing can take longer, depending on scenario size and number of players) At the controls of your fighter planes, will you dare you to fight the fearsome Messerschmitt 109E over England, or the famous Japanese Zeros over the Pacific Ocean ? Will you succeed this battle ? Or will you have to escape the flaming wreck ? Fighter In Sight, with its historical scenarios, will allow you to relive this all over again. The game proposes a fresh approach of aerial combat. It will allow you to make mass struggle by involving many squadrons. Fighter In Sight was created with rules that will become more difficult as you play more scenarios. For example, when playing the first scenario you will learn how to use the speedometer. When playing the second one, you will also learn about the fuel management, and so on. The progressive rules have been prepared to address families as well as experienced players. It offers a simple, fast, realistic and easy to assimilate gameplay. It is possible to increase the realism and the difficulty level with additional parameters. Documenting and researching about historical background and technical facts has been an important part of the creation of Fighter in Sight so that the game would respect as much as possible the spirit of air combat, and still remain easy to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
