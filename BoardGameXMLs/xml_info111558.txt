			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The towering castles of evil incarnate, perched upon nameless mountains and looming over the villages below are but folklore, tales to be told on moonless nights and at harvest festival... aren't they? You would hope so, given that your road is leading into such a land, one of the wildest and least known regions of the North. And as you pass by tiny villages, and as the dark mountains rise ever higher and higher above and so cast their shadow over your road, and as black clouds obscure the moon, you continue telling yourself with quickening pace, perhaps to match your heart, that tales of the Undead are indeed only folklore, yet your heart continues to tell you something else, that this road, like all roads in this land, lead to a towering castle of evil incarnate...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
