							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Among Nobles: Promo Character Cards</name>
									
			<description>Alternate versions of some of the character cards (different backside). A single cards was given out for free with each game bought at Spiel'15, or they could be bought there as a complete set. They are sold out since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new cards include Sybille of Cleves, Charles IX de France, Charles de Solier, Mary I of England, Isabella d'Este, Isabel de Portugal, Edward VI of England, and Felipe II de Espa&amp;ntilde;a.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is what Among Meeples published as an update during their Kickstarter campaign:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody loves promo-cards! So we naturally decided to create some for game fairs, as &amp;quot;thank you's&amp;quot; to the people who have helped us etc. We ended up creating 8 new Character cards and a silly alternate artwork first player card with our faces on - the last one only in 14 copies, they are for family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While including them in the game was not an option, we really wanted to give something more to the backers. While people attending game fairs and buying the game can get one or two cards, we now bring you the option of getting them all as PnP. We will release them all in October, but we will also add one to the PnP files each time the number of likes (thumbs) on the big Essen preview list rises by 5 (it is currently at 74 likes, currently making it the 13th most liked game - out of more than 1.000!)! You can find links to the latest PnP edition in this backers-only update.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards all substitute other cards in the game. If you play using sleeves, simply swap the original card with the promo card before playing. If you do not use sleeves, the best method is properly to wait for the original to be turned over and then substitute it with the promo card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please notice, that this &amp;quot;Kickstarter mini-expansion&amp;quot; is designed as promo-cards, they are not perfectly balanced or nearly as thoroughly tested as our regular cards are. We do not recommend to use them in the first few games, but for experienced players, especially the ladies add more complexity during the first rounds - and alters the tactics immensely. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
