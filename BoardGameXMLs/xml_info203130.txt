			<description>Shrek SuperSlam is 3D multiplayer fighting game. The game features three multiplayer modes: &amp;quot;King of the Hill&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Melee&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Slammageddon&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;King of the Hill&amp;quot;, the object of the game is to stay atop of a hill the longest, while opponents try and knock each other off. The first player to reach 30 points wins. The longer the player stay on the hill, the more points she/he receive. In &amp;quot;Melee&amp;quot;, the objective is to earn as many slam points within a 2-minute time period. For attack, a word bank that says &amp;quot;Slam&amp;quot; will fill up. Once the bank has filled up, the player can unleash a Slam Attack which can hit multiple opponents. For each opponent who's hit, the player will receive a Slam Point, but if a player get slammed, they'll lose one. The player with the most slam points after the time limit stops wins. In &amp;quot;Slammageddon&amp;quot;, each single attack counts as a Slam. But, if a player manage to get a 'Max Slam Juice' potion in Slammageddon match and hit the opponent(s) with your slam, nothing happens.&lt;br/&gt;Every character has a &amp;quot;Slam&amp;quot; attack. Slams all have different effects. For example, Shrek's Green Storm attack will send his opponents flying as he undergoes flatulence and Pinocchio's nose extends and he flies towards enemies in an attempt to strike them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_SuperSlam,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_SuperSlam,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
