			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among wizards, there are few who devote themselves to learn and practice the secrets of the Arcane Healing arts. Their unique ability to heal earns them a warm welcome on most places and adventuring groups.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Many wizards employ familiars to assist them, but only a few have unlocked the power of their magic through the familiar itself. For them their familiar isn't just a sliver of their conscience, but a true friend and powerful companion.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Wizards who do not specialize, known as Generalists, apply their intellect to the arcane magic as a whole, and because of that have the most diversity of all arcane spellcasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
