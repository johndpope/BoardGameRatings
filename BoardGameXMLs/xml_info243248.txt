							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frog Master</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Atari APEX first prize winner.  Frog Master contains exciting arcade feature in addition to being a highly educational program.  It is a fast-moving high-concentration game for 1-4 players.  You score by making touchdowns on the opponents' goal line &amp;ndash; if his goalie doesn't get there first!  But your players (tadpoles and frogs) must be trained.  This is accomplished by giving them a reward at just the right moment when they do something right.  This takes precise timing and judgement.  Your critters must penetrate barriers and avoid evil line backs if they are to score.  Many will fall by the wayside, but some will get through.  As they learn you can look inside their heads to see how they think.  As you reward them, they reward you (the &amp;ldquo;thought processes&amp;rdquo; simulated demonstrate the basic type of animal learning &amp;ndash; operant conditioning &amp;ndash; widely studied in high school and college courses).  As you teach them they teach you how learning takes place.  Great graphics.  Runs in 16K.  Requires two joysticks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
