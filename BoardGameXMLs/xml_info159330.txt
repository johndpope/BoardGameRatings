			<description>Summary written by author/programmer for VGG&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Wars is a online browser game of social and military strategy, set in Krynea, a very special world of epic fantasy and magic. In it you will take the role of a great hero who commands his people and his armies to victory, helped by friends and alliance&amp;rsquo;s companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a HUGE and defined map with bridges, mountains, rivers and ports, that greatly impacts the strategy of the heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may choose their own style of play, focusing on military might, magic, diplomacy and adventuring, to name just a few possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of the same alliance can coordinate their attacks against a single target, and battles have a duration based on the number of attacking and defending troops. That allows for the arrival of reinforcements on both sides, which makes the battles highly tactical and intense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a FREE TO PLAY approach, where players can enjoy the game for free and optionally buy a Premium account and other upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
