			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terror. Sheer blind terror sublimated and spat back out of the barrel of an M16. The fear and isolation. The desperation to get out alive - just to get out and get home. A green hell populated by a people ho despise you and want to kill you. Or maim you. Or send you mad. This is the Vietnam War. This is GRUNT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRUNT attempts to be historically realistic, claustrophobic and packed with a great deal of nervous tension. GRUNT uses six-sided dice. Players take on the role of members of an infantry squad, part of the famous 1st Cavalry Division, their missions are frought with danger: snipers, booby traps, jungle ambushes, rocket-propelled grenades, friendly-fire ... and stress. Always stress, building up to unbearable levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
