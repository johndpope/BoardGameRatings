			<description>Dr. Fred&amp;rsquo;s mutated purple tentacle is about to take over the world, and only you can stop him!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally released by LucasArts in 1993 as a sequel to Ron Gilbert&amp;rsquo;s ground breaking Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle is a mind-bending, time travel, cartoon puzzle adventure game in which three unlikely friends work together to prevent an evil mutated purple tentacle from taking over the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, over twenty years later, Day of the Tentacle is back in a remastered edition that features all new hand-drawn, high resolution artwork, with remastered audio, music and sound effects (which the original 90s marketing blurb described as &amp;lsquo;zany!&amp;rsquo;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are able to switch back and forth between classic and remastered modes, and mix and match audio, graphics and user interface to their heart&amp;rsquo;s desire. We&amp;rsquo;ve also included a concept art browser, and recorded a commentary track with the game&amp;rsquo;s original creators Tim Schafer, Dave Grossman, Larry Ahern, Peter Chan, Peter McConnell and Clint Bajakian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day of the Tentacle was Tim Schafer&amp;rsquo;s first game as co-project lead, and a much beloved cult classic! This special edition has been lovingly restored and remade with the care and attention that can only come from involving the game's original creators. It&amp;rsquo;s coming to Windows, OSX, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in March 2016!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
