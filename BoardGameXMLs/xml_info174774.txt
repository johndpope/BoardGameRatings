			<description>Nutshell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Enchanted Kingdoms, happily ever after is only a wish away&amp;hellip;or so they say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But no one talks about what you have to give up to get your wish&amp;hellip;or what happens to those who don&amp;rsquo;t get their happily ever after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fairy tales are not just for children. As adults, many of us still find our hearts stopping when Red Riding Hood is devouredby the Big Bad Wolf, and we find ourselves cheering the Prince Phillip on as he slices his way through the thorn-covered vines to reach Sleeping Beauty&amp;rsquo;s tower. That&amp;rsquo;s because the tales change as we grow older: we see the Big Bad Wolf and the thorn-covered vines for what they are, and we find new reasons to sympathize with our heroes and heroines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stories become darker and, sometimes, more relevant. As C.S. Lewis wrote, as we grow bigger, so, too, do stories. With this pitch, I invite you to breathe new life into those old stories: if you look between the lines of black text on white pages, you&amp;rsquo;ll find shades of grey that will surprise you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
