			<description>Master Warrior XL: Fighting Brawl! For the Championship is a two player strategy game that is meant&lt;br/&gt;to be played quickly. As of the writing of these rules, this game has undergone absolutely no testing,&lt;br/&gt;although a (theoretically) functional prototype has been created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Master Warrior, players first design their fighter with six moves and then attempt to pummel their&lt;br/&gt;opponent into submission. During the game, each player is represented with a Fighter Card. Each&lt;br/&gt;Fighter Card is not only used to keep track of which abilities a fighter has, it also tracks where in the&lt;br/&gt;Arena the fighter is and which moves the fighter is planning to perform in the upcoming turn. Each&lt;br/&gt;player has Ten health at the beginning of the game and two energy, each of which should be noted on&lt;br/&gt;the player's Fighter Card. The winner is the player that wins two out of three rounds. A round is won&lt;br/&gt;when the opponent is reduced to zero health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the 4 Tile Contest:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freely available: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3175992#3175992&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3175992#3175992&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://drop.io/dpnp1c3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://drop.io/dpnp1c3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
