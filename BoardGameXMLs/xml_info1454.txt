			<description>RYB is quick-moving card-&amp;amp;-dice game for two to five players.  It is available for free download from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://invisible-city.com/play/32/ryb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://invisible-city.com/play/32/ryb&lt;/a&gt; and is scheduled for a 2002 release under the name Dragon Hatchery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In RYB, each player controls a pool of 2 red, 2 yellow, and 2 blue six-sided dice.  These dice are used to complete Goals that are played to the middle of the table.  Different goals require different combinations of dice.  If a player fails to complete a Goal, they can bank points on that Goal for future use, but those points are available to anyone who attemps to compete that Goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player also maintains a hand of cards.  In addition to Goals, there are other cards that allow players to take, swap, and borrow dice and to re-roll failed attempts to complete a Goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RYB makes an excellent children's game because encourages lots of addition, subtraction, and comparison of quantities while keeping the focus of the game away from the math itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
