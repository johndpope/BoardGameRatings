			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awaken the Dracula in you!&lt;br/&gt;Come with us, mere mortal!&lt;br/&gt;Release the vampire in you.&lt;br/&gt;Become the night wandering, blood sucking creature who lives most of his life in the darkness of old castles, and fears holy water and the sight of crucifixes.&lt;br/&gt;When the night is clear and the moon is full, you are nothing less than the famous Count Dracula himself, searching for life saving medallions in a village full of menacing enemies.&lt;br/&gt;Priests, witches, punks and the police are hot on your trail because the professor Van Helsing has warned everyone of your intentions to create chaos on Earth and become its master. Fortunately you possess the ability to eerily transform from Dracula into a bat or a werewolf and back again, according to which situation demands it.&lt;br/&gt;Beware, Van Helsing is out to get you and plans to sabotage your every move. Your wicked plans must be completed before dawn, for your life is at stake!&lt;br/&gt;Come, the night awaits...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
