							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lion and the Mouse</name>
									
			<description>The Lion and the Mouse is a spin-and-move game for two or four players. Each player has a Lion, a Mouse and a Hunter piece. The object of the four player game is to be the first to move one's Lion and Mouse pieces from their color's Start space to the corresponding Lion's Den space. In the two player game, each player controls two colors and must move both of their Lion and Mouse pieces to the appropriate dens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece has unique traits: the Hunter can &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; (lock down) a Mouse or send a Lion back to its Start space; the Mouse can free a Lion from a trap; the Lion can send a Hunter back to its start space from outside a trap space. The spinner determines which piece may move, though some spinner spaces permit the player to choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
