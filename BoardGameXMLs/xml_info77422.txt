			<description>Risk II is the official computer and online version of the classic board game Risk. Risk II was developed by MicroProse, designed by Deep Red and published by Hasbro Interactive in 2000. The graphics and sound far surpassed previous computer versions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the classic board game style of play, Risk II introduced new modes including a single-player tournament and a brand new concept called SameTime, in which turns are taken simultaneously by all players. Up to eight players can play, in any combination of human and computer opponents (as long as at least one player is human). Available computer opponents are an assortment of mostly 18th and 19th century generals: Campbell, MacKenzie, Marmont, Barbacena, D'Erlon, Maransin, Solignac, Sherbrooke, Aubert, Spencer, Taupin, Freire, Vauban, Baird, Bonaparte and Wellington. Each computer opponent has a different style of attack and a different reliability in honoring alliances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Risk II , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
