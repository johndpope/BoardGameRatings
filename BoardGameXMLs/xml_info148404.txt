							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Martial Arts: Technical Grappling</name>
									
			<description>Master Grappling . . . or Face Defeat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The canny warrior knows that grappling is fundamental to fighting. Any melee &amp;ndash; from a brawl to a swordfight &amp;ndash; could suddenly move into the clinch. Some fighters even specialize in such tactics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a hard subject to get a hold on, however; volumes have been written about leverage alone. GURPS Martial Arts: Technical Grappling brings this depth to GURPS. Expansions to the GURPS Basic Set and GURPS Martial Arts rules include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Trained Strength. Discover how technical proficiency complements raw power.&lt;br/&gt;     Control Points. Transform grappling from an all-or-nothing affair to a matter of degree.&lt;br/&gt;     Position Revisited. Achieve leverage by jockeying for not only posture, but also facing and orientation.&lt;br/&gt;     Armed Grappling. Control and entangle your foes with a surprising variety of melee weapons.&lt;br/&gt;     Combat Options. Narrow your focus with the One Foe option, exploit Committed Attack to force a posture change, pass a limb to trap your opponent, and more.&lt;br/&gt;     Techniques. More than 30 of them &amp;ndash; some new, some modified. Use an Escaping Parry to break a clinch, or Change Position to establish a weight advantage.&lt;br/&gt;     Fighting Styles. Learn Jacket Wrestling or Shuai Jiao &amp;ndash; and distinguish between between bear and lion attacks &amp;ndash; with six classic styles plus four specifically for animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether your campaign features athletes wrestling for prizes and honor, lawmen who must control and disarm suspects, or historical warriors trained to fight to the death, Martial Arts: Technical Grappling will add detail and realism to your battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement requires GURPS Martial Arts for GURPS Fourth Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
