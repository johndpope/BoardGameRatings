			<description>In this game half of the players are cargo vessels shipping goods to ports. Other half are buccaneers trying to steal the goods. Whenever a cargo vessel successfully delivers goods player is awarded points to the value of the cargo. Buccaneers receive points when they successfully steal the shipment. When the shipment is delivered or lost, the cargo vessel player draws a new card that indicates destination and value of new shipment. Game is played until all the shipment cards have been used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map consists of two different kinds of routes, open water and shallow. Players can freely move which ever way they prefer, but if a ship ends its move on shallow water the player has to draw an action card. Most of these cards either make the player sit out next turn or allows them to take new turn right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
