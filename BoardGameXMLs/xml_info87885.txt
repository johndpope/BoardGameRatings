			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ninety-Nine Nights II is a hack and slash title for the Xbox 360. It is the sequel to Ninety-Nine Nights. The game is set in the fantasy realm of Orphea, and darkness is swelling through the kingdom. The Lord of Night has mustered a legion of minions and is destroying everything in his path. The players control one of a group of five heroes that must stop the Lord of Night&amp;rsquo;s rampage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is loosely similar to the Dynasty Warriors series, with the player needing to combat hordes of weak enemies in order to complete their objectives. There are a number of different &amp;lsquo;super enemies&amp;rsquo; that have more health and special attacks, as well as bosses that are more dangerous still. Each mission has the same general goal &amp;ndash; fight through the masses to complete the set task. The tasks vary from defeating particular enemies to saving allies to destroying enemy structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose any of the five heroes as their character in each level, and the different characters provide a range of unique abilities. In addition, the different heroes each have a personalized story that provides a particular view on the war against the Lord of Night. There is an online co-op mode available for two players to team up. This mode includes specifically designed co-op levels that maintain the difficulty level for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
