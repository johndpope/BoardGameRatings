			<description>You are detectives and have 24 turns (every turn is one hour from the title) to found all clues and witness to stop the villains. Every turn you will take a SMS card that will do something with game. Sometimes it could help you - you can have extra steps to go in this round. Sometimes it can force you to find some clue again or to go to some specific place to recover something. You win if you will find all 16 clues/witness, before the ending of last turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-operative and very random game. Good to play with kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
