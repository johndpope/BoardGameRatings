			<description>Battlejack is a player versus player high-stakes mock gambling game. Players Draft their Fighters in secret. Actions are resolved using Blackjack but the players play versus each other instead of a dealer. The players are gamblers who create electronic avatars to fight in a virtual arena. Players may use the included Fighters, or create a custom Fighter using a combination of Abilities and Gear. Players also have a Cheat which breaks the rules and an Exploit which gives your Fighter a huge short term boost. Momemtum Tokens are earned for successfully attacking and defending and can be used to increase a Fighter's Abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Flow:&lt;br/&gt;Players may have their Fighter Run or Attack on their turn. If they Attack, the player may wager points  on the Attack, if the Attack hits, it deals additional damage based upon the size of the wager. If the Attack misses, the wager is lost. Attack damage is also modified by weapon type and a random damage element based upon margin of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Fighter runs out of points they die. A Buy In oppurtunity allows players to bring their Fighter back into the Arena. In the end the last Fighter standing in the Arena wins the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional copy of Battlejack may be used at the same to increase the number of players from 2-4 to 5-8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
