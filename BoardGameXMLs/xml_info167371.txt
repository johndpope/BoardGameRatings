			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;MY DADDY TOLD ME TO NEVER TRUST A MAN!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Golden Age of Comics, jungle adventure series were all the rage. In 1937, Will Eisner and Jerry Iger hit on the notion that a female jungle hero couldn't help but be popular with the core comic book audience what with the tendency of jungle heroes to not wear much in the way of clothes. So, into existence came Sheena... and shortly after that, the first &amp;quot;fan service&amp;quot; likewise appeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judy of the Jungle debuted in 1947, ten years after Sheena. She first appeared in Exciting Comics #55 where she became popular enough to knock long-time title star Black Terror from the cover within two issues of her debut. She enjoyed a 15-issue run, before fading into history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judy may not have been the most groundbreaking of characters, but she was visually distinct from the many other Sheena wanna-bes--where they wore varations of a striped animal skin bikin (like Sheena), Judy's attire was a tattered cocktail dress. She may also have the most unique set of &amp;quot;daddy issues&amp;quot; in all of comicdom. Even better, her adventures never wanted for action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And her series is titled Judy of the Jungle. This was a comic that was begging for a NUELOW Games edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judy of the Jungle: The Lords of Memnon features the first four Judy adventures, and the debut adventure of the first black jungle hero--Voodah. In addition to 38 pages of great comics, the book includes an all new talent tree and starting occupatiuon designed to bring jungle action to your d20 OGL Mddern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trivia: The creator of Voodah, Matt Baker, was among the first African Americans to draw comics for mainstream publishers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
