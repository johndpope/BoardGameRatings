							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golden Tee 3d Golf</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A huge step up for the Golden Tee franchise. This version offers significantly improved graphics. The game also made great advances in user control, primarily in the ability to moderate swing strength (as an aspect from the roller ball sensitivity.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version offers three courses (common throughout the series.) Also common for the next several versions offering one desert, one ocean (tropical) and one forrest course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this case it was Oak Valley, Ocean Pointe and Cactus Canyon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the normal rules for golf play. All scoring is done for stroke play (hazards, water penalties etc.) You are provided with a standard set of clubs. 2-9 irons, 3 and 5 woods and a driver. Sand and pitch wedge and a putter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the swing you can turn left or right. By rolling the roller ball (controller) back in a certain direction (for backswing) then foward in a certain direction, you can accomplish different shots including slices, hooks, fades and knock down shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also keeps track of high scores for each course including:&lt;br/&gt;-the thirty best scores -Great golfer points (scored by getting shots within 5' of the hole from at least 50 yards out)&lt;br/&gt;-longest drive&lt;br/&gt;-longest putt&lt;br/&gt;-fewest putts&lt;br/&gt;-most greens hit&lt;br/&gt;-most fairways hit&lt;br/&gt;-most birdies&lt;br/&gt;-most eagles or better&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
