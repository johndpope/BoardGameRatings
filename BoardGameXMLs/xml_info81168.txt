			<description>From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Japanese hentai bishoujo (adults only) game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;My name is Tachibana Yuuji, a regular student with no particular plans for the future - until my parents left for Hawaii on a business trip last fall, leaving me in the care of my uncle in the wintry countryside of Hokkaido.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Small-town life on Japan's northern island didn't have time to get dull, as from the moment I got there I was reunited with my cousin and childhood friend Saki. She's pretty demanding, but when I'm hanging out with her and her school friends I don't mind; as I get close to them I feel like I'm finding meaning in life that I didn't know I was looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Legend says there is a flower that blooms here in the depth of winter... as the twilight deepens and a snowflake melts in the palm of my hand, I stand with a beautiful girl by my side. Will we be able to uncover its mystery in this fleeting moment?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a captivating story from veteran scriptwriter and novelist Kitagawa Samui and beautiful, subtly erotic art from doujin artist and game illustrator Shikei, G-Collections proudly presents a classic &amp;quot;renai&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;true love&amp;quot;) bishoujo game. With the windswept background of the Hokkaido winter countryside as its setting, full of moments of laughter, joy, and tender passion, Snow Sakura is a heartwarming tale of romance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
