			<description>Publisher summary&lt;br/&gt;You are elderly people in a Nursing home. No one comes to see you anymore. You want to talk with others, tell them about your life, your dreams, and your memories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge Comments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probably one of the more depressing entries we&amp;rsquo;ve read but also one that can be very powerful as well. As you literally burn through the memories of your nursing home patients it becomes harder and harder to relate new stories as you can&amp;rsquo;t remember the things that came before. The time of play can be variable on how large a piece of paper you write on and is a great small game for those that want to try something a little more serious with their group. - Jef and Jon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A timely gut punch, this one about our tragic loss of memory as we grow older. I particularly appreciate the lack of die rolls in this game; randomization wouldn&amp;rsquo;t improve this concept. You have your memories&amp;hellip;until you don&amp;rsquo;t. - Brent Newhall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was one of three winners in the 200 Word RPG Challenge 2017200 Word RPG challenge 2017[/rpgseries]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
