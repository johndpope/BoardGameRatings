			<description>Tips! is a game of hot plates &amp;amp; cold revenge. Hustle for the biggest tips, sabotaging co-workers along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~~~How does it play?~~~~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serve your customers drinks, appetizers, main dishes and desserts in large quantities. The number of menu items you can serve of each type is constrained by the party size, also the menu items need to be served in a particular order (no dessert before the main meal in this place!). Minimize the number of times you get an order wrong, have customers run out the door without paying, and taking annoying restroom breaks (try to just hold it in!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, each player counts up their tips - whoever has the most wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
