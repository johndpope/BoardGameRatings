			<description>The game is played with 33 pegs in 33 holes arranged in a cross. To start, you select one peg to remove from the board. Thereafter, you try to remove as many pegs from the board as you can by &amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot; them. To jump a peg, you take one peg, move it over an adjacent peg, and put it in the hole on the other side. The peg that got &amp;quot;jumped&amp;quot; is removed from the board, thereby creating another hole that other pegs can jump into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to remove as many pegs as you can before no further jumps are possible. Getting down to one remaining peg is difficult, but for even more of a challenge, try to have the last peg wind up in the hole you started with in the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
