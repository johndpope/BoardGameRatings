							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cars: Mater-National Championship</name>
									
			<description>The game focuses on the first ever Mater-National race held in Radiator Springs by Lightning McQueen and features an improved world as well as new characters. Mike and Sulley from Monster Trucks, Inc are in the video game and Sulley can race with all the monster trucks, Count Spatula, The Crippler, Ginormous, Monster McQueen, and Monster Mater. Mike is featured in a minigame which involves picking up &amp;quot;laugh canisters&amp;quot;. Some other characters featured are Emma, a small white and pink rally car from England, Philip, a red and white, over-excited British 1937 Cord Model 812 who has trouble remembering which side of the road to drive on in America, Gudmund, a cocky 1980 Audi Quattro rally car from Sweden who has loads of headlights and loves driving through caves at night, Otto, a German tuner car who doesn't understand the concept of speed limits, Koji, a red, grey and white Japanese drift car who loves drifting, Giovanni, a tough-looking but very nice red Ferrari Enzo from Italy, and Yuri (possibly named after Yuri Gagarin), a dark green Russian 1962 Toyota Crown. Ornament Valley, Radiator Springs, and Tailfin Pass have all been updated. In Radiator Springs, new rock formations have been cut, and Fillmore has opened a nature park. In Ornament Valley, there is a construction zone, an airport, and several new rock formations to explore. In Tailfin Pass, roads have been completely revamped, and there is a new mine and an abandoned western town to drive through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cars Mater-National&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
