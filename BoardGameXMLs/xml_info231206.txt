			<description>Orbots is an easy-to-learn and quick-playing game in which you maneuver your orbital robots (orbots) around a tiny asteroid to collect power crystals in different combinations to generate the most power (points) by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orbots features just a few simple rules for movement, combined with a few simple rules for scoring. Each turn consists of moving your orbot up, down, left or right to reach a power crystal to add to your collection, or to reach a tunnel to move to another part of the board. There are four different types (colors) of crystals and each resonates at a different frequency (values of 0-5 or 0-8, depending on the number of players). Combining crystals of the same type, but different frequencies is what generates power and scores points. The greater the difference between two crystals, the more power is generated. There are also special crystals that increase the power generated by a pair of crystals, or that changes how crystals combine, boosting power if you can get to them in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orbots also includes optional goals beyond simply generating the most power, for a more strategic and challenging layer of gameplay, as well as added replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of simple rules, intuitive strategy and quick gameplay makes Orbots a great gateway game for newer or younger players, as well as a compelling and satisfying filler game for more experienced gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orbots is currently in late-stage development and is scheduled to launch on Kickstarter in the fall of 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
