			<description>From box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conceived and designed by Larry Miller.&lt;br/&gt;For one driver at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OFFICIAL ENTRY FORM:  The National Enduro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STARTING TIME:  Sunrise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COURSE DESCRIPTION:  Incredibly brutal endurance circuit.  From the break of dawn through the dead of night.  From Baja's scorching desert sands through the ice-covered plains of Montana.  On hairpin turns to Tennessee, to the zero-visibility of a New England fog.  And back.  There is no finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DRIVER QUALIFICATIONS:  You never fear, never sleep.  Your only goal in life is to break your own last record, rev that extra RPM, race that extra mile.  Spend most of your time in fast lanes.  Usually see competitors in your rearview mirrow.  You are your own idol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAR REQUIREMENTS:  Rugged as a tank, quick as a jet.  So responsive it knows where you're going before you do.  Low-built, high-powered, fuel-injection perfection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race is set.  Are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instruction manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strap on your goggles.  Sink into your seat.  And leave all your fears in the pit.  You're about to enter the race of your life.  You'll be requred to pass lots of cars each day.  Through sun and snow and fog and ice, sunrise to sunset -- as fast as you can, as long as you can.  Welcome to the National Enduro!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fasten your seatbelts, the National Enduro is ready to take you on.  This high-powered cross-country race winds like a bad mountain road.  Your odometer registers mile after mile of changing weather conditions, shifting gears and squealing brakes -- you're passing, always passing.  Be careful out there.  Complete as many of the 99 days as you can.  Enduro.  Can you endure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
