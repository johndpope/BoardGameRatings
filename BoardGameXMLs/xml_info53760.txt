			<description>Shan Tu is a combination of Halma and Checkers that features a three-cornered board made up of a grid of circles, each connected with up to six adjacent circles.  (The board could easily be drawn with hexagons instead of circles and lines.)  The game is meant for three players but can be played by two.  Its pieces (ten per player) begin in one corner and move to an opponent's starting corner to be crowned, then must move to one of three central circles in order to win the game.  The first player to get one king to the central circles wins.  Pieces, be they ordinary un-promoted pieces or Kings, may move in any direction and capture opposing pieces by jumping.  Kings have no advantage other than that they are required to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to The International Society for Board Game Studies, Shan Tu dates back at least to an 1895 advertisement describing it as &amp;quot;A worthy successor to Gobang, Reversi, Halma and other favourites.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
