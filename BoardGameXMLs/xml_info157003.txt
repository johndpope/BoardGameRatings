			<description>Stalingrad Solitaire: Death Knell of the German 6th Army 1942 is a game focusing on the German assault on Stalingrad and focuses on the time period of September 2, 1942 - September 4, 1942. While primarily a solitaire game, the special edition also contains optional two player rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls the German forces and must battle the Russian Army to control as many regions of Stalingrad as possible. The game is played by deploying German units on a map of Stalingrad. The AI (or an optional second player) controls the Russian forces through movement, placement, and attack rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays out over 15 turns (although shorter scenarios are provided). Each turn, the player will place Russian forces in the Ferry areas on the Volga River (these units are placed upside down and are not revealed until attacked). The German player will then raise troops and move units to instigate combat. The AI rules then dictate how the Russian units will counter attack and conduct movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is determined by controlling all the Urban areas of Stalingrad at the end of a turn. The game can end early if the player achieves the victory conditions before the end of turn 15. If the player doesn't control the Urban areas by the end of the game, it is a loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
