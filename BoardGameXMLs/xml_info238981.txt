			<description>Stau-Mau Mau is a family game from the 'Haba Reisspeile' collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar to Uno.  You get to a number of different car tokens in different colors.  On the central gameboard you need to put down your tokens and get rid of all of them.  You can put a vehicle after a vehicle of the same color or the same shape.  As you lay out your pieces you create a big traffic jam across the board.  Some cars have no special function others make the next player to skip a turn, give the player an extra turn or makes the next player take more tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get rid of all your tokens, when you have one token left, you need to shout something or you need to take a new token from the reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played totally on magnetic surfaces which is nice.  The players get their magnetic tokens on parking lot cards in their hands to keep them secret.  The board is laid out in the tin lid thus making it magnetic itself.  This makes it perfect to play everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 32 car tokens, 3 parking lots and one main board in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
