							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rant!</name>
									
			<description>The players on one team draw a card, which describes an everyday nuisance that the players on that team must complain about. The card also indicates a few words or phrases that the players cannot use in their rants. Members of the opposing teams attempt to guess what the rant is about. Score for being the first team to figure out the rant and for successfully ranting. The next team then takes its turn. Play until everyone is hoarse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
