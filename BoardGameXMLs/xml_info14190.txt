			<description>In the late sixties, Electronic Data Controls Corporation released a series of electronic board games under their &amp;quot;Computer Games&amp;quot; line, primarily consisting of two-player sports games. The games all used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game combined five of the earlier sports titles into one game. The football field was printed on the wooden board, and two double-sided cardboard overlays contain the playing fields for the other games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was followed by the 1974 release of this smaller format five-in-one system. Instead of using the oversized wooden boards characteristic of the original EDC games, this edition uses a smaller plastic board which only displays the game matrix. Two double-sided cardboard overlays contain the matrices for the other sports. The individual playing fields are printed on cardstock panels. Plastic markers are used to record the position of the ball/puck and show other game stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
