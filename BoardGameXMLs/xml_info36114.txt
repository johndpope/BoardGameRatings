			<description>Inspired by Fred Saberhagen's Berserker series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Human fleet vs a Berserker Ship. Abstract skirmish level Ship combat. Each figure represents a single Ship (unit).  Victory: Destroy the opposing fleet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 grid or chessboard. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the ships. The Human Fleet player has a force of sixteen ships against the single Berserker ship. Each ship is rated for hit points, speed, and attack range. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck and card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
