							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Red Goblin Games Free Sample Pack</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lot of us here at Little Red have been involved with gaming for a while now. It's helped us out when times seamed bad and helped us lift other people us when they needed a hand. So it's with that same spirit of community that we want to give back. Presented here in these pages is a lot of hard work from a lot of talented people. We've spent a great deal of time putting together this little gift to the community we've come to know and love. We hope&lt;br/&gt;you have as much fun playing it as we did making it! In addition to the community, we'd like to thank the people&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;who've made this community what it is today. People like Dave Arneson, Gary Gygax, Skip Williams, Monte Cook, Jason Bulmahn, Jonathan Tweet, Lisa Stevens, and all the people at both Paizo and Wizards who have put so many hours in making this hobby so much more than &amp;quot;just rolling dice&amp;quot;. (Your work really means a lot to us here at Little Red.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's loaded with free goodies for you to enjoy! Here are just some of the things included in our gift to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two new modules, including &amp;quot;A Face Only Stolkholm Could Love!&amp;quot; from our public playtests.&lt;br/&gt;     New monsters, including The Man Eating Lily and The Lonely People!&lt;br/&gt;     The new path for druids: The Bestial Champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
