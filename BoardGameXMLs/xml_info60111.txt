			<description>Includes GM's Screen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Mega-City One's Most Wanted! This is the definitive collection of all the famous personalities, good and bad, that have prowled through the Judge Dredd comic strips of 2000AD. Within you will find all the rules and histories for characters such as the Angel Gang, Stan Lee, DeMarco PI (and her simian bodyguard, Travis Perkins), and many more, including the greatest judges ever to have graced the Justice Department - Judges Dredd, Anderson and Hershey. We have also managed to squeeze in some of the unique equipment, weapons and vehicles these famous people use, as well as a couple of prestige classes that will allow your players to emulate their heroes (and villains). Mega-City One's Most Wanted will truly elevate your games of Judge Dredd to a new and exciting level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
