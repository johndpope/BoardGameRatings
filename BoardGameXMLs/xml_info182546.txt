			<description>Hammer and Forge is an expansion for Advanced Song of Blades and Heroes or for Fightin' Fungi (the two rule sets are identical except that Fightin' Fungi has additional rules specific to fungus creatures).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hammer and Forge provides additional rules, background and profiles for the Dwarf race and its allies and enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hammer and Forge supplement was originally released through a Kickstarter campaign which also funded the production of a line of miniatures (primarily Dwarves), but as is standard in the Song of Blades and Heroes system, players can use whatever miniatures they prefer or have on hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
