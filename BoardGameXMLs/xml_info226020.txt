							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exposed: The Anti-Bullying Game</name>
									
			<description>The card deck consists of 52 multiple-choice trivia cards and 52 bully or target cards. In rummy fashion, players draw from the deck and try to meld sets of three bully or target cards in which all the cards of a set are the same or all are different. If a trivia card is drawn, eg, &amp;quot;School bullies often target which type of Kids,&amp;quot; a player may earn chips for a correct answer. Melds also grant chips, as does emptying your hand. The person with the most chips when someone empties his hand is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
