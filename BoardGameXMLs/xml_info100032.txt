							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dungeons of Dregnor</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A young prince sent by your father to deliver a present to King Dregnor, you are taken by surprise when Dregnor seizes your gift, accuses you of theft, and throws you in his deepest, darkest dungeons. Your cellmate, a very old man, tells you you'll end up waiting for a trial till you're old and gray, and escape is the only way out. He says he'll help if you take him along, but what if he's one of Dregnor's spies? Does he really know the way through this dangerous, underground maze? Wraiths, giant diggers, and the Executioner are only some of the hazards you'll face if you try to escape! Will you stay in you cell, hoping your father will come to your rescue? Or will you brave the dungeon maze and fight your way to freedom? The dangers are great, but the rewards are too. Will you fall victim to hidden traps and perils or choose wisely and find fame and fortune?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
