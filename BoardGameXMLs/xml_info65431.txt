			<description>The board represents a Basketball half-court.   The court is divided into 63 squares that are marked with odds for making a shot from that spot on the court.  Squares closer to the basket are marked with odds for both a guarded and an open shot.  There is a movement track that runs through the outside squares.  Each player has two &amp;ldquo;court decks&amp;rdquo; and one &amp;ldquo;shoot deck.&amp;rdquo;  Most individual plays are resolved by drawing from these decks of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In normal play, the offense begins with the ball along the outside track.  Both players draw from their court deck.  If the offense has the higher number, the ball can moved (usually closer to the basket) up to the difference between the two numbers.  If the defense has the higher number the ball is moved the difference of the two numbers along the outside track.  If the numbers are equal, special actions such as fouls and turnovers occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player shoots, a card is drawn from the &amp;ldquo;shoot deck&amp;rdquo; and the shot resolved according to the odds printed on the square where the shot occurs.  The color of the court deck card used to arrive at that square determines whether it is an open or guarded shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for rebounds, fast breaks, 3-pt. shots, 24 sec. clock, &amp;amp; fouls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
