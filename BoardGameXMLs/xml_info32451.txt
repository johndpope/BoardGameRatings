			<description>Each player starts with $10,000 and a pawn at Bangor, Maine. There are three cards for each of eight commodities. Each commodity may be bought, one at a time, in any one of three different cities. Each commodity may be sold when a player holds all three cards of that commodity at a profit in San Francisco, St. Louis and New York. Players are free to barter with each other. In turn, a player rolls the dice and advances one&amp;rsquo;s pawn along the path the total value of the dice. A player may stop short to conduct business in a city. Some spaces between cities force a player to draw a chance card. Some routes between cities only allow one-way traffic. The game ends when a player reaches New York with all three cards of one commodity. That player receives a $1000 bonus and all players must cash in their commodities at face value immediately. The player with the most cash is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
