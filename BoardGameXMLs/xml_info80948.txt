							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Original Flatland Role Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a world of two dimensions and plane geometry, in which the very idea of height is considered insanity and the darkest heresy. Where the only thing that matters is the straightness of your sides and the regularity of your angles. Where the slightest deviation from the norm can lead to arrest, imprisonment, execution (and consumption by your peers) or a lingering death by starvation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Flatland. Enjoy your stay . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Original Flatland Role Playing Game includes complete rules for a setting where characters are supposed to be two dimensional, with three adventures and four adventure outlines, a Flatland wargame by Matthew Hartley (Tusk, Aeronef, etc.), full-colour cut out character figures, extensive background material including the complete novel Flatland by Edwin A. Abbott, and much more. Best of all, by buying it you're supporting charity:  All of the author's income from this game is donated to M&amp;eacute;decins Sans Fronti&amp;egrave;res (Doctors Without Borders)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
