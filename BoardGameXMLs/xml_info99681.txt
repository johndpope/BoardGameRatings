							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moto Racer 3</name>
									
			<description>Moto Racer 3 expands on the offerings found in Moto Racer 2, having more types of races including multiplayer online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a motorcyclist in races on various terrain. The game does not have a career mode, but instead contains many race modes: speed, Supercross/Motocross, Freestyle, Trial, and Traffic. Speed mode places the player in courses with long straights and slight curves, in order to allow the driver to reach the high speeds. The courses in the mode are set so the player can gain speed. Supercross/Motocross uses dirt tracks with hills in races designed to make driving difficult. Freestyle gives the player a time-limit to perform as many tricks as possible for points. Trial mode requires the player to maneuver an obstacle course on a motorcycle. Traffic mode is a race between two participants in the streets of Paris requiring the player to avoid oncoming traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Moto Racer 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
