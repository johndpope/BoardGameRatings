							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Covered With Glory</name>
									
			<description>From the Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Covered With Glory is designed to reflect the tactics of the Napoleonic period at the level where those tactics had the most impact - the company and battalion. The unique movement and morale systems make the obstacles faced by officers of the period all too evident as players try to coordinate the movements of the units within their brigade or division. This is a fast paced, easy to learn, easy to play games system in which exciting and challenging battles can be played with as few as three or four battalions on each side or as much as a division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a game of high strategy. It is a game of tactics at a level too long ignored or simply not understood. It is a game about the common soldier and how he was led, maneuvered and deployed as he covered himself with glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
