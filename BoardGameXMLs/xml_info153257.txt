			<description>Magi is a game of wizard duels, mixing strategy and RPG elements with the dynamism and immediacy of fighting games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create a character and pit him or her in a series of duels against other wizards. Each battle grants you more spells and power, letting you expand your strategy. But time goes by and no mage is immortal. Sooner or later, your character will have to face the final challenge &amp;mdash; the battle with the death itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why it&amp;rsquo;s cool:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tough challenge that makes you work for victory.&lt;br/&gt;    Multitude of spells and characters to experiment with.&lt;br/&gt;    Each spell and ability has its unique tactical purpose.&lt;br/&gt;    It&amp;rsquo;s pure nerdy fun, with builds, strategies, and what not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
