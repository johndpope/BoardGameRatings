			<description>from designer's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a Hexhex board divided into concentric sections. I don't know the best board size, and I don't yet know the best way to section the board. The different versions of the game arise from the different ways to section the board. I'll start by describing the rules with the simplest board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The board begins empty. One player owns the black stones, and the other owns the white. Starting with Black, the players take turns.&lt;br/&gt; 2. On your turn, you must either place one stone on any empty space on the inner section, or two stones on any two empty spaces in the outer section.&lt;br/&gt; 3. The game ends when the board is full. The player with the largest group wins.  If the players&amp;rsquo; largest groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which aren't the same size.  Whoever owns the larger of the two wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
