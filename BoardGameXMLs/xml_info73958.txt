			<description>&amp;quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is a simulation computer game that simulates theme park management. Developed by Chris Sawyer and published by Infogrames, the game was released on October 15, 2002. It is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon and is the second game in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series. In 2004, a sequel, Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, was released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the game is to complete scenarios by successfully building and maintaining theme parks. Players can choose between various attractions, including transport rides, gentle and thrill rides, roller coasters, water rides, and shops or stalls. The player can further modify the park by changing the land and scenery. Players must satisfy the needs of the visitors by building food stalls, drink stands, bathrooms, souvenir shops, and facilities, like ATMs, information kiosks, and more. Players must balance their budget in their expenses and income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most notable differences from the original game is that RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 features a more robust system for building structures, in which one can lay each piece of wall and roof individually. Additionally, the game allows a piece of scenery to be locked in place and have its height adjusted, providing greater flexibility. The mechanics in the original game made custom building construction more difficult. Another departure from the original was allowing any ride or shop to be fixed at any elevation, including underground. Previously, only rides that had tracks could be built underground, since the player had to build the first piece above the ground, then extend the track below ground afterward.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
