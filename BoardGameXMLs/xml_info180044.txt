							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Descended from Dragons: Kobold Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huge Draconic Power in a Tiny Package!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite underdogs, kobolds have been a fan favorite since 3rd Edition. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s their connection to dragons, and the promise of tapping the potential of their draconic blood, or their love of cruel and unusual traps and hazards, or simply their adorable high voices and the silly things they say, kobolds are great fun and provide lots of options for player characters&amp;hellip;except for the fact that mechanically, they&amp;rsquo;re about as weak as you can get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book aims to give players who want the fact that their character is a kobold to be more mechanically relevant a way to make that happen, while also providing support for kobold characters of a variety of classes that don&amp;rsquo;t typically make much mechanical sense for kobolds. Included are the kobold crafter, an alchemist archetype that specializes in traps, the kobold jester, a bard archetype that is a master of appearing weaker than he really is, the kobold king, a fighter archetype that focuses on improving his ability scores and eliminating their racial weaknesses, the kobold revolutionary, a ranger archetype that focuses on combating larger foes, and mobilizing other kobolds as allies, the kobold spell scale, a sorcerer archetype that allows them to unlock greater draconic power than sorcerers of other races could ever dream of, and the kobold mystic, a wizard archetype that is adept at avoiding harmful magic, and gains some spontaneous casting ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
