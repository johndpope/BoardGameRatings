			<description>Matapan is a card game simulating the battle of Cape Matapan, which took place in March 1941 between Italian Regia Marina and English Royal Navy.&lt;br/&gt;Matapan is a turn-based game for two players. It's played over a grid of 8x8 cards. Alternatingly, each player turns over one of his and one of his opponent's cards. When both cards show ships, a battle takes place.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score more points than your opponent, by sinking his ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
