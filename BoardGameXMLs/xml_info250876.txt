			<description>Ideastorm is a game full of crazy inspirations and imaginations! Players are given plenty of vocabulary, then use their creativity to connect them to one another to create new words or phrases. However, they should always be aware of what other players are thinking, trying to get the same answers as them to win the game. This may sound easy, but Ideastorm is not really that simple!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, players use the three words writen on each of the two cards in the middle pile to figure out a different word or phrase, then write it down on their own whiteboard. If any player writes the same answer as another, both of them score points. The two cards with words change every turn, so the playing experience is full of surprises and never repeats. Once a player has 25 points or more, the game is over. Whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
