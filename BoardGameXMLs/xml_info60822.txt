			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of turning in your gear after every mission? Running a game with no home office? Just want to kill things and keep their stuff? No problem! The Big Score presents three all-new system upgrades that completely change the way you handle Spycraft gear! Now you can play that apocalyptic or mercenary game you've been considering and track your character's personal hoard every step of the way. Or you can raid a few dungeons or arcologies with cold, hard cash on the line. Collect relics, ancient baubles, and other incredible items built right into the setting and story. There's a gear option for every game in town - just choose a base system, decide whether to add Loot, and away you go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Stockpile system converts all your gear picks to Possessions so you can play an uninterrupted campaign with otherwise default rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Cash n' Carry system lets you play with a traditional cash economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Loot system introduces special prizes your characters can track down and win as mission objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed statistics for modern Common Items, including all kits in the Spycraft 2.0 Rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New gear-related campaign qualities and events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Three new sheets for tracking your gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
