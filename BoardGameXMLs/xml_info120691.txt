							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Color Claim</name>
									
			<description>Color Claim is a two player game played on a 5x6 board using Looney Pyramids. At the start of the game, two multicolored stashes are placed on the board, one pyramid per space. Players then alternate turns moving pyramids or stacks of pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No colors are owned by the players at the start of the game. Whenever a player moves onto single pyramid, that player can choose to capture the pyramid instead of stacking on it. When a pyramid is captured, any other captured pyramid belonging to that player is removed from the game. The player now owns the captured color and will score points for that color at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue to move pyramids and stacks until no more moves are possible. Scores are then calculated, with stacks scoring points according to the number of pyramids they contain and the size of the pyramid on top. The player who owns the highest scoring color wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
