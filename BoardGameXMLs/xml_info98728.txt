			<description>The gates have opened: Embark on a perilous journey into the nether realms of the &amp;bdquo;Underworld&amp;ldquo;. Command hordes of mindless undead minions. Summon the mighty and vicious Archdemon to bring terror and destruction upon your foe. Foil your opponent&amp;rsquo;s evil plans with nifty counter-magic and even meddle with the very fabric of space and time to go forth victorious from the epic battles fought in the &amp;ldquo;Underworld&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first Expansion Set for Elemental Clash, &amp;ldquo;Underworld&amp;rdquo;, brings you 66 all new cards to customize and enhance your Basic Set decks. Apart from many exciting and powerful colored ones, &amp;ldquo;Underworld&amp;rdquo; introduces neutral Creatures and Spells. Furthermore, the new &amp;ldquo;Double Element Stones&amp;rdquo; can be utilized to make multi-element decks even more viable and efficient. So do not fear, young wizard apprentice, and delve into the dark depths of the &amp;ldquo;Underworld&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent&amp;rsquo;s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). Is a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
