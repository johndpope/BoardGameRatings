			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WTF is, on the surface, a game about cards and points.  You play a card, you gain or lose some points, and the player with the most points when the GAME OVER card is played wins. But there's a catch or two: First, the GAME OVER card is double-sided, so everyone knows where it is at all times.  Second, over half of the cards in WTF contain blanks and you get to fill them in and finish the rules!  You might get a card that lets you determine how many points players gain or lose, or you might get a card that lets you require all players to perform some ridiculous task of your choosing.  Each card simply must follow on the &amp;quot;suit&amp;quot; of the previous card -- but many of the suits are made up by the players as they play! The big catch is that you actually write on the cards each game, so your deck is always changing.  The result is that the card that seemed funny when it made the player to your left eat his own earwax is a lot less funny when it comes back around to the player on your right!  For even more excitement, you can mix up your deck with another friend's deck and see what happens. It&amp;rsquo;s up to everyone to decide how far you have to go to get points and keep the GAME OVER card out of the point leader&amp;rsquo;s hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
