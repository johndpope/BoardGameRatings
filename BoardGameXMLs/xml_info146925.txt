							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gunslingers Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Gunslingers''  is a card game set in the wild west, where each player  must build up a posse of gunslingers to fight it out to the death. The player with the last gunslinger left alive wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game set up procedure location cards are randomly placed to create a western town for the players to move around. Each location the players visit opens up options that they can interact with to aid them in building up a strong group of gunslingers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting the game with just one gunslinger card each, the players must move around the town and reach specific locations to play action cards, hire gunslingers or buy and sell items or weapons in an effort to build up their posse and eventually shoot it out to the death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By buying Items or weapons the players can enhance their gunslingers abilities during specific actions, such as giving a gunslinger a holster during a shoot out action will make them faster on the draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action cards get the players gambling at the saloon, mining at the mine, brawling outside the sheriffs office and capturing gunslingers from the rival posses, only then marching them off to the gallows and sending the prisoner to boot hill. Many more actions cards exist that can change the strategies of the game, like the explosion card, that could blow up the train station and thus prevent the only place the players can go to hire more gunslingers, their only choice would be to wait until it was rebuilt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as one player has hired a gunslinger from the train station, the fighting can begin so you had better earn some cash fast and be that first player or you may be sent to boot hill sooner than you think........&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
