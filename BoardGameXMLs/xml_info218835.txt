							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Monster from the Other Side</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scream cuts through the night. As the group looks out the windows at the small inn, they see a teenager carried away by a huge bat! What was supposed to be a calm night in a small town, turns into a monster-mystery where everyone seems to owe everyone else something...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster from the Other Side is the first official adventure specially written for the table-top/roleplaying game Drudge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure takes place in a small un-named town, somewhere in Europe during 1901. Time and place is easily changed, and even the genre can be tweaked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small horror/mystery adventure for a 3-4 person strong group. Both table-top and roleplaying sessions are incorporated in the adventure, taking all of Drudge!'s rules into effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster from the Other Side is a fun, quick and interesting adventure which can easily be expanded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
