							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Invisible Man</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to become invisible and escort a criminal to the police station.&lt;br/&gt;The player who first succeeds in doing this wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four Invisible Men on the platform, each outlined in a differen colour. The players choose the one thy are going to represent and take a counter and five sections marked A, B, C, D and E to match the colour of their invisible man. Cover the invisible man with these sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start on the inner track from the letter 'A' corresponding to the colour of their counter.&lt;br/&gt;After spinning, each player in turn either moves his counter round the board the number of spaces indicated by the arrow when it stops or he takes a card, he cannot do both.&lt;br/&gt;On whatever letter a move ends, the player removes the section bearing that letter from his invisible man.&lt;br/&gt;Should the move end on 'risk' the player must take a card and follow the instructions on it. In either case this ends his turn  which passes to the player on his left. Should a move end on a letter from which the section has already been removed this also ends his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the first player who manages to remove all sections from his invisible man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
