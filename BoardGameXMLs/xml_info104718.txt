			<description>This game is another game in the Games on a Line Series of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players are challenged to occupy at least half of the board.  During their turn, players do one of the three possible move types: place one more pieces on an empty space, remove one or more pieces from one of their stacks on the board, or move one of their pieces (or stacks).  Players can remove pieces either through custodial capture, or moving one of their pieces as part of a group that is larger than a group of an opponent that is adjacent to the group that pieces are part of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meshok is the English spelling of how a word in Russian for &amp;quot;pocket&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rucksack&amp;quot;, connected also to the military term involving salients in lines during combat, is pronounced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
