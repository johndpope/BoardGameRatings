							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doomdark&#039;s Revenge</name>
									
			<description>Doomdark's Revenge is the sequel to the seminal ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC game The Lords of Midnight by Mike Singleton. It has similar game mechanics to Lords, but adds more detail and complexity with the number of characters and locations increased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Doomdark's defeat in the first game, word reaches his daughter, Shareth the Heartstealer, that he has been overthrown. Enraged by this (not out of filial devotion, but because she had been planning a particularly gruesome parricide of her own), she decides to take revenge on the chief architect of his downfall, Luxor the Moonprince, by kidnapping his son Morkin. The game revolves around Luxor and his companions Rorthron the Wise and Tarithel the Fey (Morkin's beloved), and their attempts to rescue Morkin and defeat Shareth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has five factions to be recruited or fought: the Fey, the Barbarians, the Dwarfs, the Giants, and the Icelords. The main difference between this game and Lords is that the lords now all move and react independently, no longer content to sit in their castles and wait to be recruited. Shareth also moves around, attempting to recruit armies and lords to her cause, so a major part of the game involves recruiting sufficient forces to counter hers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This makes the relationship between lords very important, as some lords can only be recruited by certain others. Certain lords are vassals of certain others, and some may only be recruited by their lieges. Recruiting a liege does not, however, automatically recruit all his vassals, nor their respective vassals. Lords may also cooperate, recruit and fight each other independently, making the world much more dynamic than the previous game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many magic items to be found, most belonging to a single lord and having 'power in battle', as well as magic crowns, and the landscape and its features hold many surprises for the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doomsdark's Revenge reverses the first game's victory conditions by giving the computer only a single goal, the death of Luxor, Shareth wins outright if Luxor is slain. The player has many possible levels of victory, ranging from the mere rescue of Morkin and retreat to Midnight to the destruction of Shareth and the safe return home of Luxor, Morkin, Rorthron and Tarithel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Doomdark's Revenge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
