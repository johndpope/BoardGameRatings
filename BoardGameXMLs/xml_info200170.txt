							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myth: Dark Frontier</name>
									
			<description>The last, fading light of hope lies behind the walls of Farrenroc, the city on the edge of Darkness. You've walked its stalwart streets, tasted of its determined harvests, and have in turn sworn your life to its defense. Death does not frighten you near so much as the thought of Farrenroc falling to Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now, here you stand&amp;mdash;at the gates of the last city, facing the uncertain lands beyond. As the distant drumming heralds the encroaching Darkness, you steel your weapons and ready your courage for a final defense of your ancestral home. The dark frontier awaits...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight back the oppressive forces of Darkness in Myth: Dark Frontier, a fully cooperative board game for 2-4 players. Take on the role of an iconic Myth hero in a desperate fight to protect the city of Farrenroc from the legions of Darkness that seek to despoil its holy walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes will have to travel, fight, and quest in defense of their city, while also establishing strongholds throughout the surrounding lands to provide crucial resources to Farrenroc. Each hero is equipped with a unique deck of action cards, providing unique ways to perform the standard actions...as long as Fate is on their side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the forces of Darkness spread across the land, methodically crippling Farrenroc's influence in hopes of eventually laying siege to this last standing beacon of Light. Each game of Dark Frontier pits the heroes against a sinle army, contributing its own unique minions, captains, boss, and treacheries. Heroes must contend with these threats while also mustering the support of the land to unite against a mutual foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Frontier combines high adventure with resource management, programmed action selection, and epic conquest to create a unique gaming experience to further enrich the world of Myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of iconic heroes from the world of Myth, aiding the besieged city of Farrenroc in its never-ending quest to push back the Darkness. Each hero has a small deck of five actions: Travel, Battle, Encounter, Fortify, and Quest. Three of the five are selected and placed in one of three time slots (morning, day, and night). These selections are made for all heroes and the enemy at the same time, then shuffled. Each time phase is played out by drawing and executing the action, be it a hero or an enemy. Oftentimes the timing of these actions is important to accomplish a quest or encounter, or to push back invading forces. Players will need to discuss their planned actions with each other and play them in the appropriate time slots. All the while, the enemy is moving to destroy Farrenroc by any means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
