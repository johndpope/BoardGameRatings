			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jug Inn sits in a prime location just south of Gardiren&amp;rsquo;s wharf and offers a magnificent view over the Shem River. Trivin of Jasath, the proprietor, caters mainly to wealthy guildsmen and nobles. He discourages riffraff by keeping the room rates high and by serving only fine food and expensive wines and brandies. Trivin is an important man in town and has a very inquisitive nature; he is always seeking to uncover any secrets his guests may have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jug Inn is a location expansion intended for use with the Gardiren Castle article (COL #5623). It describes the establishment, its services, staff, and clientele. Full-color plans of the inn are included, along with several adventure hooks the GM can use to bring the location into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
