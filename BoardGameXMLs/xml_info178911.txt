							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Animist: Nature Incarnate</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have the right to bear arms, scorpion stingers, and everything in between!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Druids, rangers, and others who revere nature barely scratch the surface, for they interact with the products of nature: her magic, her flora, and her fauna, but not with the primal entity whose personality is reflected in everything she creates. Animists commune directly with the primal being herself, offering themselves up as living clay to be shaped into a pure representation of her will. These representations, known as aspects, encompass everything from the pedestrian products of nature to the concepts and emotions that drive nature forward. Despite their range of expression, all animists are united in their adoration of their patron, and are, in essence, nature incarnate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commissioned by &amp;quot;Sugar Momma&amp;quot; Patreon backer Sasha Hall, the animist base class presents a new, flavorful system of druidic pact magic with an incarnum-style twist. Featuring the Prominence mechanic, animists take on different natural aspects each morning, but can choose to spend multiple aspect slots to dig deeper and deeper into a single aspect, unlocking further related abilities in a single niche at the cost of reduced versatility. A selection of minor aspects rounds out the animist's daily loadout, ensuring that there's always some interesting little trick on hand for when the going gets rough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Class Stats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Difficulty to Play (1-5): 2&lt;br/&gt;    Difficulty to Build (1-5): 2&lt;br/&gt;    Role: Full BAB Primal Striker/Spellcaster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The animist base class&lt;br/&gt;    Two archetypes - the tattooist and the verdant herald&lt;br/&gt;    Favored Class options for all common races, as well as many featured races&lt;br/&gt;    Seven feats&lt;br/&gt;    21 major aspects, each with seven or more abilities&lt;br/&gt;    30 minor aspects&lt;br/&gt;    Extensive bookmarking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
