			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the raggedy edge of human space, the Orion Frontier. This is the edge of human exploration. Rimward from here: There be Dragons! No star chart or encyclopedia tells us what lies beyond, only whispered tales of scouts and pirates provide us myth-inspired answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But here there is life... life in abundance and wonder to boot.  The edge of the Orion Frontier is an arbitrary area of space called the Twilight Sector.  Legends on the naming of the place abound. Was it a joke of some bureaucrat disgruntled with his posting, just the poetic license of those who came to call the place home or a comment on it being the last spec of human settled space? Arguments and evidence for each claim are many and it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that the truth will ever be known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the Twilight Sector does have though is a wonder: Earth! Or at least an exact copy known as Terra/Sol. The planet is a beautiful blue green ball of cosmic habitat that resembles the mother planet down to the shape of its continents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opportunities for adventure abound on this duplicate Earth and the Twilight Sector which surrounds it and you can choose what type of character you want to explore them as.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
