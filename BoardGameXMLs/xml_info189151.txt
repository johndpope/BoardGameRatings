			<description>Crack of the Bat (COTB) Baseball is a dice driven baseball game that uses player and pitcher cards with realistic stats to simulate the game of baseball.  A single roll of four 10-sided dice (red, blue, green and white) provides almost all the play resolution. Different combinations of these dice (blue-white, red-white and green-white) determine if the result is read from the pitcher or batter card, and whether the result is a hit or an out. All aspects of the game - fielding, stolen bases, hit location, strikeouts, etc. - can be simulated with the COTB system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
