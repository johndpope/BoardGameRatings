			<description>Learn first language ability with this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in four rounds. In the first round, you only use the cards 1 to 10 and the blue cardboard counters. Shuffle the cardboard counters face down. Give each player a card with a short phrase in french on it, the lowest number starts then. Pick up a cardboard counter and read the word aloud (it is written both in latin letters and in phonetics). Each player listens carefully, and says &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; if he thinks this word belongs to his card. He then put the counter on his tray. If the sentence from his card is now complete, he reads it to the other players and gives a translation. The translation can be checked with the translation wheel. If it is correct, he keeps the card, otherwise the first player giving a correct translation gets the card. A round is played until all cardboard counters are gone. Then you start another round with new cards and new counters. Afer four rounds, the player with the most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
