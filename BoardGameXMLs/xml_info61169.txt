			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a neat trick you can do&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many people are jealous of the powers displayed by the heroes and monsters that share the world with them. These larger-than-life figures command potent magic with a thought, and have mystic abilities as natural to them as their arms are to the common man. Yet most ordinary folk manage to put aside this petty envy and continue on with their lives. A small number of people, though, become obsessed with such thoughts, burning with jealousy that others are so gifted while they are denied. As their obsession takes them over, they learn the secrets of how the brain controls the supernatural aspects of the body just as it does the natural ones, and that by ingesting certain portions of a creature&amp;rsquo;s brain, they can steal these powers for themselves. These are the powerphages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this PDF are both the D20 Fantasy (Prestige Class) and D20 Modern (Advanced Class) versions; allowing you to run Powerphages in either type of game. Also included are three new feats, game information on Powerphages as well as a high-level NPC sample Powerphage ready to use in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
