							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">9: The Last Resort</name>
									
			<description>9: The Last Resort is a 1996 adventure computer game developed by Tribeca Interactive. The game was produced by Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal, and sported an all-star cast of voice-artists including Cher, James Belushi, Christopher Reeve, and two members of Aerosmith. It also includes the visual style and artwork of Mark Ryden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game came soon after the release of Myst, which revolutionized the graphic adventure genre. Like Myst, 9 is a graphically-rich 3D prerendered world, taking advantage of high-quality QuickTime video, and solely available on CD-ROM. It was written for the Windows platform, unlike most games of the time which ran on DOS and the Mac OS platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9 features a large cast of characters, and is rich in character interaction. The game world is populated by bizarre environments, objects and creatures. The game world is designed to represent the limits of man's imagination. There is a strong musical theme running through the entire game, as evidenced by a majority of the puzzles, including the main recurring puzzle. There is also a strong element of humour in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;9: The Last Resort&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
