							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golden Gate Park</name>
									
			<description>At three miles long and half a mile wide, San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Golden Gate Park is a sprawling patchwork of venerable buildings, gardens, meadows, lakes, and paths that go in every direction but straight. It would be nearly impossible to see all of the park in a single day&amp;mdash;but let&amp;rsquo;s try!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Gate Park is a fast-playing board game for 2-4 players. In the game, each player assumes the role of a married couple spending a day visiting historic Golden Gate Park during their trip to San Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin the game having just arrived from their hotel to the Music Concourse at the heart of Golden Gate Park. The time is 10:00am on a gorgeous weekend morning. Players will take turns traveling about the park visiting its varied attractions, ending the day at 5:30pm sharp for the trip back the hotel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every action taken by a player takes a certain amount of time, which must be spent wisely throughout the game. Walk, shuttle or taxi to places like the bison paddock, Stow Lake, Shakespeare Garden, or the California Academy of Sciences. In between attractions you will need to find time to eat&amp;mdash;perhaps at the famed Beach Chalet&amp;mdash;and to answer the call of nature. And you don&amp;rsquo;t have unlimited funds so be sure to mind your budget for the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will accumulate&amp;mdash;or possibly lose!&amp;mdash;valuable experience points along the way, with the player having had the best experience for the day declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; a 17&amp;rdquo; x 44&amp;rdquo; mounted board&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; one sheet of die-cut tiles &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; four custom dice&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 84 wooden cubes, discs and meeples in four player colors&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; wooden time tracker&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; cloth bag&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
