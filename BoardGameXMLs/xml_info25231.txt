			<description>Grand Total is &amp;quot;Mathematical Equation Scrabble.&amp;quot;  Players place number and symbol tiles in a line to form an equation, scoring points for the number they use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is large (18&amp;quot; square), colorful, and well-designed.  It is ruled off in 1&amp;quot; squares, with numbers from 0 to 9 printed in about 10% of the squares. The tiles are cardboard counters of decent thickness - the numbers are red and the symbols (+, -, and =) yellow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players mix up the tiles, then draw seven numbers and three signs.  In turn, each player places tiles on the board to make a &amp;quot;legal&amp;quot; equation, using at least one tile already on the board, crossword-style.  Typical Scrabble rules are used regarding challenges and redraws.  Player score the sum of the numbers they used, disregarding the results of the equation they formed.  If a tile is placed on a space bearing the same number, it's double score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A surprising rule is that a player may remove the equal sign from an equation on the board and replace it with a plus or minus if they can form a new equation that way.  The removed &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; is reused further down the new equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game meant for 2nd/3rd Grade and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
