			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike Force Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to introduce a novice wargamer to conflict simulation, these games rely on familiar mechanics from other games you may have played to allow players to focus on strategy instead of learning new rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike Force: Hunter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quick and dirty game of chasing bad guys, Strike Force: Hunter casts you in a dual role. You are trying to capture your opponent's terrorists while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate your own into his city. This game mixes &amp;quot;Concentration&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Stratego&amp;quot; and offers several different ways to win... or lose. The entire file is 4 pages. There is a map, a set of markers to be cut &amp;amp; folded, and 2 pages of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
