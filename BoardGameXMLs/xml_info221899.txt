							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruined Temple of the Wild Arcana - Outer Chambers</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Temple of Wild Arcana was once the home of hundreds of powerful chaos sorcerers who worshiped the chaos god, known only as The Eye. When The Eye became silent during the temple&amp;rsquo;s greatest time of need, the orcs of the nearby hills invaded the temple and killed most of the sorcerers within. The sorcerers still alive however unleashed a spell that trapped the orcs within the temple and raised the dead sorcerers as spell-wraiths. Years have passed since then, but, the chaotic magic of the sorcerers still remain. The magic has decayed and become more chaotic, beginning to consume the temple and cause it to slowly fade away. Rumors of ancient relics and powerful scrolls that lie within the temple draws many adventurers here in the present day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
