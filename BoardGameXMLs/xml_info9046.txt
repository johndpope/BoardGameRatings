			<description>Zhukov's First Victory: The Battle of Nomonhan, is an introductory level game of the battle between the Soviet Union and Japan's Kwantung Area Army in the summer of 1939. A series of border disputes between Japan's puppet state of Manchukuo and Soviet-controlled Mongolia since the spring escalated to an undeclared war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese sent the 23rd Infantry Division, reinforced with tanks, engineers, artillery and backed by much of their air force, to teach the Russian garrison a lesson. Unknown to the Japanese, the Soviets also sent reinforcements led by General Zhukov. In a series of battles the Japanese gained some success in July, but were crushingly defeated in August. The forces of the Rising Sun would never again strike north, and instead cast their eyes elsewhere for territorial expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 12 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion to Regiment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Two 11x17&amp;quot; full color map&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed un-mounted countersheet (300 5/8&amp;quot; + 6 5/8x1.25&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&lt;br/&gt;One 9-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One Player Aid Chart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player Provided: One 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 2 to 4 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
