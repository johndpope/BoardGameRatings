							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leaping Lillypads</name>
									
			<description>A strategy game as players guide their Frog on a gourmet buffet across the lillypads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this simple strategy game, each player plays a Frog with his own special menu of what tastes good on the pond.  He moves his frog in large or small movements across the lillypads, snapping up insects as he goes.  The trick is in only getting the insects you like more than the ones you don't like.  Each Frog has his own special secret diet, you don't know what each frog is after.  Be careful, predators surround the pond looking for a meal of frog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simple mechanics can be learned in minutes by children and adults alike.  Play is quick and intuitive, setup is fast with variable board setup to change the game every time.  Random menus for each frog ensures uncertainty about other players intentions and strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes rule expansions to challenge experienced gamers and those who become experienced with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed as Print n' Play, they game can be produced in either a high or low quality finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available July 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
