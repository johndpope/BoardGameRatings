							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fairfax&#039;s Revenge: the battle of Langport 1645</name>
									
			<description>Introductory game for the English Civil War series by TCS Games, it is a small print &amp;amp; play wargame on this minor battle from the English Civil War, more a fighting retreat and a sequence of cavalry clashes than a complete battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features the now classic system from TCS, made of random chit draw leaders activation, based on the quality of the leader himself, that leads to units activation and subsequent movement and combat.&lt;br/&gt;Each leader is rated from 1 to 3 (the higher the better, as he has more chance to be drawn earlier); when his chit is drawn from the pool, the player may move and have combat with all the units under his command. The activation is renewed for each other leader in the pool, except the last one that didn't move on that turn. there are no zone of controls (so movement is very fluid), terrain plays an important effect (as some terrain gives restriction to the attacker and improve the chances of the defender), combat is fast and furious (with advance, retreat and immediate elimination).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for melee, morale, cavalry charges, artillery and so on, with a very streamlined system that you may read and play in a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very good for introducing new players to the hobby, a sort of SPI quad games revisited and modernized&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
