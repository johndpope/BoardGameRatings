			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In World Cup players each manage tennis players, trying to optimally deploy them in order win tournaments and earn money by marketing the results. The game ends after the sixth tournament, and the manager with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before each tournament there is a travel phase where the managers simply move their two players (one amateur, one professional) to the next city by rolling the dice, possibly resolving events on the way. When a player reaches a city you can decide in which of the four quarter finals to place him, provided the tournament isn't already full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have arrived at the location the tournament begins. The winner of each match is determined through the best of 5 sets. A set is won when a players manages to roll a 6 (professional players have two on their dice, amateurs only one). The winners of a match advance to the next stage which is resolved in the same manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the final match, the four best players receive prize money according to the prize table and can also collect one marketing contract each. Those can be cashed in after a tournament to obtain additional money, either individually or in matching sets while sets are much more valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
