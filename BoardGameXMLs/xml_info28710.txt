			<description>From the publisher's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Troopers Evolution&lt;br/&gt;Based on the ever popular Heinlein novel and the highly successful film, this game uses the Evolution system to bring the War of the Species to your tabletop. Pre-painted Mobile Infantry, Arachnids, Skinnies and Forth miniatures will be appearing in the first wave of releases for this game, hitting your local stores in August.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's monthly 'Signs &amp;amp; Portents' magazine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Troopers Evolution is based on the same game system as the original, though everything has been tightened, streamlined, and developed to give a far more tactical game.  The design of the best miniatures in the old range have been retained, the others improved and, to top it all off, everything will come pre-painted, saving you the trouble of creating forces from scratch, and allowing you to get straight into the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Replaced&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Starship Troopers Miniatures Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
