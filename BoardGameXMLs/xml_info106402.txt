							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Woody Two-Legs: Attack of the Zombie Pirates</name>
									
			<description>Meet Woody Two-Legs, the least infamous pirate of the Seven Seas. Things have never gone quite right for Woody. That is, until he scored big time and got his hands on a huge treasure. Sailing to a remote island, Woody was about to bury his treasure, just as any good pirate would do. Unfortunately, it turned out that the original owners of the treasure, namely Mr. Jones himself and his retinue of undead pirates, had caught up with Woody. Small he might be, but Woody Two-Legs was not going to give up without a fight. Help Woody to fight wave after wave of undead pirates, defeat deadly bosses, collect bonuses and use devastating special weapons. All legs on deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woody Two-Legs is a casual score chasing arcade shooter that offers players various degrees of unlockable difficulties, building gradually on intensity with wave after wave of attack by the retinue of undead pirates and their unholy allies. Part of the addiction lies in the fact that these enemies become increasingly nasty as the player unlocks the various difficulty modes, ultimately facing up against the man himself in the ultimate boss fight in Nightmare Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
