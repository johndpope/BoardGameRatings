			<description>The Lucky Dime Caper starring Donald Duck is a platform game released for Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear in 1991. It is the 8-bit counterpart to Quackshot (a Sega Genesis-only release), another Disney-licensed game which also features Donald Duck as the main character. A sequel to this game, Deep Duck Trouble, also featuring Donald Duck, was released for both consoles in 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a side-scrolling platform. The gameplay follows the same pattern of Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse, which was released for Sega consoles a year before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil witch Magica De Spell has stolen Uncle Scrooge's Number One Dime and has kidnapped his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Donald Duck embarks on a mission and travels around the world to save his three nephews and to recover Scrooge's lucky dime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lucky Dime Caper&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
