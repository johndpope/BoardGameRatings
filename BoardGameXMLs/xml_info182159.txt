			<description>From the publisher's webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of science fiction, survival and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An RPG about desperate combat and managing scarce resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A post-apocalyptic setting where the remnants of the human race, soundly defeated by an extraterrestrial invasion, try to survive in an age of snow and ice, to recover the technology of the past and to reclaim their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RPG will take you to a cruel and bloody future where humans are no longer the dominant species on the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all that remains of humanity, you are the resistance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UED is powered by the Lost Dice system, in which every roll you make means one die fewer in your reserves. The result is rising tension over the course of your mission, as you try to succeed and survive with dwindling resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You set out into the frozen wastelands with your team of Runners, with heated exploration suits and the best equipment your Haven can provide. You're carrying messages, searching for supplies or looking for a way to beat the Invaders. But the world of ice is a dangerous place and chances are you won't all make it home. Wild animals, human Renegades, the robotic Invaders, the biting cold - all of these could kill you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
