							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythosa Gazeteer</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is time to enter the world of Mythosa - a land of adventure and wonder, a place that has witnessed the rise of mighty empires, powerful city-states, and realms ruled by great and noble lords. It is also a world at the edge of darkness: old kingdoms collapse into decadence, while humanoid tribes emerge to reclaim lands they once possessed. Ancient evils stir in their slumber, worshipped by dark minions who seek nothing less than the release of their vile masters. The civilized world is besieged by the insidious forces of chaos and destruction, slowly giving more ground with each passing decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time has come to stand fast against the darkness, to turn back the armies of the night, and to reclaim the land for man and his kin. It is a time for heroes to emerge, to walk in the paths of legend, and to forge legends of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
