							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RUMBLESLAM: Vitamir</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Built to endure the sub-zero temperatures of his homeland, Vitamir is clad in thick hair that acts as both insulator and armor. During his travels, the bear-like wrestler created dozens of folk stories and rumors. The Sasquatch? Just Vitamir taking a stroll through the woods. The abominable snowman? Just Vitamir lost in a snowstorm.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fan favorite Vitamir is a force unto himself. A giant of a man, he has some of the best movement and action points of any WEIGHT 3 wrestler. He's got great stats and high damaging special abilities. His Man Against Wild ability does extra damage when targeting Feral Den or Forest Soul wrestlers, which makes him the perfect Kaiser's Palace wrestler to add a little extra oomph to a Heavy Pounders team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
