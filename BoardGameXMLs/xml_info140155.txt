			<description>Espionage cards it's a dynamic and very fun game. Using your brain you have to discover the three variables of the confidential file, you have a lot of tools to your disposition. Use your private agenda...and you'll be the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple:&lt;br/&gt;Every player recibes a deck of 15 black cards called &amp;quot;personal agenda&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then you take the deck called &amp;quot;Confidential file&amp;quot; with 15 yellow cards and split it in 3 parts : 5 cards of locations (London, Athens, Paris, Tokyo and Panama), 5 cards of Spies (Orange Spy, Blue spy, Red spy, Green spy and White Spy) and 5 cards of devices (Jetpack, Airplane, Lethal Gas,Satellite and Helicopter). Shuffle every deck and take , without looking, 1 card per deck and face it down in the middle of the table. then merge the remaining cards into one deck, shuffle and deal evenly among the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now its time to play!: &lt;br/&gt;The objetive of the game is to discover the face down cards using logic and deduction.&lt;br/&gt;First of all you know that the &amp;quot;confidential file&amp;quot; cards can't be in the center of the table so you discard those card from the &amp;quot;personal agenda&amp;quot; deck in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now a player begins its turn by asking other players about some of their cards. For example: I ask to the player on my left for &amp;quot;the BLUE SPY in LONDON&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;In AIRPLANE to PANAMA&amp;quot;. Every question must involve 2 elements of the 3 different variables (cities, spies and devices) it may include 2 of the same element, for example 2 agents, 2 cities or 2 devices.&lt;br/&gt;Once the question was askes, the other player checks his/her cards of &amp;quot;confidential archive&amp;quot; and if he/she has 1 or two of those cards, he must show 1 to the player who asked. By knowing the card, you can discard what he/she shown from the personal agenda. otherwise he says &amp;quot;I'll pass&amp;quot; and another player must be asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues like this until someone thinks that they know the cards facing down and makes and acussation! if he guesses right he wins if not the player to the left makes and acussation and so until someone wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
