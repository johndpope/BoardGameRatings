			<description>The flip card deck on a ring has 20 cards in 4 colored sections.  Each section has a lead card with the rest of the cards with a list of five words, front and back. &lt;br/&gt;          Name things that...(followed by lists of nouns, adjectives, verbs).&lt;br/&gt;     A word is chosen to complete the Namits question and players or teams think of associations.  If game played with paper, the one with the most answers wins.  Play time suggested from 1 minute to 1 day.  If played verbally, players have 30 seconds to answer with the last one standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up.  Good for home schooling.  Very small, 2 1/2&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;, so a good travel game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
