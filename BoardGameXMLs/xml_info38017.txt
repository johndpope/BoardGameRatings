							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Journey to the West</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2-4+ players based on the Chinese Legend Journey to the West.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the players journey, they collect Strength cards and Weakness cards. Strength cards build up the player's power to overcome obstacles, while Weakness cards are used to undermine the opposing players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have the most Victory Points once all of the Obstacle cards have been captured. Obstacles include foes such as the Dragon King of the East, Flesh Eating Demons, and the Nine Headed Bird Demon. The number of Victory Points received for overcoming an obstacle is based on the strength of the obstacle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
