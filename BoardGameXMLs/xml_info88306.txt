			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grease: The Official Video Game is a combination rhythm and party game for the Wii and DS. The game is based on the 1978 musical by the same name, and includes a range of features that are true to the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can compete in two teams of up to four players each, singing and dancing to 16 songs from the movie. One team takes the role of the T-Birds, while the other sides with the Pink Ladies. The dancing is controlled by the Wii Remote and Wii Balance Board, while the singing employs a USB microphone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players dance and sing to the songs, but can also participate in a number of mini-games that are based on the movie, including a drag race against the Scorpions or carnival games at the graduation carnival. Story mode places the player in the role of Danny as he tries to earn the affection of Sandy with his slick dance moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DS version is a more basic title, and includes 10 songs. Players tap to the beat in the strictly rhythm based game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
