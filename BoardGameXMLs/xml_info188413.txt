							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wormhole!</name>
									
			<description>Wormhole! is a space themed board game for up to 8 players that turns the traditional rules of game play inside out. Everyone starts out at the edge of the board on a spiral track. Every turn you roll the dice, move closer to doom and draw a card. That card may be good, it may be bad, but it will certainly be unpleasant for someone. Red event cards go into effect immediately and may move you forward or back, swap you with the nearest ship or even make you take another turn. Blue mass cards are...mass cards. Mass is also the most common card type in the deck and comes in 25, 50, 75, and 100 unit variants. Mass is bad, because for every 100 mass you accumulate you have to roll another die on your turn. So if you&amp;rsquo;ve got 300 mass sitting in front of you, you&amp;rsquo;re rolling 4 dice every turn (that's your original die plus 3 more). And that&amp;rsquo;s just not going to end well. Green action cards are like the red event cards, but you can hold onto them and use them at your discretion. Use one to send your highest mass card to the person behind you...or if you happen to be that person behind you can use a different one to dodge that mass and let it keep on heading back. There&amp;rsquo;s even an action card that will let you skip your own turn! When a player inevitably reaches the center of the wormhole, they are out. Flung into the deepest recesses of time and space most likely. When that happens, they mix up their remaining action cards with their mass cards and each remaining player takes one at random (going in order along the track). Play continues until only one player is left on the board, allowing them to safely escape the wormhole and making them the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
