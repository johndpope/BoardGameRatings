			<description>Kiezk&amp;ouml;nig is a roll-and-move game for 3-6 players age 16 and up. The players attempt to dominate an area  to become 'Kiezk&amp;ouml;nig' (King of the Red Light district). To do so, the players have to collect the 9 cards of a colour, which represent both legal and underworld business (the latter represented by power and capital) in that area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has two tracks, the inner, &amp;quot;legal business&amp;quot; one, and the outer, &amp;quot;underworld&amp;quot; one. There are also event spaces, where players draw event cards, and combat spaces, where players can challenge other players. Players can change tracks via taxi spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
