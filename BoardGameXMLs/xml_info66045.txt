							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scary Tales: Big Bad Wolf vs. Cinderella</name>
									
			<description>Big Bad Wolf vs. Cinderella is the fourth title in the Scary Tales series of two-player games pitting common fairy tale characters against each other. Here's more about the characters in this game from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;He'll huff and puff 'till he gets his way...and if that doesn't work, maybe his great big teeth will! The Big Bad Wolf has even convinced those boarish Little Pigs to join his malevolent side. She's and over-worked, over-stressed girl on the brink who's had it up to here, plus Cinderella has her Fairy Godmother looking over her shoulder. They're both crazy for power, but which has the strongest will and resources to rule the Land?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom in which a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy, comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
