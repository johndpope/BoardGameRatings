			<description>A game set in the Battlestar Galactica Universe using a variation of Dice of Arkham by Mads L. Brynnum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Setting: After the Cylon surprise attack that wiped out the 12 colonies of man, the Battlestar Galactica leads a rag-tag fleet of the last remaining humans on a long and perilous journey to Kobol, the home of the lost 13th Tribe. You control the fleet as you make you way to your new home, deciding when to run, when to fight, and how to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Overview: This game is more than a simple re-skinning of &amp;quot;Dice Of Arkham&amp;quot;, the mechanic has been changed and modified to lend itself to this unique Sci-Fi Universe, yet it remains true to its heritage. Those familiar with &amp;quot;Dice Of Arkham&amp;quot; will have no problem picking this game up. For those who aren't, first of all I recommend you grab DoA RIGHT NOW (the link to it is above). It's an excellent game! There is also a very complete set of rules that will explain this game fully included in the pdf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;Game Sheet &amp;amp; Rules (which you print)&lt;br/&gt;8 tokens (which you provide)&lt;br/&gt;8 Dice, 6 of one color and 2 of a second color (which you also provide)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximate Game Length: 10-20 minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Each turn you roll your Jump Prep Dice (6 dice, however you only roll 5 of them until you complete the first &amp;quot;Humans&amp;quot; event) to perform your actions such as repairing your ships or advancing along the Jump Preparation Track. You will also roll the Draidis Dice (2 dice) once per turn which shows you what Cylon threats will have to be resolved in this area of space before you can continue. The Cylons are also attempting to move down their track and perform Traitorous Acts to prevent the Humans from reaching the home of the lost 13th Tribe, Kobol. As each side completes their Track, an event is triggered. If the Cylons complete 3 events before the humans do, you lose. If you complete 3 before the cylons do, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will ALWAYS be free to Print and Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Lord Malachi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submitted for the 2013 Solitaire Print and Play Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
