			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bigger They Are... is set in the town of Kenselheim, which can be set almost anywhere in the Empire. The adventurers are hired by a nobleman to eliminate the local magistrate&amp;rsquo;s judicial champion, an Ogre Pit Fighter, so that he can challenge the magistrate to trial by combat in order to reclaim his ancestral lands. The Ogre is a fearsome opponent, however, so the characters will have to think carefully about how they will defeat him. This adventure is designed for characters on their first or second career, though it can easily be tailored for players on their third career (just make Mentag even more fearsome). Less experienced characters will have to be more inventive in dealing with the Ogre, while others may be able to beat Mentag through sheer force of arms. Socially inclined characters can conceivably complete the adventure without having to enter combat at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
