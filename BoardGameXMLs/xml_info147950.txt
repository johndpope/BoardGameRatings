							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Throne</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 32 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a fantasy throne room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Throne module is a single map for use in any fantasy setting. A single door in the south is the only entrance. The room is in a circular shape. The floor is made of gravel with nary a piece out of place. Six pillars support the ceiling, each having a sconce and a lit torch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dragon throne is on a raised dais. A luxurious red carpet extends from the throne. The red carpet flows past two bizarre candelabra and tumbles down a staircase, ending in the middle of the room. Above the throne is a massive dragon skull and a flag of a red dragon emblazoned on a shield with a white backdrop. From this flag extend two dragon wings that encompass the throne as well as give support to a small upper level with wooden railings where the king&amp;rsquo;s archer bodyguards watch over the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dragon throne is an exceptionally good area for a villainous mastermind in a fantasy RPG to make his final stand. In a modern game, it could make for a great secret cult that may be aware of occult powers in the present or has historical knowledge of magic from a previous age. It can also make for a great throne room for an alien race in a science fiction game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
