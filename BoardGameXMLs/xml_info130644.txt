			<description>In Chicago, set in the United States during the age of Prohibition, the players are gang bosses who fight to control the city of Chicago. They try to earn money by controlling the areas of Chicago and building casinos and moonshine stills. Once Prohibition is lifted, the player with the most money wins &amp;ndash; but before that happens, the player with the most money is arrested (like Al Capone) and half his funds claimed as punishment. Thus, you need to be second in order to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
