			<description>Drinks not included!&lt;br/&gt; â€‹&amp;quot;You Did What?&amp;quot; is the first &amp;quot;Laminated Poster Board Game&amp;quot; for adults from Shim and D'rothy. The 18&amp;quot; x 24&amp;quot; game board features original black and white hand-drawn artwork on over 40 spaces. The laminated paper sheet can hang on a wall as a decoration and then be taken down to play the game. The surface is lamination-encapsulated so it can't be easily ruined by spilled drinks.&lt;br/&gt; Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Ages: 21+&lt;br/&gt;Typical game duration: 60 minutes&lt;br/&gt; Great for dorms, party rooms, bars, and your adult clubhouse!&lt;br/&gt; Bring your own:&lt;br/&gt;6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;coins, bottlecaps, or other play markers&lt;br/&gt;paper&lt;br/&gt;pens/pencils&lt;br/&gt;smartphone/camera (optional)&lt;br/&gt; ... and get to playing (and drinking, and smoking)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
