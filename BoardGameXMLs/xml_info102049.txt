							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deuce, The Card and Lawn-Tennis Card-Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>Card game for 2 or 4 players&lt;br/&gt;All the cards are dealt to each player and placed in front of them face-down. The server now rolls the die and that indicates if the serve was good or a fault. If the ball stays in play, the opponent reveals his first card from the stack in front of him. If the return of serve is good then the original server reveals the top card from his stack, and so on until the point is won.&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is exactly the same as in real tennis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
