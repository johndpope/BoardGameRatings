			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The running of the bull... Minotarr!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 12 Rogue, Minotarr is a brute your players will love to hate. This thuggish fool has been cursed with great power, despite having no sense of responsibility! Not the world's most inspiring leader, he still brings with him a number of power level 7 thugs who're just as obnoxious and bull-headed (well, figuratively) as their leader. Minotarr is a classic villain archetype in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minotarr is designated &amp;quot;Violet&amp;quot; for his magical origins. This can attract the attention of heroes of a mystic bent who aren't used to dealing with foes who are so direct in their villainy or methods of combat. Of course, because Minotarr holds grudges easily, he makes a great nemesis for any hero who stands between him and whatever he wants to grab by force. Editor's Note: Paired with Ticktock, Minotarr makes for a fun &amp;quot;Old West&amp;quot; themed episode of your game. Your players may get a lot of mileage out of bull puns at his expense!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
