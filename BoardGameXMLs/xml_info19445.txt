			<description>This Ampersand Press game is an innovative nature game for children. &lt;br/&gt;It requires no reading. &lt;br/&gt;There are four different games that can be played at multiple levels. &lt;br/&gt;Wild Seed teaches children about life cycles and gives them an awareness of the environmental conditions needed to stimulate plants. &lt;br/&gt;The game stimulates interaction and discussion with a beautifully illustrated game board and action cards. There are color spots to designate movement around the game board, and a storybook that can be read to the child to introduce plant science. &lt;br/&gt;Also included are additional learning activities. This game will intrigue your children and they will learn a great deal. &lt;br/&gt;They can play in small groups with adults and have a great time with follow-up activities. &lt;br/&gt;They learn why some seeds grow and others don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an excellent and socially responsible game in terms of its theme and in the way it helps children to learn about nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Description:&lt;br/&gt;Play the Wild Seed Game for fun, fast-paced action, and strategy!
