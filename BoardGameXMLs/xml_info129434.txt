							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silent Hill: Defeated</name>
									
			<description>This is an unofficial fan-made game, and is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Konami or Great Eastern Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Silent Hill: Defeated is a free, unofficial, print-and-play card game designed for use with Silent Hill-themed playing cards (not included) to play a game more thematically linked to the popular survival-horror videogame. The card deck is a &amp;quot;poker&amp;quot; deck with 2 Jokers, but the splitting of the deck's artwork between Monsters (Black suits) and Heroes (Red suits) led to the design of Silent Hill: Defeated. The game could conceivably be played with any &amp;quot;poker&amp;quot;-style deck, but the Silent Hill deck from Great Eastern Entertainment is highly recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is like Silent Hill meets Uno. You start the game by drawing 7 cards and your goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand. You do this by &amp;quot;challenging&amp;quot; the top card of the discard pile. Sometimes that card is a Monster and you will need a Hero to fight it. Sometimes, it's the other way around. The Heroes (red-suited cards) and Monsters (black-suited cards) have different rules and play a little differently, but in the end you have to combine both strategies in order to empty your hand of cards, which allows you to finally escape the twisted place called... Silent Hill.&lt;br/&gt;(please check the Files section for the rules pdf.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
