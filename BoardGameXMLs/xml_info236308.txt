			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Wise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They call you Wizard&lt;br/&gt;They call you Witch&lt;br/&gt;They call you Warlock&lt;br/&gt;They call you Miracle-Worker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one thing they don't call you is their equal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circles of Power is a game about wizards in a world that hates them. In this game, you portray individuals who have suffered from oppression, discrimination, and prejudice. You learned to wield the Sacred Fire, both to protect yourselves and aid your marginalized communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game about magic, where you refine your spells, create new sorceries, and train apprentices to follow your traditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game about activism, and the difficult choices and moral compromises made by people thrust into the seat of leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game about marginalized communities, each of who suffer from the oppression of the dominant Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circles of Power is a PbtA roleplaying game inspired by such games as Monsterhearts, Dream Askew, and Night Witches. The Apprentice Edition is an experimental, limited-run version of the game, commonly known as an ashcan. This 72-page rulebook contains everything you need to run the game, including setting information, playbooks and the GM rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
