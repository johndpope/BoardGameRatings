			<description>KISS: Psycho Circus - The Nightmare Child is a first person shooter computer game developed by Third Law Interactive and published by Gathering of Developers for the PC in August 2000. It was also released later that year for the Dreamcast (using Windows CE) following a port by Tremor Entertainment. The game is based on Todd McFarlane's KISS: Psycho Circus series of comic books, themselves inspired by the rock band KISS. KISS: Psycho Circus was the first game to be developed by Third Law Interactive, themselves having recently formed in December 1998 after a widely publicized mass walkout from Ion Storm. Versions for the PlayStation and the Game Boy Color were planned, but were later canceled. The PC version of the game was done on the an enhanced version of the Lithtech engine, licensed from Monolith Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's story revolves around a KISS tribute band, who suddenly receive superhuman powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kiss: Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
