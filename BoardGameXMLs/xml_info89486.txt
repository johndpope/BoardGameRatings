			<description>Plot&lt;br/&gt;Robocalypse follows the story of a batch of robots with the brains of World War II veterans that must defeat a group of machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Robocalypse is controlled entirely with the stylus. Up to four players can play together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development&lt;br/&gt;Robocalypse was announced on January 22, 2008 by former SpongeBob SquarePants writer Jay Lender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reception&lt;br/&gt;Robocalypse has received mostly positive reviews, with an aggregate score of 79.8% and 79 from Game Rankings and Meta Critic respectively. Daemon Hatfield of IGN awarded it the Editor's Choice in its review, exclaiming that he was glad to see a real-time strategy game made for the Nintendo DS, despite the genre being so well-suited for the system's touch controls and dual screens. He complimented its controls and AI. He also praised its humor, saying that he finds it to be truly unique. Mike Feinburg of GameSpot also praised it for its tight controls and humor, but described the AI as clumsy and frustrating.&lt;br/&gt;Robocalypse was recognized by the KRI games development conference in Moscow as the best game for portable systems. It also received several Nintendo DS-specific nominations from IGN in their 2008 video game awards, including Best Strategy Game, Best New IP, and Most Innovative Design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocalypse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocalypse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
