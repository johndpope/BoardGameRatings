			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP: Ultimate Racing Technology is a motocross game for the Xbox and PC. It is part of the MotoGP series, and includes riders and tracks from the 2001 Grand Prix season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP is a mix between a simulation and arcade style racer. There are a number of different play modes including Training Mode, Quick Race, Time Trials, Arcade Championship, and Grand Prix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training Mode tasks the player to complete a number of challenges that test their driving abilities. Completing these tasks unlocks additional tracks, bikes, and outfits. Arcade Championship pits the player against the clock and offers a more forgiving control response. Tricks can be performed which earn bonus points. Grand Prix is a simulation-style season mode similar to Gran Turismo&amp;rsquo;s Career Mode. Players can compete in a number of different races around the world to earn points toward the leaderboard in the Grand Prix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ships with ten licensed tracks from the 2001 season and over 30 racers. Players can match off against the AI or compete against friends in 4-player split-screen races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
