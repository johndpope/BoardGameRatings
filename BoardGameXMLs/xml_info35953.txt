			<description>&amp;ldquo;A card game for 2 to 4 players, or more. Each player controls a country during the First Industrial Revolution. Players try to develop their economies as quickly as possible.&amp;rdquo; The game is played with two sets of cards, an Industry Deck and an Event Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are seven categories of &amp;ldquo;Resources&amp;rdquo; that are tracked for each country: Food, Population (Skilled and Unskilled Labor), Fossil Fuels, Steel (Production Capacity), Transportation, Guns, and Luxury Goods (Peacetime Consumption). Each country begins with an equal amount of resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The first player to have a combined score of 100+ in Guns and Luxury Goods wins. If more than 1 person gets 100+ on the same turn, the Player with the higher score wins. If it is still tied, use Transportation, and then Population, as tie-breakers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
