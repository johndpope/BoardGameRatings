							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruins of Warsaw</name>
									
			<description>Warsaw was levelled by six NATO nuclear devices in 1997.  The city, even in its current state, provided some protection against the bandits who ruled the countryside.  Baron Czarny moved into the city, taking as his own the former Palace of Culture and Sciences.  From this new Twierdza Czarny (black fortress) the evil Baron commands his horde to pillage and subjugate everyone in and around the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters have become involved in the battle for Warsaw, between the baron and the Milicya.  They will play leading roles -- commanding troops, ambushing convoys, contacting other communities, and trying to survive in the rubble and debris of Warsaw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also are complete macro combat rules for Twilight: 2000.  Now battles involving hundreds of men and vehicles may be resolved quickly, easily, and realistically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes map of Warsaw and Twilight Miniatures Rules: Draft edition (also published as a supplement to Challenge issue 25)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
