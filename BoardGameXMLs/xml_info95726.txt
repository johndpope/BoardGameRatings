			<description>S:S&amp;amp;S EP is a 21st century interpretation of the archetypical old school videogame adventure, designed exclusively for Apple's touchtronic machinery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a mix of laid-back exploration, careful investigation &amp;amp; mysterious musical problem-solving occasionally punctuated by hard-hitting combat encounters. S:S&amp;amp;S EP is an unusual genre-bending effort with an emphasis on sound, music &amp;amp; audiovisual style that has been positioned as 'a brave experiment in Input Output Cinema'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S:S&amp;amp;S EP has been recently described as &amp;quot;... an unlikely mix of Zelda and art house cinema. The game is equal parts Robert E. Howard, Shigeru Miyamoto, Tim Schaefer, with some David Lynch thrown in for good measure &amp;mdash; but there is more to S&amp;amp;S than these inspirations.&amp;quot; (link)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S:S&amp;amp;S EP won the IGF Mobile 'Achievement in Art' award in March 2010 and has been eagerly anticipated in some quarters ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S:S&amp;amp;S EP is an unusual collaborative project made in the experimental independent videogame hotspot of Toronto, Canada. It has been built around the songs &amp;amp; sounds of composer/rockstar Jim Guthrie, whose discography includes solo efforts Morning, Noon, Night, Now More Than Ever, as well as the Juno award-winning Alone At The Microphone by Royal City. S:S&amp;amp;S EP features the internationally recognized art &amp;amp; design style of Superbrothers, whose illustrations &amp;amp; short films have appeared in a variety of exhibitions &amp;amp; publications. S:S&amp;amp;S EP is entirely made possible by the award-winning independent videogame studio Capy, creators of the critically acclaimed Critter Crunch &amp;amp; Might &amp;amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes, with Capy creative director Kris Piotrowski overseeing the project's strange evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
