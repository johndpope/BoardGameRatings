							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fifth Book of DragonQuest: Worldly Endeavor</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What this &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; is about: In preparing for an online DQ campaign, I decided to compile additional skills, equipment, house rules, etc. that I found on the Internet, along with many of my own ideas, in the form of sort of a &amp;ldquo;5th book&amp;rdquo; of DragonQuest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skills below add significant depth to the basic DQ system, allowing both PC&amp;rsquo;s and NPCs to be created with more depth and variety. Some of the skills are written in detail, while others are merely guidelines for the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The professions below provide logical skill groupings for the GM to create more realistic, fully fleshed out NPCs. In addition, a few of the professions (boldfaced below) are written in some detail to appeal to PC&amp;rsquo;s as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also wanted a bit of a simple religious system in place, hence the Devotional Paths system where characters may follow a Light or Dark path with appropriate benefits and restrictions placed on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colleges of Magic are revised here to allow for those from Arcane Wisdom and a College of White Magics. Finally, the Equipment and Adventuring sections add a bit more variety to the DQ 2nd edition rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional User Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fan-created &amp;amp; organized title was freely distributed on the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
