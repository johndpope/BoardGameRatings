			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life in the big city is tough, no matter if you&amp;rsquo;re scraping the bottom of the barrel or living high on the hog. The worth of a man is often measured by the price on his head and the amount of lead needed to bring him down. There is money to be made as long as you don&amp;rsquo;t mind getting your hands dirty, no matter what side of the law you&amp;rsquo;re closest to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside these pages you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Full bookmarks for all chapters and major sections in the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Edges, Hindrances, and Setting Trappings geared for the dark alleys and gritty streets of Wellstone City&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 50 pages of setting description and a detailed history of Wellstone City&lt;br/&gt;     NPCs, Crime Families and Organizations, Locations, and important people in the city&lt;br/&gt;     An introductory adventure, &amp;quot;Public Transit Assassins&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Public Transit Assassins&amp;quot; is an adventure for Novice level characters or higher that demonstrates that life in Wellstone is tough. Sometimes you have to walk to a job, sometimes you have to do what you can with what you have; sometimes you have to take the bus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good people live and work in the city. They carry out their lives and they try to ignore the crime and vice that exists all around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not their story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not their City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Wellstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
