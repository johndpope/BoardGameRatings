			<description>バベルの塔 is played with 10 tiles, 5 black and 5 red, each player having their color. At the beginning, the second player places the 10 tiles face down randomly in a square grid so as to form a continuous shape of their choice. The tiles are flipped and the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns, players take one of their tiles and place it on top of a neighboring tile/stack. The following restrictions apply:&lt;br/&gt;- you can only take one tile, the topmost of a stack,&lt;br/&gt;- you cannot split the tiles in two different groups in the grid,&lt;br/&gt;- you cannot move a tile to an &amp;quot;empty space&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;If you cannot make a legal move, you must pass until a legal move is available to you again. You cannot pass if a move is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have your own tile at the top of the last pile remaining when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
