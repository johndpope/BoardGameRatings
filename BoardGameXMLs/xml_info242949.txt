			<description>From the inlay (Play It Again Sam 6 version):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of this (22nd) century, the 'Pirate Industrials' funded and built the Asteroid Belt colonies, only then to break away from Earth. Negotiations collapsed, and the 'Pirate Wars' began - Earth's attacks on the colonies' central trading route still continue. This is the Firetrack, spanning the mining worlds, separated by Commspaces, areas of space filled with discarded communication hardware - space junk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In principle, each world is of four types - 'Baseworld', 'Dustworld', 'Iceworld' and 'Mallworld' - although there is some variation within each of these design types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worlds are individually driven by nuclear power plants, disguised as 'eyes' within the 'Devil Rock' at the end of each colony. Destroying these plants throws the settlement into darkness. In the BBC Micro version, you must then re-attack in the blackout to prevent the machine-building mechanisms reconstructing everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variable defence levels have been observed throughout the worlds including instances of total abandonment - you need only fly over abandoned worlds once to wipe them out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of the few security-cleared ex-military personnel open for Firetrack pilot selection. You must try to destroy as many of the mining worlds as you can. [...] You must ultimately try to find the 'White Light' opening somewhere in the Firetrack. Flying the Firetrack has always been difficult enough - it may well be that Earth itself is now at stake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally released on the C64 and BBC Micro. When re-released on the Play It Again Sam 6 compilation, Superior Software also converted it to the Acorn Electron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Electron edition is slightly cut down, for example the BBC Micro version allows the player to select any of the first three levels to start, but the Elk version can only start on level one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conversely, if the BBC Micro version is run on a machine either upgraded with Sideways or Shadow RAM, or models where Sideways or Shadow RAM is included by default (e.g. the Master or Master Compact) then the game utilises enhanced graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits (Play It Again Sam 6 inlay):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Creator and Author: Orlando&lt;br/&gt;Electron Conversion: Chris Terran&lt;br/&gt;Loading Screen Design: Michael Hutchison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
