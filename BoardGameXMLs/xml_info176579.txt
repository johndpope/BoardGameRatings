			<description>Detect. Deduce. Decode. A Battle of Wits over the Code Machine. A word game for the critical mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Da Vinci is a genius in coding messages creatively. In this game, you will stretch your imaginative and logical mind to crack the secret behind the Code Machine. Come unlock the genius within! The product is a beautiful fusion of a word game and a logic game. Its interactive game-play makes it a great piece for friends and family pastimes. The difficulty levels are controlled by players, so it is also a nice adult-child educational toy. Something special about this product is that it features a patented word coding method that is unique, but easy to understand. So while enjoying the fun and challenge, players can gain knowledge of vocabulary and coding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn. How to play ... &lt;br/&gt;Step 1: Draw two game cards to determine the &amp;quot;Word Type&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Spelling Condition&amp;quot; of the secret word to be formed. Reveal the two cards to all players. &lt;br/&gt;Step 2: One player uses the chips to form a secret word by the method illustrated on the Code Machine. Cover it with all windows closed. &lt;br/&gt;Step 3: The other player(s) must crack the secret word with as few windows opened as possible. Ask questions wisely for hints in the process. The player that requires less windows opened is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a two-player game, one player is the Encoder, the other the Decoder. The Encoder forms a secret word by the method illustrated on the Code Machine using the information from the &amp;quot;Word Type&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Spelling Condition&amp;quot; cards, starting from the farthest left position, in correct spelling sequence, and announcing the number of letters in the word. In each round, the Decoder opens one small window at any position and attempts to name the secret word. In each game, the Decoder has a total of three changes to ask the Encoder a yes-or-no question for a hint. The questions can be used all at once or separately. When the secret word is cracked, count the number of windows opened. Switch roles and repeat. The player who required less open windows to decode the secret word is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a three-player game, one player is the Encoder and the other two players are the competing Decoders. The Decoders take turns opening windows and attempting to crack the secret word. The Decoder who successfully cracks the secret word first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
