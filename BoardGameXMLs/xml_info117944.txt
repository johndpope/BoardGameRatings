							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Isle: The Andosia War</name>
									
			<description>BATTLE ISLE&amp;reg;: THE ANDOSIA WAR is an entirely new kind of conflict simulation, combining elements of real-time and turn-based strategy in an action-packed mixture. The player is immersed in a complex world where both economic finesse and military expertise are essential. Powered by a revolutionarily new engine, the game is presented completely in 3D with an unprecedented richness of detail. In network game there can be up to 8 players on 2 teams. It is possible to play via Internet without any additional game fees on the BATTLE ISLE Internet server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the tradition of the BATTLE ISLE series, the tactical aspects of the game are carried out in turn-based mode. In contrast to a pure real- time strategy, this allows not only more game depth but also more lavish graphic effects, zooms and camera chases, immersing the player in every event. Light conditions change during the course of the day. The weather, the seasons and even the tides play a key role in producing goods and planning tactics and strategy. A core component of the strategy in THE ANDOSIA WAR involves securing the necessary resources and carefully planning how they are to be used. Raw materials must be collected; factories, research facilities and power plants have to be built and transportation systems have to be created. All of this, including the actions of the player, take place in real time and continue in the background while the player plans and sets up his military maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
