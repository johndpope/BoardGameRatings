			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mercenaries spied a small door to their right which led into the warehouse. The mist only became thicker the closer they approached the door. Assuming their regular positions, Geremiah tapped the control box. The mercenaries froze as they stared into the creatures&amp;rsquo; nest. Sthol reached out and tapped the control box again, closing the door. The mercenaries stepped back, staring at each other with discerning looks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sthol looked deeply at the others. &amp;ldquo;Did you see that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geremiah nodded his head. &amp;ldquo;It looks like the nest. There was some giant, bulbous creature on the far side, probably a hundred of those skittering, scorpion things, and a handful of the larger ones. This must be the mother, and those little ones must be her offspring. I&amp;rsquo;m assuming they grow into the larger creatures we&amp;rsquo;ve already fought.&amp;rdquo; Geremiah glanced toward the far wall. Using his night vision goggles, he could see vents along the way. &amp;ldquo;The small ones must be traversing the ship through the vents. They must fall into the rooms, get stuck, and grow into the larger ones. That explains why the control boxes are all intact.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A myriad of sci-fi options for the Entropic Gaming System!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entropic Heroes: Science Fiction is the first companion book to the EGS core rulebook, and provides a wealth of options for creating sci-fi characters, adventures, and campaigns!
