							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wombat Rescue: 5th Player Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The Wombat Rescue: 5th Player Expansion does exactly what its name suggests: It expands Wombat Rescue to support 5 players (the rules for a 5-player game are included in the base game's rulebook, along with the rules for the other expansions that were available upon release of the game). This was the final stretch goal for the Kickstarter campaign, and that stretch goal was not met; however, it is available for purchase through the publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
