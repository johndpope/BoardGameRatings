			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&amp;rsquo;s Resource supplement by Greg Marks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hard Bay&amp;rsquo;s fate has ever been tied to the sea. Although blessed with a natural, protected harbour and plentiful fishing, foul weather and a dangerous, unwholesome reputation have conspired to keep the village nothing more than a dreary, isolated place. A vein of smuggling and thievery ran deep through the village until the Sharkrazor pirates were crushed four decades ago. Now administered by three minor noble families, a darker horror than mere piracy lurks within the place. Rumours speak of strange fires set amid a circle of ancient, weathered stones atop a nearby shunned hill when the moon is new and of strange, abhorrent fishmen lurking in the abandoned, half-drowned smuggler tunnels beneath the ramshackle village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
