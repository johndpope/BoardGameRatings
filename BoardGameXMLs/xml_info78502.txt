							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Formula One 2000</name>
									
			<description>Formula One 2000 is a racing game in the Formula One series of video games. It is also the only game of the series, known to be made on a non-Sony console (Game Boy Color). Drivers appearing on the front cover are Mika H&amp;auml;kkinen (McLaren) and Jarno Trulli (Jordan).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formula One 2000 contained the new &amp;quot;arcade&amp;quot; mode, which had been missing from its predecessor, Formula One 99. This arcade mode seemed more similar in style to WipEout&amp;mdash;tracks were grouped into &amp;quot;location zones&amp;quot; with futuristic-sounding names and cars were grouped into series. The player began on the easier courses with the worst cars, before unlocking the more difficult courses and the better cars. Bonus images could be unlocked as an incentive to win races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation mode, however, had begun to stagnate. Despite the introduction of pit-stop strategies and an improved cockpit view, these were quite superficial changes in the grand scheme of things. Critics and gamers alike were beginning to tire of Formula One games, especially considering that this version was not the only game on the market. By this time, people complained about the fact that every game had the same cars and tracks, and the differences between years were minimal. However, people continued to buy Formula One games to a great extent, if not quite to the same extent as the mid-1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was clear by this time that in order to keep to Formula One series interesting, developers had to create more interesting arcade modes and unlockables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_2000_(video_game),&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_2000_(video_game),&amp;...&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
