			<description>A campaign game of Regimental management in the 18th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is game that was originally designed to be played in a club or group context over a series of sessions, the aim being to build up a &amp;lsquo;campaign&amp;rsquo; of experiences and a context for a number of small 18th century skirmishes involving just a handful of battalions a side.&lt;br/&gt;In the game the players represent colonel proprietors of British Infantry regiments in the mid-eighteenth century. The premise is that in this period, Colonels were, in effect private military contractors to the state &amp;ndash; contracted to provide a battalion for the King.&lt;br/&gt;The game is a development of an original idea developed by Brian Cameron and Jim Wallman in June 1996 and subsequently played by the enthusiastic members of the Chestnut Lodge Wargames Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The British Army in this period (the date is deliberately not specified, it is &amp;ldquo;Seventeen forty-something&amp;rdquo;) consists of a variable number of regiments (usually 50 - 60) each of which is normally a single battalion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For administrative purposes each battalion consists of 10 companies, 9 centre and 1 grenadier. In effect the colonel owns the regiment and is paid by the government to recruit and maintain it.&lt;br/&gt;Each player makes up a character name for their Colonel. This is, in many respects, a roleplaying game, so players are encouraged to define such things as age, marital social status, background and previous military experience (which is not required to hold a colonelcy). If in doubt about what the period was like watch the film Barry Lyndon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colonel should be regarded as being the player in person &amp;ndash; so risk to the colonel in battle is risk to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
