							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Train Simulator: Marketplace â€“ dia. 1/146 HTV 25t Coal Hopper Wagon Pack</name>
									
			<description>BR Built nearly 17000 21t hoppers to Diagram 1/146 between 1952 and 1959. They were subject to major body corrosion, in common with other coal carrying wagons. From 1971 there was a major rebuilding program, with the new welded bodies featuring only 2 side ribs, compared to the five as originally built. The chassis was retained unaltered, though some previously unfitted examples did emerge with vacuum brakes.In March 1977 rebuilds appeared from Shildon Works fitted with new 10 leaf springs, allowing the loading capacity to be raised to 25t and they were renumbered at the same time. Just over 900 examples of Vacuum braked hoppers were delivered through to April 1978 and it is these wagons that are represented in this pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1/146 25T HTV Coal Hoppers Wagon Pack for Train Simulator includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Clean and weathered versions freight brown and maroon liveries&lt;br/&gt;    Loaded and empty versions with suitable physics&lt;br/&gt;    Four different type of data panel/lettering - randomly assigned but can be overridden&lt;br/&gt;    Loaded versions have five different load profiles randomly assigned&lt;br/&gt;    Animated handbrake lever&lt;br/&gt;    Intelligent taillamps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pack includes a user manual with further details about the rolling stock and the customising of some of the features when using the wagons in scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
