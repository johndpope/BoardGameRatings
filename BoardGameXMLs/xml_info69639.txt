			<description>Fantasy conquest theme boardgame for 2-4 players on an 8x8 map. Traverse 4 different terrains (mountains, plains, forests, and badlands) upon which are built 8 types of structures (Villages, Towns, Cities, Mines, Castles, Towers, Temples, and Ruins). Fight using your Heroes, Mages, Armies, and Monsters, and leave garrisons in the places you have conquered. Use your 5 permanent Allies to help you as well as your hand of Temporary Ally cards. The map layout changes every game as well as your permanent Allies, so every game will have its own unique challenges and opportunities. Win by eliminating your opponents or controlling 5 Temples or over half the Map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
