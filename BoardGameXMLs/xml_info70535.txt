Like issue #5, this issue is listed as February 1987.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comic book portion:&lt;br/&gt;In a DEMON jail cell Rose tells Dr. Arcane's daughter, Donnah, that she must become the new Dr. Arcane. Rose is able to release Donnah's power, transforming her into Lady Arcane. Meanwhile, the Demon Master, powered by the Hellfire Crown takes on the Champions. Giant becomes enraged when he sees his family threatened and begins a fight to the death with the Demon Master. Giant, distracted by Malice, is killed. Later at the DEMON base, The Demon Master asks Flare, Marksman, and Icestar to join him. Flare, who turns out to be the Demon Master's sister, flips out at her brother's manipulations. She surprises the Demon Master and takes control of the Hellfire Crown. Meanwhile, Foxbat helps Rose, the new Dr. Arcane, and Malice (now on the outs with the Demon Master), escape. Flare, powered by the Hellfire crown, devastates the Demon Master with a huge light blast. Malice sneaks in at the end, and claims the Demon Master's power from his dying body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPG Content:&lt;br/&gt;Barnick [character write-up] by Christopher Breen&lt;br/&gt;Salizar [character write-up] by Thorston Johnson&lt;br/&gt;Doctor Arcane [character write-up based on character created by Dennis Mallonee] uncredited&lt;br/&gt;Lady Arcane [character write-up based on character created by Dennis Mallonee] uncredited&lt;br/&gt;Champions Comments [Letters]&lt;br/&gt;Foxbat and Fandom by Foxbat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
