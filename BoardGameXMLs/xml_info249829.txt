							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flapjacks &amp; Sasquatches: Promo Pack</name>
									
			<description>This is a promo pack usually obtained at conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards include.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beard Envy.. &lt;br/&gt;But we have Beer!&lt;br/&gt;Camp Foreman&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I'm Thirsty, eh!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Lucette&lt;br/&gt;That's NOT Jimmy!&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of these cards simply get added to the deck.  However a few have special rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beard Envy and Lucette should be given to the players listed on the cards before the game starts.  Some folks find these two cards can be rather harsh on the starting player when combined but Prolific games thinks they should put on their big boy pants and earn that beard they were so proud of before these cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
