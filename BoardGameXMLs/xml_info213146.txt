							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PlayStation 4 Pro</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an updated version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware, including an upgraded GPU with 4.2 teraflops of processing power, and a higher CPU clock. It is designed primarily to enable selected games to be playable at 4K and improved quality for the PlayStation VR. All PS4 games are completely compatible with both the PS4 and the PS4 Pro, but optimized games will have improved graphics performance on the PS4 Pro. Although capable of streaming 4K video, the PS4 Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu-ray. Additionally, the PS4 Pro is the only PS4 model which can Remote Play at 1080p, with the others limited to 720p.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
