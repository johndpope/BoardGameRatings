			<description>[Taken from the back cover.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INFINITE ADVENTURES IN NUMBERLESS WORLDS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unbound is a universal roleplaying game with a twist: the players and the gamesmaster create the world, the plot, and the adversaries during character creation.  Using a series of leading questions and a rule system that lets players fill the gaps with their imagination, you'll craft a unique setting together - and then get out there and explore it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unbound supports short, linked campaigns and has an innovative, fast-paced combat system that puts pressure on the players to make tactical decisions every turn.  To play Unbound, you'll need a group of 3 to 6 players, a gamesmaster, and one deck of regular playing cards per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From the publisher site.]&lt;br/&gt;From the creator of Goblin Quest, One Last Job, Drunken Bear Fighter and more besides comes UNBOUND, a new tabletop roleplaying game. Co-written by Grant Howitt and Chris Taylor, UNBOUND is a mix of streamlined tactical combat and collaborative worldbuilding and storytelling. UNBOUND allows the players and gamesmaster the chance to craft the characters, the adventure and the game world together, all at the same time, through a series of directed prompts and leading questions tied to the powers and abilities that players choose for their characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve played in games featuring cyberpunk bodyhorror noir, drunk jungle wizards, dwarven robocops, young adult guerilla warfare, post-apocalyptic sci-fi dragonhunters and biomechanical high elf assault vampires. We can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what worlds you&amp;rsquo;ll create together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNBOUND is low-prep, high-content. With UNBOUND, the players and the GM contribute evenly to the story, so &amp;ndash; in the in very first session, and every session after that &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s a bare minimum of preparation. Everyone just turns up and plays: less planning, more awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNBOUND&amp;rsquo;s battle system is fluid and cinematic but supports interesting, round-to-round tactical decisions through a series of clever abstractions and an innovative stamina system. Using a deck of standard playing cards as both a way to determine chance and each character&amp;rsquo;s hitpoints, we&amp;rsquo;ve built a visceral and exciting way to have fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
