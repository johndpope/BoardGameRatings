							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizard of Shadowfell</name>
									
			<description>The Wizard of Shadowfell is a variant core character class for D20 Fantasy gamers, a twist on the Wizard haracter class most gamers are familiar with. The Wizard of Shadowfell is an attempt to emulate he wizardly heroes and protagonists of myth and&lt;br/&gt;literature; in particular, to allow players to build heroic arch-magi similar to three main inspirations: J.R.R. Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s Gandalf, Terry Brook&amp;rsquo;s Allanon the Druid, a character similar to Gandalf in many respects), and Merlin, as portrayed in films like Excalibur and Mists of Avalon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wizard of Shadowfell is a secretive, enigmatic and powerful spell caster. His sheer brilliance and indomitable will allows him to walk with demons and converse with gods, and in both cases he is treated as a rare equal. In contrast with the traditional Wizard, the Wizard of Shadowfell casts spells rarely and with great deliberation, but the spells the arch mage masters are incredibly powerful and can change the course of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizards of Shadowfell excel at tactics and deception, and are well versed in the history of nations, politics and court intrigue. Despite this, few Shadowfell Wizards rule openly, with most choosing to be the voice behind the throne&amp;rsquo;, or to rule through proxies. In an adventuring party, the highly educated and purposeful Wizard of Shadowfell is likely to be the team leader, the one who decides the course of a&lt;br/&gt;journey, who uses his sharp mind and divinatory spells to prepare the party to the dangers they will face on the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
