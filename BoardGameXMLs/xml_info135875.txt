			<description>Welcome to the world of SHADOWRUN ONLINE&lt;br/&gt;Become one of the infamous Shadowrunners in this multi-platform online version of one of the most successful pen and paper RPGs ever. Experience Shadowrun with your friends and plenty of enemies in a true cross-platform game and determine the future of the 6th world! Live your life on the edge, fight corporations and gangs and try to stay alive doing the most dangerous job of all: Shadowrunner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch your back.&lt;br/&gt;Shoot straight.&lt;br/&gt;Conserve ammo.&lt;br/&gt;And never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s it all about&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;In Shadowrun Online, set in the 2070s of our world, dragons are running mega corporations, Amerindian braves battle it out with Ork street gangs over turf, elf hackers glide through the all-encompassing matrix and cybered up street samurai face toxic spirits in the rubble of ruined streets. And YOU will be shaping the future of this world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a spell slinging mage, a cybered-up Street Sam or a matrix-running Hacker. Choose from hundreds of different types of magical and mundane gear or even change your body by adding implants and cyber-augmentations to improve your abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every character perceives the game world differently: While mages can see auras and look into the spirit plane, the right implant allows you to interact with the overlay of augmented reality permeating the modern world and hack anything from security cameras to combat drones. Knowledge really is power in Shadowrun Online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the best part is: In Shadowrun Online the collective actions of players will not only determine the fate of the online game world, but our unique player-driven plotline will enable you to determine the future of the whole Shadowrun Universe! Events players trigger will also cross over into the pen and paper storyline &amp;ndash; so you can shape the future of the Shadowrun Universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its core SRO is a full Unity3D online game, accessible through Windows, Mac, Android, iOS-  and Linux and on Ouya, with high quality graphics and great effects. It is fully cross platform, meaning you can play it on your tablet in the train, then go home to sit down at your PC to continue with the same character. Highly individualizable characters and a turn based system, which balances fast-paced action with deep tactical combat, make it a true Shadowrun experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the dark side of the future, pal. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a hell of a ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowrun Online&lt;br/&gt;In development by Cliffhanger Productions, Shadowrun Online brings the universe to a full cross-platform MMO experience for iOS, PC, Mac, Linux and Ouya. Filled with turn-based action and corporate intrigues, players will be caught in a desperate struggle between several rival megacorps in a frantic race for one of the best kept secrets of the Sixth World. In the end, it will mean the downfall of one of the megas and it will be up to the players to decide which one it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowrun Online will bring players from all around the world to one big virtual table, allowing them to collectively shape the future of the Shadowrun universe and share the excitement. Finally, your Shadowrun game will really come to life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalyst is working with Cliffhanger Productions on the Shadowrun Universe Website (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.shadowrun.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.shadowrun.com&lt;/a&gt;) and is coordinating setting and story, so that the game play of the MMO can have a direct impact on the storyline of the RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being part of the greatest revival and expansion the world of Shadowrun has ever seen is a dream come true. Working with Catalyst allows us to weave both our stories together and now also create Shadowrun Online as the first Shadowrun 5 ready computer game, so players will feel right at home! Being able to enjoy your game with your friends&amp;mdash;or even find new people to play with&amp;mdash;is the unique opportunity provided by an online game and we are very excited to be able to do just that for Shadowrun,&amp;rdquo; said Jan Wagner, Managing Director of Cliffhanger Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
