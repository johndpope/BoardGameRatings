			<description>Some people make and sell bread for a living. Others make and sell shoes. You, on the other hand, are a witch and you make and sell potions with your sisters. At first, making potions with your sisters was great, but now you&amp;rsquo;re frustrated that you have to split all of the profits with them even though you do most of the work yourself anyway. If you want to keep all the profits for yourself, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to mix in the last ingredient for each potion while your sisters are not looking. Then you can steal it away, sell it on your own, and go into business for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witchful Thinking is a mathematics-based card game where 2-4 players have to make potions by mixing ingredients in a cauldron. Each ingredient includes a number value ranging from -5 to +5 and each potion includes a number value ranging from -19 to +20. Players are able to make their selected potion when the combined value of the Ingredients equals the value of the potion.&lt;br/&gt;â€‹&lt;br/&gt;Witchful Thinking is a great resource to familiarize children with numeracy and to strengthen their mental math ability in both addition and subtraction. It's challenging for adults too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
