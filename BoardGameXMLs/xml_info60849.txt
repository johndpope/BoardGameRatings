							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rook&#039;s Haven</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been called &amp;ldquo;The Jewel of the North&amp;rdquo; by those who have never ventured out of the grand bazaar and the inns of the Foreign Quarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others call it &amp;ldquo;The City of Vice and Depravity.&amp;rdquo; What do they expect from a city founded by pirates and populated by the dregs of society?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rooks&amp;rsquo; Haven holds something for everyone. After all, if someone is willing to pay for it, chances are good that it can be found in &amp;ldquo;The City of Dark Delights.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a city where thieves and assassins rub shoulders with the heirs of nobility, adventure lurks around every corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't have to go looking for it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some how, it always finds you...&lt;br/&gt; Rooks' Haven is the first campaign supplement for the Lady's Rock. It details a metropolis that can truly be described as a &amp;quot;wretched hive of scum and villainy,&amp;quot; to steal a phrase from an incompetent member of a ancient mystic brotherhood of warrior monks that was destroyed and then almost completely forgotten in the span of 30 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's leaders are corrupt, and make no attempt to appear otherwise. It's citizens are thieves, liars, and whores... and many of them are proud of that fact. It is a depraved city that it indifferent to life, human or otherwise. But somewhere in the depravity lies a freedom that you cannot find in civilized lands. It is that freedom that draws people to the Lady's Rock like moths to a flame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
