							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Isandlwana (1879 AD)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;During the reign of Queen Victoria Great Britain built an impressive empire that spanned the globe. One of their most colorful military campaigns took place in 1879 when the British provoked a war with the Zulus in South Africa. The British expected a quick and easy victory but the Zulu warriors were no push overs . . . Isandlwana was the most disastrous defeat the British ever suffered at the hands of a native force.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This miniatures wargame is intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale miniature figures or paper figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A British commander can claim victory if any of his units survive the battle. The Zulu objective is to loot the British camp and wipe out the British infantry.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
