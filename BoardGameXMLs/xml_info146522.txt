			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat Asteroids in Outer Space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two objectives within this game. Firstly to break up asteroids before they beak you up, and secondly to destroy time bombs before they detonate. The normal hyperspace function is also included. Each player starts with three ships. When you have scored 10,000 points you will get another. The player can only shoot four shots at one time. Time bombs appear on the screen randomly. There are two types, one starts from the left hand side of the screen, the other from the right. Both move horizontally, of course, and there is a number in the middle of the bomb which counts down to 0 as it moves across the screen. If you do not shoot it before it hits 0, the bomb explodes, blowing up the ship and every rock on the screen. It is a flexible game in that there are no less than 10 different levels of play available. The level influences the number of rocks that fly around at the beginning and how often time bombs appear. The value of the time bomb countdown is also affected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPACE ROCKS also includes a subsidiary game called Space Battle. This enables the player to fight time bombs and enemy ships without worrying about rocks, that is to say, there are no asteroids in Space Battle. Although we imagine it is up to everybody to make their own judgement, this feature seems to us to be more use in providing an opportunity for practicing control of your space ship rather than meaning to be a serious game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
