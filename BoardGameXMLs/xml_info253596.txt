			<description>The Cinematic Game of Insane Survival Horror&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first rule of the game is that if a rule doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense or isn&amp;rsquo;t as fun for everyone as what you&amp;rsquo;d like to do, you can change it or ignore it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Screaming is a mechanics-heavy game with a lot of moving parts that can interact in unexpected ways. Usually these unexpected interactions are fun. If they&amp;rsquo;re not fun, as the Director you are free to do something about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Likewise, the game generates a lot of random effects, especially via various tables. If you roll something that isn&amp;rsquo;t as fun as you&amp;rsquo;d like, or if you have a better idea, change what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of making a major change to the game&amp;rsquo;s rules, run this proposed change by your players first to see if they like it or to answer any questions they have about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
