			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find yourself inside the Mages' Guild in Draconia. You came here because Morgan Armbruster, the leader of the guild, requested your presence. The letter that he sent you mentioned that the guild was having dragon problems. More specifically, their problems involved a venerable red dragon named Magda. For one reason or another, Magda had decided to unleash numerous assaults on the guild and its members. The guild has suffered heavy casualties as a result of these assaults, and because of your reputation as world-renowned dragon slayers, Morgan was interested in hiring you to take care of this problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
