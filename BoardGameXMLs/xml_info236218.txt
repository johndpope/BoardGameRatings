							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GNS and Other Matters of Role-playing Theory</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My straightforward observation of the activity of role-playing is that many participants do not enjoy it very much. Most role-players I encounter are tired, bitter, and frustrated. My goal in this writing is to provide vocabulary and perspective that enable people to articulate what they want and like out of the activity, and to understand what to look for both in other people and in game design to achieve their goals. The person who is entirely satisfied with his or her roleplaying experiences is not my target audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
