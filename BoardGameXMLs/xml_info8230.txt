Where's the male monkey? This memory game has players searching for pairs of animals to put on Noah's Ark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the animals cards are placed face down on the trail of the game board.

When all the animals are matched into pairs and placed on the Ark, count how many you placed in your section. Whoever finds the most pairs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: Game board, Plastic Ark with gang plank that fits into game board, 20 Animal Cards (10 male, 10 female), 4 colored game pieces, 1 die, Game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes in a box with both English and French description and rules.
