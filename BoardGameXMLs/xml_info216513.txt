			<description>WORLD'S FIRST BOARD GAME FOR DEVELOPERS AND MANAGERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORYLINE&lt;br/&gt;You are working for one of the most promising tech startups in Silicon Valley. Everybody expects the release of v2.0 of your product. This could be a huge leap for the whole company, or it might destroy it if the deadline is not met. The CEO has offered $100 000 to the team that contributes most for the new release. This will be either the developers or the PM team claiming the credit.Who will be the hero of the day? And which team will be remembered by history? It&amp;rsquo;s all up to you and your friends to decide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE&lt;br/&gt;Developers vs Managers is an entertaining / educational board game. The game is designed for IT Specialists by IT Specialists. The purpose of the game is to improve the soft skills of everybody involved. Developers vs Managers is ideal for play when you are on a team building event, having fun in the office or just breaking the ice with new people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;First - gather 5 to 10 friends or colleagues&lt;br/&gt;Draw your role and keep it secret until the end of the game!&lt;br/&gt;Are you a developer or a manager?&lt;br/&gt;The others will judge you by your actions, not just by what you are saying!&lt;br/&gt;Pick-cards&lt;br/&gt;Then: You are the one in charge of who is taking part in the release or not! But you also need to win the trust of the rest of the players that you are leading them to the win...&lt;br/&gt;Pick-a-team&lt;br/&gt;Now vote! The twist of the game is executing the sprint. Is it successful thanks to the effort of the development or management team?&lt;br/&gt;Hint: developers trust only other developers. managers know someone needs to &amp;quot;manage the resources&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;If the developers execute 3 successful sprints they win!&lt;br/&gt;Unless!&lt;br/&gt;The managers guess correctly who the CTO is. Then they win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is extremely addicting because the longer you play, the more you fall into it and the more intense the game gets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
