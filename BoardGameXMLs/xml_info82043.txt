			<description>Bad Street Brawler is a 1987 video game by Beam Software Pty., Ltd. It was distributed worldwide by Mindscape Inc. and Mattel. It was released for the Commodore Amiga, the Commodore 64, MS-DOS, and the NES. The NES version was one of only two NES games specifically designed for use with Mattel's Power Glove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player plays the character Duke Davis, who goes from stage to stage beating up gangsters that get in his way, dressed in a yellow tank top, sunglasses, and yellow pants. He is described as a former punk rocker and the &amp;quot;world's coolest&amp;quot; martial artist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the start of the next stage, quotes are introduced to entertain the player (such as &amp;quot;Never trouble trouble until trouble troubles you&amp;quot;). The player fights a variety of enemies, such as gorillas and old ladies who throw pocketbooks at the player (resembling weightlifter dwarves who throw dumbbells at the player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bad Street Brawler&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
