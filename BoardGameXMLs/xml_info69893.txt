							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Revenge of the Red Dragon</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;A New Kind of Game&lt;br/&gt;Inside are two books for two players. One of you becomes Flametongue, an ancient Red Dragon. The other becomes his enemy, Raven, the Black Knight. The two of you are engaged in a desperate race -- the Black Knight must reach the safety of his castle before the Red Dragon catches him!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You each have a map of the countryside. You both know where the Black Knight's castle is located. But between here and there are many obstacles, for no one in the countryside has much use for either the Black Knight or the Red Dragon! Powerful wizards, giants, and others lie in wait, hoping for a chance to catch either or both of you! (Your opponent takes the part of all monsters and enemies you fight, just as you take the part of any enemies he faces!) An easy, dice-less combat system simulates battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In is an exciting game of adventure and pursuit, combined with magic. Everything you need to play is provided: two books, maps, Combat Table, Character Sheets. No dice required. All you provide is one friend and two pencils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY ANYTIME! ANYWHERE!&lt;br/&gt;PLAY MANY TIMES!&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck in participating in&lt;br/&gt;THE REVENGE OF THE RED DRAGON!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
