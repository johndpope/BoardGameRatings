			<description>Totally is a game of arranging numbers so that they add up to a given total. It can be totally frustrating as you struggle to find a spot for a final number, but it's always totally fascinating and totally fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game plays like a numbers Take It Easy.  One player randomly selects 15 of the 30 numbers available in his color, and the other players select those same numbers from their pool.  Then two &amp;quot;key total&amp;quot; tiles are selected and revealed.  The players then attempt to arrange their tiles in such a way that rows and columns equal one of the two key totals, with their figure based around only one of the key totals.  When one player announces they are done, a three-minute timer begins and the remaining players must finish their work before the time runs out.  Scores are based on the sum of the number of tiles used in lines horizontally and vertically less the sum of the unused tiles multiplied by 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
