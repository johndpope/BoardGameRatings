			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Mii is a detective investigating the mystery of a haunted house, along with your assistant Ella Mentree. You search the mansion for map pieces and fight monsters along the way. By tagging other Nintendo 3DS players via StreetPass tags, you select differently shaped pieces and place them on your map, generating doors, corridors, and stairs to the next floor. When like-colored pieces are connected, they form a room which may contain treasure chests. As more pieces are collected, more of the mansion can be explored. When weapons are used in battle, they can be powered up. You can also upgrade your weapons by using other ones you no longer need. Tickets are earned which can be redeemed for accessories for your Mii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
