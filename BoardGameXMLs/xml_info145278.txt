			<description>From the introduction of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Spark?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spark is a roleplaying, storytelling game. In this game, you play the roles of the most important characters in a fictional world. You cooperate to tell a story of heroic deeds and personal struggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;diams;&amp;diams; Create fictional characters and use them to explore a rich Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;diams;&amp;diams; Collaborate with your friends to tell a dynamic story.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;diams;&amp;diams; Explore the themes and issues that matter to you.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;diams;&amp;diams; Make meaningful choices and drive the story forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Romeo and Juliet is a tale of two youths torn between family, loyalty and romantic love. Moby Dick, by Herman Melville, focuses on the cost of vengeance. Samwise Gamgee in The Lord of The Rings explored themes of bravery and sacrifice in his loyal service to Frodo Baggins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spark RPG helps you tell those kinds of stories by those kinds of characters. It&amp;rsquo;s about examining motivations, convictions, and perspectives through play, and learning a bit about ourselves in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spark RPG is about imagining, building, and exploring fictional worlds. It gives you all of the tools and guidance you need to create an evocative and engaging Setting. It shows you how to find inspiration and collaboratively build a world with your friends. Most importantly, it teaches you how to create a place that each of you find compelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is purpose-built to foster creating dynamic, custom Settings. You can work together to create a world that interests all of you, one that gives you a context for rich stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge your Beliefs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You tell a story about a group of individuals with their own firmly held convictions. These characters struggle with each other and the world to uphold their Beliefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more you challenge your Beliefs, the more Influence you gain and the more Conflicts you can win during play. By changing yourself, you can change the world. It&amp;rsquo;s a game about self-reflection and personal growth. A game that helps you explore real life issues and learn a little bit more about yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
