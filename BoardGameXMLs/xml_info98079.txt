							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Darkness in the Woods (DCS)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Darkness in the woods is designed as an adventure for a party of low level characters and serves as a good introduction to the DCS System. The GM should feel free to add additional monsters to the adventure as well as additional traps and such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I originally ran this adventure at a series of conventions and because the characters were low level I kept the combat to a minimum and concentrated on pure atmosphere. In looking at the actual flow for the adventure it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple, go and get something. Where the adventure comes into its own is with atmosphere..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
