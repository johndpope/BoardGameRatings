							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead</name>
									
			<description>To get a bit of relaxation after the last great battle fought in Grotesque Tactics 2: Dungeons &amp;amp; Donuts, Holy Avatar decides to grab a little R&amp;amp;R with his Guild of Maidens on a Caribbean island he recently purchased and renamed; &amp;ldquo;Holy Island&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Upon arrival on the beach, they make a gruesome discovery; numerous dead maidens, horribly mutilated, are scattered all over the path to the center of the island. The Guild of Maidens is afraid that something horrible has happened in the maidens&amp;rsquo; camp on the island. Holy Avatar must investigate what happened on the island and the toll this disaster has already taken. New adventures, new hazards and, did we mention the zombies&amp;hellip; await our hero and his companions inside the dense woods and caves of this once idyllic island.&lt;br/&gt; Silent Dreams has listened and reacted to the community&amp;rsquo;s suggestions and demands with new optics that were redone from scratch, fresh Cel-Shading graphics and an overly colorful and clean look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this new approach, Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead is introducing a fixed camera, which will provide you with a clear overview of the events in the game. Zooming in and out is still possible, as well as the ability to move the camera over the whole map. From the technical point of view, the game is in line with the endemic Caribbean flair as the HUD is provided with a tropical design, as well as the character portraits got a general overhaul and the entire game is wrapped in the steel drum-marked Caribbean soundtrack, carrying the comforting Southern Sea feeling throughout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
