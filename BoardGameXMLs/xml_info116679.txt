							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NFL GameDay</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NFL GameDay was the first installment of the almost completely PlayStation exclusive football series developed in-house by Sony.  The first year's game was released both in the long box, which was typical of many early PlayStation games, and in the jewel case, which became the iconic packaging for games on the console.  NFL GameDay got a lot of attention when it came out and was generally held to be equal to or better than its more established rival, Madden '96.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
