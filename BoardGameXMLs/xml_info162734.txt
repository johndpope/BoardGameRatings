							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tactical Game 3</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;This game was the precursor to PanzerBlitz. It was developed from two playest projects at Poultron Press, Highway 61 and State Farm 69. Tac Game 3 is the very first commercially available board wargame to depict modern ground combat at the tactical level. This two-player game pits German and Russian armoured forces against each other on the Eastern Front in 1944.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sold by direct mail and advertised in S&amp;amp;T, not sold in boxed version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
