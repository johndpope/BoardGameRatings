							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mor Aldenn Setting Guide</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A PFRPG Campaign Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located at the heart of an ancient realm, Mor Aldenn is a wondrous place where magic is part of everyday life. It has been home to the mages for more than three centuries and their magic has had a great impact on the city itself. Their towers rise above even the great trees of Ossindrillon, overlooking the vast realm that surrounds the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People of the City of Mages accept magic and try to use it to their advantage. They understand fully that, used correctly, magic can be one of life's many luxuries. It is a rare thing to find a person with Mor Aldenn who fears magic and the mages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITY OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mor Aldenn, City of Mages, the Tower City, sits on an island at the juncture of two rivers. The city began as a small human and elven settlement but soon grew to the size it is today. A literal crossroads where merchant ships bound for the Great Ocean embark, and highways lead to the Old Kingdoms, the upstart principality of Calathia, and the shining city of the elves, Ossindil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visitors must enter the city from one of the docks or from across the single bridge leading to the mainland on the island's northeast side. This arrangement has served the city well, making it difficult for the Night Hag's minions to assault the city without plenty of warning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new visitor probably remarks on the prevalence of magic in the city. Lamp posts with continual flame spells line several main streets, and shops and homes also often bear such lights at their doorways, making the city relatively well-lit at night. It is not uncommon to see a wizard or sorcerer borne along through the air on a carpet of flying or traveling the streets atop a palanquin balanced on the shoulders of a demon servant. If asked, citizens can direct the visitor to one of the two locations where the city rulers have installed decanters of endless water to ensure a supply of fresh water for the populace. Shops which deal in magic items, spellcasting, alchemy and other arcane services are much more common in Mor Aldenn than in other similar-sized settlements. Then, of course, there are the wondrous towers of magic, for which Mor Aldenn is most famous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Setting Guide also includes a short introductory adventure by none other than the amazing Ron Lundeen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
