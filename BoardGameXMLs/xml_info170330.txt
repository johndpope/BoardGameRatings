			<description>Paraphrased from The Penguin Book of Card Games (2008 Paperback &quot;Jack&quot;):&lt;br/&gt;This basic traditional trick-taking game calls for exactly six players, either individually (Sixte) or in two teams (Sizette).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six cards are dealt to each player. Reveal the last card for the trump suit. Suit must be followed if possible. Tricks are won by the highest trump played, else by the highest card of the suit led.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A point is awarded for winning three tricks. On the other hand, if every player wins one trick, whoever won the first trick gets a point. If neither condition is met, no points are awarded. Play to six points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
