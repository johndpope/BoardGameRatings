							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BrainBox: Cities of the World</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you know which people founded Copenhagen? Or what the former name of New York was? BrainBox Cities of the world contains 71 beautifully-illustrated cards showing famous cities of the world!&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
