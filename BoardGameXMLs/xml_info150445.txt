							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">007 Legends</name>
									
			<description>007 Legends is a first-person shooter video game featuring the character of British secret agent James Bond. It is developed by Eurocom and released in October 2012 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, November 2012 for Microsoft Windows and December 2012 for Wii U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose behind the game is to celebrate fifty years of James Bond in film. To achieve this the single player campaign will include one mission from each of the six actors' eras, being Goldfinger (Sean Connery), On Her Majesty's Secret Service (George Lazenby), Moonraker (Roger Moore), Licence to Kill (Timothy Dalton) and Die Another Day (Pierce Brosnan), with Skyfall (Daniel Craig) released as downloadable content for the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC and included on disc for the Wii U version. Additionally, some of the original talent from the films are adding their likenesses and voices to their associated characters. 007 Legends is the fourth and final James Bond game title to be released by Activision, as well as the last game released ever developed by Eurocom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being built on the engine used for Eurocom&amp;rsquo;s previous title, 2011&amp;rsquo;s GoldenEye 007: Reloaded, 007 Legends shares much of the same gameplay, though there are some notable additions and modifications. The most significant change is the greater focus on stealth-based play, with enemy AI being more suspicious and investigative. Throughout the campaign players will frequently be presented with situations that require stealth to get past, though often running-and-gunning will also be an option. To compliment such stealth scenarios, players will have access to three gadgets from the start of the campaign: the returning smartphone, which has new vision modes and binocular capabilities; a new dart pen that can fire three different types of dart, including distraction, shock and tranquillizer darts; and a wristwatch that can fire a laser and map nearby enemies and cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;007 Legends&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
