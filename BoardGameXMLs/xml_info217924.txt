							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fall of Stalingrad</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of Joni Nuutinen's Conflict Series. The player takes the role of German forces and their Axis allies at the dawn of the Soviet counter-offensive that encircled the city of Stalingrad and sealed the fate of the German 6th Army and turned the tide of World War II in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Axis forces are on the defensive as the Soviets pour through the lines and the Axis forces are stifled by command confusion and unable to move. Can you prevent the encirclement of Stalingrad and retake the initiative. The game has varying levels of difficulty to make for just the right challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
