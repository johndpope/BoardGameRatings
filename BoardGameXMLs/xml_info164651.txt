			<description>The players have to get from their starting point (Berlin, Madrid, London or Rom) to Monte Carlo. The first player to arrive in Monte Carlo wins the game. Movement ist determined by cards (F.X. Schmidt &amp;quot;Super Mini Rallye-Autos Trumpfquartett). Each player gets 5 Cards. At his turn the player reads the data on his first card, indicated on the space his meeple stands on, and compares it's value with the other players. The player with the highest value moves 4 spaces, the second 3 spaces, the third 2 spaces and the fourth 1 space on the game board. When player gets on a red space hes has to change the car and uses the next card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
