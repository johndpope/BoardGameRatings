							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BrainBox: Once Upon a Time</name>
									
			<description>Do you know how the gingerbread crossed the river? Or how many bears live in the house Goldilocks found in the woods? BrainBox Once Upon A Time contains 55 beautifully-illustrated cards showing scenes from some of the best loved children stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner. This simple concept can be played by all ages and in large groups as well as a 1 person game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
