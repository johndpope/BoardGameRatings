			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triangles is a series of 90-card decks of playing cards. Each card represents a piece of a triangle, numbered 1-3. The triangles are &amp;quot;cut&amp;quot; in one of three ways (horizontal, vertical and centered cut) which works as suits, and the numbers 1, 2 and 3 of the same cut make a complete triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 81 triangle pieces and 9 whole triangles (jokers) in each deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each installment in the Triangles series has a distinct visual theme and rules for two games: a base game titled &amp;quot;Triangle Mayhem&amp;quot; and a bonus game only introduced in that particular installment, however any Triangles game can be played with any of the decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bonus game in &amp;quot;Triangles: Original is titled &amp;quot;Triangle Tricks&amp;quot;, and the deck features photographic artwork from the world cities of Sydney, Los Angeles and London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRIANGLE MAYHEM: Complete triangles by playing cards (triangle pieces) at the center of the table. The table is free for all meaning anyone can start a new triangle, continue an existing triangle, or complete a triangle by playing the final missing piece. Multiple triangles can be in the making simultaneously and whoever completes a triangle scores its cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRIANGLE TRICKS: A trick-taking game with a twist where the highest number (1-3, joker) takes the trick. In the event that two players are tied the same trick continues and all players - even those who played a low card - are still in the game. Points can can quickly stack up and experienced players will know when to play low cards, trusting that other players will tie to keep the trick going for another round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
