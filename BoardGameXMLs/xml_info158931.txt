			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the beginning of time, evil has threatened to break free of the abyss and overrun our world. But there have always been a few brave souls who have fought to hold it back. They are called HUNTERS. Hunters: Battle of Arkady is a fully cooperative action/horror board game for 2 to 6 players ages 13 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunters: Battle of Arkady uses poker-sized cards to create a dynamic playing board, allowing each game experience to be different. Players then work together to defeat the Arch-Demon Avenastur before the town of Arkady is consumed by darkness. Players have a choice of six characters to play as, each with individual stats and abilities. During the course of play, additional monsters are revealed and must be fought or dismissed as the character's abilities allow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has eight phases, beginning with the character's movement about the board. Avenastur (the Demon) then moves to &amp;quot;chase&amp;quot; the nearest player. If the player has moved, then one or more monster cards are revealed. Once there is a monster in the player's &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; then the attack/defense part of their turn begins. The player must always roll their attack, depending on the number of d6s their character has, and then roll the attack of the monster who attempts to hit them. Once all the monsters in the &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; are defeated, the character my Investigate their location. Certain locations have special perks, such as extra lives that can be collected for use by any player, or additional abilities granted to all players. Next the player can regen their health/mana pool as their stats allow. Finally, the Growing Darkness phase flips a location card facedown, losing any special perks remaining, and ending the player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won or lost depending on the defeat of the &amp;quot;Main Boss&amp;quot; Avenastur. Killing him wins the game for all the players. However, if the town of Arkady is overrun by the Growing Darkness, the players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
