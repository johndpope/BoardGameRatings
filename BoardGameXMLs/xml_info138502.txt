			<description>From the author:&lt;br/&gt;As the 1930s begin, the Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries and the Enlightenment of Mankind is the foremost institution of learning and research in the world. You are esteemed members of the Committee, each a pulp hero of the first order, and you are all newly returned from an expedition to discover an ancient city and the lost secrets hidden there. Now you sit before the assembled Committee to give a full report of your expedition. Each of you harbors the same desire in your heart&amp;ndash;to be recognized as the first among equals and to garner the most acclaim for your incomparable contributions to the expedition's success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
