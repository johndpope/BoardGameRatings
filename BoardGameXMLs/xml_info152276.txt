			<description>MicroSport Soccer is a fast-playing finger-flicking action game played with a portable board and small coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game revolves around players taking turns flicking the coin in an attempt to land it on the goal. Individual player zones govern ball possession, while additional rules cover passing, turnovers, throw-ins, and goal kicks. The adjustable size of each team's player zones and goals allows amateurs to compete with experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
