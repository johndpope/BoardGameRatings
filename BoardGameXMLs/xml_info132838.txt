			<description>The story follows the adventures of a young girl named Mika, who, along with her companions Yuteki, Evelyn, Sauber, RuRu and Berger must travel the world in order to stop a rising evil from engulfing the land while slowly unraveling Mika's past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales of Breaker is modeled closely after the conventional games of the Tales series. It plays like a typical role-playing video game, with the player advancing the plot by fulfilling a number of tasks given by non-playable characters and defeating several monsters along the way. The game uses the familiar Linear Motion Battle System that is featured in several other games in the series, which involves the characters moving horizontally across the battlefield, striking enemies only when they are close enough, with all the action happening in real-time. The maximum battle party number is two characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Mobile,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Mobile,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
