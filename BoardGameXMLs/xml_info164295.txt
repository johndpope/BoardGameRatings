			<description>From The Game Crafter page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you conquer the catacombs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;             Now with BIGGER BAG! Easier to select cubes at random, and enough room to store all the game pieces as an alternative to the game box ***&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QUBQST (cubequest) is a dice rolling, dungeon crawling game, that takes classic elements from early fantasy role-playing games, and mixes them with simple to pick up gameplay, and retro computer game style graphics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QUBQST plays like a casual computer game - generate your catacombs, take your party of characters (Warrior, Wizard and Thief) through, encountering creatures, traps, secret rooms, items and treasures, until you reach the Golden Cube, your final destination in the catacombs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only by defeating all of the creatures on the Golden Cube, can the party win, calculate their score, and see how they rank - will they be Hopeless Heroes, Average Adventurers, or Catacomb Conquerors?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play alone to beat your best score, or with others either co-operatively, or to beat each other's scores!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CHARACTERS!&lt;br/&gt;Warrior - no special skills, but strong and great in combat, and can go into a beserker fighting rage!&lt;br/&gt;Wizard - weak in combat, but can cast classic spells like Invisibility, Shield, Heal and Fireball!&lt;br/&gt;Thief - can sneak past creatures, steal their treasures, disarm traps, and detect secret rooms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CREATURES!&lt;br/&gt;The classic creatures in the catacombs range from Kobolds to Cockatrices, Goblins to Gelatinous Cubes, and Banshees to Balrogs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE TREASURES!&lt;br/&gt;Collect Gold Pieces and Gems, find the Vorpal Sword, the Holy Cross, the Spellbook and more to help you on your quest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CUBES!&lt;br/&gt;QUBQST has 36 cubes (dice) in total!&lt;br/&gt;10 Catacomb Cubes (including the Golden Cube) - caverns, chambers and corridors to explore&lt;br/&gt;9 Combat Cubes - used to determine the results of combat&lt;br/&gt;8 Creature Cubes - the different creatures that dwell in the catacombs&lt;br/&gt;4 Cache Cubes - Gold Pieces, Gems, Normal Items and Magic Items&lt;br/&gt;3 Character Cubes - Warrior, Wizard and Thief, used to show their Hit Power and test their skills&lt;br/&gt;1 Casting Cube - shows how many Casting Points the Wizard has&lt;br/&gt;1 Contraption Cube - shows any traps that are triggered&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
