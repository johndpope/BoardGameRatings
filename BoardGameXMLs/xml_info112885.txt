			<description>Super Strike Eagle, known in Japan as F-15 Super Strike Eagle (Ｆ－１５スーパーストライクイーグル F-15 Supa Sutoraiku Iguru), is a combat-oriented arcade video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This video game involves flying airplanes that tests the player's Sidewinder missile and machine gun firing skills against various non-aligned nations that were historically notorious for housing extremist leaders during the Cold War. The game was released in North America, Europe, and Japan approximately simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various types of targets in the game, including air, land and water targets in an environment that gives players permission to freely roam around the battlefield; limited only by the player's fuel supply. Land targets include nuclear power plants (but often include anti-air weapons and tanks); the player may suffer from radiation sickness after destroying nuclear plants when not at a safe distance to do so. The player will eventually need to use one of his/her limited sorties to have it healed; neglecting to do so will have fatal results. Weapons in the game include guns, missiles, electronic jammers, and bombs. Each mission on every war theatre consists of both mandatory and optional targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooting the optional targets results in the accumulation of a higher score which can double as a respect meter for bragging rights. Furthermore, destroying airfields, although not necessarily required to complete a mission, would stop opposing fighters taking-off to take the player down. In the more advanced missions, players can shoot chemical weapons factories and terrorist camps for bonus points. Although the game cannot be saved through a video game battery, there are a number of passwords the player can use to resume his/her mission at the appropriate place. Crashing the airplane and being killed in action will result in the flags (located at the United Nations building in New York) being lowered to half-mast. Dying in the game will also produce the playing of Taps while the world mourns the deceased pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a practice round and then the player is thrown into real-life combat zones in order to test the skills learned in the practice round. Targets become progressively difficult to destroy. Unlike most shooter games, the player only has one plane. If the player crashes, the game is over and a screen indicating the nations (if any) that were reclaimed by the player displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Strike Eagle&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
