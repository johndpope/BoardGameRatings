			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rangers are a sub-class of the fighter. They are masters of the outdoors, patrolling and protecting large stretches of wilderness from evil humanoids and monsters. Rangers often take on the role of spy, scout and the first line of defense for more civilized and settled areas. They are well-versed in combat and survival in wilderness settings...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find TWO optional Ranger classes for Labyrinth Lord and other Basic Edition Fantasy games. It includes descriptions of abilities like Tracking,Move Silently, Direction Sense, Wilderness Survival, Hide and Listen. In addition, one version of Ranger includes Damage Bonus against humanoids and the other version expands the Rangers skills. This product is formatted so that it can printed out and placed in a folder or a rule book for easy access during game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
