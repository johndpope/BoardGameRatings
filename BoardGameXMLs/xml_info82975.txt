							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dance Dance Revolution X2</name>
									
			<description>Dance Dance Revolution X2, abbreviated DDR X2 or simply X2, is a music video game, and a part of the Dance Dance Revolution series.&lt;br/&gt;Over 70 new songs are included in X2. All licensed songs from Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova and Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2  (With the exception of &amp;quot;Angelus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Golden Sky&amp;quot;) have been removed due to their licenses expiring. However, 4 classic licensed songs from earlier DDR mixes have returned in remastered form, along with a special remixed license track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the new features included in the main game mode is a special &amp;quot;extra stage&amp;quot; system. Known as Replicant D-action, this mode allows players to choose from a set of 6 difficult songs. When a player gets rank AA or more one of these songs (any difficulty), they receive a medal for that particular track. When players subsequently earn all 6 medals, they can access the Encore Extra Stage, &amp;quot;Valkyrie dimension&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dance Dance Revolution X2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
