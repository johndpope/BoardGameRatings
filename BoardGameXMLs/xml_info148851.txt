			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides you with a new race your players may select to use while creating characters in your games. Aside from the base Racial Traits, within each product in this series you will find some Racial Edges, possibly some related Hindrances, new gear, and other materials of relevance to the new player race. In this particular product Misfit Studios gives you the dragon men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon men are an offshoot of the greater dragon race, and just like dragons they come in a number of variations (as found in the Monster Brief: Dragons and Monster Brief: More Dragons products), and so information is provided to customize the basic Racial Traits to suit each of them. Also included are nearly a dozen new Hindrances, including a sub-category unique to dragon men: Breeding Hindrances, representing what can go wrong when a dragon man breaks free of its shell. There are also over 20 new Edges, most of which are Racial Edges for dragon men (and, in some cases, other races with similar natural abilities.) Rounding out this product is a suit of armor that is tailored to a dragon man's unique anatomy, including an armor piece that allows them to turn their tails into weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
