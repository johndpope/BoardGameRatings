			<description>A very unusual and interesting adaptation of real life car sales/trading translated into a boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start play as a normal everyday person, a &amp;quot;punter&amp;quot;, whose compelling ambition is to become a car dealer. Through life's ups and downs, you must collect the 5 cars you need, of any make, to become a garage owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a garage owner, you move to the next level on the board, with the opportunity to buy &amp;amp; sell additional cars, and also to aim for a main dealership - if you have sufficient stock of one make of car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very clever and absorbing game- easy to pick up as you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
