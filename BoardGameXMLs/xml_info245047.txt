							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Major League Baseball Challenge Game</name>
									
			<description>The Major League Baseball Challenge game is personalized to each team in Major League baseball.  The box covers are designed for each team as well as a playing board which duplicates the home teams ball park, all in full color. No dice involved, this is a card game with special &amp;quot;at bat&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fielding&amp;quot; cards which control play and provide real life baseball action. The rules are simple and the game is fast with sudden reversals like a home run with two on in the bottom of the 9th inning, for a come from behind win. Good Luck and &amp;quot;Play Ball.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
