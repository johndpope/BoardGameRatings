			<description>Quantified is a cooperative board game set in a world in where everyone's behavior is constantly surveilled and analyzed. A player's behavior results in a social credit score, determining their position on the social ladder. Players start from different positions on the social ladder, as refugee, unemployed or employed, with unequal access to human rights. The goal of the game is to make all rights accessible to all players and to fight the implementation of totalitarian policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a typical turn, players will be able to move around the city, add non-player-characters to their network, attempt to solve so-called rally cards (initiatives that support human equality), attempt to prevent so-called threat cards (automatic, constantly approaching negative effects, such as invasive amendments, correction camps or totalitarian laws) or even simply work an official or illegal job. The trick is, not every action can be taken by every player: for example, those without the right to movement take longer to cross the city, or those without the right to free speech can't share their rally cards with others. And even the actions you can take must be taken with care as all actions leak personal data and if too much is leaked the players may have to face behavior analysis cards that negatively impact their collective game state!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, by solving enough rally cards or working their way of the social ladder, every player should have access to all four of the human rights. Once this is completed, the players have won! But if three totalitarian laws come into effect before then (or the threat deck runs out) the players will collectively lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
