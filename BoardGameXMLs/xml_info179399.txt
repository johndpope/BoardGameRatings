			<description>The game is an up-to-four player cooperative experience with four distinct player characters working together to solve a mystery in an action-horror setting. Some characters wield firearms where as others use magical abilities. Players will make their way through levels with randomly generated elements such as enemy locations, locked doors, or even room layouts to make their way to a safety vault at the end of the level. Throughout it the players will have to fight off various types of enemies by means of firepower and creating light-sources to defeat them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Alone in the Dark: Illumination&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
