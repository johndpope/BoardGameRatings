			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like sleep without dreams.   [Werner Herzog]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALIEN BREEDS is a roleplaying supplement for the Cepheus Engine and other classic 2D6 SF roleplaying games.  It details a new species of hostile alien predator with both an unnerving and horrific lifecycle as well as an ability to mutate ad hoc to suit its current environment. ALIEN BREEDS works well within Zozer Games&amp;rsquo;  own SF setting called HOSTILE, but it can be used in any Cepheus Engine game &amp;ndash; as long as your players can handle this beast&amp;hellip; and there is certainly no guarantee of that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the book is a typical colony installation. It is a fairly small example, big enough to hold may be 50 or 60 people, enough for an extended science survey, a prospecting mission or the maintenance of some new equipment on planet &amp;ndash; perhaps a powerplant, refinery, test mine or atmosphere processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colony layout is used in the included adventure &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;Outbreak&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
