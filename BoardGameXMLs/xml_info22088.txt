							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oil Spill</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You are the captain of an oil supertanker. Your objective is to outmaneuver the other captains and be the first to collect and deliver your cargo of crude oil to the refinery. Chart your course to navigate the environmentally sensitive waters and the hazards of the savage seas. Be prepared to face the consequences of human error. Each roll of the dice presents new obstacles and calls for different strategies. You will be rewarded for your environmental foresight. Reefs, Ice Floes and Oil Pirates make this an exciting adventure, challenging all captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bon Voyage!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;On March 24, 1989 the tanker Exxon Valdez crashed into Bligh Reef and spilled nearly eleven million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. The environmental effects were catastrophic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was not the first Oil Spill.&lt;br/&gt;It was not the last Oil Spill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned.&lt;br/&gt;This game will help people become more aware of oil transportation and methods of preparation for and prevention of oil spills.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incredibly over-produced, and apparently incredibly random roll-and-move game, with tons of chance cards, most of which punish the player for lack of environmental foresight...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
