			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get your motor runnin'--you're in for the most challenging motorcycle racing experience ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're racing in the championship, competing against a friend or just trying to beat the records, this race is so real you'll feel the g-force, hear bugs crash against your helmet and smell the burning octane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feel the adrenaline pumping through your blood as the announcer signals the start of the race. As you zoom away from the start, the engine's roar will be echoed by your pounding heart. Hit the first curve at break-neck speed and launch into the straights as you push your bike to the limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you finish each lap, your ears will ring with the crowd's thunderous cheers. Pushing your bike to the edge, scream past the competition and pound home to the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
