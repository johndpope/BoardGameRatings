							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Packy and Marlon</name>
									
			<description>Packy and Marlon was designed to improve self-care behavior in children with juvenile diabetes. The game achieved some success with treatment groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A gang of rats has invaded Camp Wa-kee, and stolen the Food and Medical Supplies, hiding them in different areas of the Camp. As such, Packy and Marlon, two diabetic elephants, are tasked with retrieving the stolen goods and clearing out the malicious rodents, while also remembering to take their insulin and check their blood glucose. At the end of the game they face the evil bosses Veets and Yebur of the Lunch Room Crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Packy and Marlon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
