							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sky Kingdoms: Good Evil &amp; Primal Forces</name>
									
			<description>Establish dominance of the skies with armies of battle-hardened warriors who attack from ancient machinations of war called Sky Kingdoms. Take control of the Good, Evil or Primal forces in this fast paced, expandable card game. Decimate opposing forces, and lay waste to their floating realms, then claim enough gold to build a new flying fortress capable of not only winning the battle, but the war itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a glance&lt;br/&gt;Sky Kingdoms is a light strategy game intended to keep every player engaged and active at every point of the game. The round-robin game mechanic (think Poker) keeps turns fast, and a single stat (think Blizzard's Hearthstone) makes for simple yet strategic gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Sky Kingdoms is to collect as much Gold as possible by battling for control of the Skies. The first player to collect enough gold wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Battle mechanic&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is made up of a series of Combat Rounds, where each player has the opportunity to use over 48 unique Unit Cards and Battle Cards in combination to produce the highest Combat Value, win Combat and collect Gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
