			<description>Quest with us as we embark into an enchanted forest where the mighty Elf King grows tired of the Faeries in charge and requests a dance of leadership for his enjoyment.  Listen in as Katie, Tim, and Matt take on the roles of Faery faction leaders and attempt to win the favor of the Elf King and thus secure a thousand year reign for our faction of elf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elf dance is a simple card game that will provide enjoyment for any age. If you are interested in helping this project get funded you can click the little faeries throughout this post!  But hurry you only have four days left before the Elf King grows angry and banishes this game to the planet Thra!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;Elf Dance is a 2 to 3 player game. Each player has a Native Clan, determined before play begins. The player&amp;rsquo;s goal is to recruit as many Faeries and Goblins (Faery and Goblin cards) as possible to the player&amp;rsquo;s Native Clan,while thwarting the other players from recruiting Faery and Goblin cards to their own Native&lt;br/&gt;Clans. The game itself is one of the players: its Native Clan is always the Goblin Clan, and the game itself may possibly come out the winner. Each player&amp;rsquo;s recruited Faery and Goblin cards are kept in a pile by the player&amp;rsquo;s side, and whoever has the most&lt;br/&gt;of these recruited cards when the deck runs out wins the game (bonuses and penalties from equipped Enchantment Cards are also counted).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
