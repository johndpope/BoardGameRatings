			<description>This is a similar game to the well known Scrabble in that letters tiles are blind drawn and used to form words, and that the objective is to score points. However there are significant differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) The words are placed on table in a pool area rather than being in a crossword grid. So word two does not need to have a letter in common with word one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) There are not points on the letters, but points are scored primarily based on the number of letters in the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) 350 letter tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(4) After each turn unused letters are put in a discard pool which subsequent players can used to make words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
