			<description>Ortho is a game intended to sensitize players to correct writing.  It aims to do this by making spelling entertaining and the more they play the more they learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a token.  Then each player takes a card that has 25 words that are arranged in 3 columns labeled Beginner, Intermediate and Expert.  Each player takes turns reading a word for another player to spell. If the word is spelled correctly the player moves a space on the board.  The winner is the player who reaches the finish line first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
