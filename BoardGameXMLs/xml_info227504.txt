			<description>SHRINE: Completion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHRINE is a competitive abstract strategy game, where two players take turns placing stones on a beautiful board of tiled pentacles. The stones and the pentacles each come in three colors: crimson, cream, and cobalt. Stone placement follows this order, and players take turns placing the next color of stone on the board. There are only two rules to placement: no stone may be placed on a pentacle of its own color, and no two stones of the same color may be placed next to one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stones on pentacles sharing an interface are connected. Connected stones, enclosing at least one pentacle, are a loop. A loop that encloses at least one pentacle of each color is a shrine. The player to complete the first shrine wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrine is distinct from classic stone-placing games in that players become decoupled from colors. A winning structure will usually include stones laid by both players, but the winner is the one who places the final stone. This leads to an interesting dilemma: how much do I cooperate with my opponent to build this shrine?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
