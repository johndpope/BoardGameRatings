							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizards and Warzones: Trading Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The way the game works is each player has a deck of 40~60 cards, after shuffling you draw 6 cards from the deck, decide who goes first, etc. then each player starts with 30 Loyalty (its like your Life Points) and 10 resources (just as important as Loyalty). Each player will spend their resources to play creatures to attack their opponents with and defend their Base (their side of the field), and play powerful spells, weapons, and artifacts to power up their creatures! Be careful though, because you might trigger an opponents Event card! (It's like an instant or a trap card) and then you might get set back as a result! Plan carefully as you set up your Terrain cards (Their like lands and field cards) to bolster your creatures defenses (by giving them a safe place to hide) and be prepared when you play your Epics (similar to legendary artifacts) because though they may greatly aid your creatures, one slip up and it could be stolen from you, if that happens 3 times you lose the game! Oh and don't forget to pay attention to the placement of your creatures to (because it matters big time!) If your not careful you might leave your weakest creature on the Front Lines (where it can be attacked) when it should have stayed in your Base (where its more safe)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
