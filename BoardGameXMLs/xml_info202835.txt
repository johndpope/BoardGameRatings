			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;Aim of game: To get all the Indian Braves of your color in the tents.&lt;br/&gt;The number of Indian Braves used in a game depends on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a color and takes the pieces on that color. The first player spins the arrow. When the arrow stops he then takes as many tents as the number the arrow points and places each of the Indians under a tent. Each player proceeds in a like manner. Soon all tents will be occupied. At this point, they are all mixed.&lt;br/&gt;From now, each player spins the arrow and takes tents off Braves already covered to the amount as shown by the arrow. If the Brave under a tent belongs to another player, he replaces him with one of his own. If it is his own he leaves it there and it counts as part of his go.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have all his Indian Braves in tents is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
