							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Realm of the White Worm (HERO)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villages near the lonely mountain range are scared and need help. A dragon and its henchman have been terrorizing them for months. They take their children and demand food and supplies, something the villagers have little to spare with winter coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have turned to a mighty band of adventurers for help. They have little to pay other than their gratitude. Legends will be told of the adventurers if they can save the villages from the dragon and the dragon&amp;amp; hoard should be more than enough to make them rich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you powerful enough to save the villagers?  Are you ready to face certain death?  Are you ready to fight a dragon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realm Of The White Worm is an adventure for Fantasy Hero with multiple options. It will be up to the GM to decide which one to used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It works best with a party of 4-6 characters of 200 to 250Pts. GMs may need to adjust the adventure to suit other point level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
