			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free scenario by Peter Schweighofer introduces readers to all aspects of gaming in Pulp Egypt: Adventures Along the Nile, 1933-1939, from ancient tombs and superstitious workers to nefarious criminals intent on relieving the heroes of the treasures they recover. As members of an archaeological expedition, the characters explore a long-lost tomb belonging to a charioteer hero of the ancient Battle of Kadesh. After braving the mysteries and dangers within the tomb, they must safely transport artifacts from the excavation site at Sakkara to their warehouse in Cairo, evading greedy laborers, antiquities thieves, and smugglers all intent on stealing their discoveries. This 12-page adventure also includes maps, pre-generated characters, a player hand-out, and a copy of the Any-System Key for easy reference. Check out this free scenario to get a feel for the kinds of adventures you can play in the Pulp Egypt sourcebook available from Griffon Publishing Studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamers can easily adapt this Any-System Key adventure to their favorite roleplaying game rules. The Any-System Key describes character skills and task difficulties in terms that easily translate into nearly any game system. These terms do not link to any one game engine, but serve as general guidelines to give readers an overall sense how they fit within their own game&amp;rsquo;s stat and difficulty scale. To use this scenario you&amp;rsquo;ll need the copy of the Any-System Key included in this adventure and your favorite roleplaying game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
