			<description>In the game, a new craze had hit the town: fighting with model robots. The player would walk around the town as the main character, but would take control of the model robot during fights. There were six robot models available, each with different stats and special moves. The models are Max, Gong, Axe, Speed, Lon and Borot. Over time, the player could earn credits and buy parts to improve their model. In addition to the story mode, there was a simple versus mode that allowed the player to fight immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Power Quest (game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
