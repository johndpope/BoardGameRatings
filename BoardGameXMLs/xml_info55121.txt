			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Modern20 Supplement #1. This is a selection of rules and options that, if I were writing Modern20 today, would be in the core rules. In time, the material in this supplement might actually be folded into the core rules, suitable for any modern campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is why the optional Psionics and Ki skills from The Hunters and Martial Arts20 are included but not the feats that supported them. The skills provide relatively minor benefits and are thus suitable for the vast majority of modern campaigns. Once the feats (from their sources) are added to these skills, they get much more powerful and would be suitable for a smaller, more specialized selection of modern campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy this addendum to Modern20, hopefully it will liven up your campaigns as it did mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this supplement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 3 New Occupations&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 New Perk&lt;br/&gt;    * 2 New Skills&lt;br/&gt;    * Grappling and Hit Location&lt;br/&gt;    * Cover and Hit Location&lt;br/&gt;    * Armor and Hit Location&lt;br/&gt;    * Optional Rule: No Class Skills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
