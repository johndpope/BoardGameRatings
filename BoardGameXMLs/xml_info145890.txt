			<description>There are 52 cards with different letters on either side, 4 blank cards, and a tray with 5 bins for cards.  The cards are dealt evenly, players take turns placing letters in the trays until the last one is full -- making a valid word.  Then there are no turns: players just play one of their cards to the middle, replacing a letter with another letter to make another valid word.  When a player plays all his cards the round stops and he scores 1 point for each other card unplayed by the others.  The first to 25 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
