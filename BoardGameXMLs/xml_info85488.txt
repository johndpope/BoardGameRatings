							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Necromancer&#039;s Legacy: Bloodlines &amp; Paragons</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Compleat Librum ov Gar-Udok's Necromantic Artes is the necromantic masterpiece of M. Jason Parent, co-owner of E.N. Publishing. Originally released in PDF in February of 2002, this dark tome was nominated for the Best Rules Supplement ENnie and received honourable mention for another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the legacy of the dark necromancer has not truly been uncovered yet. Even now, the core material of the Necromancer's Legacy is being revised and updated to the current edition rules, and new secrets are being unearthed and added. Whispers of fell arcanists casting magics using the entrails of fallen foes now circulate around the campfires. Tales are told of giant forges brought back from the island nations and used to forge the very souls of enemies and innocents into horrific magical devices. And even now, the blood of the undead seems to flow within the veins of northlanders, with many exhibiting strange affinities and links to fell beasts such as ghouls and vampires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Necromancer's Legacy - Bloodlines &amp;amp; Paragons explores five of the classic undead introducing a paragon class for each as well as Minor, Intermediate and Major bloodlines for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The races covered in this product are: Ghosts, Ghouls, Liches, Mummies and Vampires. Each has a fully detailed paragon class and all three levels of bloodline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
