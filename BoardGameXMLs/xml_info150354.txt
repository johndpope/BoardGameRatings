			<description>From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Dhoesone, the northernmost realm of Anuire bordered by the wild Rjurik, savage goblins, raging giants and eerie elves. Torn between 3 competing faiths and fought over by conniving guilders the realm stands at a cross-road in more ways than one. Can prosperity be restored to the land? Or is the realm doomed to fall to infighting? &lt;br/&gt;Only the new regent can say&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt; The Player&amp;rsquo;s Secrets of Dhoesone is a sourcebook for use with the Birthright campaign setting for the Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game.
