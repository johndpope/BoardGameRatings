			<description>Wildwood is a card game in which two players, or two teams, compete to call Druids and build the most fitting Grove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round you draw three cards. From those cards, you decide which to use as a bid to call a Druid, which to place in your face-down back row for end-game scoring, and which to place in your face-up front row as a source of effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Druids you have successfully called add scoring bonuses, the ability to rearrange your cards and those of your opponents, and other special effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the sixth round, you score your back row. You count the face value of the cards you have placed within it, bonuses granted by the Druids you have called, and you also gain bonus points for suit or number matches you have created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team play adds chances to meaningfully cooperate with your teammates, and to read and respond to the other team's gameplay as it unfolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
