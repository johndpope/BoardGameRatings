			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on the role of a fallen lord on his journey back to become one of the mightiest in the realm. Make your banner strike fear into your opponents and challenge the multiplayer ladder in action packed skirmishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With innovative gameplay and dynamic environments, Pathos Interactive aims to refresh the real-time strategy genre. Bannermen will contain a singleplayer campaign and several multiplayer modes, where the main tasks consist of base building, resource management and battling enemy armies. The maps and missions vary in both length and shape and include features never before seen in RTS games. Players will be able to interact with the environment, creating interesting combats and greater strategic depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in a semi-fantasy medieval world that has been brutally damaged due to decades of war, starvation and natural disasters. The people are in desperate need of a powerful leader that can unite the kingdom. Many tribes claim their right, but there is only room for one banner in the kingdom capital. The goal of the game is to lead your bannermen to victory and defeat the evil, once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since Pathos Interactive announced the game, RTS enthusiasts all over the world have shown their interest. Many people crave for a new RTS with modern technology and innovative gameplay, yet one that delivers a nostalgic feel and alludes to the games that thrived during the great RTS period at the turn of the century. Bannermen is here to fill that void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is currently available in demo form from the game website. It is expected to be released in Q2 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
