			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swift Justice Among the Stars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sho-Gan (PL 12) is the most powerful of the Justiciars; an order charged to instantly convict, sentence, and execute offenders of Khor Law. Sho-Gan was raised with a strong sense of law and order. He also possessed an unwavering loyalty to the Khor Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, Sho-Gan found a rival in the Knightstar Wal-Las. After spending time on the distant world of Earth, Wal-Las returned to the Khor Empire with ideas of a less structured society; allowing more personal freedom in choice of life-pairings, education, and profession. These kinds of ideas were subversive to Khor ideology. Wal-Las&amp;rsquo; words of freedom started to gain momentum in the Khor Empire, as the captain was&lt;br/&gt;popular with the common people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To eliminate the threat, Sho-Gan sent the Knightstar to patrol the Khor borders near Freespace. The Justiciar then released Wal-Las&amp;rsquo; most notorious enemies from prison and told them where to find the Knightstar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
