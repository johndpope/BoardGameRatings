			<description>Leni and Frederick like walking over the brightly colored flower meadows in the summertime. There is a lot to discover there and they can admire the many different types of insects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of all, the two of them like the fat cuddly bumblebees. They are a little bit clumsy as they fly around and make a particularly loud buzzing sound, but they are just as busy as bees when it comes to collecting the delicious nectar from the many blossoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
