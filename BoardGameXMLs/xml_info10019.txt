			<description>The Race for Space is a serious look at the space technology race of the 50's and 60's.  There are three two-player scenarios, all of which are playable solitaire as well.  The game covers the period from 1955 to 1970 from the first attempts to orbit a satellite to the first manned landing on the moon.  Players develop hardware and systems through research, then conduct launches to test those systems.  Finally, they announce public launchings in an attempt to earn prestige points (victory is determined by prestige) and through prestige points to increase funding.  The game comes with 108 mounted but not die cut counters, 6 development displays, two launch displays, plus various charts, record sheets, and tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
