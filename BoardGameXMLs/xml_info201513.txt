			<description>This is a game about the life choices made during young adulthood. You&amp;rsquo;re all grown up and leaving home, but making good life choices can be harder than it seems! Your parents don&amp;rsquo;t think you can make it on your own but you&amp;rsquo;re going to prove them wrong. You have a job and an apartment, but you need furniture and your new friends love to party. You want to impress everyone but your parents are visiting for Christmas and you only have nine weeks to get ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is three days: Friday, Saturday and Sunday (the only days that matter!). Fridays are payday. You get paid, and life happens. Saturdays and Sundays are up to you. On each day you can: (a) Shop for furniture (b) Assemble furniture or (c) Throw a party&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a number of furniture stores (decks of cards) which you can choose to visit and browse but with limited stock it&amp;rsquo;s important to visit the right store to get the items you need. Remembering what you see in a given store is half the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most Life Points at the end of Christmas. You can score two types of life points: Parent Points and Party Points. Most Parent Points are scored at the end of the game when your parents visit. Your parents are impressed by matching furniture and grown up d&amp;eacute;cor. Party Points are scored throughout the game. You can choose to throw a party, but sometimes the fun happens when you least expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
