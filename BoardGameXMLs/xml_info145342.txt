							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hyen Keep</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyen: An imposing keep on Rethem's border with Kanday, Hyen is held by the Order of the Copper Hook, an Agrikan fighting order. Hyen and its surrounding manors are all that remain of the order's once-extensive lands in southern Rethem, the rest having been lost to them a generation ago during Ezar's War. The Copper Hook never recognized the treaty that ended that war and its members continue to raid across the border, dreaming of the day they can retake their lands from the hated followers of Larani in Kanday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
