							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Garden of Mad Alchemy</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh no! The peasants of the village have caught a most terrible plague and nearly everyone is suffering! The herbalists claim that they can concoct a cure but only if they can get ahold of several mage wort plants. It is rumored that this mystical plant grows only in the eerie, danger filled alchemist garden. This overgrown, maze like place is full of bizarre magic, terrible hazards, and creatures most foul! As one of the few still healthy, only you have the courage and strength to journey into this mysterious, labyrinth like place and recover the mage wort plants that the villagers so desperately need! Will you do it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Exiles of the Wicked Maze, this adventure features single player, solo play action that is driven by a symbol filled maze, simplified rules, and a random roll chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a complete game on its own. Your imagination is the only thing required other than access to a printer, a pencil, and some six sided dice. A perfect game for when you don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time, can&amp;rsquo;t get a full gaming group together, or have a power outage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
