							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Jena-Auerstaedt</name>
									
			<description>Campaign Jena-Auerstaedt, John Tiller's fifth title covering the Napoleonic Wars. Extensive research went into developing the background for this game. It features more than 35 maps covering Saxony and Prussia to include a map of the area where the armies fought in early October, 1806. Jena-Auerstaedt includes forty scenarios that cover the historical as well as alternate versions of the battles, and three campaigns including over 300 scenarios giving the players a wide variety of options as well as battlefields. Historical actions are included, such as Auerstaedt where Mar&amp;eacute;chal Davout covered himself in glory and, of course, the main action at Jena where Napoleon himself brought down the once mighty Prussian army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
