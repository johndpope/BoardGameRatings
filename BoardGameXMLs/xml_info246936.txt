							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly: LPR â€“ La Palette Rouge</name>
									
			<description>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rear of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Since its creation in 1992 LPR has become Europe's No. 2 pallet pooling operator exclusively dedicated to the fast-moving consumer goods sector, handling more than 40 million pallet movements a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With subsidiaries in 7 countries (France, Spain, Portugal, Benelux, United Kingdom, Germany and Italy), LPR offers an end-to-end delivery and collection service throughout Western Europe. It has a network of some eighty depots and collects pallets from 20,000 drop-off points across Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LPR offers a fully outsourced solution with high-quality pallets that are entirely compatible with automated production and picking systems. The LPR product range includes all types of pallet used by manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods and by major retailers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LPR has a team of experienced professionals, ready to provide tailor-made responses for individual customers, with solutions that are simple, innovative and flexible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPERTIES&lt;br/&gt;BROWN&lt;br/&gt;Flint / Barrow&lt;br/&gt;LIGHT BLUE&lt;br/&gt;LPR Benelux / LPR Germany / Lpr Italy&lt;br/&gt;PINK&lt;br/&gt;West Hallam / Temple Patrick / Avonmouth&lt;br/&gt;ORANGE&lt;br/&gt;Leeming Bar / Folkstone / Mossend&lt;br/&gt;RED&lt;br/&gt;LPR Portugal / LPR Spain / LPR France&lt;br/&gt;YELLOW&lt;br/&gt;Chorley / Wrexham / Kegworth&lt;br/&gt;GREEN&lt;br/&gt;Dublin / Clonmel / Longford&lt;br/&gt;DARK BLUE&lt;br/&gt;Redditch / Toulouse&lt;br/&gt;STATIONS&lt;br/&gt;Northfleet / Stretton / Trafford Park / Burton Latimer&lt;br/&gt;UTILITIES&lt;br/&gt;Timber / Nails&lt;br/&gt;TAXES&lt;br/&gt;One Way Trip Fee / ISPM 15 Charge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version is very special for two reasons:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. It is the first &amp;quot;square box&amp;quot; edition that has been created by anyone else apart from Hasbro. (The square box (called the &amp;quot;Number 9&amp;quot;) makes a much better version than the rectangle, for corporate gifts. It was always a no go but now companies can now have their own version of this &amp;ndash; thanks to LPR.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. LPR commissioned their own playing pieces; a lorry and a pallet! (This is the first time a company has done this in the UK.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
