			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bernard sisters were victims of a terrible natural disaster. They grew up learning first hand just how valuable family and community could be. As young adults, they worked hard to ensure anyone who needed aid could get it through charity, volunteering, and championing social change. When a deadly auto accident led to the discovery of their mutant powers, there was only one real option they would consider. As the heroes SILHOUETTE and OMBRE they could protect their community and help in ways they never could before. Sticking it to the bad guys is just icing on the cake!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
