			<description>It's a story, a game, and an adventure! Hank, Stella and Cody were camping one night in their grandfather's mysterious tent. When they woke up the next morning, they were in another part of the world! Can you solve the mystery of the Magic Tent and bring them home? Young adventurers climb into the full-size, indoor play tent and begin reading the story. The story contains hints to finding clues that parents have hidden around the house. The mystery and clues are provided in the Mystery Treasure Hunt, Vol. 1 Alaska, which is included with this set. After reading each hint, the kids climb out of the tent and race to find the hidden clue. When they have collected all the clues, they'll fit them together to reveal a secret message. It's an active and imaginative game for groups or individuals. The high-quality tent makes a colorful, sturdy play structure. It stands nearly 5 feet tall and 4 feet across, with stay-open tabs and mesh ventilation panels. Made from sturdy, flame-retardant, 70 denier nylon. Comes with 48&amp;quot; x 58&amp;quot; Nylon Tent, 15 Tent Poles, Mystery Treasure Hunt and Illustrated Instructions. For 1 or More Players, Ages 7 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
