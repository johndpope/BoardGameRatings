							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rally 6</name>
									
			<description>Rally 6 is more than just a car rally game but a spark to the imagination for all ages. The unique board design enables re-arrangement of the aerial view of the village of Whittlton to give six different layouts at varying levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;No mid-game boredom with Rally 6. Driving through the village involves thrills and hazards, natural features such as fords, level crossings and junctions in addition to those brought about by landing on the yellow cross-hatched Incident squares. The game is always close run and maintains the excitement right to the end.&lt;br/&gt;Choose and navigate your own route to pass through all ten checkpoints, encounter and overcome the hazards, re-adjust your route to deal with changing conditions and race home to win Rally 6. The thrills of Rally 6 are endless because no two games are ever the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
