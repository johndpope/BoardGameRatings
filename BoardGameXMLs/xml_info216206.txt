							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rock Paper Scissors Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>Loot Crate Exclusive. It's believed that this popular game originated over 2,000 years ago in China. Typically played with hand gestures, now Loot Crate brings you its very own version that combines the classic gameplay of chance with the random unpredictability of dice! Opponents each select a colored die and roll against each other. The dice sides are decorated with video game-inspired hand signs that represent &amp;quot;rock,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;paper,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;scissors.&amp;quot; Best out of three, OK?! Includes a velveteen dice bag so you won't lose them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
