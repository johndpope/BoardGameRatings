			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Starlink is a tactical real-time strategy game about interstellar conquest. Each map is procedurally generated and consists of many star systems linked via hyperspace routes. Each star produces ships for the faction that controls it. Some systems are under a special effect like increased ship production, faster ship send off, defensive bonus etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with one star and tries to take over as big an empire as possible in the time alloted for the match (or outright eliminate the competition). To help with that special abilities can be selected to aid one self or hinder the opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many examples of this genre the player does not have to select and send ships manually but instead simply specifies over which link the produced or arrived ships are to be sent off in each system. The supply lines created this way continue to reinforce the war zones until the orders are changed or the enemy manages to conquer a link in the chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played alone versus AI opponents, via network in competitive or cooperative modes and features a progression system where winning matches slowly expands your selection of active abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
