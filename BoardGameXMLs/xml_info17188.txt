			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Original Fortune Telling Board Game &amp;quot; by Jennifer Sands is the only board game of its kind that combines a fun and safe methodology based on modern fortune card readings and empowered by real mystical stones.  With a roll of the dice each player is whisked away on a journey to discover his or her special personalized fortune.  Collect, win, lose or buy LOVE, MONEY, PEOPLE and Question cards in this fun and exciting game where all players win a real personalized fortune card reading of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls the die, moves his or her pawn, and then does what the landed on square tells them to.  This is almost always either gaining or losing fortune telling cards (from four different decks - love, money, people, and questions) or empowering stones (which can be traded in for fortune telling cards).  The rules state that the &amp;quot;object is for each player to collect as many fortune telling cards as possible&amp;quot;; but they also state that the winner &amp;quot;is the player who draws the last card,&amp;quot; which ends the game and allows that player to discard up to three of their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real purpose is for each player to use the cards collected during the game to have their personal fortune told on the tarot-style card layout board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you believe in this stuff, you'll be happy to know that &amp;quot;all Jennifer Sands products are created with the assistance of professional psychics, fortune tellers and astrologers.  All Jennifer Sands products use safe fortune telling methodologies.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't believe in this stuff, you'll note &amp;quot;this product is for entertainment purposes only.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
