			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Stellar Sojourn character creation is involved.  First, a Species (Race) is selected (from about twenty options), and then a Homeworld is selected.  Next, Attributes are generated; Attributes include Strength, Quickness, Endurance, Intelligence, Will, Guile, Perception, Charisma, and Luck.  Attributes are modified and/or limited by Species but otherwise are randomly generated with 2D10.  Several Secondary Traits are then derived, including Body Combat Fighting Skill, Throwing Fighting Skill, Shooting Fighting Skill, Dodging Fighting Skill, and several others.  The character is then provided a rudimentary background by generating possible Life Events (some Life Events will cause character revision, usually minor).  Characters next generate Skills and Skill Levels, a numeric rating for each Skill running from 1-10.  There are ten groups of Skills, each with several individual Skills.  Finally, a series of random Details are either generated or derived to complete character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate major section of the rules details the Setting.  Extensive information is provided but mostly it is of a fairly generic/vanilla nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
