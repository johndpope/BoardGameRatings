			<description>Reclaim Oz is a nontraditional deck building strategy game that takes places in a Dystopian Oz overruled by Four Witches.Reclaim Oz is unlike other deckbuilding games because of the combination of PvP elements and a limitation to the size of each players deck. It is a unique tabletop experience that has the play differently than any other games in the same genre.&lt;br/&gt; If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know already, the game takes place in the Wonderful Land of Oz, but at a time when it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so wonderful. All the great Legends of Oz have disappeared, and four Witches from the Silver Islands. While L. Frank Baum may have written a much happier world, this is still the same place, with all the characters and places you know in love&amp;mdash;but in a time of great terror. The game consists of animals, beasts, and mythos&amp;mdash;it is your task to get the World back to the way it once was, with the characters you know and love. If you are able to compile the best deck filling each of the four categories (HEART, COURAGE, BRAIN, HOME), you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes it different?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Consisting of a 90 Card Deck&lt;br/&gt;    And a Completely New Card Playing Experience&lt;br/&gt;    Reclaim OZ with your cards in hand&lt;br/&gt;    Defend your Deck from the Evil Witches of OZ&lt;br/&gt;    Find a New Ruler to Lead Ozonians back to Prosperity&lt;br/&gt;    Rescue the Legends of Oz and take Back the Emerald City&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one thing that makes this card game different than a traditional deck building game is the lack of currency and ability to purchase cards. The cards are given to you each turn, Cards are marked with symbols letting you know how they are used in the game, the symbols include: Heart, Courage, Brain, Home, and Wicked. All of these cards are used in different ways. *All Card Designs Are Subject to Change&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;Each Player is dealt 5 Cards. During their turn they will play two cards; one card face down in their vault and place one card face up in their discard pile. Another option is to play an action card against another player in replace of playing a card in their vault--this will trigger a PvP event giving the attacked player the option to play a defense card in return. These cards become Trash and not played again. If you choose to Vault instead of Attack, please note the vault card is safe from play and will go towards your final deck at the end of the game. The only cards that can harm your Vaulted Cards are Witch Cards. Cards present statistics and points, Each card is given a value in the form of gold bricks called Road Points the higher rated the card the better it will serve you in the end game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Board includes places for the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOME: Cards that are played against or in defense&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRAIN: Ruler/Legend/Key Section (3 Cards per board)&lt;br/&gt;HEART: Foundation Section (3 Cards per board)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COURAGE: Ozonian Section (3 Cards per board)&lt;br/&gt;WICKED: Curse Section (1 Card per board)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the Game you must build your Deck via placing it on the Game Board, once an item is placed--it&amp;rsquo;s there until the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can have up to nine cards on their Board and one card can be given to them as a curse, making each deck build a total of ten cards. When a player is cursed the card is played face down on their Game Board the player does not know what curse is given to them until the final tally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witch/Curse Cards are used to play against other players in order to damage their vaults. Curse cards can be played toward another player by placing it on the Player you want to curse, each player can only be cursed once and it cannot be taken back or discarded. Witch cards are PvP actions that will cause a player to be affected. That player can use what is in his or her hand to replenish their board, in case of the attack ending the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any time the player must draw a card from the main deck, but the deck is empty, they shuffle their discard pile and use it as their personal deck. for the remainder of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all four witches have been played, Witches can not be discarded but played into their discard pile that will affect one or all players  in the game. To play a Witch Card place the character face up on the table and explain the action that must take place, some witches have you attack single players while others affect everyone in the game. The Witch Cards play a pivotal role in the gameplay and can only be diverted if a Defense Card in Hand is playable and not vaulted. All Witch Cards caused whichever players/cards affected to be Trashed and will no longer be used in gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the game ends and the cards on the Game Board are tallied, the winner has the most Road Points in their Vaulted Deck is the winner. In the result of a tie the player with the highest Road Point Legend is the Winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly all cards but Witches/Curses have double or triple uses, for Example Quox the Dragon can be used as an Attack card or as a Courage Board Card saved face down on your personal game board. Because of the value of that card, he can be used as a great boost on your Final Game Points&amp;hellip; However as an attack card he can significantly harmful to another player, giving you the advantage. The cards you choose to save on your Board impact your final score--it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to choose how to play your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Card has Road Points value that is tallied at the end of the game to determine the winner, but high Road Point Cards may not want to be vaulted due to their Additional Properties--such as saving you from Attack. Road points are the the key to a 'Victory'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curse cards, which are like the other cards, but have a negative Road Point value that counts against the player at the end of the game. It is uncertain which curse is given to a player until the end count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defense cards, though they may have a high Road Point Value and can double as Assist or Support in your Vault, will usually be kept in hand in order to be playable (though Trashed) in order to save other cards in your deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack cards generate effects during a player's turn, allowing that player to Attack another players hand or rarely their vault cards. Witches are considered Action Cards because they attack every player and usually the Vault (which in some cases will affect the game drastically). Defense and Action cards can be played each turn unless the player chooses to Vault a Card instead of using it as an action. Welcome to Oz...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
