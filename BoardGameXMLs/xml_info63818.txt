			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambush Valley takes Force on Force players to the deadly battlegrounds of the Vietnam conflict. From the flooded paddies to the jungle choked hills and death-haunted deltas, Ambush Valley provides players with all the theater specific rules they need to recreate engagements of the Vietnam era, including new campaign rules that allow you to follow the evolution of a platoon as it takes part in a multi-scenario campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designers of Ambush Valley have taken great pains to ensure that playing the VC is as challenging and fun as playing the Free World forces. VC players will truly feel as if they are lords of the jungle and masters of the night as they frustrate their heavily armed opponents with hit-and-run ambushes and booby traps!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example organizations and vehicle write-ups for:&lt;br/&gt;- US Army&lt;br/&gt;- USMC&lt;br/&gt;- ROK&lt;br/&gt;- ANZAC&lt;br/&gt;- CIDG&lt;br/&gt;- VC Local Force&lt;br/&gt;- VC Main Force&lt;br/&gt;- NVA Infantry&lt;br/&gt;- NVA Sappers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expansion rules for:&lt;br/&gt;- Campaign Rules&lt;br/&gt;- VC Tunnel Networks&lt;br/&gt;- Tunnel Rats&lt;br/&gt;- CS Gas&lt;br/&gt;- Night Fighting&lt;br/&gt;- Theater specific weapons - M79, M60, M14 Modified&lt;br/&gt;- Booby Traps&lt;br/&gt;- Riverine Operations&lt;br/&gt;- Point Men&lt;br/&gt;- Kit Carson Scouts&lt;br/&gt;- Spooky Gunships&lt;br/&gt;- Claymore Mines&lt;br/&gt;- Improvised Alarms&lt;br/&gt;- And much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambush Valley is a supplement for Force on Force. Force on Force is required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
