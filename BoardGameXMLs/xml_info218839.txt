			<description>Watch out! Townsville has been taken over by villains and only the Powerpuff Girls can help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative game where the players will work together to move the Powerpuff girls around the board to uncover villains to fight. Each Powerpuff Girl can fight alone (using the dice with erasable sides) or can work together to fight stronger villains. But after each turn, time will pass and the professor will move along the time track (leading to bedtime). Defeat 5 villains, including Mojo Jojo, before bedtime and you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
