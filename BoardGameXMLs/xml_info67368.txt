							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guards Tank: The Battle of Prochorovka, July 1943</name>
									
			<description>World at War magazine Issue 13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guards Tank: The Battle of Prochorovka, July 1943 (GT), designed by Joseph Miranda, is the first of our new East Front Battles Series. That series will present operational simulations of medium-to-large-sized battles fought during World War II on that front. There will be two players in each game, and solitaire play is easily doable.&lt;br/&gt;  There are two general types of units in the counter-mix: maneuver (non-artillery) and artillery. In addition, certain units are classed as &amp;ldquo;armored.&amp;rdquo; Individual units vary in organizational size from platoons to regiments.&lt;br/&gt;   The action in GT is focused on the Kursk offensive&amp;rsquo;s southern front, as the SS Panzer Corps breaks through the Soviet main line of resistance, held by elements of 6th Guards Army. The German spearheads are then met by a counterattack from 5th Guards Tank Army. What followed was one of the more controversial battles of World War II. There&amp;rsquo;s still historical debate about its significance. Some historians claim German tank losses here made it the turning point of the war in the east. Others say German losses were exaggerated; it was the Red Army that suffered massively, and the Germans actually called off the offensive for strategic reasons. Here is your chance to explore those interpretations.&lt;br/&gt;  Each hex in GT represents one kilometer (0.62 miles) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents a day. There&amp;rsquo;s a nine-turn short scenario and a 13-turn long scenario. The rules weigh in at a little under 14,000 words. Two experienced players can complete the short scenario in about four hours. Rules cover such items as: reinforcements, replacements, command-control, zones of control, adjacent and ranged combat, first and second wave combat, suppression, anti-tank fire, airpower, weather, fog of war, supply, untried units, and special tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
