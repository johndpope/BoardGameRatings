			<description>A simple word deduction game from the 1930s, produced as part of a series by Party Game Publishers (PGP) of Luton in Bedfordshire, England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games consist of 18 cards (games), each of which is printed with a black and white line drawing. Beneath the drawing is a cryptic clue to look for something in the drawing - for example, the drawing might be of two boxers fighting, and the cryptic clue might be, &amp;quot;spot the drink&amp;quot;. The answer is &amp;quot;punch&amp;quot;, which is something depicted in the drawing and which is also a drink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is for each player to see all 18 cards, and solve as many of the clues as they can within a set time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good production values - cards are heavy duty and well printed - but limited replay value, as once you have worked out the clues on each card there is no point in playing the game again as you know all of the answers. Simple pleasures for simple folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
