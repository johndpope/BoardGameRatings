							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Serpent Islands</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your party is among a group of adventurers who have been hired to serve as elite mercenaries in the dwarven wars against the servants of Kaishnalai, at an extravagant salary commensurate with your level of experience.  To reach the battle zone, a two week sea voyage is necessary.  After one week at sea, the ship is caught in a terrible storm which lasts three days.  Late one night, when the storm finally relents, the ship finds itself in unfamiliar waters with the rudder and mainmast destroyed.  After a few hours adrift, during which the crew tries various schemes to build a makeshift rudder and find out where you are, calm seas suddenly explode under the fury of a huge serpent; a toothed snake with six tentacles like those of a squid.  It attacks with complete surprise and totally destroys the ship before any effective defense can be given.  In the heat of the attack, the captain's voice is heard: &amp;quot;Abandon ship!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Every man for himself!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you face the horrors that thrive on the Serpent Islands?  Will destiny lead you to riches and a safe return or leave your bones silently smoldering beneath the mud?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your fate awaits you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
