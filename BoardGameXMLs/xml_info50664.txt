			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TERRORS FROM BEYOND is a collection of 1920's and 30's adventures for Call of Cthulhu, designed for play with pre-generated characters. The book provides fine opportunities for an impromptu game or tournament play and &amp;mdash; because the characters are intimately connected with the plot &amp;mdash; roleplaying challenges not normally available in most published material. An excellent adventure collection for new and veteran Call of Cthulhu players alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Light: The keepers of a remote Scottish lighthouse have vanished. What fate awaits those who come to investigate the disappearances?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grave Secrets: The people of Stafford, Rhode Island, live much the same as their colonial forbears, making only gradual concessions to the encroaching tread of progress. Now, a fate both formless and awful has befallen a family in town. One by one, the children succumb to a newly arrived, yet ancient, menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dig: Miskatonic University students on an excavation at nearby Dunlow Woods uncover ancient secrets, murder and horrors from the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Method To Madness: The investigators have been committed to a private asylum. Are they really insane? Is their impending cure now worse than their derangements?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death By Misadventure: Evidence suggests that Charles Stanhope was killed by the accidental discharge of a faulty shotgun at his home in the Lincolnshire Fens. The Coroner's verdict is death by misadventure - but is there a suggestion of something far more sinister?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Burning Stars: The investigators recover in a US Military hospital in Haiti suffering from on-going and prolonged blackouts. The last seven days of their lives have vanished from their minds &amp;mdash; is it amnesia, or a fear of remembering?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
