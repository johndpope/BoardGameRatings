			<description>Traffic is a game about traveling in Switzerland.  The board shows a route of 45 spaces. 8 of them are petrol stations, which can be extended to service stations. The background of the board shows a detailed road map of Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player travels across the route with a car, that can be chosen from 22 car cards. Some cars have cheaper upkeep costs than others, but they will reduce the income received when they land on the profitable bank spaces on the board.  But money can also be earned through petrol/service stations, obtained by correctly answering the question cards as well as by chance cards and the possession of special star chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These star chips are the main objective of the game, because the first player having 70000 francs in money plus 7 star chips, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traffic comes with some unusual components. First, there is a plastic bar with 23 holes. &lt;br/&gt;Rolling a glass marble in that bar replaces the roll of a die. Second, a 1.5 x 3 inch model car serves as challenge trophy. The winner gets this car until a next game is played. And third, 2x36 (traffic) question cards for children and adults are somewhat like a game in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
