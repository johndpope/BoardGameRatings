							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PT 109</name>
									
			<description>PT 109 is a solitaire game depicting John F. Kennedy's exploits in the South Pacific during WWII as the skipper of a PT Boat.  This game is part of a three Game series (Profile in Courage) which will cover various episodes or crises in the life of John F. Kennedy.  The other two games in the series are Election 1960 and DEFCON 1: The Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game is played over a period of 4 Rounds, with 10 turns per Round.  The solitaire player, takes the part of Kennedy as he tries to successfully complete missions against the Japanese in the Solomon Islands in 1943.  Each Round has several phases, which include drawing cards which represent Random Events, Missions, and possible contact with Japanese military units, such as Barges, Destroyers, Aircraft attacks, etc.  If Contact is made it leads to a Combat phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the player knows what his orders are (his Mission he must complete), he must prepare his PT boat for the mission.  This includes a series of decisions as to the amount of fuel, ammunition, medical supplies, etc. that he will need to increase his chance of success.  Victory Points are accumulated over the four rounds to determine if the player has scored enough points to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
