			<description>&amp;quot;The velocity of the ball, the awful physics of the track ... and in the middle of it all, men.  Playing by an odd set of rules. It's not a game man was supposed to grow strong in...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those of you who enjoyed the 1975 movie &amp;quot;Rollerball&amp;quot; will want to take a look at this re-creation of the violent future sport ... as a board game. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to use all the speed of the track to overcome your opponents and force your way through to the goal with that heartless steel ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player manages his team of skaters, catchers and bikers in an effort to score goals with the ball. Each member of the team is represented by a counter (or figure), with vital information recorded on a separate card. The speed of movement is recorded with a sliding clip on the side of the card, and adjusted turn by turn as the figures race around the track. The player must pull order out of chaos as his team struggles with opponents to control the ball and score goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement of figures is affected by the speed and agility of the figure. Complex manuevers, interactions with opposing figures (such as striking and checking) and handling the ball are resolved with dice rolls. As the game progresses, injuries and fatigue will reduce the effectiveness of the team, and play strategy includes decisions about protecting key figures and targeting particular opponents in this full contact sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing time is extremely long. This is a simulation game requiring book-keeping and attention to detail. Not for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game variants allow modified game constraints such as &amp;quot;no penalties&amp;quot; or changes to the time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free to download from the files section below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is fan work. Title, words and images from the film are used without permission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
