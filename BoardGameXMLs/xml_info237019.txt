			<description>A One-Round Adventure for Red Steel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been in this stinking jail for almost an hour. Most of the guards have finally left, leaving only two of them to watch over you. Unfortunately, they seem very alert. It has been extremely quiet, since the guards hardly talk at all. Because they listen to every word you say, most of you have been relatively silent as well. The weather is hot, but through the small window in the north wall you can see that the sun is going down. Shadows stretch across the jail, and you can hear a cricket chirping from nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
