			<description>{from the back of the box}&lt;br/&gt;The Battle for the Bridge&lt;br/&gt;In a medieval city, two opposing sides of the town, each composed of six teams, fight on the Center Bridge to force the enemy back across and into its encampment.&lt;br/&gt;Astuteness, strategy and a little bit of luck are used by the Generals and their Captains to win the final victory.&lt;br/&gt;The game has two phases. First there is a fast parade around the city walls when each team's force is secretely determined by the cards. Second, the actual battle for the possession of the Center Bridge where the expert usage of Strategy Cards by the Generals and their Captains can increase the strength of a team.&lt;br/&gt;The game is rapid, exciting and never repeticious. No two games are ever the same cause the Strategy cards (Warriors, Flags and Pageant Figures etc.) can continually reverse the momentum of the Battle.&lt;br/&gt;All Players are involved from the beginning to the last second of the game.&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played by 2 players, by an entire family (4-6 players) or by a group of friends (8-14 players). The more expert players will enjoy studying the battle statistics and organizing tournaments.&lt;br/&gt;The duration of this game is about 45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This box contains:&lt;br/&gt; - 1 large Playing Board representing a na&amp;iuml;f plan of a Medieval City of Pisa, subdivided into two opposing sides along the Arno River: Tramontana (north) and Mezzogiorno (south).&lt;br/&gt; - 200 illustrated Strategy Cards: Warriors, Flags, Pangeant Figures, Captains, etc.&lt;br/&gt; - 2 Dice.&lt;br/&gt; - 2 Parade Tokens.&lt;br/&gt; - 12 &amp;quot;Chariots&amp;quot;, one for each team to be used for the Bridge combat.&lt;br/&gt; - Stickers with the emblems of the 12 teams.&lt;br/&gt; - 4 Large Card Holders.&lt;br/&gt; - Game Booklet with explanation of the rules and examples of strategic moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
