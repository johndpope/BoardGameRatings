			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These four adventures are the second act of a steam &amp;amp; spell campaign for the Pathfinder RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conspiracy has been unmasked, and though their plans were disrupted, the fallout has gripped the attention of the world. After decapitating a cell of conspirators in their home city of Flint, royal constables of the nation Risur managed to drive away the 300-ft. tall metal titan that the villains had crafted in the shadows. Now it tromps its way across the borders of great nations, unstoppable, out of control, but such a tempting prize for whosoever can seize its reins. &lt;br/&gt; Spymasters and their agents set to work to take advantage of this pivotal opportunity, zealots expose shameful secrets, and would-be tyrants take their shot to overturn the old order. But the conspiracy, though stymied, is not defeated, and if they complete their masterstroke, it will be they who choose the face of this new era, the spirit of the age. The zeitgeist.&lt;br/&gt; This tome contains Act Two of ZEITGEIST: The Gears of Revolution, a cinematic adventure path designed for experienced Game Masters. These four adventures witness your party - members of the Royal Homeland Constabulary - rise from 9th to 15th level as they thwart the worldwide machinations of a conspiracy known as the Obscurati. Take a step away from traditional fantasy, and play a part in shaping the coming age!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
