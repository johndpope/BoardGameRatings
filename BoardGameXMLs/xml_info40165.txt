							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All About St. Paul</name>
									
			<description>All About St. Paul is a Monopoly-esque game that was sponsored by the St. Paul Chamber of Commerce, apparently to promote businesses in the city and to acquaint players with how to get around St. Paul and where to find things, c. 1982.  The board is a fairly accurate street map of the city, with various landmarks and businesses depicted on it.  As a bonus to purchasers of the game, a coupon book was also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
