							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Politicians Game</name>
									
			<description>Politics may be a dirty game, but just like a pig in a poke, it's a heck of a lot of fun when you're the one wiggling and jumping in that expensive and exclusive mud! Rub shoulders with the rich, famous and powerful people who shape the future of countries; you also get to take part in the great Political Debate. Dirty work, but somebody's got to do it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Politicians Game attempts to faithfully recreate the arena of politics, so your &amp;quot;political potential&amp;quot; can be put to the poll. Of course no experience in necessary, nor any knowledge of the topics you will be required to  cover in this hilarious game of &amp;quot;sound bite cynicism&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
