			<description>Seven-Handed Poker is a clever little way to play poker!  This game requires a single deck of playing cards and seven poker chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Seven-Handed Poker, players play any amount of cards from their hands.  The player with the better poker hand wins the round. After each round, players always draw three cards regardless of how many cards they just played.  Hand sizes will grow and shrink depending on how many cards a player plays each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
