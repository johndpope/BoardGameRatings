			<description>Merrills-meets-memory game where players try to eliminate stones of the opponent by getting three of their own pieces in a row. All pieces, though, are hidden, and all of them have the same figure on their backs: initially the orientation shows which figure is which but after a couple of turns players will have moved, swapped and twisted the pieces often enough to confuse anyone without a very reliable memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add insult to injury, some special pieces (Horus falcons) can be uncovered, with fatal consequences for either player (depending on the situation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
