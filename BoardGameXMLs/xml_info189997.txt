							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scenario Upgrade Pack: In the Shadows</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Shadows (CHA2357) is a Call of Cthulhu scenario collection published by Chaosium (in print and PDF), released in 1995. This pack, created as an independent add-on by Cthulhu Reborn, upgrades the three scenarios from the Chaosium book by providing them with fresh renditions of their numerous player handouts (some of which are hard to read in the original publication due to printing errors).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Handouts in this collection are presented in high-quality form in full colour (for use as deluxe player props), and also provided as text-only handouts (for speedy access to clues). The upgrade pack also contains notes to make it easier to run these scenarios with the latest (7th) edition of Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three classic scenarios documented in these dire artefacts of doom are: Devil's Hole, In The Shadows of Death, and Song of the Spheres. They were all written by Gary Sumpter, who has also approved these new enhancements to his original creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: This PDF is not a stand-alone product, but relies on having access to the Chaosium publication In The Shadows (CHA2357).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
