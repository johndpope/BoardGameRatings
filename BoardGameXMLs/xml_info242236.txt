			<description>Baby is cooperative deduction micro game for two to three players in which one player facilitates the recurring and semi-random needs of the infant whilst the other one (or two) player(s) take on the role of the parents, attempting to decipher and resolve the cause of their child's cries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of three micro decks of five cards each. One deck represents a happy baby, another a sad baby, and the middle a neutral baby. A baby status token moves between the decks, indicating the current climate of the infant and also defining from which deck the next card should be drawn. Cards are only seen by the player playing the role of the child, and upon them are depicted up to two different needs of the five in the game: hungry, poopie, sleepy, restless and crying wolf (ie. nothing's really wrong). Depending on the card the player will then place face-down tokens showing the baby is upset but not visibly indicating what the cause is. These needs can be resolved with different parent tokens, such as feeding, diapers, carrying, music and playing. While the need tokens don't come in multiples and therefore can't &amp;quot;double up&amp;quot; on the same time the parents only have a limited number of each of their tokens so they must use them wisely. After each step of the game (child expressing and then parents attempting to solve it) the baby status is always move to indicate the new state of the child. If a card should be drawn from an empty deck, the game has ended and the players all win if the status of the baby is happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
