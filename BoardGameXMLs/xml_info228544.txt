							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunting Lodge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the woods you come upon an impressive structure. Seems someone was here, but not at the moment. Looks like a hunting lodge. Large windows let the morning light into the lounge area. Out back is stables for the horses. A campfire and seating is also included just outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map pack includes 4 versions of the map. One is fully populated and furnished with assets. The other is empty to decorate anyway you like and with and without gridlines. Two size version are included with each style map. 50x50 pixel per grid for easy import into Fantasy Grounds (labeled FG2). And a 100x100 pixel per grid for higher detail. (labeled 30x30grid) Map edges align with the grid for easy import into all Virtual Table Top programs and apps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
