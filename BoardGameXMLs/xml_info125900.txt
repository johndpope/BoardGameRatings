			<description>Blood Upon The Risers: D-Day is a scenario book for NUTS! 2nd Edition. It takes place on June 6, 1944 and covers the actions of small bands of American paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division during the early parts of Operation Neptune, a portion of the Overlord invasion plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside Blood Upon The Risers: D-Day you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Special Airborne rules that will make your paratroopers different than normal soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; New rules for the different types of terrain you will fight in.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Tabletop artillery rules.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; New weapon and vehicle stats.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Ten linked scenarios covering the actions on the 6th of June.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenarios provided in the book are fictional, though based on actual events, and are intended to be played solo (or cooperative) from the American side. The scenarios can easily be modified to be played head-to-head with another player taking on the forces allocated to the German side. The scenarios are also designed to be played in sequence, with the result of the previous mission affecting the next. However, they may also be played as standalone scenarios with little-to-no changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
