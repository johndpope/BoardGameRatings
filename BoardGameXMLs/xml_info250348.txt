			<description>In Stock hold'em (ストックホールデム), players are investors who want to use information to manipulate stock prices, buy and sell shares, and earn lots of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players place information cards with sources (i.e., suits) and numbers on each company, and all employees manipulate stock prices by making poker hands for each company. Since some information about these cards &amp;mdash; either the suit or the number &amp;mdash; can be viewed from the backside of the card, players can speculate about how a company might be valued by guessing the hands of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
