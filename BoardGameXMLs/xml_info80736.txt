							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mouse About</name>
									
			<description>The aim of Mouse About is to solve all the food puzzles by guiding Marv the hungry mouse around the screen from one piece of food to another, he will then scoff the food down and wait impatiently for you to guide him to the next tasty morsel. Marv has to eat all the food onscreen to successfully progress to the next puzzle. Each puzzle is played against the clock so you have to hurry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No two games are ever the same as the puzzles dynamically respond to the players skill level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Any Touch game mechanic lets you play by touching anywhere on the screen, making for some great interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
