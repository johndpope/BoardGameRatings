			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been down on your luck recently and money is beginning to run short for some of you. You were in your usual haunt, the White Griffin Tavern in Mulhessen, when you received a message from Victorio del Sym, who you&amp;rsquo;ve worked for a number of times in the past. His jobs have always been extremely dangerous but also quite lucrative. He asked you to meet him in Boerden, a small town midway between Mulhessen and Saerb. Jack complained of having to spend even a night in such a rube town, but the rest of you agreed that the money was worth the trip. Jack conceded the point when Camille gently reminded him of his increasing debts. You have been on the road for two days and night is falling as you see the outskirts of Boerden ahead. You&amp;rsquo;d guess from what you can see that it can&amp;rsquo;t have more than 500 residents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
