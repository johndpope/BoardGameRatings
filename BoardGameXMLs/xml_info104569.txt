			<description>A Forbidden Island themed Express game in the vein of Infection Express, Taboo Atoll Express places the player into the role of the intrepid treasure hunter, on an island that is determined to keep its secrets, and is willing to sink itself in order to protect them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player roams around the island, looking for clues as to where the treasure is located, all the while the island is aware and slowly sinking itself to prevent the player from succeeding.  Should you spend too much time on the island, you'll sink with it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taboo Atoll Express should take around 10-20 minutes to play, has easy setup, and can be played with a handful of colored cubes or markers, and a few custom dice.  The game is available for free in print-n-play format from the paperparachute games site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
