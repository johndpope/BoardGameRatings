			<description>A Decktet memory game for two children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Decktet wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, declare &amp;quot;I am searching for ...&amp;quot; and name the suit from one of the unclaimed aces. Then move your token one card clockwise and turn over the card your token lands on, revealing it for everyone to see. If that card has the suit you were searching for, claim the ace of that suit - unless it was a Crown, which causes you to put back in the middle of the table the claimed ace of the Crown's suit if you have currently claimed it. The excuse does nothing when one of the face-down cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The younger player goes first, unless the game was just played and someone one, in which case the previous game's loser goes first. Players take turns until all six aces are claimed. The player who claims the most aces wins. If both players claim three aces the game is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
