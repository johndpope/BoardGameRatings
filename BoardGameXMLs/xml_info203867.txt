							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slimmer Man: The Getaway</name>
									
			<description>Run thru the forest and survive all you can cause Slimmer Man is behind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the six archetypes, you alone (or with a friend) have to walk your way out from the forest. Survive till you getaway or walk into Slimmer man's arms and yeah that's not a choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is composed of 9 Forest Cards. One of the cards (the start card) is dealt face up and the others? Shuffle them and then place them in a 3x3 formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you one step on the Forest cards. Each time you step on a new Forest card you turn it upright to see what you have to do while you are there. Some cards tell you to shuffle specific board cards, one lets you take a Light token and there is one you never want to find; Slimmer Man&amp;rsquo;s Card that makes you get a Fear token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to win? Walk around the board 10 times without finding Slimmer Man, but if he gets you, you receive a Fear token and you and your partner steps by the Forest are back to zero, but if you have Light token and Slimmer Man appear light him instead of receiving a Fear token. With 4 times that you give Light Slimmer Man or 10 steps through the Forest are enough to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
