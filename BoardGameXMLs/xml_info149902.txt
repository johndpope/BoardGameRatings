							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mango Republic</name>
									
			<description>Mango Republic is a tabletop game for two to four aspiring dictators. Players use their cards to expand their power and attempt to take complete control of the government of a nascent democracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a board to keep track of the activists, parliamentarians and generals in Mango Republic. Tokens placed by the player on the districts count as activists, tokens on parliament count as members of parliament, and tokens on Fort Peace count as generals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more activists in a district the player has, the more parliamentarians he gets. The more parliamentarians he has, the more cards he can hold. Cards give you options to gain activists, generals and hurt your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever establishes complete control over the government, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
