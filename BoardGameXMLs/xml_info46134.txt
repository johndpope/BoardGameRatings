			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wine country of Thentis produces some of the greatest wines in all of Althios. However, the small town may hold an even greater treasure. The adventurers are hired to locate a previously unknown cure for lycanthropy rumored to exist in the surrounding mountains. A simple cure to this scourge is a prize scholars will pay handsomely for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thentis is a quiet little town that holds more than its share of secrets. Nestled high in the mountains of what was once the legendary kingdom of Yendis, the small town grows wealthy with the prosperous wine industry. However, the trade routes are perpetuallly threatened by the dangers of the surrounding mountains, and new trouble is on the horizon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The army of General Targati is on the march and has annexed the city of Thentis. The general looks for the profits of the winery to feed his war chests as he attempts to reforge the empire. Between the general's ambition and the curse of lycanthropy can the adventurers emerge triumphant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red or White, an adventure for the d20 System, invites characters to discover the glory of wine and pursue the mysteries within the quaint little town of Thentis. Recommended for characters level 5-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
