			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our World, 1633 A.D.: The apex of the biggest religious war of all time. Europe is devastated by two vast clashing armies: Sweden and France on the Protestant side, the Holy Roman Empire and Spain on the Catholic one. The most powerful man on the Continent is also the evilest &amp;mdash; Cardinal Richelieu, an ecclesiast by rank, but de facto warlord. It is the Thirty Years&amp;rsquo; War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But someone is watching. Monad, a mysterious, disembodied entity cries in anguish at every combat, at every slaughter, at every witch hunt. The publication of Les Grandes Mis&amp;egrave;res de la Guerre (The Great Miseries of War), a series of 18 ghastly etchings depicting the horrors of war, destroys the last sparks of hope residing in Monad&amp;rsquo;s soul: the being decides to build a private World in which the original tenets described in the first book of the Bible, The Genesis, would be strictly, directly applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Monad it is not so mighty. For reaching that ambitious goal, it needs more raw power. And it is ready to make a terrible pact to gain it: Monad travels throughout space and time, and in the hollow and cold Void that lingers at the end of the Universe, it meets the horrible Outer Gods. No one knows what happens there; but the fruit of this mad copulation is Domhan, the little, artificial world that Monad desires so intensely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Genesis is a brief campaign of adventures for the Fifth Edition Fantasy of the &amp;ldquo;World&amp;rsquo;s Most Popular Fantasy Roleplaying Game.&amp;rdquo; Starting with 1st level characters, you will be able to reach the fourth level in the process of completing the five scenarios in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
