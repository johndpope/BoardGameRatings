			<description>Crazy Climber 2000 is an updated version of the 1980 arcade game Crazy Climber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In both games the player assumes the role of a daredevil who is attempting to climb to the top of a series of skyscrapers. There are a number of obstacles and dangers to avoid. These include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Windows that open and close (the most common danger).&lt;br/&gt;     Building occupants who throw objects such as flower pots, buckets of water and fruit in an effort to knock the climber off the building.&lt;br/&gt;     A giant condor, who drops eggs and excrement aimed at the climber.&lt;br/&gt;     A giant ape (in the style of King Kong), whose punch can prove deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the climber is able to ascend to the top of a skyscraper and grabs the runner of a waiting helicopter, he earns a bonus and is transported to another skyscraper, which presents more dangers than the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crazy Climber 2000 was released for the PlayStation in the year 2000. It is a 3D graphics update of the original arcade game. A notable feature is the ability to turn corners and access different sides of the buildings, which now have a variety of designs (including one with a cylindrical, tower-like shape).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crazy Climber 2000 disc includes a port of the original arcade version of Crazy Climber and a scan of the instruction panel.
