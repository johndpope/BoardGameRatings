							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One Night Werewolf: Monster</name>
									
			<description>One Night Werewolf: Monster uses the same mechanics as One Night Werewolf but has unique roles including a Hunter, Witch, Vampire, Zombie, Hanged Man, and Wolf King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is identical to Werewolf.  Each player is given an identity card, with the two remaining identity cards placed in the middle of the table. Each player looks at their role card and then closes their eyes to represent falling asleep at night.  The Moderator calls out the roles in a specific order for them to take their nighttime actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roles:&lt;br/&gt;GJ Hunter - may hunt in the graveyard cards during the night phase.  Even if the Villager team loses, it can still win if the GJ Hunter manages to hunt a werewolf card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie - During the night phase may take a card from the graveyard to use as its new body to participate in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hanged Man - Simply wishes to be hanged and doesn't belong to either the Villager or Werewolf team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magical Girl - May use magical skills to view other cards (Similar to Sorcerer mechanics)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampire - May exchange his card for another card (Similar to Phantom Thief mechanics)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Werewolf - With more power can remember the cards in the graveyard that it raided last night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all roles have had their action, players open their eyes representing waking up for the daytime phase. Players now discuss who they believe are the werewolves(or if there are any in play) and vote for a player.  Player with the most votes is killed; killing a werewolf causes humans to win, killing a human causes werewolves to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
