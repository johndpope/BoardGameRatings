			<description>To boldly roll where no dice has rolled before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Trek: A Space Battle in a Tin is light and fast 2 player duel, in which you will be trying to be 'last ship floating'. You will collect power and damage opponent's mother ship by pushing and pulling two custom dice on a five card space battlefield, by deploying cards with units of various strength and influencing both dice simultaneously most of the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2016 Mint Tin Design Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Overall Design - 8th&lt;br/&gt;Most Innovative Mechanic - 9th&lt;br/&gt;Best Theme - 8th&lt;br/&gt;Best Artwork &amp;amp; Graphic Design - 3rd&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guest Judge: Caroline Berg - Top 3 Picks&lt;br/&gt;2nd pick&lt;br/&gt;  &amp;quot;Dice Trek: A Space Battle in a Tin, while I'm not a person for two-player games, I couldn't resist the theme. The game is more than just Star Trek: The Dice Game - it mixes in many Sci-Fi tropes, creating a feeling of nostalgic Sci-Fi action. The rulebook is well done, covering all the information the players need, and the graphic design is top notch.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
