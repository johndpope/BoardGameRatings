			<description>GAME SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Towers&amp;amp;Bridges is a board game for two players. It combines traditional elements of chess &amp;mdash;such as a squared board&amp;mdash; with original pieces and movements. The game symbolizes a battle between two feudal lords: the White Lord and the Black Lord. Each one leads an army composed by attack towers and portable bridges.&lt;br/&gt;The principal aim of attack towers is to capture enemy castles. But these are surrounded by deep moats. Portable bridges are used to cover those moats. In this way, towers can cross moats; and thus, they can take castles&amp;hellip; but only if the tower is as high as the castle. Most attack towers are initially smaller than most castles. However, they can get bigger by capturing an enemy tower. When this happens, the stages of the defeated tower are added to the winning one. So, winning attack towers become higher and higher. In the end, they may even match the highest castle: that is, the enemy lord&amp;rsquo;s one.&lt;br/&gt;During the combat, both contenders may be helped by mercenaries and flying creatures. But these are jailed in strong citadels, so first of all, attack towers must free them. Once they have been liberated, mercenaries can blow enemy bridges up; and winged creatures can transport their lord by air, crossing even moats not covered by bridges.&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose in the game is to trap the opponent&amp;rsquo;s feudal lord, who takes shelter in the highest castle. The player who gets this objective wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTES:&lt;br/&gt;-This information was submitted by the publisher.&lt;br/&gt;-The game has been published in English and Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;-The game has been published as a book.
