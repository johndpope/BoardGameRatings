			<description>A compendium of four family games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Primus Ludus. The aim of the game is to get one pawn of each colour (red, blue, yellow) to the center of the board. All players can move all pawns. The choice of pawn and direction is limited by two coloured dice. After rolling them, you have to move a pawn of one's colour along a line of the other's colour.&lt;br/&gt;    Sekundus Ludus. You roll dice to move along a path. Depending on the field you reach, you either gain or lose sticks. If you reach the finish with insufficient sticks, you have to do another round.&lt;br/&gt;    Tertius Ludus. An easy roll-and-move game, in which you have to get around the board with 3 of your 4 pawns. Similar to Pachisi, you may return other pawns to the start, too. The mechanic that makes the game special is the unlimited number of rolls you can make each turn. If you choose to roll another die, you can add the new score to your movement rate, but if you have bad luck, you lose everything and can't move this turn.&lt;br/&gt;     Quartus Ludus. A card game based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanic. A joker beats rock, paper, and scissors. Every time you lose to another card, your pawn is advanced. The one who reaches the end fist, loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
