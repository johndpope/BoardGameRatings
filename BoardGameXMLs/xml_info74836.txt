							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return to Ditch Day</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel to the original TADS example game, Return to Ditch Day stars you off in the tropics.  Having been a Caltech graduate for a decade, you now work for a tech company trying to sell its product.  Unfortunately, it isn't working, so you spend the first part of the game fixing it.  It is here you meet a representative of a rival company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later on, you are assigned to recruit an engineering student from Caltech.  It just so happens you arrive on Ditch Day, and the rival company's recruiter is there as well.  It then becomes a race to solve the engineering student's stack before the competition can do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
