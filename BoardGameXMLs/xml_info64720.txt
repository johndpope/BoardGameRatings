			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crusader Journal&lt;br/&gt;When Caesar stood upon the banks of the Rubicon looking south to Rome he hesitated.  Before him stood the vast, complex mechanism of the past, glowing with a host of intricately woven stratagems. With him, he had but one legion, weary from 8 years of brutal war with the Gauls. But when called to surrender himself to the Senate and certain exile he did not hesitate. He called his legionaries to cross into Italy, to cross the Rubicon.
