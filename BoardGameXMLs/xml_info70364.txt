							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spellcraft &amp; Swordplay Revised Edition</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A NEW CLASS OF OLD SCHOOL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hordes of slavering orcs close in.  You're tired, battered and bruised, but far from beaten.  You grip your heavy sword tightly, and blink at the sweat in your eyes.  You're all that stands between the goodly folk of the village and a curtain of eternal night...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between these covers lies everything you need to begin grand adventures of dark and gritty fantasy, high, epic fantasy, or even fairy tale fantasy.  All you need is some imagination and a few friends, and you're off!  Inspired by the very earliest days of the hobby, Spellcraft &amp;amp; Swordplay uses a rules-lite system that allows play in a style that is fast, loose, and cinematic.  Explore ancient ruins, rescue captive princesses, slay dragons, and build your own legacy of adventure and excitement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
