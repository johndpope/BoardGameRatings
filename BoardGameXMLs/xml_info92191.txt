			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Issue #3 of HARPer&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar. For this issue, I had originally planned to present a few articles of an Irregular nature, and actually make the issue available ahead of the normal schedule, making it an Irregular issue as well. However, one of my articles actually answered some issues we had for another HARP product that had been put on hold until we could rethink the concepts behind it. Thus, that article was pulled. I also pulled two other articles as well as I was not entirely happy with how they turned out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the articles still remains, Irregular Stats. In it, I take a look at an alternative method of handling stats, and stat acquisition. This article also introduces the idea of stat potentials. However, unlike Rolemaster, these potentials are based upon race, as you will see in the article.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the rest of the issue, you will just have to make do with the normal ramblings of my dark and twisted mind. I hope that you enjoy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
