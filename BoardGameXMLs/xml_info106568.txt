			<description>A monopoly-like game where players roll-and-move around the board divided into countries instead of streets. Unlike Monopoly, players don't buy these countries but invest in them, consequently multiple players can own shares in the same country and all of them need to be paid off by a player landing on that country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games uses the Internet for its game mechanics: event cards (&amp;quot;News Flash&amp;quot;) and conference cards that let players vote on a usually environmental issue and pay money to the majority voters are not drawn from a deck but are instead displayed on the website &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.globalthegame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.globalthegame.com&lt;/a&gt; where occasionally new cards will find their way into the game (an iPhone App is also available). The winner is the first player to own $1.000.000 in investment certificates or alternatively the last remaining player because there is no debt in Global The Game, anyone unable to pay is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
