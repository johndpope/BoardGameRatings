							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost (1994)</name>
									
			<description>Outpost is a video game developed and published by Sierra On-Line. In general terms the game is a science-fiction version of SimCity, taking place on a distant planet. The game was noteworthy for having a hard science fiction approach, with one of the main designers being a former NASA scientist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A massive asteroid named Vulcan's Hammer is detected to be on a collision course with Earth, and all attempts to divert it from this path have failed. The last attempt, firing a large nuclear warhead at the asteroid, actually ended up splitting it not into five chunks as humanity hoped, but rather two asteroids. Now, instead of destroying the earth, it will simply wipe out nearly all life on Earth's surface. Extinction is not an option, and so a mission is organized to create a colony on a world elsewhere in the galaxy as the last hope for mankind's survival. The player is in charge of that mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Outpost (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
