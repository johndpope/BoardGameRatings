			<description>PRIME TIME: The Ratings Game is a card game for 1-4 Players that puts you in charge of a major television network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In PRIME TIME: The Ratings Game you are the head of a television network. It is up to you to create shows that will attract the highest ratings and beat out your rivals. At the start of the game your schedule is a blank slate. You will have to program shows for Monday to Friday night. You do this by programming (playing) cards onto the table. These cards represent the shows, actors, commercial breaks and more. At the end of the game, whoever has the highest rated shows on each night will &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; that night. Each night is worth points. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast the actors, come up with special twists and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to program some commercials to pay for it all. What shows you create and when you program them are all up to you. Will you fight for the coveted Thursday night-time slot with a prestigious big budget show or try to tie up Monday and Tuesday nights with cheap programming? It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to take your network to the top of the charts and be the leader of Prime Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
