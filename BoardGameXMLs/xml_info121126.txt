							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3D Pixel Racing</name>
									
			<description>The gameplay in 3D Pixel Racer is similar to other basic driving games. Players choose a driver, car and gameplay mode, and compete in a series of events in that mode to unlock new cars, tracks, and drivers. Every track in the game has several checkpoints at witch player's total race times are logged, so players can replay tracks to replay tracks to get the best time. The game controls on the Wii are nearly the same as those in Mario Kart Wii; the Wii Remote is held in the sideways position and used to simulate a steering wheel. The iOS version of the game uses the iPhone's built in accelerometer as a steering wheel, and two buttons on the touch-screen to control the cars' gas and brake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;3D Pixel Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
