							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Scooper: The Ice Cream Collectin&#039; Card Game</name>
									
			<description>User Summary: Very simple pattern game in which players must lay out non-matching scoops-of-ice-cream cards above a cone. Players start with four scoops in hand, a spinner determines how many scoops can be played out of the players hand, players draw back up to four, and play passes to the left. The &amp;ldquo;melt&amp;rdquo; position on the spinner requires a player to return an already played scoop, and &amp;ldquo;steal a scoop&amp;rdquo; cards let players steal scoops from others. The first player to get five non-matching scoops played on their cone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
