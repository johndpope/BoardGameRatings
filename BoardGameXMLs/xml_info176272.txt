			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend holds that once dragons ruled.  They carved out kingdoms and reigned unchallenged for uncounted millennia.  Only speculation explains why the time of dragons came to an end, but it is doubtful the young races could have arisen if they still ruled.  For several years, it has been an open secret that the dragon cults have been strategizing to bring dragons back.  Signs seem to indicate that at least one cult has succeeded.  Heroes are needed to quash the threat lest it fester into something that could bring disaster to the entire region.  A Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 4th level characters.  This is the first episode in the Wyrmling Saga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
