			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Power of Sheer Genius Unleashed!&lt;br/&gt; Path of the Genius is designed to help build characters who achieve immortality and legendary status not so much for their raw personal power but for their intellect itself. They may be researchers or writers, spreading ideas to the far corners of the world that plant the seeds of change wherever they are heard or read or understood. They may be naturalists and explorers, insightful observers into the world around them as it exists, or they may be forward-thinking futurists and experimenters always pushing the envelope of the possible. Their areas of specialization and study range from ancient history to advanced technology, from clockworks and alchemy to manipulation of fundamental forces like electromagnetism and gravity. Equal parts archivist and tinker, from calm loremasters to raving mad scientists, a genius adapts the knowledge of the past and applies it to new situations and new opportunities for breakthroughs. A genius is a character whose mind is her ultimate weapon and who has never met a problem she could not think her way through. A genius is always thinking, always imagining, always listening, always recording, always planning, and always ready to try something new to demonstrate that the mind itself, not the magic it might wield, is the true path to greatness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Path of the Genius includes advice on creating a concept for your mythic scholar, scientist, or brilliant battlemind, with half a dozen suggested builds, but the heart of this product is over 70 mythic path abilities tailored specifically for the genius' particular blend of inspired invention and technical expertise. Whether your stranger is a mad scientist or a curious professor, an inventor, tinker, battlemind, or well-rounded polymath, you'll find all manner of abilities designed to analyze the boundaries of possibility in the library or laboratory like genegineer, purging alchemy, and it's alive, or on the battlefield like probable path, lesson learned, and regression to the mean. Your genius can master all forms of information with abilities like perfect polyglot, eidetic research, and sage scholar, and can figure out anything he doesn't already know with elementary deduction, insightful calculus, and this just might work. A genius can be a master of the preindustrial sciences as a technological tinker, engineer, or in clockwork creation, or can plumb through Victorian sciences and future technologies like advanced gunnery, nanite replication, and rapid robotics. Whether your genius has his feet planted in alchemy, algebra, or advanced cybernetics, you'll find a wealth of genius ideas to make your heroes as learned as they are legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
