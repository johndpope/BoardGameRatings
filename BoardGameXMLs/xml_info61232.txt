							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Protectorate Peacekeeper</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arman Protectorate Peacekeeper is a warrior who draws strength and power from his faith, conviction and devotion. Most are generic champions of the Arman Protectorate and the Sanguine Covenant, using their faith to gird them against the plots of heretics, infidels and pagans while defending the members of the Covenant. Other Peacekeepers are devoted to a specific holy duty, perhaps one that has been entrusted to their family for generations. Peacekeepers often dedicate themselves to a specific cause, such as the death of black sorcerers, the destruction of undead, or the promotion of law and justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    All the information to play a Protectorate Peacekeeper prestige class in your NeoExodus or other home setting.&lt;br/&gt;    All New Protectorate Peacekeeper Feats including Pressing Attack and Team Fighter.&lt;br/&gt;    with circular 1-inch counters for miniature play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
