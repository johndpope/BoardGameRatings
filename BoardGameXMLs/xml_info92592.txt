			<description>Carrier based starfighter combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighter-Tac is a deeply strategic card game for two players. Each player is in command of a massive warship called a Battle-Carrier, and each uses a customized deck of cards called the Flight-Deck. The goal of the game is to use your Fighters and other cards in your Flight-Deck to destroy your opponent's Battle-Carrier, before he or she destroys yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of drawing cards from your Flight-Deck on your turn, then spending Resource Cards (Fuel, Energy and Ammo) to launch Fighters and shoot their weapons in an attemp to destroy the opponents Battle-Carrier. The Flight-Deck also contains other cards to aid in the fight, such as Skill Patches for your pilots, Refits for your Fighters, Modules that upgrade your Carrier, and even Support ships to increase your firepower or defense. Resources must spent to play these other cards as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various kinds of Fighters at your disposal: Interceptors, Assault Fighters and Bombers are just a few. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing when to attack with which Fighter is vital to winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using your Resources, dice rolls, and other cards in your deck, your goal is to get your Fighters across the Combat Zone to the opponent's Battle-Carrier so they can make attack runs in an attempt to destroy it. Your opponent will send out Fighters to try to intercept and destroy yours as well. Any of your Fighters that make it through will be able to attempt an attack run on the enemy Battle-Carrier. Each Battle-Carrier has a limited amount of Armor Points. Once the enemy Battle-Carrier's Armor Points are depleted, it is destroyed and you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combination of deck construction, Fighter tactics, and using your Resource Cards wisely is the key to victory. Resources can give a Fighter or a Pilot strengths and abilities that can win the day over the enemy. They can also be used to make your Battle-Carrier more efficient and deadly as well, thus increasing its chances for survival, and increasing your chances to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
