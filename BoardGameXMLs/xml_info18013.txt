			<description>This was Sid Sackson's first professionally-published game, later reworked into &amp;quot;Das Super-Blatt&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Buried Treasure.&amp;quot; It was a tie-in to a short-lived children's cartoon show (which was based on the Amos &amp;amp; Andy radio and TV shows), with the card suits corresponding to characters from the cartoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involved picking the top cards from stacks of overlapped face-up cards (so you could see what choices your pick would free up later), and scoring points thereby. The other catch is that the cards have different values in different rounds of the game, so there are a number of timing issues involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
