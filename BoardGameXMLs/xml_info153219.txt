			<description>Tap the Frog, based on the app of the same name, is a collection of games in which players bounce balls on the table and try to have them land in particular cells in a grid that lies in the bottom of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; In &amp;quot;Froschball&amp;quot;, players take turns bouncing a ball off the table while trying to have it land on frogs within the grid. If a ball doesn't land in the box after three tries, remove it from the game. Once all the balls are thrown, players score two points for each ball on a frog of the same color, 1 point for a ball on a frog of different color, 0 points for a ball on water, and -2 points for a ball on a pirate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;quot;Soloh&amp;uuml;pfer&amp;quot; is a solo variant with the same scoring system in which the player tries to maximize his score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; In &amp;quot;B&amp;auml;lle-Schubser&amp;quot;, a ball doesn't score if it shares a grid space with a ball of a different color. Otherwise, scoring is identical to &amp;quot;Froschball&amp;quot; and the player with the most points after five rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; In &amp;quot;Tic Tac Trio&amp;quot;, players take turns bouncing balls into the grid &amp;mdash; retrieving one ball from the grid first if all balls have been thrown &amp;mdash; and the first player to place three in a row wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tap the Frog has a double-sided pond, with one side having a single pirate and the other having two pirates and more water spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
