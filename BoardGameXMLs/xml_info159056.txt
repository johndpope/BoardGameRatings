			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typically, only arcane and divine practitioners of necromancy are able to tap into the darkest of the dark arts. Inevitable and endless, death terrifies the living and burdens the minds of any adventurer. Unlike casters, who whip spells from a safe distance, a warrior comes face to face with his victims when he claims their lives. He is close enough to see his victim realize its life has ended. He smells his victim&amp;rsquo;s innards as they are exposed to the air. Warriors who found themselves drawn to libraries to better understand why targeting certain parts of the body yielded a faster kill often stumbled across books on death magic in their research. No longer just death dealers, these warriors reap what they sow. Reapers are fueled by death, the death they cause and the death that surrounds them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Reapers are front-line combatants, crushing pawns and minions to build up the momentum to confront larger threats. They are well protected by their choice of armor, but are more offensive minded combatants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new 20-level martial class for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
