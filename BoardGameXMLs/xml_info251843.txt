The might of the resurgent Society is finally poised to breach the formerly impenetrable barrier surrounding the trinary system. The galaxy pauses to watch if a new generation of Starfinders can save those once lost. A mission of exploration and a mission of mercy, this return to the Scoured Stars will undoubtedly shape the future of the Starfinder Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content in The Scoured Stars Invasion also contributes to the ongoing goals of the Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo) faction. Content in this scenario also contributes to the ongoing year of the Scoured Stars storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Mikko Kallio&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario Tags: Exclusive, Faction (Second Seekers [Luwazi Elsebo]), Starship&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
