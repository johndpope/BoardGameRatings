							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For the Sake of Change</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Sake of Change is the second of five free adventures in the Novus Ordum Mundi Adventures series for 7th Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the book's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part One begins with a hurried chase through the streets of Cardican, a port city on Avalon's southwestern shore in Camlann County. The Heroes are after a thief who has snatched a Syrneth sphere away from their companion, an Explorer scholar named Theodore Lipton. This adventure works best if one of the Heroes is an Explorer or has ties to the Explorer's Society. However, Theodore Lipton could just as easily be a family member or friend of one of the Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Two involves studying the strange relic and discovering that another artefact from the same dig site may unlock the first one's secrets. The only problem is that this companion piece is now part of the Duke Mayor's collection...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Three has the Heroes visiting the Duke Mayor's estate where a party is taking place. There are several options on how to obtain the piece from the Duke Mayor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Four occurs once the Heroes bring both the first artefact and its companion piece together. A dramatic encounter takes place and dark secrets are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
