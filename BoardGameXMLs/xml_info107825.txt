			<description>Pararena is an action computer game for the Apple Macintosh computer originally written in 1990 by John Calhoun and released as shareware. It is a mouse-controlled ball game where two players compete on hoverboards in a parabolic arena with two &amp;quot;goals&amp;quot; on the sides. The objective is to gain scores by getting the ball into the other player's goal and, on the other hand, to protect one's own goal. The ball can be held for a while by squatting on it (holding the mouse button down) and then thrown to the current direction. If a player is tossed out of the arena still holding the ball, the opponent will get a score and the player will respawn in a few seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is situated in space and the two competing teams are called &amp;quot;Earth&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Taygete&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1992, in association with Casady &amp;amp; Greene, Calhoun wrote version 2.0 of Pararena which had 16 color graphics and was then a commercial product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pararena&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
