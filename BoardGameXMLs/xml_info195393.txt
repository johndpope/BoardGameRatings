			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Hawksview stands as the second city of Atrelios, and has for over three hundred years, ever since Goron III conquered the city and brought it into the kingdom.  The petty king Kaelethos was slain and his young son, Haestos placed upon a puppet throne as Duke Hawksview.  The city stood then, as it does now, on the might escarpment known to all as the Rockwall.  From the walls of Hawksview a man may look out upon the lowlands of eastern Atrelios and experience a small portion of what it must be like to fly.  Indeed, each year there are a small number who are overwhelmed by the sight and die reminding themselves that they are, in fact, not birds.  This is your city, your home, and it needs your help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventures uses the &amp;quot;Combat Happy&amp;quot; rules subset of the obSESSION system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
