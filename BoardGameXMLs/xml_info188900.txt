			<description>Puzzle Dice is a quick playing abstract game for two players in which the players draft dice from an open display over 12 rounds and place them on their individual player boards with 6x6 spaces. The dice come in 6 different colors and as they are rolled before the drafting can have values between 1 and 6. The aim of the game is to create lines, rows and diagonals of dice in which each color and or each number is unique. Sacrificing the scoring potential for a line, row or diagonal (by placing a duplicate color or number) gains that player a wild die which in a later round can be placed instead of a drafted die from the display. After both players have filled up their boards all lines, rows and diagonals that fulfill these criteria are scored and the player with the highest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
