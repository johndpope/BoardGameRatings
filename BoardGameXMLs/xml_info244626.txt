			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alluna and Brie is a turn based RPG that follows the adventures of two magical girls as they attempt to turn the tide on an invasion of squid girls from a parallel magical dimension. It is a spinoff of Max's Big Bust - A Captain Nekorai Tale and features several returning characters as well as a massive cast of new characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a mix of combat sections and life sim elements, each day you'll be able to choose whether you'll fight tentacle girls in the monster dimension, or to spend the day hanging out with friends, or to pick up a part time job waiting tables for a spare bit of cash. There's even a mermaid volleyball tournament to worry about! Time is limited though, so you'll have to plan carefully if you want to successfully juggle romance with saving the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
