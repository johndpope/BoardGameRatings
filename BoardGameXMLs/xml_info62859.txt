							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iraq 1941</name>
									
			<description>Iraq 1941 is a conflict simulation of the 1941 British invasion of Iraq. Also known as the Anglo-Iraqi War, this was a struggle for critical oil fields that could spell doom for Great Britain if lost. Outnumbered two to one on the ground and in the air, the British defeated the Iraqi army and their German allies in a free-wheeling air and ground campaign. Can you do the same? Iraq 1941 is a two-player game, or it can be played solitaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Two-Person or Solitaire Play&lt;br/&gt;    * Eight-Page Rules Manual&lt;br/&gt;    * Rules Include a Variant Scenario and Variant Counters&lt;br/&gt;    * Game Mechanics for Air and Land Combat&lt;br/&gt;    * 24 x 17 Hex Game Map in Full Color by Map Artist Richard Dengel&lt;br/&gt;    * Map Comes in Large (12 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; Sheets) and Small (One 17&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; Sheet or Two 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; Sheet) Formats with Large and Small Counters&lt;br/&gt;    * 92 Beautiful Playing Pieces by Counter Artist Tom Cundiff&lt;br/&gt;    * Map, Counters and Rules Available in PDF Format&lt;br/&gt;    * Player Aid Card and Setup/Reinforcements Charts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
