							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bedlam</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many speak in hushed tones of the dark asylum brooding atop Goblin Moors, and of the unspeakable horrors that dwell within. Its sinister Master comes to town for supplies only at night, before his accursed carriage speeds away to the nightmarish building that is Bedlam. People vanish on the moors, and their corpses are found months later - drained of blood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, new scandal surrounds the asylum: the son of a nobleman disappeared on a hunting trip on the moors. His father has offered a reward for his rescue, but it is believed that the Master has imprisoned him in the asylum for some foul purpose. Will you, brave soul, being of sound mind, pass through the portal of madness into Bedlam?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bedlam is open to any character up to level 3 with no more than 35 combat adds. Spell-casting does not work in the strange asylum, but magic-users are free to try their luck regardless. This classic solo adventure with over 200 paragraphs is compatible with all versions of Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls and is here presented at last in its definitive edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
