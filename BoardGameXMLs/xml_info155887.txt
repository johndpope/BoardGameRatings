			<description>The release of Agricultural Simulator 2013 brings you back to the fields, being a hobby farmer without getting your hands dirty! Imagine yourself controlling your fields, feeding the livestock and buying/selling hardware and goods, all things you can relate to Agricultural Simulator. Good planning, some knowledge of what your doing and a little skill are the key to your success. Are you ready for a country life?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting on a small property you start a career as a successful farmer and time by time, you earn new fields, tractors, machines andanimals. You also have the opportunity to specialize in an area such as livestock or grain marketing, or just focus on all aspects of agricultural farming. Learn to live as a farmer with the forces of nature to assess the weather conditions and to respond optimally to increase the yield of their fields, providing the animals what they need. Rapid and effective support is provided by the numerous volunteers who can do the work on your farm. For the first time these helpers work independently and support you with the field work and even during transport. Overall, you have more than 100 original tractors and agricultural machinery such as combine harvesters, forage harvesters, attachments and trailers available, all from the famous manufacturers you know from real life or television. You can buy equipment from Challenger, Fendt, Massey Ferguson and Valtra and turn your land into a blooming field. Of course, all machines are controlled by you and operated by hand. Agricultural Simulator 2013 now has a comprehensive and realistic pollution model, which looks really good, and makes this game even more realistic. Maintenance is an important point to keep your equipment in good condition and thus be able to keep your farm running. You need to pay attention to your vehicle because offcourse for a farmer the tracktor is most precious. Not only does the dynamic growth at your fields,or  just driving around look good, it feels natural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
