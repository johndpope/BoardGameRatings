			<description>ALL ABOARD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Horses throws you back into the 19th century when Railroads dominated commerce. Climb aboard any one of Lydon Rail Company&amp;rsquo;s four railways and race to be the first train to successfully deliver $1,000,000 in resources! Be wary of what lies ahead, as setbacks are bound to happen! Tariffs will slow our delivery, maintenance will stop you in your tracks and hijackers are eager to steal your payload! Fix what you can, deliver the goods and attain victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses one of four unique railways each with a unique advantage. During a turn, a player has up to 4 available actions, Draw, Transport, Remedy, and Sabotage, each of which will either bring you closer to victory or slow down your opponents. Your main goal is to accumulate $1,000,000 in resources before another player beats you to it. Denominations range from $25,000 to $250,000, so keep a look out for highly valued resources. But it isn't as simple as drawing and transporting resources...Setbacks can bring you to a halt. Remedy them quick to keep moving! Game play is quick, with each player allowed up to 3 actions per turn! You may draw, transport and sabotage in a turn, Draw twice and then remedy, or if you are feeling notorious, Sabotage three times! A 2-player game usually lasts about 10-15 minutes. Add a third and expect a bit longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
