			<description>Hocus Pocus is a card game based on some of the mechanics of Uno, combined with the nasty 'Take That!' of games like Hearts. It revolves around a battle between a number of mages (4 is best) trying to damage each other with a ball of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently the game is in prototype (which it may never leave), so I am adding it here to release it to the masses, and to get general feedback so I can improve it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
