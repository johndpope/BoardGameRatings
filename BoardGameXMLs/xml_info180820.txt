(Deal StateCards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each of 12 rounds every player invest his/her funds to ads  in swing states. (Select MiniCards and place a pyramid.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last weeks of campaigning are really hectic. Mood of voters changes quickly. Candidates have no time to monitor and respond to all attacks. (All players place their pyramids simultaneously.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Election Day all votes are counted, and the winner becomes the new president. (Players count their electors in swing states.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 Swing States is a new version of U.S. President, published in 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no changes in rules, just some tweaks to improve a gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 4 sets of pyramids you will go through last 12 weeks of presidential election campaign. With more sets you can experience more weeks and longer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be a president or not to be, that is the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elementary, my dear Watson, just secure absolute majority of electors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
