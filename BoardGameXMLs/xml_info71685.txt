							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek: Klingon Academy</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Star Trek: Klingon Academy, also known as Klingon Academy, is a starship combat space flight simulator computer game developed by 14 Degrees East, an internal development house of publisher Interplay Entertainment. It was released on June 21, 2000 to moderately positive critical and fan response. The game follows a young Klingon warrior named Torlek as he attends the Elite Command Academy, a war college created by General Chang to prepare warriors for a future conflict with the United Federation of Planets. Christopher Plummer and David Warner reprised their respective roles as Chang and Gorkon for the production of Klingon Academy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klingon Academy is the successor to Interplay's Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, this time played from the viewpoint of the Klingon Empire. The change is similar in style to the PC game Star Wars: X-Wing and its sequel, Star Wars: TIE Fighter. However, it also made a change in game mechanics, and is widely considered to be more true to Star Trek dynamics than its predecessor. Basically, it restored a view of starship combat as being more akin to naval capital ships than to fighter jets, a common criticism of the Starfleet Academy game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star_Trek:_Klingon_Academy,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
