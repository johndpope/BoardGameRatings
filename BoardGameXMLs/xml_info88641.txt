							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mind Murders</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two baffling murders rock the city. Both victims were members of the powerful Marciano mob, but in each case, the murderer was a random citizen with no connections to the victim or the criminal word -- a random citizen who immediately kills himself after the deed is done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What could be the motive behind these murders? Who is turning the innocent into cold-blooded killers? Can anything stop the Mind Murders?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mind Murders is an adventure for Adamant Entertainment's Thrilling Tales line of pulp products for modern D20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Walt Ciechanowski, this 30-page adventure is intended for a group of 1 to 3 player-characters of 3rd through 5th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
