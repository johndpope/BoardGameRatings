			<description>Madden NFL '95 for the Sega Genesis was the first Madden game to ever have both the NFL team logo and NFLPA licenses. This version of Madden NFL was also the first Madden to showcase no passing windows. Previously included &amp;quot;Past Championship Teams&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;All-Franchise&amp;quot; teams were not included. This is the first Madden game to save season mode via a cartridge battery. Player stats were tracked individually both in-game, and throughout a season. The cover has John Madden on it, but it also features two actual NFL players, Dallas Cowboys left tackle Erik Williams and San Francisco defensive lineman Karl Wilson who has his number edited to show the fictional number 70 which was not used on the 49ers roster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the first to be released to a handheld, being released for the first time to both the Game Boy and Game Gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Madden NFL '95&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
