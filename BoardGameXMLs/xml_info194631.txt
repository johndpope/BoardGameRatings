			<description>The classic game of trick or treat fun, rock n roll and fright!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Be the first player to travel through the town of Wheary Falls by defeating all three monsters and arriving to the concert in one piece!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: The Player whose birthday is closest to Halloween (October 31st) goes first, and then play continues clockwise around the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, roll the die and move your Character Pawn as directed. Then pick up one Fate Card from the CARDS pile and follow its direction. Now your turn is over. Place all used Fate Cards in a discard pile. Once all cards have been used, shuffle discard pile and begin using again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement: Each Player should roll the six-sided die and then pick up a Fate Card on each turn, unless stated by a previous card.&lt;br/&gt;Always move in the direction of the candy corn square pieces (the white tips point forward), unless a card directs you otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Win The Game: If you are the first Player to reach the concert ticket (FINISH), you've reached the Demon Inferno show and have won the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional Rules: Once you've mastered this classic game try a slightly more challenging version. Use the additional rules of either Easier Play, Choose Your Fate or Hard to Kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
