							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Light Crusader</name>
									
			<description>Light Crusader is an action RPG developed by Treasure and published by Sega. It is similar in gameplay to Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole, blending console role-playing game RPG, action-adventure and platform game  elements in much the same way. It featured an art style and presentation that mimicked European RPGs. It marked a major departure for the developer, known for fast paced action games, with colorful anime-inspired visuals. It is, to date, their only RPG, and their only game with a distinctly Western art style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure follows the knight Sir David as he travels to the town of Green Row. Green Row has been suffering from a rash of disappearances and Sir David has been summoned by the King to find the cause. Gameplay is viewed from an isometric  viewpoint. Players can execute simple sword slashes as well as using the 4 magic elements, move freely, jump, and push objects. Gameplay is a mix of action, puzzle solving, and platforming for the most part, with the usual role-playing staples like towns, shops, equipment, and spellcasting. The player controls Sir David as he travels through an assortment of dungeons, battling creatures such as 'slime', solving puzzles to advance and saving those who were kidnapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Light Crusader , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
