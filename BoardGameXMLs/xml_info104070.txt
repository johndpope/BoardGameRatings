			<description>The National Broadcasting System is in dire straights for this season. They&amp;rsquo;ve got an entire schedule that&amp;rsquo;s totally empty. No shows, no demographics, and that means no money. 2 to 4 players are all executives and creating shows is as easy as finding gimmicks to already-crafted genres and tying that into a demographic. Just like the CW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to create the highest-scoring television shows on the lineup before anyone other player does. Television shows consist of three types of cards: Genres, Gimmicks and Demographics. There are also Wrench cards that can shake up the schedule, shake up hands and keep the game lively and interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
