			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Are your players tired of having to set aside that family heirloom in favor of a random bit of treasure with better abilities?  Do you want your character to define his equipment, rather than letting the equipment define the character?  Do you desire maximum flexibility in the gear your players use?  Do you prefer customization over predefinition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you answered yes to any of the above, then you need Complete Gear, the new book on customization from the author who brought you Complete Control: Character Design for the Uninhibited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within its 13 pages, Complete Gear gives you everything you need to stop making your characters define their abilities by the luck of random treasure or the availability of item creation feats and puts the control firmly in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With illustrations by Dave Peterson and V. Shane, Complete Gear is written by John Fraser, the author of Complete Control: Character Design for the Uninhibited.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
