			<description>Skate 2 is a sandbox skateboarding video game developed by EA Black Box and distributed by Electronic Arts as a sequel to the 2007 game, Skate. Skate 2 was released in January 2009 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skate 2 is set five years after the events in Skate. During Skate It, many mysterious disasters (identified as earthquakes in Skate 2) devastated the city, leaving it in ruins and a mass evacuation of the city. The city has been changed to a noticeable standard, but if gamers have played the previous games, they may recognize familiar spots. The new city has been named New San Vanelona, or New San Van for short. However, instead of a skaters paradise the city used to be, security has been stepped up by Mongo Corp in order to protect the best parts of the city. Most of the good skating spots have caps on them to prevent skaters from skating on them, and security guards almost everywhere else. The player progresses through the story by completing challenges for magazines like The Skateboard Mag and Thrasher all before shooting a cover photo as a final mission for each magazine. The player also participates in Vert and Street Contests, as well as races. Throughout the game the player can choose board, truck, wheel, and shoe sponsorships from well-known skateboarding brands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Skate 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
