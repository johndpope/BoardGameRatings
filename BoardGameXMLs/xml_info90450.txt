			<description>The Lost World: Jurassic Park is an action video game released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and Sega Genesis. Developed by DreamWorks Interactive and published by Electronic Arts, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is based on both the novel by Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s film The Lost World: Jurassic Park. A year later a special edition of the game was released for the Sony PlayStation as a part of their Greatest Hits line-up and featured several modifications to the game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of characters struggling to survive on InGen&amp;rsquo;s &amp;quot;Site B&amp;quot; populated by over 20 species of dinosaurs in an environment of escalating chaos. There are 5 characters in all to choose from, each with their own special abilities and attributes. The game generally features a side-scroller perspective, limiting the player's movement to left and right. Throughout the game, the player will take the role of a Compsognathus, Sarah Harding, a Velociraptor, a Tyrannosaurus, and a human fighting his way through the island. In each level of the game there are &amp;quot;DNA bonuses&amp;quot; that can be collected for access to new characters and storyboard art for that particular character. If every bonus is gained a secret ending (see below) to the game will be accessible. Each character has their own unique attributes and abilities. During gameplay, the character must complete all levels to sequentially gain access to the next character. At the end of the character&amp;rsquo;s chapter, a &amp;quot;DNA&amp;quot; code is given for access to the next character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;The player begins controlling Comosognathus (in the Special Edition, the player first plays as Tyrannosaurus escaping Jurassic Park) which travels through a forest with dinosaurs such as Staurikosaurus and other dinosaurs. The player then gets caught in a Brachiosaurus herd migration. In the next level, the player is chased by an angry Carnotaurus awakened by him/her. After some caves, a human tries to kill the player using a grenade launcher. The player then controls the same human. (Human Hunter) The player goes into a cave, a cliff, with more dinosaurs. Soon after, the level ends with player now controlling a Velociraptor. The player goes into more places with humans and other dinosaurs as enemies. They soon end up in lava fields with Deinonychus and soon the boss, an Euoplocephalus. The player takes control of one of the Tyrannosaurus. Starting in the lava fields, going to a hot geyser field, in a cave, and to the human camp site. Finally the character takes control of Sarah. (Human Prey) In the first level, the player must escape from the pursuing T. Rex and avoid the obsacles. The second level shows the tyrant dinosaur and raptors in a graveyard. The final level is when the player must kill the stowaway Tyrannosaurus on the boat. After it is brought down, the male T. Rex appears and attacks the player. After it is killed, Sarah escapes Isla Sorna with Velociraptors looking on. If the players collected all DNA bonuses troughout the game, the secret ending will be unlocked. The player received a video E-mail showing Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) congratulating the player before he gets scared as a dinosaur approaches, shown as the screen begins to shake. It then ends with the message &amp;quot;Congratulations. End of Transmission&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park (console game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
