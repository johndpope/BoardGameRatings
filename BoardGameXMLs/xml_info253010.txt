							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monkey: the Role-Playing Game - Quick Start Rules</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monkey Quickstart rules is a short excerpt of the main rulebook, intended as a pickup and play introduction to  the soon to be released Monkey the Role-Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Four Pilgrims from the Journey to the West. Meet Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy and Tripitaka, the three immortals and the mortal monk, Tripitaka, who are travelling from China to India in the West along a demon infested road. These are pre-generated characters from the book that you can pick up and play.&lt;br/&gt;    How to Play. A quick, concise version of the action system that is used for every situation where the immortals meet uncertainty and an element of risk. This section also explains how an adventure is put together using scenes and how players interact within this framework.&lt;br/&gt;    If you See Buddha on the Road. This short introductory adventure is suitable for both beginning players and Narrators. This adventure guides you gently through it, introducing key concepts of the setting and the rules in quickly absorb-able highlight boxes.&lt;br/&gt;    More Immortals. Another set of three immortals and the Nun that they are escorting to India, that demonstrate the sort of immortals that you can create using the full rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
