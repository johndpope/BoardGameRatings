			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS War Against the Chtorr is a GURPS Third Edition setting based on David Gerrold's War Against the Chtorr novel series, pitting humanity against alien invaders bent on transforming Earth's environment into one matching their home planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do the worms eat? Bushes. Trees. Dogs. Cows. Cars. And people. Especially people. The worms eat everything slower than they are. And the worms are very fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David Gerrold's classic novels of The War Against The Chtorr form the background for this gripping game-world of heroism and disaster. Here you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A complete description of the post-invasion Earth.&lt;br/&gt;    Character and campaign ideas. Will you fight back against the invaders, or prey on your fellow humans as the world changes? or will you become a renegade, helping the worms as your own body becomes alien?&lt;br/&gt;    Dozens of Chtorran creatures, from stalking terrors that swallow you whole to swarming horrors that gnaw you to the bone.&lt;br/&gt;    Terran countermeasures: super-robots, Lethetic Intelligence machines, and the Telepathy Corps.&lt;br/&gt;    Chtorran jokes. (&amp;quot;What does a Chtorran call a pacifist? Lunch.&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
