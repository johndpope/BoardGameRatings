			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Gamemasters using this scenario should already be somewhat experienced with the ST:RPG2 rules. They should also own or have access to The Romulans, which will give important background information on the members of that race. Players should be experienced in running the type of characters they have chosen (either Star Fleet officers or civilian adventurers), but they need not know any more about the Romulan Star Empire than the basic information in the Intelligence Sourcebook of The Romulans, much of which would also be easily available to civilians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure can be worked into any existing campaign, or run as a one-shot adventure not part of a larger campaign. Though the text was written from the point of view of Star Fleet Officers as player characters, players may use civilian adventure characters with only slight modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
