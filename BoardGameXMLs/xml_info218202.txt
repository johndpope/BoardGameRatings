							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beastly Bust-Up</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who would win in a fight between an elephant and a rhino? What if both of them were standing on an iceberg? What if there was an octopus involved somewhere? What if the octopus was being worried by a tortoise?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Beastly Bust-Up, a gang of irascible animals from all corners of the globe come together to duke it out for the coveted elephant head trophy. Players wrangle their teams of fighters, trying to send the right beasts to the right places to win the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles take place in various habitats, each worth a number of points. Players take it in turns to dispatch fighters of various ranks to contest those habitats, hoping to have the highest total rank in each habitat at the end of the game and claim the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This would all be straightforward enough, but each animal has its own special strengths and weaknesses to throw into the mix. Fierce ones can scare others off, cowardly ones need babysitting, agile ones can avoid being squashed, speedy ones can slip in unnoticed... from the mighty lion to the lowly mouse, every fighter can contribute something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beastly Bust-Up is a scaleable game that can fill a ten minute coffee break or launch a multiplayer tournament across several hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
