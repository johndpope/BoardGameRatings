			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Card version contains nine, double-sided card tiles. Each over-sized tile is 8&amp;rdquo;x10&amp;rdquo; and printed on sturdy 12 point card stock. The UV coating on the tiles keeps them spill resistant, lets you peel transparent tape on and off them without damaging the tile, and allows you to mark the tiles with dry wipe markers then wipe them clean. As you can see in the images below, the card version has the square grid overlay with the different version of the barges on either side. We recommend getting the Zip File combo as well (or at least download the PDF Preview) so you can see how the tiles all lay out. The full layout map is not included with the printed card pages to reduce their cost to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes a dock with two buildings, two piers, a passenger barge, a cargo barge, and a small boat. This module also includes a complete water and a shoreline page that can be printed out multiple times to make the river as large as the Game Master needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies may be pursuing the adventurers and they are trying to flee across the river, setting up an ambush at the docks. The passenger barge is perfect for a ferry to transport the characters across or down the river possibly with an attack by sea monsters looking to snack on a passenger or two. Maybe they need to sneak in to the cargo barge and procure some goods instead. Alternatively they are hired on to protect the cargo barge&amp;rsquo;s precious cargo from pirates out to pilfer it for themselves. Adventures on the river abound with this new module from DramaScape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map product is a full-color, 48 x 30 inch, Barges and Docks. The ZIP file includes VTT images for your online gaming needs. All the barges are in .png format for individual placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
