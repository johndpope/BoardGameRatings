			<description>HAWKEN is a free-to-play first-person mech shooter developed by Adhesive Games and published by Meteor Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawken is a Multiplayer mech combat video game developed by Adhesive Games. The game focuses on creating an intense battle experience that captures the feel of piloting a mech while keeping the action fast-paced and strategic. It has been confirmed that the game will feature two unique game modes, as well as conventional team deathmatch and free-for-all modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawken is a mech-based first-person shooter. The game takes place in a dystopian human-colonized planet industrialized to the point of collapse, in which the hunt for resources has become a battle for survival.Four game modes are planned for release: Team Deathmatch, Free-for-All Deathmatch, &amp;quot;Siege&amp;quot; and another yet-specified unique team game mode; Khang Le has said that they also want to do a co-op &amp;quot;Horde&amp;quot; game mode, resource-and time-permitting.Seven to eight unique maps have been planned for the game on release, with plans to provide additional downloadable content afterwards. There will be three different mech types: a light type, a heavy type, and an all-around type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of a battle mech pilot, armed with cannon-like weaponry. Unlike many other first-person shooters, weapons will not require ammunition but are prone to overheat. Overheating will shut down all weapons of the mech, forcing the player to find a safe place to recover. It will be possible to choose weapons and upgrades for all mech types to match a play-style or role in a match. In combat, the player will be able to side dash, boost, and make 180&amp;deg; turns to compensate for the slow movements of the mech, which will in turn deplete the fuel gauge rapidly. Turrets are also featured in the game as two types: stationary and placeable. Stationary turrets will be aligned to the team which activates the turret, while placeable turrets can be picked up and placed around the map by anyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hawken (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
