			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dead have risen to consume the Earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the months since the first Outbreak of the Living Dead, the survivors of the Pinnacle Cruise Ship have faced all manner of horrors. From the Shamblers to the Infected Newborns, from the Living Dead Generals to the Ragers, they have survived against insurmountable odds. Now, an early winter has hit, and with it heavy snowfall and cold. Forced to find safe haven and fortify against the elements, can the characters withstand the greatest threat of all . . . their fellow survivors?&lt;br/&gt; War of the Dead brings the zombie apocalypse to the award winning Savage Worlds role-playing game, broken down into 4 chapters of 13 adventures each.&lt;br/&gt; Chapter Three continues the saga as the characters are forced to uncover sinister plots within their own camp. A serial killer is on the loose, the Living Dead are mysteriously appearing within the walls of their safe haven, Government conspiracies are discovered, and not everyone is who they appear to be. Can the characters unravel the mysteries around them before it is too late?&lt;br/&gt; In a world consumed by the Living Dead, there is an entirely new high cost of living . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
