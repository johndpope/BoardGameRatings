			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customize your car, take corners at 200 mph, and own your opponents. Need for Speed NITRO delivers the fun and exhilaration of high-speed racing with deep and challenging gameplay, where racing skills are not the only way to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master advanced techniques such as building up boost by taking risks on the road, then use it at the right moment to take the lead. But don&amp;rsquo;t forget about the cops, who will do everything they can to disrupt the race. And for the ultimate bragging rights, impose your graphical style on the world when you lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However you choose to race, never count on victory until you&amp;rsquo;ve crossed the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
