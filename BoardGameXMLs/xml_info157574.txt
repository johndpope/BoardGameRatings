							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ballad of Old Tusky</name>
									
			<description>subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;A neolithic RPG scenario for 4-6 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from GMs Overview:&lt;br/&gt;This is a cavepeople meet astronauts game, set in a world which resembles Earth's prehistoric past. The Player Characters (PCs) are a group of cave- people chasing a particularly large Mammoth, which only has one tusk. It is known as &amp;quot;Great Tusky&amp;quot;, and has eluded the tribe for decades. In his younger, wilder days, Great Tusky trampled the chief of the tribe, killing him and his young bride. His brother swore revenge on Tusky, and the tribe has been hunting him ever since. To complicate matters, a spaceship has just crashed on the planet, due to atmospheric interference. The ship has crash landed on top of Great Tusky. Great Tusky has not died - the ship's A.I. (Ulysses) opened the cargo bay as the ship was landing, in order to save Tusky's life (the A.I. didn't know if he was intelligent or not). Tusky is currently rampaging through the interior of the ship - he is much too big and tough to be affected by the stun weapons the security guards carry. The PCs encounter the aliens (very similar to themselves, just more evolved) and are captured. They are given a temporary boost of brains by an Alien Scientist, and asked to deal with the problem of Old Tusky. Using a combination of Brains and Brawn, they must overcome Old Tusky and help the spacefolk. Unfortunately, their brain-power diminishes throughout the end of the scenario, until they are once again simple cavefolk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
