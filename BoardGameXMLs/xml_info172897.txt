							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MegaJail</name>
									
			<description>In the future, crime is out of control. Aliens, gangs, and worse run amok in the unified worlds of the United Galactique. The best solution was the MegaJail, provided by MegaJail Inc., a maximum security franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In MegaJail, the players are Wardens proving who is the best at running a wing of a MegaJail in order to secure a lucrative MegaJail contract. Whoever scores the highest Reputation (your score) after a pre-set turn limit wins. Lots of things influence your Rep - you lose it when Cons (prisoners) escape, or get injured, paroled, or other things. The MegaJail Inc. management also dislikes you spending too much cash, so keep an eye on your budget!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get Cons in a draft at the beginning of each turn. Then you have a phase with players taking to actions to build new things (like Cells or Facilities). During Lockdown, Cons are put in Cells, which is the major puzzle of the game. Finally News Events happen, Cons may act out, and a new turn is started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just scoring the best isn't enough though - Cons cause Hazards, such as Unrest, Contraband, and ongoing Damage - and Cons can get Angry from overcrowding, high Unrest, or other events. If all the Cons are Angry at the end of the turn, the entire MegaJail melts down, and everybody loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part puzzle, part jail sim, part campy. Can you be the best Warden and run your own MegaJail?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
