							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dodo&#039;s Race (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After chasing a white rabbit through the wood and falling down a strange hole, a group of young adventurers meet the Dodo, who asks them to engage in the oddest obstacle course ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Adventures in Wonderland, a mini-adventure path for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game! Chapter 3: e Dodo&amp;rsquo;s Race is a family-friendly mini-adventure suitable for 2nd level characters. By the end of the adventure, all characters who have played the first two chapters of Wonderland should have earned enough experience points to take them one third of the way to 3rd level. The entire Wonderland adventure path takes characters from 1st to 5th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Dodo&amp;rsquo;s Race was designed to be part of a mini-adventure path it can be played alone or even as part of another adventure entirely. The Dodo&amp;rsquo;s obstacle course can add a wacky and fun element to any quest. For example, the yeti in Madam Margarethâ€™s Magic Potion (another After School Adventure from Playground Adventures) could challenge the party to a race in the Dodo&amp;rsquo;s place instead of simply attacking them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures in Wonderland: Down the Rabbit Hole is an After School Adventure. After School Adventures are adventure shorts designed to only take a few hours of time to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
