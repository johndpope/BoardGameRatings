							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS TT: Battle of the Bulge 1</name>
									
			<description>THIRIMONT, BELGIUM, 15 January 1945: By the end of 1944 the German offensive in the Belgian Ardennes was definitely stopped. But the Allies still had to push the Germans back behind the Siegfried Line before they could resume their strike into the Reich. By January 13&amp;mdash;eleven days after it was launched &amp;mdash;the counteroffensive had expanded far enough to the east along the battle line to engage the American 30th Infantry Division into the fight, with the capture of St. Vith as a first objective. While its sister regiments were plowing south over the hills, the 120th Regiment was locked in a bitter three-day struggle for Thirimont, a ridge village which controlled the east flank of the attack. By irony of fate, this village was defended by the 1st Battalion of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, the same unit, whose soldiers so full of confidence, earlier rode on the tanks of the powerful Kampfgruppe Peiper, and had traversed Thirimont one month earlier on the way to the Meuse bridges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here comes an entirely NEW way to enjoy your ATS gaming: Geomorphic boards that link in a myriad of ways! And no one has a cooler scenario collection to put you into the action with on the new boards like CH! Battle of the Bulge I for ATS TT includes all the combat counters and large markers you need to play, just bring your ATS rulebook and play aids and the standard &amp;frac12;&amp;quot; small marker counter sheet and you are ready for this all new take on the Battle of the Bulge and ATS gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
