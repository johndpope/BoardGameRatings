			<description>In 1982, Coleco released Expansion Module #1 for its ColecoVision video game system using off-the-shelf components, that enabled the ColecoVision to be compatible with the Atari 2600. Atari sued Coleco for patent infringement, however a court ruled that since Coleco used off-the-shelf components and not the same components found inside an Atari 2600, the Expansion Module #1 did not infringe on Atari's patents for the 2600. With this ruling, Coleco decided to make a stand-alone Atari 2600 clone and named it the Gemini.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Coleco Gemini controllers featured an 8-way joystick and a 270-degree paddle on the same controller (the joystick was at the top of the controller, and the paddle was at the bottom of the controller). To play paddle games, a Y-connector was used to connect two controllers to the controller jack at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Coleco Gemini&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
