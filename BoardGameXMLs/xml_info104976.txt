			<description>McLoughlin had had high sales with their Grandmama series of game and Milton Bradley decided that it should grab a share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to answer the riddles correctly to score points. Naturally, the game was seen as educational, a prime attribute in the years just before the 20th century began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
