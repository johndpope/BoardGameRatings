			<description>The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through buying and selling stocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board and play resembles Monopoly.  Play begins on the opening bell and $20,000 is collected each time the spot is reached.  Roll &amp;amp; move to a space for the opportunity to purchase that company's stock.  When all of a company's stock (a color group) is owned by one person, a mutual fund is formed, and an opponent landing on this stock owes increased dividends.  On Bull and Bear market spaces, cards are drawn that penalize or reward.  Purchasing on margin is allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Board&lt;br/&gt;7 Denominations of Play Money&lt;br/&gt;20 Bull Cards &amp;amp; 20 Bear Cards&lt;br/&gt;28 Stock Certificates&lt;br/&gt;8 Heavy Metal Playing Pieces&lt;br/&gt;45 Gold Bar Markers&lt;br/&gt;Pair of Dice&lt;br/&gt;Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
