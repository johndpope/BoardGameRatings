			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of FERpg is to provide a very simple, &amp;quot;single use&amp;quot;, rule set for gaming so that experienced gamers can take an occasional break from their normal roleplaying system and have a fun one-off or two-off adventure with another system.  To this end, the rules here are exceptionally simple and fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player will be the GameRunner, a sort of narrative expert and tie-breaker (light-weight GM); the remaining players will create characters.  Characters have a name and &amp;quot;some quick info&amp;quot; which are narrative tags describing appearance and ability.  For the Character's Main Job, a rank of 2d4+2 is assigned.  For their Secondary Job, a rank of 1d4+2 is assigned.  For anything else, a rank of 1d4 is assigned.  All scores summed provide Hit Points.  Characters then buy equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For any attempted action that is non-trivial, players roll 1d12 and must roll under their relevant Ability.  If the character has no relevant ability they use their lowest score divided by two, rounded up (usually, they will have to roll a 1 to succeed).  After every session, players have three chances to improve a Character Ability--1d12 is rolled and if it rolls over the ability then the ability increases by one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Combat, initiative is determined by coin flip.  Characters again roll under a target, this time their opponents relevant defensing ability (if any).  For anything not covered in the rules or for any arguments that may arise, the GameRunner makes a decision which is final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also include two brief scenarios:  Mobhits, a gangster scenario in New York City during the 1920s; and, Gapnack, a comical fantasy scenario with odd flying things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
