			<description>In Storm the Bridge, you play as both a leader in charge of a party of crew members and, sometimes, as writer able to change the narrative. You will recruit crew members (some better than others), sabotage other players (all in the name of peace, of course), and fight for control of ship sections (sorry, no holodeck). Action is cut-throat, a well-played card can change the direction of the game, and in the end, only one leader will arise as the new captain of the FSS Polemus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storm the Bridge is completely card-based, with 14 oversized cards (nine leaders and five ship sections) and 140 poker-size cards (35 crew members and 105 action cards). Players use their leaders to recruit crew members, and then use the leaders and crew members to recruit better crew and attack ship sections, while using action cards to add bonuses, sabotage the other player, modify crew members, and more. The goal is to control the Bridge ship section card and two other ship sections, then use the Bridge's unique ability - Victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
