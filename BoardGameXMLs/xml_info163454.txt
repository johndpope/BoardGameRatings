They are:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Movement (M) &amp;ndash; used to make tests to jump obstacles, climb walls, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Accuracy factor (Ac) &amp;ndash; used to determine the effectiveness of your shooting&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Armour factor (Ar) &amp;ndash; used to reduce the effectiveness of enemy shooting&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Negotiation factor (N) &amp;ndash; used to negotiate the surrender of enemy troops&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Technical factor (T) &amp;ndash; used in tests to defuse bombs, hack computers, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Language factor (L) &amp;ndash; used to understand foreign languages&lt;br/&gt;They also have a variety of equipment depending on what type of character he is (more on this in the force selection lists &amp;ndash; see the section entitled Force Selection).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving&lt;br/&gt;Each character can normally move six inches if models are 20mm to 30mm in size, six centimetres if models are 15mm in size, or 12&amp;rdquo; if over 30mm in size (not recommended).
