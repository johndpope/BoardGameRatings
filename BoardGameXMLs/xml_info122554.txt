							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scratch</name>
									
			<description>Scratch is a two-player strategy card game where each player constructs a deck of iconic fantasy monsters. Players take turns laying a single card in a 3x3 grid with each successive card sharing at least one side with a card already in play. When cards are first played, numbers on shared sides are compared to determine if the new card defeats the old card, allowing control of cards to be gained and lost throughout play. Victory occurs when one player controls three cards in a row (horizontal or vertical). Scratch has a minimum of rules but deep strategic game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
