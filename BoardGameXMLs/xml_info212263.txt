			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tenewick&amp;rsquo;s Shop of Desires is your one-stop shop for weapons, armor, and equipment. If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough, you might even be able to find something magical while you&amp;rsquo;re here. So step in and begin your visit, and let good old Tenewick meet the desires of your heart!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tenewick is a goblin of unique ability. He can get you almost anything you desire...for a small fee, of course. Use the Goblin Shop as a place of easy access for equipment for your characters, or simply as a place to instill hopes and dreams within the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the pages of this book, you will find a description of Tenewick&amp;rsquo;s Shop of Desires (The Goblin Shop), along with statistics for playing Tenewick, his goblin guards, and his special Servant Warrior Guard. You will also find information on the lands surrounding the Goblin Shop, which will give you a brief glimpse into the World of Suntarynn, the world in which the Questing Heroes Role Playing Game is set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
