			<description>Game Instruction Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOUR MIND IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gidders is the adventure/puzzel game that tests your cleverness and creativity inside interactive 3D worlds. As Zack you will enter the Gridder Corporation factory consisting of 36 levels of grids, each 16 x 16 squares. Your objective on each level is to solve it by collecting the required number of Pyramid Keys. You accomplish this by interacting with the tumbling Gridders. After you've solved the level you must locate the diamond shaped portal that transports you to the next level. Continue to descend grid by grid toward your final fate and the mystery of the factory. Each level can be solved in more than one way and the solutions become more challenging with every grid. You cannot advance to the next level until the current one is solved. Dramatic animated sequences between the levels provide plot twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
