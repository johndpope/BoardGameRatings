							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crystal Lorewarden</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The traditional keepers of arcane and esoteric lore have always been the wizards, the bastions of writing and literacy through all lands and peoples. However there are other ways to store information than the written word on paper and parchment &amp;ndash; there are peoples who have stored their lore, their secrets, even their very memories and experiences within shards, formations and even huge lattices of crystal. These crystal storage forms are crafted by psionic individuals, and are then accessed by other manifesters, sometimes millennia after their initial creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lorewardens are manifesters who concentrate on learning the knowledge stored in these devices and in all other forms of storage, in order to collect it, learn from it, and store it anew. They seek out all forms of esoteric knowledge, secrets of ages past, long-forgotten lore, and lost powers of the mind. All crystal lorewardens seek out knowledge and ancient secrets, but more than the arcane loremasters, they dedicate themselves to preserving this knowledge for future ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only manifesters can become crystal lorewardens, as they must be able to access and store crystal matrix data forms. These manifesters sometimes work independently, but many congregate in esoteric cabals to accumulate data as a group and uncover similar secrets or to seek out a hidden truth buried ages ago under convoluted layers of secrecy and misdirection or even by mythology. There are small communities of lorewardens in many major cities that have any visible psionic presence, and most psionic guilds and organizations also have a lorewarden or two to catalogue discoveries and seek out related lore to the cause or mission of the guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
