			<description>From the publisher's flyer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;77 portraits and 33 interaction cards provide the raw material for people-related games.  Who are these people?  What do they do?  How do they relate to me?  PERSONA is simple to play.  The dots on the interaction cards indicate the number of portrait cards to be played.  The arrows represent the interactions.  Players interpret portraits and arrows in their own way.  Is this a familiar situation?  What drama or comedy is unfolding?  There are endless variations.  Paintings by Ely Raman, creator of The OH Cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a game by the definition of most BGGers.  It's really a tool for simulating - er, I mean stimulating - conversation.  However, the publisher claims it's a game, so here it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
