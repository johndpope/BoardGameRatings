			<description>A game for three-year-olds.&lt;br/&gt;A race to the finish between the farmer and the rabbits. The farmer is trying to catch the rabbits, the rabbits are trying to make it to the other side of the farm. One player is the farmer, the other are the rabbits, if the farmer catches all the rabbits the farmer wins, if one rabbit makes it to the other side of the farm, the rabbit wins.&lt;br/&gt;The rabbits use the carrots spread around the board to hide under, but there's a knack, the farmer can remove from the board a bunch of carrots if he lands on that square and no rabbits are hiding under them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
