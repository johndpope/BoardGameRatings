							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brittle Bone Lake</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A month ago, some fancy boy rode through here, he wore armor without a scratch on it. No proper armor is without dents and blood. He spoke loud, but a man without a notch on his blade has little to say worth the spit he sprays. He wanted information about Brittle Bone Lake. Most laughed at the fancy, some told him to go home to his nursemaids, but Jundry, gave him directions. Do I have to say Jundry has no love for the fancy folks? Haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the boy since. I bet that armor is proper now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brittle Bone Lake came about because of my drowsy Google+ surfing. I saw some very cool maps by Kristian Richards and wanted to give a go with it. I drew the map that;s included and thought it came out well. And when I saw the map my mind went back to that Trampier picture of the catoblepas rearing its head out of the water that was in the old Monster Manuel. So I grabbed my pencil and scribbled some notes and whamo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brittle Bone Lake is a small location to place in your campaign. You'll meet Sir Tusks, a catoblepas who minds his own business. Locals like when adventurers come through to spend their coin. What the adventurers and locals don't understand is that Sir Tusks keeps the area free of other hostiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Encounter published on Tim Shorts's Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
