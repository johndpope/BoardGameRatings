			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Path of Bones is a fast paced cinematic martial arts combat game. Hordes of troops. Powerful heroes. Exotic locales. Unparalleled action And no dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Path of Bones uses dominoes - &amp;quot;bones&amp;quot; - instead of dice to run its combat system. Engagements run on a two-tiered system: troops mass and press their advantage together; heroes combine their marital arts styles into devastating attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules provide an intriguing system of simultaneous attack and defense based on the two sides of the dominoes drawn by you and your opponent. Equipment and character types provide options for over forty different types of common troops. There are thousands and thousands of ways to combine the martial arts styles from the rules to make heroes ... and a guide to customizing the system to your own tastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the base rules you get nine combat scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One set allows a band of heroes to progress through a traditional Chinese story&lt;br/&gt;     Another sets the stage for fighting the Mongol Invasion of Japan&lt;br/&gt;     A set up for the epic climactic battle of the Forty Seven Ronin&lt;br/&gt;     Each combat scenario is playable as a stand-alone game, with options for replay value&lt;br/&gt;     Twenty-five pages of print-and-play terrain to support the scenarios right away&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays well from as few as forty to fifty figures total (both sides) up to about five hundred. It was playtested with 25-28mm figures using standard size dominoes and 15-28mm figures using mini dominoes. Bones are used to measure movement as well as resolve combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
