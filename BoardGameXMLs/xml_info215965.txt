			<description>The Great Whee Race is a tabletop racing game set in an alternate prehistory where our Human ancestors &amp;ndash; the Archaic Homo sapiens, or Ahs for short &amp;ndash; rub elbows with Neanderthals, Dino sapiens (dinosaur men), Florz (small Ahs), &amp;amp; other species. Dinosaurs still roam the Earth &amp;amp; magic actually works! A sub-species of early Humans called Neuro-Evolutionary Rostral Developers (abbreviated as N.E.R.D.s) has recently evolved, &amp;amp; N.E.R.D.s have been busy inventing all sorts of amazing &amp;ldquo;cavepunk&amp;rdquo; stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of their most popular inventions is the downhill racer, popularly known as the Whee in Cave-Speak. Many different styles of Whees have been invented, &amp;amp; the N.E.R.D.s who invent them almost always claim their design is the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bunch of prehistoric Clans have gotten together to test these claims. The Great Whee Race is about to begin! Each player chooses a Whee Racer, &amp;amp; then purchases a Crew &amp;amp; Cavepunk inventions. The racers then vie to be the first to cross the finish line in a race down a big hill. And just about anything goes in The Great Whee Race, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to outmaneuver, outfight, &amp;amp; outwit your opponents in order to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Whee Race is played on a track overlaid with a square grid. From 2 to 5 racers vie to make it to the finish line first. Each racer - called a Whee in Cave-Speak - is controlled by 1 player (or team of players), A variety of prehistoric-ish species serve as crew members, &amp;amp; give various bonuses. Whees can be outfitted with melee weapons, missile weapons, or both, as well as cavepunk inventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the downhill journey begins, a simple card-based simultaneous movement &amp;amp; action system is used so that players don&amp;rsquo;t know where anyone else is going when they choose their movement. This has 2 nice effects: players are all active throughout most of each turn, &amp;amp; perhaps more importantly, there are usually LOTS of collisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique &amp;ldquo;game mechanic&amp;rdquo; is used to resolve all actions: the Rok Draw. Every time they attempt an action or have a contest with another player, a player draws from a pool of tokens consisting of 3 kinds of Roks. Bonuses &amp;amp; penalties add to or subtract from the number of Roks drawn. Most actions have the same target for success, so they are resolved quickly. Players can use 1 of 6 pre-made Whees &amp;amp; crew, or can customize their own using a simple point build system. There&amp;rsquo;s another PDF included with track sections, templates, Whee Racer stat cards &amp;amp; models, &amp;amp; all the tokens you&amp;rsquo;ll need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
