			<description>(From the back cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was all supposed to be so easy.  But after the heroes go through a tour of duty in WWII (not bad for heroes born ing the 1950's!), things once again get complicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems that time travel is once again called for, but this time things are kind of strange.  In fact, history itself has begun to disappear!  All kinds of people are showing up where they shouldn't be - or not showing up where they should!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key seems to fall somewhere in the 1870's, around Dodge City, Kansas.  All you've got to do is go there and fix the problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Dodge is a city under siege -  a siege that only Superheroes can break.  Ready to attack are the armies of Napoleon, Genghis Khan, and Alexander the Great!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Weird, Weird, West is the second in the three-part TIME WARP series of adventures.  It is designed for the WEST COAST AVENGERS - but any character can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
