							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shakhàn Book C: Combat on Telostic</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat mechanism used in the game is quite complex and involves several derived characteristics (&amp;quot;combat-related factors&amp;quot;).  Combat occurs in rounds, each Round (5 seconds) being further sub-divided into Pulses (1 second) during which characters can execution actions based on their Tactic Card Allowance.  Characters have a Combat Factor that derives from numerous other statistics; likewise a Missile Factor is derived.  Exertion is noted against a Fatigue Point Reserve while damage is tracked against a Body Damage Reserve.  Combat is planned with Tactic Cards and then executed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally speaking, the rules favor highly detailed combat over speed of play.  Combat involves many numbers, numerous tables, and several calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
