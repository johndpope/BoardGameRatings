							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Anderson &amp; Felix Guide to Naval Architecture Second Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your project has the green light!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently the largest ship building company in Clement Sector, the Anderson and Felix Shipbuilders Company was started on Hub in 2299 by Jamie Anderson and Reynaldo Felix. Both Anderson and Felix brought to Clement Sector their considerable expertise and experience constructing space vessels for travel between Earth and the Earth Sector colonies.  And now that expertise is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranging from tiny ten tonne work pods to massive armored system defense monitors, the space ships of Clement Sector are as varied as the crews that operate them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides the tools for a naval architect to design small craft to huge in-system ships, trader or capital ship. They can install the latest technology to allow the ship to transit interstellar distances, use inertialess drives or to &amp;ldquo;ride fire &amp;ldquo;on a ship that uses spin gravity to provide for crew comfort. They can also design low technology missile armed warships or capital ships bristling with high energy weapons and ship killing torpedoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book merges the adventure class ship and capital ship design sequences into a new design sequence that allows for better design flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your tools await you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
