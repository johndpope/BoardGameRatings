			<description>The Endless Land is a game with modular boards that are placed in a different way each game for a new experience each time!  Some players will choose dangerous quests and heroic battles to gain victory.  Some will set up commerce and trade routes to conquer the land.  There is magic and adventure among the dwarves, elves, and humans that live in this realm. Make sure you have plenty of food for the journey and let the quest begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn all players will take their actions simultaneously.  They travel to a neighboring town (move their player meeple on the board) and collect the goods which have been accumulating there. The board is modular and matches up with other board parts to form a unique terrain each game.  Also, the game expands with more 8&amp;quot; X 10&amp;quot; board pieces to form a playing surface as with no knowable end.  Each player uses gold, wheat, wood, iron, and many other commodities to build farms, stores, and implements of combat.&lt;br/&gt;Players may also take quests that send them into the lairs of diabolical monsters who are hoarding gold, rubies, and other valuable items.  Players can risk sneaking into the dark caverns and taking the loot, but if the monster awakens they are in trouble.&lt;br/&gt;Players can build strongholds so that even when they are not in a town, that town is building up their store of goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can trade each turn to turn their wheat, sheep, or cattle into food, they can also trade other commodities for food in a town where that is in demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can travel faster buy buying a horse or boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players wishing to build or buy must have food to stay in a particular place longer to transact business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are gained by building structures and conquering creatures.  The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
