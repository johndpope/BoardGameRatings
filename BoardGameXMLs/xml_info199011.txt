							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Exodus Of Israel</name>
									
			<description>A quick historical family game for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Exodus Of Israel is one of the most well known and preserved events of ancient times, being found in many sources, including the Old Testament writings acknowledged by the Islamic, Judaic, and Christian faiths. It follows the story of the tribes of Jacob, having relocated to Egypt during a severe famine. Initially welcomed due to the favor earned by Jacob's son Joseph, generations later forced into slavery by a Pharaoh who no longer remembered or cared for the growing nation of outsiders. The God of Jacob (re-named Israel before his death) hears the plight of the nation, and delivers them out of the hand of Pharaoh through a series of plagues which break down the hardened will of Pharaoh as well as show His power in the eyes of the region. Led by the prophet Moses, the Israelites are granted their freedom, and immediately make their migration (Exodus) back to the land promised them by God. The journey was not a pleasant one. Being in the desert with stressed resources, it often led to complaining, and sometimes outright rebellion against Moses and God Himself despite leading and providing for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is for 2-4 players, and at essence is a roll-and move game suitable for children. However there are also several elements of choice involved, and anyone with an interest in the Exodus story would enjoy following the path of the Israelites and being re-acquainted with the joys and pitfalls experienced along the way. The game can accommodate non-readers and readers alike, and has been designed to be playable independent of direct parental supervision. The winner of the game manages to make the journey from Egypt to the Promised Land with the most amount of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
