			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are crossing America on your bicycle. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you stop to explore and old mining town.  Soon you discover that Silverlode has been invaded by a terrible, bubbling black slime that makes animals howl and people hiss and attack each other in the night.  You have no choice but to stay and help solve the mystery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But whether you find yourself trapped in a river of oozing black evil in your own hotel room, running for your life from a hideous manlike monster, walking a narrow path over a pit of rattlesnakes, imprisoned as a sacrifice for a mad doctor's experiments, battling billions of attacking insects, or defying the eerie powers of the yellow-eyed people- never fear!  If you make the right choice, you might also win a million dollars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get ready to plunge into adventure.  And if you get caught in the black slime, just go back to the beginning and start again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS ADVENTURE BELONGS TO YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Which Way books- Where YOU make things happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
