			<description>Golf the Card Game is a fast paced and exciting game that can be played with 2 to 6 players.  Each player received 4 cards and uses memory and chance to reach the lowest stroke total for each hole - just like real golf!  &lt;br/&gt;If you can't beat 'em at the course, beat 'em at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to trade cards with the draw pile or the discard pile to reach the lowest stroke value for each of the four cards in your hands.Stroke values are added up at the end of the hand to determine the winner of that hole.  Hole totals are added up after nine or eighteen holes and the golfer with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes:  Playing cards, score cards, pencil, instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
