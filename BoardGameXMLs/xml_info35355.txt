							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">De schippers van de Kameleon</name>
									
			<description>Based on the popular 'Kameleon' series, players each have their own Kameleon boat, with which they need to save four different animals from drowning. Players choose cards to plan their sailing route in the lake, where the animals are. If they have a rescue buoy in the right place in their 'route' they can save an animal. The first player to save all his animals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
