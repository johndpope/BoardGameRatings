							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Talented Barbarian</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barbarians are one of the most popular martial classes, in large part because they have more flexibility than most martial classes. With the option to select a rage power at every other level, barbarians have access to a wide range of potential builds, ranging from fast-and-mobile skirmishers, to heavily defended tanks, to whirling dervishes of mass destruction. If there is a limitation to the barbarian, it&amp;rsquo;s that even when modified by rage powers and archetypes, most barbarians end up looking and playing a lot like each other, because they are all rage-fueled killing machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the popular and proven edge and talent system that has already been applied to many other classes in the Talented Class line of books from Rogue Genius Games, we&amp;rsquo;ve built a new talented barbarian class that can take on any of a large number of &amp;ldquo;uncivilized&amp;rdquo; roles. While these most certainly include a number of things that could be considered forms of berserker, they also allow for barbarians seeped in mysticism, trained as guides and scouts, or who have learned to become one with the savage nature they live in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
