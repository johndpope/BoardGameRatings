							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales from Space: About a Blob</name>
									
			<description>The player controls a gelatinous Blob character who has a range of abilities that are released over the course of the game. The controls include those of a typical platformer with the addition of digestion (absorb/shoot objects), magnetism (repulse/attract) and electricity (gain/deplete). The game itself is split into 4 Tiers comprising 17 levels. Over the course of a level a player will receive target sizes that must be reached by locating and absorbing surrounding objects. Larger objects can be absorbed when the Blob increases in size. Target sizes are treated as sections within a level where a player must traverse platforms, solve puzzles, and fight enemies in order to proceed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tales from Space: About a Blob&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
