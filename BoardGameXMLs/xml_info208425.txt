			<description>Lizardman Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Slann are a dying race. First born children of the Old Ones, since the fall of that ancient and noble race, and the coming of the force known as Chaos, there have been no new births, and as each individual is slain, their race heads towards extinction. Those that still exist in the world are millennia old, but they number only a few hundred. Favoured by the Old Ones, the Slann were responsible for constructing many of the ancient wonders of the Old Ones, including the immense Warp Gates which eventually led to the fall and extinction of their masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
