							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gettysburg: Into the Wheatfield</name>
									
			<description>This is GETTYSBURG: INTO THE WHEATFIELD for ATS. No one that has studied this battlefield is unaware of where the infamous Wheatfield is. We've all walked that hallowed ground. Now, students of the battle that own CWATS can re-fight the battle in detail on the historical map. You'll need to own CWATS of course -- but if you buy direct from CH, you'll also receive a copy of the DEVIL'S DEN counter sheet&amp;mdash;allowing you to choose one module or the other with FREEDOM! Isn't that what all the shooting was about in 1863! Of course, we suggest you nail BOTH CWATS modules: Devil's Den and Into the Wheatfield, but the choice is yours! Order your men Prone, call for a Bayonet Charge! Choose your cannon ammunition. Send a Courier out to the end of your line. It's all up to you as YOU are In Command (at least we hope you are, as the rules say, units that are not In Command ... are Out of Command ... or Isolated .. or OOC and Isolated ... oh the detail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
