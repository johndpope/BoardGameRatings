							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Favorite Carrera RS Trick Taking Game</name>
									
			<description>My favorite Carrera RS is a trick-taking card game themed on car racing. There are six kinds of cards (numbered from 1 to 5, with two kinds of &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; cards), speed chips, fuel chips, and victory tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the round, each player is dealt six cards and five fuel chips. Like typical trick-taking games, the first player leads by playing a card from his/her hand and other players play one by one. The number on the played card represents the speed of the player's racing car. When playing the card, the player has the option to increase the speed of the car by paying a fuel chip(s) and/or a speedy chip(s). Usually, the fastest car wins the trick, but the tricky part is that the value of &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; cards become all 0s if there is any &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; card played in the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also have the option of playing his/her card face-down, giving up the trick but receiving (possible multiple number of) fuel chips from the supply as compensation. Another way to receive a fuel chip is to play a &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; card. But be aware that a player can store a maximum of five fuel chips. Meanwhile, a speed chip is awarded to the player who wins the trick. This means that the player who wins earlier tricks becomes more advantageous for the later tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important trick is the last (6th) trick, since only the player who wins the last trick receives a victory token. The player who earns the most victory tokens after a certain number of rounds is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
