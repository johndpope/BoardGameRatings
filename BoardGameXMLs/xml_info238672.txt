			<description>First World War naval action in the Adriatic consisted mainly of Austro-Hungarian bombardments of Italy&amp;prime;s eastern coast, and wider-ranging German and Austro-Hungarian submarine incursions into the sea and the Mediterranean.&lt;br/&gt;Allied forces mainly limited themselves to blockading the Central Powers' navies in the Adriatic, which was successful in regards to surface units, but failed for the U-boats, which found safe harbors and easy passage into and out of the area for the whole of the war. Considered a relatively secondary part of the naval warfare of World War I, it nonetheless tied down significant forces.&lt;br/&gt;This is an area game simulating the Great War in the Adriatic Sea (1915-1918) between Italian and Austro-Hungarian Fleets. The game comes with the last issue of NoTurkeys! web-zine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
