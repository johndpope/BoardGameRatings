			<description>Each player takes a fleet (3 Battleships, 3 Cruisers and 8 Destroyers).  Each player also takes 3 mines and 3 buoys.  The fleets are placed in the harbors or capitals (not on the Jetty dots used for &amp;quot;moving out&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is based on the roll of 2 dice.  Units may be moved in any combination adding up to the total on the dice (for example a roll of 12 means 12 units can move 1 or 4 units can move 3, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacking an enemy happens when friendly units move onto a spot with enemy units (there is no limit to stacking on a dot).  To fight, players add up the values of each fleet (Destroyers = 1, Cruisers = 2 &amp;amp; Battleships = 3 combat points).  The fleet with the lowest value must lose its best unit.  Additional factors include forts, obstacles (shoals &amp;amp; straits) and high speed stretches.  Buoys and mines affect movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player who succeeds in penetrating into the opponent's capital with one or more ships.  Occupying the capital requires superior forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
