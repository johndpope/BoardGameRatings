							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steel Battalion Controller</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special, very large, and bulky controller was bundled with the Steel Battalion game. The controller has two control sticks and around 40 buttons. Only limited quantities were made available. These quickly sold out, making the game a collector's piece. It has since been re-released in limited quantities worldwide, with blue controller buttons distinguishing it from the first edition with green buttons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
