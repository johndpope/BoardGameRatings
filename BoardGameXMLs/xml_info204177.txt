			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, in a time when the world of Faer&amp;ucirc;n was much younger, men lived in gleaming cities on the shores of great inland seas, and wizards ruled on high, experimenting with magics unknown to men today.  This was the time of ancient Netheril, when magical carpets and flying castles filled the skies and men still warred with elf and dwarf alike.  The common people of the land were little more than slaves to their magic-using masters, wizards who dabbled in the search for immortality.  Over centuries, the wizards of Netheril grew powerful, mighty enough to challenge even the gods of the heavens with the ancient secrets they had discovered.  The gods of old looked down on Netheril and the foolish pride of its rulers and chose to curse the land in punishment for the wizards' pride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For characters of 7th - 9th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
