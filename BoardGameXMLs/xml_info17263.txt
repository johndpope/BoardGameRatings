			<description>From the Kidult website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gasp! What&amp;rsquo;s up? A group of pretty animals have lost their colours, will you help them come back out? And why don&amp;rsquo;t you invite your friends and play all together to see who is the fast colourer of the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each kid chooses an animal to colour up and lays it on the table in front of himself. At his turn each kid throws a dice and colours up that part of the animal which is marked by the number on the dice. If that number corresponds to a coloured portion he waits for his next turn and it&amp;rsquo;s up to the child next. The winner is the one who colours up all of his animal first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
