							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dark Altar of Katar</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Conan the Roleplaying Game adventure set within the dark jungles of Vendhya, bordering the mysterious land of Uttara-Kuru. Characters should be 4th to 5th level, with an average of 4 to 6 players. Any character type can be played, however a Noble type character (Kshatriyas) would be helpful to the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For 30 long, dark years, the cult of Katar has kept itself hidden among the dank and haunted jungles of Vendhya. The faithful of Katar, mostly assassins and thieves, have secretly worshipped their goddess in the broken ruins hidden deep in the dark jungles or the underbelly of civilization. The king of Vendhya, Bhunda Chan, has placed the highest bounty upon any known members of this death-dealing cult, and has let it be known that any who harbour or help the followers of Katar, will face royal judgment. To this end, Bhunda Chan has assigned his spymaster, Dergith Vrul, the task of rooting out any nests of this dark cult and executing their members.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Altar of Katar was a free PDF download for the Sons of Cimmeria program, available from Mongoose Publishing's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
