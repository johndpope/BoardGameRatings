			<description>Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes, a revision with additional features, was released on November 29, 2007. This version was later ported to Nintendo Wii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes now allows two players to play the game; though it is limited to Unification, Versus and Tournament modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a Sengoku Basara 2 save file is present, a player may transfer the data to Heroes to carry over character levels, skills and certain items. Money and some items however cannot be transferred to Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devil Kings, the Western version of Sengoku Basara, introduced priming as a special attack. In Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes, some of the special moves of the characters can do priming damage, as indicated by the yellow text of the move. It should be noted that this is the first time in the Japanese version of Sengoku Basara to use priming since it originated in Devil Kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes introduces the lottery system. After a battle, one of the prizes a character can get is a red piece of paper. That is the lottery ticket which can be used in the Basara Shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New to Heroes is the Versus mode. This allows two players to compete with each other in eight mini-games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two new arenas to choose from: Grand Tournament, where the player earns extra points for fulfilling specific tasks, and Ultimate Tournament, where the player is given a time limit to finish off the opponents; both arenas can be played by two players. In single player mode, the player can use the new 'Tag Team' system; a player can choose two characters and 'tag' his/her partner anytime and when a tag is made, every time the active character makes a kill, his/her partner will get healed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing in the Unification Mode, Matsunaga Hisahide may be encountered the same way Musashi can be encountered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sengoku Basara 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
