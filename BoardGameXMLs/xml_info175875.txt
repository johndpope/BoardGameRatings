			<description>A BOARD GAME CREATED FOR SOCCER AND GAME FANS ALIKE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mini Copa is a soccer board game where you can play with the athletes behaviour and skills in a realistic and simple way, Each new play benefits from your good technical eye and an athletes&amp;rsquo; sense of opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of the game is broad enough to represent anything that can happen in a live soccer match. Each player, in alternating rounds, can use different actions with his team in an agile manner, while deciding to focus on the technical, physical or psychological aspects of the sport. These choices allow the development of teams with very varied personalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board game will begin in a more basic form, with four national teams and rules to play endlessly unique matches. But, with the help of additional goals, we can unlock and release the game&amp;rsquo;s full fledged potential by means of the campaign mode, in which the rules for managing the entire technical and administrative team, including trainings, casting athletes, managing the teams resources, fully customizable teams and even stadiums construction will be out allowing a hugely expanded strategical and tactical options in the best and definitive soccer game ever made!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN ON: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.sibite.com.br/ViewCampaign.php?cid=63&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.sibite.com.br/ViewCampaign.php?cid=63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out the project in english and english subtitles as well!
