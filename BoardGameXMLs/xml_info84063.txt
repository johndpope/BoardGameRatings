							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic Wear II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We go back into our wardrobe to bring you another batch of 50 new items of magic wear for your D20 fantasy campaign setting. From the Two-way Pouch to the Portable Store Backpack you're sure to find the perfect accessory for the adventure at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quiver of the Hornet's Nest&lt;br/&gt;Once per day, the owner of this quiver can use it to cast a magic missile spell (as described in the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Player's Handbook, Third Edition). This spell functions as though cast by a 9th level wizard. The spell causes 5 arrows within the quiver to transform into magic missiles. The missiles function exactly as the spell as far as damage, distance, and target choices are concerned. The quiver must contain at least 5 standard non-magic arrows for the spell to work. The missiles fire directly from the quiver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
