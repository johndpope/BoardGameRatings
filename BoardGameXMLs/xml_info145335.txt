			<description>From the author's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completing the core guidelines earlier this year, it was clear that the open system I had built needed additional support. Although my intentions were met with the first TSRS document &amp;ndash; wanting to stick to around 20 pages and reinforcing the importance of optionality &amp;ndash; I felt that particular areas needed more attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document does contain a few extra and optional guidelines for the GM and player to use as needed but it really focuses on clarification of existing concepts through situational examples. Some of the examples found herein surfaced during play testing while others were discussed by players and I during breaks in the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
