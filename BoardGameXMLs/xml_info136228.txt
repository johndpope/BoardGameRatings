			<description>An Art of War D10 game. In Outbreak Zombie the goal is to survive a Zombie apocalypse. The game is for 1-8 players ages 12 and up. With 5 game types the replay value is high. With loot dice the items are completely random. Can you survive the Outbreak?&lt;br/&gt; Throughout the game players must work together to gather items and secure buildings as needed. There is no monetary or buy section. All Items are found by looting the abandoned buildings of the town. Player cooperation is therefore put at a premium. Scarce ammo or better items can be traded between players. Unless of course you are playing the No Friends Scenario, In No Friends no help is allowed and you can attack other players.&lt;br/&gt; The Ultimate goal is securing your hometown. This is done by killing off all the zombies in your town. Get Out of Dodge is different as you and your fellow survivors attempt to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is One die roll and is streamlined for fun interactive battles. Action Points dictate how much players can accomplish per turn. Character development is present allowing for different breeds of characters based off player discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
