			<description>&amp;quot;Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie (ドラゴンクエストVI 幻の大地, Doragon Kuesuto Shikkusu Maboroshi no Daichi, lit. &amp;quot;Dragon Quest VI: Land of Illusion&amp;quot;), Dragon Quest: Realms of Reverie in Europe, is a console role-playing game developed by Heartbeat and published by Enix (now Square Enix) for the Super Famicom as a part of the Dragon Quest series. It is the last Dragon Quest game in the Zenithia trilogy. It was released on December 9, 1995 in Japan. This installment in the series was developed by Heartbeat, whereas the previous Dragon Quest games were developed by Chunsoft. In July 2007, Square Enix announced a series of remakes of Dragon Quest IV, V and VI for the Nintendo DS, making this the first remake of the latter game on other consoles. It was also announced that the title will also see release in both North America and Europe.[6] Prior to this, it has been translated by fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the sixth installment to the Dragon Quest series, the graphics and gameplay remain close to the other games, with minor additions and upgrades. The graphics were vastly improved from Dragon Quest V, which was also for the SNES, but rather unimpressive due to it being an early game on the console.. Navigation remains largely unchanged from the previous games and the turn-based battles are still in first-person. The class system from Dragon Quest III returns, with minor adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the very high price of 11,970 yen (about 100 dollars), Dragon Quest VI has sold 3.2 million copies in Japan, becoming the best selling game of 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story follows the traditional Dragon Quest &amp;quot;Hero&amp;quot; on a quest to save the world. In this particular installment, the heroes also have to endure the personal struggle of amnesia, as many of the main characters do not initially remember who they are. After completing a series of quests, the player learns that in addition to a Real World, there is also a Dream World, made up of people's dreams, and that there is a great evil that wants to conquer both. The Hero and his new party work together to save both worlds from the ever-growing threat.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dragon_Quest_VI:_Realms_of_Reverie,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Akira Toriyama: Character &amp;amp; Monster design&lt;br/&gt;Koichi Sugiyama: Music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
