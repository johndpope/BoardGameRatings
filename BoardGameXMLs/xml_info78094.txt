			<description>From the game's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is energy generated? How much does it cost? How does it affect the environment?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are extremely important topics today, and are no longer just the domain of engineers and industry experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ElectroCity was developed to increase public awareness &amp;ndash; particularly among students &amp;ndash; of the basic &amp;quot;common knowledge&amp;quot; of these topics. That is, the general terms and concepts of the industry and the dilemmas that go along with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our goal is not to provide students with a sophisticated understanding of the controversies in the various energy debates. Rather, our goal is to spark an interest and lay an unbiased foundation for later learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We set out to make a game that was fun and educational. A game that gave kids something different to do in class and share with their parents. And a game that was clearly designed and built in New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ElectroCity is proudly brought to you by Genesis Energy. Genesis Energy is a leading generator and retailer of energy in New Zealand. It generates electricity from a range of sources including gas, coal, wind and water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
