			<description>Curious little game in that it is not boxed and comes in a ziplock bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has 12 coloured spaces and on each space a counter is placed of the same colour. Depending on the number of players, each player gets an equal area featuring these counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple. Throw the dice with the colours on it. If you roll a colour in your area, you may remove the counter (it goes out of the game) or you can move that counter into an opponent's area if he has a space of that colour without a counter on it. There is some strategy required by the little ones who will play this game and that is a good thing in my opinion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to clear out all the counters in his area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
