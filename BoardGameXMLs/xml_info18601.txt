			<description>CON! is a fast paced card game where players compete to the be most popular attendee at a generic convention.  Character cards are bid on as they come into play.  Each character has a set point value and changes the effects of the bids that are used to win the characters.  After each player has a chance to put a character into play, the hands refresh and new characters are dealt into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bids consist of four suits: Stuff, Hobbies, Freakness and Tales.  Certain characters have different effects on the suits that maybe played.  Other cards Stops and Trumps allow to to eliminate rival player's cards or even knock them from the bidding entirely.  Hand management comes into play as your cards do no refresh until everyone has put a character into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game takes approximately 10 minutes to play and is scalable, so the game takes the same amount of time regardless the number of players.  It is pure beer and pretzels and will have future expansions featuring more stereotypical con goers.  The game is best described as 1/3 luck, 1/3 strategy and 1/3 spite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
