			<description>Icebreaker is a 1995 strategy/action video game developed by Magnet Interactive Studios for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer console. Despite the critical acclaim, the game did not sell well (mostly because of 3DO's failure on the 32-bit video game market). Later, the game was also ported to Mac and PC, where it found a similar fate. Icebreaker 2 was created but never released and, until recently, could only be played at creator Andrew Looney's house in a custom built arcade style machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Looney's Icebreaker 2 was made available for the 3DO by Older Games as of August 3, 2007. By December 2007, Older Games had been purchased and is no longer selling the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay consists of the player controlling a sliding white pyramid (named &amp;quot;Dudemeyer&amp;quot; on the readme of the computer version) on an isometric/diametric projection level. The goal of the game is to eliminate the several other types of pyramids (called &amp;quot;dudes&amp;quot; on the readme), some that move and others that don't. Each kind of enemy pyramid has its own weakness and specific form to be destroyed, and a great part of the game's challenge comes from this aspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 150 different levels. A demo version was created which contains 5 representative levels from various parts of the game, and as of early 2008, either still is or recently was available from the website of Andrew Looney's game company Looney Labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Icebreaker (video game), available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
