			<description>Website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;You awaken to another day of misery and confusion, an inmate in the Oakengates Asylum. The prospect of further treatment at the hands of the cruel and uncaring staff terrifies you, yet there is no escape. For you the future is as bleak as the granite walls that you stare at day in, day out. There are others you call friends. All mad of course. You know you are the only really sane person in this horrific place. If only you could convince the Doctor. If only there as a way to make them listen to your tortured pleas, to make them stop, to let you out. But what hope is there... ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is available as a free download from Yog-sothoth.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
