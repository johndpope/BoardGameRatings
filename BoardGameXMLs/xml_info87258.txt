			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colorfever is point scoring game combining a perfect blend of strategy and chance.&lt;br/&gt;You draw tiles, roll the dice, and place your tile accordingly. You score by building strings of tiles horizontally, vertically and diagonally. With every turn comes the chance to draw special tiles that give you extraordinary action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing a tile of one of five colors and then placing it in one of a limited choice of columns based on a die roll. The columns are built from the bottom up, much as in Connect 4. At the end of the game, players will score for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal runs of all-different tiles and all-alike tiles. Several special tiles and board spaces create additional scoring opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
