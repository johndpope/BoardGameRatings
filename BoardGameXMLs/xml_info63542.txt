							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grinding Gear</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this adventure does not drain every drop of your blood, then it will disintegrate you. If it does not disintegrate you, it will electrocute you. If it does not electrocute you, it will starve you. If it does not starve you, it still will defeat you in a battle of wits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You very well may survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But only the best will win the treasure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think you're ready, if you've got the guts, tell your group's referee that you want to test yourself against THE GRINDING GEAR. Then you can answer the question:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are You Good Enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grinding Gear presents a self-contained adventure setting consisting of an abandoned inn and the dungeon below it. It includes over 50 detailed locations, three referee maps, a player handout, plus referee notes and &amp;quot;designer notes&amp;quot; that tie everything together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The print version is a sixteen page adventure booklet surrounded by three detached glossy heavy-stock covers featuring maps, artwork, and the player handout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF version comes with both A4 (36 pages including all notes and maps) and Letter-sized (37 pages) formats, laid out specifically for the PDF format and fully bookmarked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenging. Cruel. Rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grinding Gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For low-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
