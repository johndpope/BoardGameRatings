			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Type-20 is the troop transport from hell. Everything about this unit is geared towards dropping something really nasty off right where you don't want it. A combination of Infiltration and Flight means that Type-20 can really get wherever it wants to go. Along with this, it brings a few painful tricks to make your opponents wince every time they see it on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral Black Sun Warrior Undead &amp;mdash; Lv. 30+&lt;br/&gt;At 4/5 | Dm 4/5 | Df 9 | Ar 2 | LP 15 | Re 10 | Mo 8/12 | AP 3/4&lt;br/&gt;Influence: 1 Uncontrollable: 10+&lt;br/&gt;Availability: Type-020's aren&amp;rsquo;t unique and you may include 1 for every 150 levels available to your party.&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Advanced Deployment, Damage Resistance, Flight, Infiltration.&lt;br/&gt;Decay: At the end of the Maintenance Phase, enemy units within the Type-020's Control Zone lose 1 LP. Effect 14.&lt;br/&gt;oo &amp;mdash; Shadow Wings (Magic, Effect)&lt;br/&gt; Enemy units within the Type-020's Control Zone suffer Blind Lv. 1. Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt;ooo &amp;mdash; Gaunt Wings (Magic, Charge)&lt;br/&gt; +2 Attack. If this Charge causes damage, and the targeted unit doesn't have a larger base than Type-020's, the target is moved from the Type-020 along its line of charge the same distance that the Type-020 charged. This movement doesn't affect intervening units or terrain, so no collisions will result.&lt;br/&gt;oo &amp;mdash; Deployment Wings (Magic, Effect)&lt;br/&gt; Move any number of Undead units, of level 40 or lower, in your party to be within Type-020's Control Zone. Each unit is moved and repositioned separately and may be anywhere within Type-020's Control Zone, though they can't be placed within 2 inches of an enemy unit. This ability can't affect engaged units. Limit: Once per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
