							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Finger Football</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zelosport Finger Football was created around the age-old concept of flicking a folded piece of paper across a tabletop until any portion of the triangle-shaped football hangs over the table's edge for a touchdown. Six points is awarded for the touchdown and the player then kicks an extra point through his opponent's &amp;quot;finger goal posts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zelosport's version has a high gloss, durable, multi-colored playing surface designed very much like a real football field. It's actual size is 2'x4' and fits easily on most kitchen or dining room tables. The back side of the playing surface is covered in a non-slip material allowing the game to be played on most surfaces without constant movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paper football has been replaced by two very different objects. A one inch plastic &amp;quot;slider&amp;quot; with a small ball bearing inside is flicked down the playing surface for runs, passes, touchdowns and 2 point conversions. For kicking field goals, a three inch foam football is included. Also included with the game are two dice used by the defense to determine the play required by the offensive player, 8 rubber washers and a ball marker to mark the line of scrimmage and the score, down and plays completed, as well as a set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
