							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bloody Forks of the Ohio</name>
									
			<description>From the text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New France, a century old, is growing. New forts have been established on Lake Erie&amp;rsquo;s southern shore, in lands long claimed by the Crown. Further inland still, French troops and their friendly allies among the Delaware tribe have made France&amp;rsquo;s commitment to the Ohio country plain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your old enemy Britain has been nosing around, of course, pushing past the Appalachian mountains into sovereign French territory. They had the nerve to build a fort at the very forks of the Ohio, where the Allegheny meets the Monongahela, and you pushed them out and built a better one on top of it.&lt;br/&gt;Fort Duquesne, you&amp;rsquo;ve named it. A formidable piece of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now they are back, making demands and trying to turn the Delaware against you. They want the Forks of the Ohio for themselves, and they are too proud or too stupid to see what they are up against. They are going to be sorely disappointed when you send them back to Virginia with their John Bull tails between their legs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a hack of a hack. The content was written by Jason Morningstar, based very heavily on John Harper&amp;rsquo;s Lady Blackbird which, frankly, does not have enough French dudes in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
