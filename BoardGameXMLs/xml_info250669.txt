							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hitman</name>
									
			<description>Hitman was created by Roman Meilinger as a senior project for Greer Middle College Charter High School in Taylors, SC. Three major companies have caused corruption and crime in Blazer City, and a group of law students have witnessed their crimes and aim to shut the companies down. However, the companies' bosses have hired hitmen to discard of any loose ends that are of risk to their reputation. The game has two different kinds of players with different goals and gameplay. Targets are trying to collect evidence to prosecute companies while they avoid being eliminated by the hitmen. Hitmen try to earn money by eliminating the targets before they are able to prosecute the companies that hired them. Each player is given unique advantages through a contact card that is dealt to them at the beginning of the game, and players must complete dice objectives during the game to perform actions like dueling, interrogating, prosecuting, and lock-picking gates. An alternate version of the game allows hitmen to steal evidence instead of eliminating players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
