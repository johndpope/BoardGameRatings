			<description>Prepare your bags, friends, you are about to start the craziest spending spree in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our hero, 'Money', can not resist the temptation to go shopping, using his 'Excess Card', especially if there are bargains. You just found out about a new basement&lt;br/&gt;of bargains in the world-famous store, Harridges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to help him as he goes down to the basement, buying things like crazy. Take care to spend up to 5% of the limit of your credit, without exceeding it. You can exchange articles for cheaper bargains, after you have bought five items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also meet some of Money's friends and earn an extra living, but beware, he also has enemies, disguised as bargains, who want to end the party and the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy bargain hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From the inlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
