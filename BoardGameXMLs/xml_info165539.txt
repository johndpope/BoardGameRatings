			<description>Remember fondly playing old style platformers, where you didn't have to learn a hundred button combos to play it successfully? Canyon Capers is just for you if that's the case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canyon Capers is a retro style arcade platformer for all ages, created by the authors of the 1992 original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starring DinoJr and his many friends as they venture through the canyons and caverns of ancient ruins in historical locations, to reach the ultimate goal, retrieval of the Golden Mollusk, source of all universal power and a mighty fine trophy at that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a finely tuned difficulty curve, from nice and easy, all the way to rock hard, just like old school platforming used to be. Canyon Capers will make you rely on your wits, your memory and at times, seat of the pants twitch gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Simple to play, hard to master classic retro platform gaming&lt;br/&gt;- 50 levels each with 3 levels of completion, each with many ways to complete... find your best path to fame and riches&lt;br/&gt;- Race to the end, collect all the items and the unique bomb mode levels&lt;br/&gt;- Unlock new characters, each with their own unique abilities as you complete canyons and worlds&lt;br/&gt;- Tongue in cheek nods to your favourite classic retro games&lt;br/&gt;- Tons of secrets and collectibles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
