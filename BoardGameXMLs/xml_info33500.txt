							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peg-Go</name>
									
			<description>A challenging, fast-paced game of pegging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peg-Go is a game where opponents must move all four of their wooden pegs completely around the board and into their home area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blocking and sending opponents back to their start area are part of the game.  Certain die rolls permit exiting the starting area, and once any peg enters one of the four safe zones in the center of the board no other opponent can enter the zone.  Rules for certain moves, passing pegs, and events are outlined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's sort of like Sorry! with cribbage bits, but when playing a four-player game, a partners variant is suggested.  Opponents sit across from one another and are allowed to discuss strategy openly, and to block safety-zones corporately.  Also, the partner may choose to use the count of their roll to get a partner's piece home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
