							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Undead States of America: The Zombie War Card Game</name>
									
			<description>You aren't trying to escape a neighborhood filled with walking dead - that was weeks ago.  This isn't about survival any more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Undead States of America is to gather survivors and hold off the undead masses.  It is up to you to rally refugees, build safe zones and lead your rag-tag forces through a psychological nightmare.  In the end, you will find your army of men, women &amp;amp; children surrounded.  Only then will you learn if you've prepared well enough to secure a future for the human race...  (from the back of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to build a cadre of fellow survivors, giving them a place to stay and supplies.  There are cards for survivors, supplies, military action (even a nuke!), and even for antagonists (used to fight against you).  The winner is who has scored the best after surviving 4 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
