			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galaxy on Fire 2 is the sequel to the iPhone game Galaxy on Fire. The basic gameplay is the same: you are Keith Maxwell, gun for hire. The core of the game is 3d combat-based missions, whether your goal is to destroy all the pirates in a system, escort a convoy, or ferry a celebrity to their destination. But a mysterious and dangerous foe has appeared, and they are using wormhole technology to raid unsuspecting systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you explore the galaxy doing missions for various factions, you can sell the cargo looted from your unfortunate targets on the open market to upgrade your ship and weapons. There are more ship and weapon varieties to choose from than in Galaxy on Fire. Graphics are improved, and 3D sound with English voiceovers is included. But the biggest change is the storyline: instead of taking a back seat as an introduction/tutorial to the gameplay, the storyline in Galaxy on Fire 2 is more extensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
