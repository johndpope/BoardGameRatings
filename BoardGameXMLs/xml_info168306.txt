			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 4-6 characters of level 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblins have been raiding the crops and livestock of &amp;ldquo;Pig&amp;rsquo;s Trotter&amp;rdquo; for the last few weeks now. Nobody knows where they&amp;rsquo;ve come from or what they&amp;rsquo;re doing here but local farmers are sufficiently displeased with their activities to have offered a 200gp reward to have them stopped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sounds like a nice little job for a neophyte group of adventurers out for their first taste of fame and glory. &amp;ldquo;I mean it&amp;rsquo;s just a Goblin-Bash, right? What could possibly go wrong &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Dollar Dungeons are standalone adventures designed to be logical, entertaining, challenging and balanced, and easily integrated into any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure has enough material to last two to three playing sessions and enough experience to raise four characters of the appropriate level up by one extra level. Treasure is commensurate with the encounter challenges faced. Scaling information is included for adventuring parties of five or six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although &amp;quot;The Firemaker&amp;quot; begins in a small village, most of the action takes place underground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
