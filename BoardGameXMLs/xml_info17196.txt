			<description>YOU control your climber up the terrain of this mountain. It's over 2' tall! Special magnetic grippers that you wear on your fingers make contact with your climber's hands. Try to get to smoother paths if you can as flags mark how far you have gone. Position your climber on a hook if you need to plan you next move. But don't wait too long! After three climbs, the player who has climbed the most distance wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
