			<description>In this second set of adventures, we continue the stories that were created in the expansions series created by Milton Bradley.&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure Mentor discovers that Queen Kessandria and Skulmar are planing to resurrect the Witch Lord. Can you get there in time to stop them?&lt;br/&gt;This adventure has new spells for both sides and monster cards were created for all the cool monsters that were introduced in the original story. There is a page for making new doors. This game will take a little work to create but is well worth the effort.&lt;br/&gt;The pages for this adventure are available to download at &amp;quot;Dragonkingdoms.co.uk&amp;quot; and yahoo's group site &amp;quot;HeroQuest-Adventures&amp;quot; for free. You do need to join the group to access the file's section where they are stored. The photo section of this site will allow you to read the story and look at the maps to see if this game is something you would like to play. Your adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
