							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Minotaur (2016)</name>
									
			<description>Four humans have been put to test by the Gods of the Ancient Greece,&lt;br/&gt;they shall face the minotaurs in the labyrinth.&lt;br/&gt;To survive, the must show their wisdom and solve the traps inside the labyrinth,&lt;br/&gt;all while avoiding the minotaurs. Their goal is to reach the last room,&lt;br/&gt;where the exit will be shown and they can finally be free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the classic MS-DOS game &amp;ldquo;The Beast&amp;rdquo;, we have created a game with new graphics and game modes.&lt;br/&gt;Playing The Minotaur you will feel the nostalgia for those old school games where your only goal was to&lt;br/&gt;get as far as possible or the highest score. The game also has full gamepad compatibility,&lt;br/&gt;so do not worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t like playing on keyboard ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minotaur also includes several game modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Arcade:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the classic mode, where the player has to fight his way through 30 levels with increasing difficulty, including different minotaurs, minotaur eggs, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Time Attack:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Arcade, the player needs to finish the level all 30 levels in a certain amount of time. Killing the minotaurs or their eggs will grant extra time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Endless:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think you beat the game, try this mode with the endless levels. Really, this mode never end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One Life&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the untouchable human? Demonstrate that with this mode where you die by one hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Local Co-op:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have trouble defeating the beasts, ask a friend for help! Or a family member, or maybe even your dog can help you. Up to four players, so the more the merrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Local VS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game mode allows the players to fight against themselves. Great for challenging your friends and competing to be the very best, or simply relax by killing your acquaintances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Trials:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will need to find their ways through a series of hand-made levels. Some of them might even have only four blocks to kill the minotaurs (ง︡'-'︠)ง.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Level Editor:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of playing the classic levels? Bored by the challenges? No problem, you will be able to create your own level maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
