			<description>The latest in Krail War-Droid technology is to be tested on the toughest assault course yet built ... The &amp;quot;Cybasphere&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It isn't easy, it would be beyond human ability, but the Metaldrone might just (and only just) make it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the METALDRONE, the latest in a series of war-droids. To test your ability, you have been placed on the Cybasphere Assault Course, an artificial course which consists of 10 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complete a level, you must find a disk, shoot the Cybasphere Leader (the Leader will appear in a certain room on each level from out of a &amp;quot;generator&amp;quot;), pick up the missile disk that he will drop, fire the missile at the level's exit door, and go through to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From the inlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
