							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dropzone Commander Reconquest: Phase 2</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces a brand new mechanic to broaden the gaming experience further - Environmentals. The Environmental Rules include World Conditions, Ecosystems, Random Events and Fauna. These Fauna include fantastic creatures, from Feral Vampires to huge rampaging behemoths, each which has the capability of affecting the battle scene with their presence and activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a new Famous Commander for each race, and a variety of new units too. The previously released units which had experimental rules, now have definitive versions of their rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Reconquest continues, more is in the balance and death and destruction are everywhere...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
