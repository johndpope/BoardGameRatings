			<description>The &amp;quot;Metal Gear&amp;quot; series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 33 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight Complete Games:&lt;br/&gt;METAL GEAR (MSX Version included in Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition)&lt;br/&gt;METAL GEAR 2 (MSX Version included in Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition)&lt;br/&gt;METAL GEAR SOLID 1*&lt;br/&gt;METAL GEAR SOLID 2: HD Edition&lt;br/&gt;METAL GEAR SOLID 3: HD Edition&lt;br/&gt;METAL GEAR SOLID 4: Trophy Edition&lt;br/&gt;METAL GEAR SOLID: Peace Walker HD Edition&lt;br/&gt;METAL GEAR SOLID: VR MISSIONS*&lt;br/&gt;2 Exclusive Ashley Wood Bande Desinee Graphic Novels - Upscaled in HD and released for the first time in North America and Latin America&lt;br/&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;br/&gt;Metal Gear Solid 2&lt;br/&gt;92+ Average Metacritic Rating for all games**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
