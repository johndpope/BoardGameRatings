			<description>One of the Avalon Hill magazines presenting articles and scenarios for Advanced Squad Leader. This one included a center insert for a 'mini-HASL': Gavutu-Tanambogo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Table of Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sand &amp;amp; Blood by Dan Dolan&lt;br/&gt;First to Fight! by Steven Swann&lt;br/&gt;Annual Crossfire: Holding the Rear by Robert Banozic &amp;amp; Mark Nixon&lt;br/&gt;Warriors of the North by Michael Dorosh&lt;br/&gt;First on the Beach by Bleck, Burnett &amp;amp; Martin&lt;br/&gt;Notes to the Troops by Rex A. Martin&lt;br/&gt;Tiger Trap by Rex A. Martin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents also included three island map overlays for Gavutu, Tanambogo and Gaomi to be placed on top of Ocean overlays, 6 page background article, the &amp;quot;Sand &amp;amp; Blood&amp;quot; GT campaign game, 3 regular scenarios (HASL A3, A4, A5), Japanese setup play aid sheet, 2 page After Action Report. These components are due to be reprinted in the new Rising Sun PTO module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of American move into the Solomon islands and Guadalcanal in 1942 called for an attack on Tulagi, an island with a good anchorage and the site of a Japanese seaplane base. Gavutu, Tanambogo and Gaomi are tiny islands off the coast of Tulagi. Between Gavutu and Tanambogo was 300 yard causeway constructed out of concrete and coral. These islands were to be taken in a small part of the main operation against Tulagi. Faulty intelligence had estimated that there were only a &amp;quot;few dozen&amp;quot; construction troops and snipers on these islands. The reality was more like 350 troops including SNLF dug into fortifications and caves. The defenders held out for 31 hours of bitter fighting against an amphibious invasion by the US Marines including suicide charges across a cricket field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;A61 Across the Wire&lt;br/&gt;A62 Paole Zion&lt;br/&gt;A63 Action at Balberkamp&lt;br/&gt;A64 Chateau de Quesnoy&lt;br/&gt;A65 The Dinant Bridgehead&lt;br/&gt;A66 Counterstroke at Stonne&lt;br/&gt;A67 Monte Castello&lt;br/&gt;DA12 Tussle at Thomashof&lt;br/&gt;HA3 Grabbing Gavutu&lt;br/&gt;HA4 Tanambogo Nightmare&lt;br/&gt;HA5 Take Two&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
