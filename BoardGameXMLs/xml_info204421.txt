			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into The Sunset is played in chunks of roleplay called scenes. A scene represents a piece of story that would take about five to ten minutes to play out in a movie. They&amp;rsquo;re shorter than your average roleplaying game scene; while a scene will probably take a little longer to play out in the game than it would take to show on the screen, you want to keep them to about ten or fifteen minutes at the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
