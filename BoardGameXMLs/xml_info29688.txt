			<description>This is the Bill Leeson&amp;acute;s reprint of the English translation of von Tschischwitz game, originally published in 1862. The game asks for at least 3 players, one acting as umpire, of a war scenario set previously by this same umpire. 3 sets of maps are used; one for every team with limited information and an overall one for the umpire with the position of both teams.&lt;br/&gt;The book includes the tables necessary to play as well as a scenario about an invasion of Bohemia. &lt;br/&gt;No verbal communication is allowed for the players, even if in the same team (except to those who are in the same spot); all must be done by means of couriers who bring the messages from one part of the battlefield to another (this is translated as a time delay among the communications of the players)  &lt;br/&gt;The different teams are given a map and a set of troops and some objectives to fulfill, while the umpire keeps good note of the development of both teams.&lt;br/&gt;Basically, the game procedure is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;a)    The umpire states the number of moves to be made&lt;br/&gt;b)    Each commander in succession states what movements he wants to make; the forces are then moved by the umpire&lt;br/&gt;c)    The umpire decides of the success or failure of an attack due to the given tables&lt;br/&gt;d)    Losses are reckoned and noted &lt;br/&gt;So soon the umpire has the movements, no corrections can be made for that same movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
