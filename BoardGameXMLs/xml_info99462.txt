			<description>In this off-the-wall action adventure game, players will experience the wacky world of SpongeBob and some of its most humorous events from the last 10 years. The game also introduces a new and unique morphing capability that turns SpongeBob into unlikely objects like a spatula or sledgehammer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SpongeBob&amp;rsquo;s Truth or Square, players must journey through memorable SpongeBob SquarePants locations to find the missing Krabby Patty formula in time for Krusty Krab&amp;rsquo;s Eleventy Seventh Anniversary. From Jellyfish Fields to downtown Bikini Bottom, players will run, jump, spin and hammer their way through 10 challenging levels. Each level will take players back to a happy SpongeBob SquarePants moment, such as when SpongeBob becomes a fry cook, gets into the Salty Spittoon or meets Sandy for the first time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipped with special morphing abilities, players can transform SpongeBob into bizarre objects--such as the Spatula Slam, Propeller Spin and Sledgehammer Smash--to help him conquer treacherous obstacles and legions of Plankton&amp;rsquo;s robots. Players will also be able to soak up water, hose down enemies, and jump into a bubble gum fling as they navigate their way through an obstacle course of traps. In two-player co-op mode, friends will be able to join in on the action as Plankton to help SpongeBob solve puzzles, unlock new pathways and defeat super-powered creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
