			<description>Buried Treasure is distributed as a ten-page DOC adventure and a one-page image (&amp;quot;Noise on the Roof&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Module summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arnold Parnell is normally a friendly man.  He is balding, short and stocky and his pants ride low on his waist, exposing a perpetual &amp;quot;plumber&amp;rsquo;s crack&amp;quot;.  He enjoys watching sports such as football and boxing with &amp;quot;the boys&amp;quot; down at the local bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arnold is a craftsman by trade.  He has always been good with his hands and currently works as a live-in maintenance man for a small apartment building in the city.  Lately he has felt overworked and underpaid.  He has also been suffering bouts of insomnia and the lack of sleep has made him gruff and irritable.  He was referred to the chapter after several Union-paid therapist visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
