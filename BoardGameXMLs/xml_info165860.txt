							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">General Patton</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Allied leader is more feared than the American general George S. Patton III, commander of the 21st Army. He is a master tactician and has a preternatural sense for combat. Not only is General Patton a dedicated soldier and scholar of warfare, he is also infused with the spirit of an ancient warrior that has lived a dozen times before and has fought in the greatest armies of history including Napoleon's, Hannibal's, and Alexander's. Patton sometimes has vivid flashbacks from these ancient battles, granting him insight into his current situation and providing him with tactical advantages..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is a master swordsman, an Olympic athlete and a ruthless soldier that revels in the glory of victory. He often seems like a man from another era, ill suited to the modern world of media and public opinion, yet he is intimately associated with the grueling horrors of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This file contains all known information on the mighty American general. It includes a summery of his background and tracks his rise through the ranks of the US Army. It also includes a personality description and information on his combat methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This file features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Details on the life and adventures of General George Patton&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure hooks and setting information&lt;br/&gt;     d20 stats for Patton and his gear (including the Patton Saber)&lt;br/&gt;     d20 stats for a new template (ancient warrior spirit)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
