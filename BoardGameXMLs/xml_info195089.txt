			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amallian was an amazing kingdom, with lush forests, amazing coasts, cuddly martial artists, and the best Emperor known. The one downside of living there was the constant infighting of the clans. They not only disagreed about the way the empire was built, but the way they traded with their neighbors, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clans didn't agree on much, but the Emperor decreed that there was to be no open fighting amongst them. This &amp;quot;peace&amp;quot; lasted for many years. Then came the storm of all storms. Sweeping many clans away, the Emperor was lost for solutions &amp;mdash; but then in the Osae Valley, a mist had appeared, and those who entered it were transported to a new land. The Emperor decreed that all clans should venture forth and settle their new empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As they did, the oversight was little to none...which lead to the clans competing for the favor of the Emperor by any means necessary. Now the clans of Amallian race to win the favor of the Emperor by building her Empire, trading goods, and showing the most strength on the other side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Legends of the Mist, you take on the role of a legend from one of the four clans. By rolling dice from your pool, you can work to build the Emperor's new kingdom with new plots, fight to control them, produce goods from them, and gain wealth for your clan and the kingdom. Each die type has a different frequency of letting you perform these actions. The other clans will work to undermine you every now and again and since dice are assigned in secret, your planning and foresight are important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you complete the objectives that the Empress gave you better than anyone else, you will be rewarded as the winner of her favor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
