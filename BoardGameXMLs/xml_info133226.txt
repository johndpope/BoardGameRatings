			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lotus III combines all the best elements of the first two games, introduces a number of new features, and puts the control firmly in the hands of the player. The expanded range of options allows the player to alter the majority of features to suit themselves. As well as all the features brought over from the first two games, crammed in there are five new themed levels, each with it&amp;rsquo;s own unique graphic style, and new features that affect the handling of your car. There is the stunning new Lotus concept car, the M200. This car will never go into production, so this will be the only opportunity you will ever get to &amp;lsquo;drive&amp;rsquo; one. On top of all that lot there&amp;rsquo;s a whole host of new music and sound effects, and loads of new graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most startling addition, however, is the stunning RECS system, which will give you access to a practically infinite number of different tracks. (For the more pedantic among you the actual number is (26^9)x99 -somewhere around ten followed by twenty three noughts.) Just about every other game to feature a track creation system has followed the standard system of including a track editor, which means having to spend maybe an hour or more designing a single track, and then having to save to a data disk, and then physically sending it to anyone who wanted to see your stunning creation. Days, or even weeks, might pass before anyone ever tried your circuits or designs. With Lotus III, each track you design will take as little as a minute, and will generate a code which can then be given to anyone instantly, and they will then be able to play your creation within seconds, and there&amp;rsquo;s no messing around with extra data disks either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
