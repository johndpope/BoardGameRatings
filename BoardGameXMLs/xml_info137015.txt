							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oneonta Domino Whist</name>
									
			<description>This game is a take on Oneonta Whist for 2-7 players.  Like in Oneonta Whist, this game involves precise bidding, and can be played with 2 players and also cooperatively for up to 7 players.  Variant rules for solitaire play are included, but the nature of dominoes makes the solitaire play not as good as that in regular Oneonta Whist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Domino part of the name comes from the game use dominoes or a deck of playing cards that are dominoes.  In this a player would end up leading with a card, and announce which of the two sides is the suit, and the other side is the value in the suit.  Players would follow the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trump suit is determined by flipping over one of the no pip cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, players can bid to take as many tricks as they can take, and lose what they bid if they fail to make it, or make what they bid if they make as many tricks as the bid, and lose one point for each trick more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
