			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two cosmic adventurers are in a tricky scenario and must work together. By rolling and manipulating dice for special abilities and combos, you can be the one that guides them to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liberation Forces are decimated, paving the way for control of the galaxy's Inner Ring. &amp;ldquo;But you promised me a real fight.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, the comm crackles to life, &amp;quot;Commander! Liberation reinforcements are dropping out of hyperspace!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, your playmates have arrived... Now off with you, I'll bring the weapon online.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Twin Stars: Stop the Virus, help a doctor through the care of a fading patient. Control the viruses, stamina &amp;amp; health to survive. You must heal the patient, then survive three days of quarantine to win. If either of you run out of health, you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stop the Virus is a scenario in the Twin Stars solo system by Jason Tagmire and Mike Mullins. The game consists of just 3 cards and players will provide their own dice and coins/tokens. Each scenario comes with 2 all-new characters and can be interchanged with others for a very different gaming experience. This game was originally offered as a stretch goal for Button Shy's Universal Rule Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
