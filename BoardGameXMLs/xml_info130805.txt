							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Proxy Wars: Oath Bound Expansion Set</name>
									
			<description>Proxy Wars is an expandable two-player game in a contemporary but slightly fictional setting. Players represent a battle-ready faction and use their agents to fight for control of a customizable board, which is set up individually each game. To win, agents must occupy valuable tiles worth victory points (VPs) or wipe out enemy agents or do both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proxy Wars is a full-fledged strategy card-based board game, and the game mechanisms include tile-placing (the cards form the board) and deck-building elements. You are to decide how to best deploy your faction's power and agents to outwit your opponent with ingenious cutting, positioning and attacking strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proxy Wars: Oath Bound Expansion Set contains six GreenEngage and five MegaCorp cards as well as scenario cards and a scenario booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
