			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squer is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. The suggested board sizes are between 5x5 and 8x8. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To flip a stone means to replace it with a stone of the opposite color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flipping direction is horizontal for Black and vertical for White.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you must perform exactly one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Maneuver: Place one stone of your color on an empty point and flip all straight lines of contiguous enemy stones along your flipping direction that are adjacent to your placement in that direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Sweep: Flip a straight line of contiguous enemy stones along your flipping direction, provided that said line touches the two opposite board edges of your opponent's color and that you haven't swept that same line on any previous turn of the game. As a reference, a swept line can be marked by placing a stone next to it outside the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win if, at the start of your turn, there's a chain of orthogonally contiguous stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. You also win if, at the end of your turn, there's such a chain on the board and your opponent has no moves available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
