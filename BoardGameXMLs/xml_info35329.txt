			<description>This game was distributed to new VW Jetta owners as a perk. The concept is a competition among the new owner's friends to be the first to have a chance to drive his/her new Jetta. The new owner puts the key at the end of the track, and the first player to get there gets to drive it.&lt;br/&gt;The theme is a tongue-in-cheek look at what it means to be an adult. The movement is spinner-based, with certain spaces causing the player to move forward or backward an additional amount based on text on the board or on drawn cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
