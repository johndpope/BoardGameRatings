							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World Cup Alpine Ski</name>
									
			<description>World Cup Alpine Ski is a print &amp;amp; play, solitaire, statistical replay game on Alpine Ski, featuring individual yearbook for several seasons of the World Cup.&lt;br/&gt;The game permits to replay each event (downhill, Super G, Giant Slalom or Slalom) from that year, and has data for all skiers (both men and women) that got points during that year.&lt;br/&gt;There are two methods of resolution: a very fast one, where for each race you roll three dice for each skier, add his/her racing value, and got a final classification for the race; and a medium complexity one, where you roll for each skier against the average time given for the race (based on historical results) and you get the final classification through the fastest to the slowest ones.&lt;br/&gt;Until now the following Yearbooks have been released: from 1967 to 1988&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
