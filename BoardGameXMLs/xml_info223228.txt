							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ivanhoe</name>
									
			<description>One side of the board has a simple roll and run game. The first player to reach space 120 wins th game. On some spaces events hinder or benefit the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game on the other side of the board can be discribed as &amp;quot;roll, run and collect&amp;quot;. On some spaces the players can collect small cards, worth different amounts of points. If a figure gets on an occupied space it robs the cards the other figure is &amp;quot;carying&amp;quot;. Cards may be brought to safety by using the shortcuts into the caste along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all players are back in the castle, but only if one player has found the card with Ivanhoe's coat of arms. If not, the players have to continue the game till one finds this card and thereby ends the game. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
