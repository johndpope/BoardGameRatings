			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORYThe tale begins in the country of Rughzenhaide, where the main characters Ritona and Princess Selphine live. Rughzenhaide has enjoyed a long era of peace for over 60 years&amp;ndash;until one night, when a raid by an unknown force brings that peace to an abrupt end.&lt;br/&gt;Ritona assumes the role of her Royal Guard and, using her vecktrakravte, narrowly succeeds in escaping the attackers with Princess Selphine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;however, their planned &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; destination is no shelter, but just an uninhabited place in the middle of the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon leaving the forest, they find themselves at Kadia, the capital of the Third Sector of the Outer-Pole&amp;ndash;all the way on the other side of the planet. Out in the Outer-Pole where the mana of the main continent doesn&amp;rsquo;t reach, the locals cannot use manakravte&amp;ndash;instead, the remarkable, hitherto-unknown art dubbed &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; is rapidly advancing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selphine is completely hopeless at navigation, hardly even able to tell left from right. As she wanders through the area, she comes across a lone girl by the name of Rune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As na&amp;iuml;ve and amicable as they both are, the two naturally become instant friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Told that there&amp;rsquo;s something she&amp;rsquo;s like to give them first, Ritona and Selphine decide to wait until noon before leaving the city&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Will Ritona be able to get Selphine back to Rughzenhaide unharmed in the end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
