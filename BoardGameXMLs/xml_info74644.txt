			<description>Introducing the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successor to the Austrian throne survived Sarajevo assassination and became in 1916 the Emperor Franz Ferdinand. Just a few years passed and in Europe it simmer again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the outbreak of the war, Europe is divided into five blocks, which are: Britain and its Allies, the Russian Empire, France and its Allies, Ottoman Empire and Central Powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a modified original map of Europe, close to the state in 1914, but reflecting the development of an imaginary continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key imaginary historical events before the war include the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Britain: In the twenties Britain got into serious conflicts with the Tsarist Russia and left the Triple Entente. From the thirties there was a gradual democratization in the colonies. Scandinavian countries see in the UK its natural protector against expanding Russia and Germany. After the riots in the Iberian Peninsula, Gibraltar outpost spreads to Andalusia and Portugal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Russian Empire: in the late twenties hit the Russian Empire its limits in far Asia. The Grand Duchy of Finland used the growing tension between Russia and Britain to escape from the Russia in early thirties. The abdication of a liberal the Tsar and the emergence new militant faction to power jump-started a new phase of armaments in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;France: After the failed assassination in Sarajevo, it was France who saved by its diplomatic activity the European peace. In the thirties, France tried to create a large Mediterranean Union. South of the Apennine peninsula and Balkan were hit by neoislamic expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the French plan foiled. Against the traditional enemy - Germany - has France built an extensive Maginot Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central Powers: Emperor Franz Ferdinand poured into crusty Austro-Hungarian veins new blood. In early twenties he federalized and modernized Austro-Hungary and in the thirties gradually agreed to trade and customs union with imperial Germany. The economic and military power of Central Powers long dampen expansionary ambitions of neighboring states. The Germans built along the lines with France its own line of defense - Siegfried Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ottoman Empire: the rapid modernization of the Ottoman Empire, launched by the world's thirst for oil, awoke southeast Europe to a new prosperity. Once Europe's sick man rallied by endless supply of black gold. In the late twenties, after a series of smaller conflicts, Ottomans returned to the southern Balkans and Islamic radicalization in the thirties dominate in large areas of northern Africa and even in southern Italy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the Powers thinks only of itself and just like you wants to be the best and win over all. Powers also conclude mutually beneficial agreements, lead diplomatic negotiations to form a military alliances, and so even you can not ignore this part of the game. Occupy all three fields of one power or help push your arch-enemy of its territory. This is not &amp;quot;Ludo&amp;quot;, this is &amp;quot;The War.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your task is to occupy the entire territory of any other power (three fields of one color), while keeping on your own territory at least one pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also win when your arch enemy loses his last piece from his own territory. His loss is your victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
