			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Stand is a game where you play a group of martial artists fighting for their lives. It is meant to be light, action-packed, and fun. Final Stand isn't heavy on setting. It's about cool characters and kick-ass action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Stand is a free, independently published RPG that models martial arts movies. Game play is divided into combat encounters and &amp;quot;fluff&amp;quot; scenes, which are any non-combat portion of the game. The game includes few mechanics for &amp;quot;fluff&amp;quot; scenes, but does include a diceless, purely karma-based skill system for resolving basic non-combat conflicts. Combat, however, is resolved using three dice pools (kicking, punching and throwing), successes from which are spent on various moves available to each character according to martial arts forms chosen at character generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
