Determined to protect the natural world, its followers will resort to any means required to follow the commands of their patron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Descriptions of each divine being, information on their churches, and how they interact with society.&lt;br/&gt;     New Feats:  Cresting Wave, Plant Attunement, Photosynthesis, Spider Senses, and Water Attunement&lt;br/&gt;     New Spells:  Calm Waters, Life Root, Salt Spray, Transmute Earth to Water, Weave Walk&lt;br/&gt;     New Creatures:  Scarecrow and Weave Spider&lt;br/&gt;     All in a compact, printer-friendly PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
