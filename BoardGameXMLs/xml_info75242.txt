			<description>From Wikipedia with some User Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures: ACME All-Stars is the second Tiny Toon Adventures-based game released on the Mega Drive/Genesis, released in 1994, and developed and published by Konami. It is also the final Tiny Toons game released by Konami. All Tiny Toons releases after this point were developed by Terraglyph Interactive Studios. This is also the first Tiny Toons game to attract a rating, using Sega's US-only VRC ratings system the game attracted a GA (General Audiences) rating. See the VGG page for more information on this rating system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very similar to a pair of Tiny Toon Adventures games released on both the Super NES and the Game Boy, ACME All-Stars is a sports title that allows the player to make a team out of a bunch of characters from the show, which include Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck, Hamton J. Pig, Montana Max, Elmyra Duff, Shirley the Loon, Fifi Le Fume, Calamity Coyote, Little Beeper, Furrball and Dizzy Devil. Players can choose between basketball or soccer and can even choose the setting. There are other events players can participate in including obstacle race, bowling, and Monty bashing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
