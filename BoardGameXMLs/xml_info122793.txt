							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poor Brendan&#039;s Almanac</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why does a game whose original publisher has been non-existent for almost twenty years need a supplement?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the materials included in this supplement seemed (to me, anyway) obviously lacking in the original DragonQuest game, and were practically begging to be written up. Other items came about as the course of several campaigns progressed, and rules were needed for things which DragonQuest did not cover. Poor Brendan&amp;rsquo;s Almanac was developed out of a set of in-house rules and modifications to DragonQuest (2nd Edition) used in several campaigns going back as far as 1981. Although it has existed in a fairly fixed form for nearly 10 years, it is only relatively recently that a reasonable means of distributing it (namely the Internet) has been broadly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DragonQuest community on the Internet has developed into a small but devoted core of players and GMs. This supplement is dedicated to all of you who have contributed to the DragonQuest Newsletter, or written to WebRPG or the dqn-list or one of the other DragonQuest discussion forums or newsgroups. Your presence and continued support for DragonQuest makes it worthwhile to produce this project. Some material in this supplement has been previously distributed through the DragonQuest Newsletter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two versions of Poor Brendan&amp;rsquo;s Almanac will be available. This one is a smaller file with lower-resolution images. A second file with higher resolution images (suitable for making a laser printed copy of the book) will also be produced. Both files are machine-readable with Adobe Acrobat software. We have tried, as much as has been possible, to reproduce the look-and-feel of an SPI supplement, as well as making the content follow in the spirit and style of the original DragonQuest game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the original DragonQuest game itself, there is nothing to keep there from being a future Second Edition of Poor Brendan&amp;rsquo;s Almanac. Feedback and commentary are the best ways to work out the bugs and to help make this more useful for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully, you will find this a useful addition to the DragonQuest rules and use it in your campaigns. Please feel free to print out and distribute copies of this supplement to other DragonQuest players, within the extent of acceptable use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fan-created effort was distributed for free on the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
