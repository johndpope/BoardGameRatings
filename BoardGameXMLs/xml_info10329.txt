			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing that has always bothered me was the predominance of wargames that espoused some sort of resolution that fell far short of complete annihilation. So I've done something about that -- &amp;quot;die! Die! DIE! The Family Game of Genocidal Warfare!&amp;quot; is here! &amp;quot;die! Die! DIE!&amp;quot; is The Family Game of Genocidal Warfare. Players build empires and advance their technology in an effort to smash the others into the dust. The board is customizable each game, and almost infinitely expandable. Using mechanics that are basic and elemental, the game proceeds at a breakneck pace to the end, with piles of bodies in every direction. The perfect game for a Sunday night around the dinner table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a beautifully rendered color version, and a more inexpensively rendered b&amp;amp;w edition (so as to show pity on your printer!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.teamfrog.com/diediedie.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.teamfrog.com/diediedie.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
