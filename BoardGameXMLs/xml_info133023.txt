							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">We are all Star Stuff (...Literally)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the immortal words of Carl Sagan, we are all star stuff. In this roleplaying game, the players take on the role of a star. You are not playing a rock star, not a movie star, nor a reality tv star. You are playing a ball of burning gas, roaming the skies in search of adventure and perhaps some cosmic hijinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning, there was a flash. Someone might or might not have said something about light along the way. Clouds of swirling gases fell upon themselves in the universal cr&amp;egrave;che, igniting the hellfire engine to millions of protostar hearts, pumping Hydrogen and Helium, Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. Small brigands of young stars fell in and out of love in the early open clusters. As the stars matured, they founded settlements and globular clusters began to form throughout the universe. The settlements grew into the galaxies that shine through the bleak background of space, calling out to lonely stars everywhere to join in on the revelry. Tales of yesterday and prophecies of tomorrow are spun around the nebulae, gathering place for a quick bit of rest, relaxation, and gaseous pick-me-up to for that burning fusion engine in the pit of every star's stomach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
