							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MelodieXpress Rhythm Deck</name>
									
			<description>The MelodieXpress Rhythm Deck provides a sneak peak at the next expansion for the MelodieXpress family of games. The 52 card deck showcases some of the new cards available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhythm Deck Contents&lt;br/&gt;The MelodieXpress Rhythm Deck includes playing cards based around music notation as the basis for games and activities. The deck includes cards for a range of notes &amp;ndash;quavers, crotchets, semibreves and minims; dotted crotchets and dotted semibreves; along with doublet and triplet crotchets and doublet, triplet and quadruplet quavers. It also includes the corresponding rests for quaver, crotchet, semibreve and minim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card designs differ from the earlier decks. As the cards focus upon elements of rhythm, the notes are depicted on a plain background without staff lines. This allows players to visually focus upon the individual note values rather than positioning against the staff to discern the pitch of the notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games&lt;br/&gt;The MelodieXpress Rhythm Deck provides a set of cards only. The cards may be used with the games from the MelodieXpress Note Reading and Composing Music packs. &amp;lsquo;Snap&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Memory&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Rows&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Rhythm Lunch&amp;rsquo; all work well with this deck &amp;ndash; though the players focus upon matching the note duration rather than its pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next Steps&lt;br/&gt;This deck provides fans with an early look at some of the cards which will be used in the upcoming MelodieXpress Rhythm Pack. This will include a further 150+ cards which can be integrated with this Rhythm Deck, along with a 16 page game guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MelodieXpress System&lt;br/&gt;MelodieXpress is a fun, educational and easy way to learn to read music. Using the approach that we learn best through play, MelodieXpress uses games and activities to introduce the key concepts of musical notation and music theory. This step-by-step approach allows you to learn at your own pace, while the games provide an enjoyable way to learn and consolidate your knowledge of music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
