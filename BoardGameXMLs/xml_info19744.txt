			<description>Spirit Racing and Entertainments were a small UK publisher in the seventies and early eighties based in Croydon, Surrey which transformed into the Spirit Games shops in Burton-on-Trent (they have three shops on one street!).  There is no credited designer or year stated on the Star Search box, board or rules .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;The object of each player is to fly his spaceship from his launch site to his planet and back, without running out of Main Jet or Manoeuvre Jet fuel.  The first to arrive back is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
