							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pause Ahead</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A challenging platformer game with lots of traps and saws and obstacles and pits and spikes. But this game has a twist. You can pause time. While time is paused you keep your momentum, and are invulnerable to threats. But when you unpause time if you are on or above on obstacle that will kill you, you won't be long for the world. Oh, and there is a time limit too. And you only have a limited number of pauses that you can utilize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
