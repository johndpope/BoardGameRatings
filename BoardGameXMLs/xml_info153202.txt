							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dragon Mage: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another burnt ruins is all that remains of your passing. Another who doubted your pride, your power, has been left in the ashes. You are the Dragon, and none shall doubt you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Mage is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game, and the second of my Mage Revised series. The Mage is one of the most popular playbooks I have ever written, but it has its flaws - the class is too open ended, and is generally capable of solving problems on a larger scope than any other class can really confront. My solution was to pare down the class into multiple different classes, each built around a single Spell Focus. This class is a reimagining of a Mage with Spell Focus: The Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Mage is all about the power and fury of the dragons. You emulate them, mimick them, and in some ways, you may even surpass them. The Dragon Mage gives in to their inner bloodline, their draconic heritage, to gain Blaze, which they spend to mimick dragons - gaining their hardened scales, their powerful wings, or their mighty claws, for just a few moments. As they advance, they gain new options to spend Blaze on, and can even gain some of their options permanently. And, of course, they can set anything they want on fire, whenever they need to. But be wary - the mighty power of dragons is balanced by mighty desires. The Dragon Mage has powerful Dragon's Desires that can lead them into trouble, for the sake of power and riches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
