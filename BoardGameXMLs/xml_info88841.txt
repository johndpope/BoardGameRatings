			<description>The Smurfs are busy having a wonderful time.  Can you match up all your cards to their happy activities?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple game (recommended for ages 4-8) of matching colours and symbols.  Each player has a hand of five cards which they must match to the corresponding spaces on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin a spinner to determine what colour card they can play and then attempt to match the symbol on their card to a space on the board.  If they have no card of the appropriate colour they must draw from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to play all their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
