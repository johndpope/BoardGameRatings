							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pool Game</name>
									
			<description>The Pool Game is an promotional game made by the Fox Pool company.  The goal of the game is to build an in-ground swimming pool at one of four houses.  The mechanics are an extremely basic roll-and-move, with the only variety granted by Pool Cards, which mostly just cause the player to lose or gain a turn.  Some of the topics covered are extremely technical, such as spaces that read things like &amp;quot;Set network of reinforcing rods on backfill rods. Support deck, not backfill soil.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
