			<description>A One-Round Living Jungle Adventure for High Level Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another year has gone by, and once again you have attended the annual council of tribes at the village of Big Chief Bagoomba. This year you won many honors, as you should, since you are some of the most famous heroes of the whole jungle. This year also had something different. For a change, Bengoukee did not have a mission for you. Instead, you saw him harassing a group of less experienced heroes, those more likely to view him with awe. Not that you don't respect Bengoukee, but now that you have some experience, you realize that much of what he does is for show. Of course, for him it works. Showmanship is always better when backed by lots of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are heading towards your respective villages, and have agreed to travel together for a while. You are nearing the village of the Katimaya, certainly not a dangerous place. Then you hear the scream of terror coming from high in the trees ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
