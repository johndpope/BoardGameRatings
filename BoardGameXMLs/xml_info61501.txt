			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness Falls on Ceranir!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, the academy and fortress of Ceranir has kept the lands safe, but when no help emerged in the face of a terrible undead attack on the village of Erburg, the locals have become frightened and disturbed by the apparent silence from their protectors. Those messengers who have returned bring stories of an eerie silence, and no means to enter. It falls to a band of local heroes to solve the mystery of Ceranir and find out just what exactly happened to this famous stronghold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from Ceranir is the sixth installment of the Bleeding Edge Adventures, bringing thrilling combat, engaging NPCs, and dynamic environments straight to your 3rd Era games. While this adventure may seem like any other dungeon crawl, it has a twist, for those who enter have the hardest time getting out. Inside this adventure, you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A sprawling fortress consisting of more than 40 rooms.&lt;br/&gt;     Exciting combats featuring deadly opponents and vicious traps.&lt;br/&gt;     New monsters including the wand-wielding arakai and the ravenous rot monster.&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded stat-blocks to make running the adventure even easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some secrets are best left undisturbed and nowhere is this truer than with the citadel of Ceranir. Can the adventurers uncover what tragedy befell the place, survive the perils of the complex, and escape its clutches to tell the tale? All the answers and more lay within Escape from Ceranir!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
