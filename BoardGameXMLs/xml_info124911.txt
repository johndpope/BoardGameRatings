			<description>Footchess is a board game that simulates a soccer match. In order to win it you will need vision, strategy and some luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 players divided in two teams move around a chess-like board, looking for open passing lines and a chance to score goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts is turn by rolling the dice in order to know is action points. Then he can spend his actions points passing the ball, moving players, intercepting the ball from the opponent or shooting the ball on goal. When the player uses all his action points the turn is over and the player picks a card from the deck. Some cards improve player skills, others are not so good and players can even be injured or kicked out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all 40 cards have been picked.&lt;br/&gt;In case of a draw the game continues until one of the teams score the winning goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
