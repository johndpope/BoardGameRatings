			<description>In Gaburu (ガブル), two players face off, with each starting with a supply of twenty tiles, some numbered and some with symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of three tiles visible to them, and they take turns placing a tile standing up in the closest empty space of one of the columns on the 8x5 board &amp;mdash; with the columns having five spaces in them &amp;mdash; then refills their hand to three tiles. When the player's tiles meet in a column, they then lay those tiles face up to reveal them and determine who won that column. The first player to win three adjacent columns or five columns overall wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
