							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chroma Roll</name>
									
			<description>Chroma Roll is an abstract dice-rolling game that consists of 29 clear rings and 54 tokens in three colors (red, blue and green).  The tokens and rings are placed on a hexagonal grid before the start of the game, with rings sitting alone on a space or in stacks of two or three, and tokens randomly placed in stacks of three on spots on the game board. Hexes on the board have colored edges (in red, green or blue). Rings are moved by rolling three dice (also in red, green and blue) and moving the rings by selecting a die of a particular color and moving a ring over the hex edges of the same color as many hexes as the die shows (1-6). The object of the game is to collect colored tokens in sets, scoring points at the end of the game for each set collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
