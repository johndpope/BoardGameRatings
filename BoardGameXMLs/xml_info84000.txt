A man from the 30th century kidnaps Dino and Hoppy, the two pets the Flintstones and the Rubbles. Dino belongs to Fred and Wilma, and Hoppy is the pet of Barney and Betty. Fred's alien friend, Gazoo, lost parts of his time machine due to the evil man from the future. Gazoo is only visible to Fred. With each stage Fred completes, he earns back another piece of the time machine, and Gazoo wields together the pieces progressively. Throughout the stages, Fred runs into Wilma, Barney, Betty, as well as George Jetson in the future stage. Fred has to defeat a boss at each stage. At the end of the map, he gets the last piece and travels to the future, where he has to defeat the man from the 30th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp;amp; Hoppy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
