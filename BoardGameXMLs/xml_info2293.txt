			<description>Heisse Karten, or Hot Cards, is played with a deck of cards showing the numbers 1-48, with even numbers in black (positive points) and odd numbers in red (negative points). Cards are played in a series of tricks, with the highest black card always taking a trick. The highest numbered red card also takes a trick if only red cards are played. Players need not follow &amp;quot;suit.&amp;quot; Cards - both negative and positive - are actually worth their face value at the end of the game, with the highest scoring player (after deducting negative points from positive points) the winner. The 48 cards in this older German game each have unique artwork with the numbers incorporated into fanciful, colorful animal drawings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
