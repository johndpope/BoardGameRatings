							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flooded Town</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long and hard rain showers combined with melting snow have caused numerous creeks, rivers and even lakes to leave their usual beds. Their water has among other things flooded this town. While some roads and houses are about to disappear into the floods others are lucky enough to be situated on high ground. In some areas only rooftops and the crowns of trees peek out of the water. The building in other houses are untouched as of yet. At least for now they are save. Of course if the water keeps rising only a feet or two separate these as of yet unaffected neighborhoods from disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
