			<description>A fascinating educational game that tells you all about the ecology and life history of our extraordinary Australian frogs (description from the back of the game board)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a roll and move.  On about every third space there are instructions to follow (eg &amp;quot;Hot weather.  Have a rest. Miss a turn.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Jump for joy.  You have found a mate already.  Advance to 'Egg-laying lilypad.'&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;DANGER  You are eaten by a yabbie.  Return to start.&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the instructions are to take a &amp;quot;Tadpole&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Frog&amp;quot; card.  These cards have a similar range of penalties and benefits as the board spaces with instructions.  The frog cards are much larger than the tadpole cards, in full colour and include some factual information about frogs on them.  A couple require the player to imitate a frog's call (described on the card) to receive the benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two places where players get a choice of paths but other than that there is no choice in movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
