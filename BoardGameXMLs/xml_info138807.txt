			<description>'Look and Learn' (English name) is designed to stimulate a child's ability to &amp;quot;discriminate between objects, to compare them, to grasp relationships between them, and to sort according to common characteristics.&amp;quot; (From the box bottom.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to seven different games are possible using the multi-picture boards and picture tiles included. Three of them are described here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Picture lotto&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a player board. Boards that aren't needed and the corresponding tiles are removed from the game. The remaining tiles are shuffled and placed on the table, colour side up. The game master picks up one tile after the other, shows the picture and names the pictured object. The player whose board contains the same picture calls out, gets the tile and places it on his/her board. The first player to have covered all the images on his/her board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Picture quiz&lt;br/&gt;The game master shows a picture without naming it. The player who has the picture on his/her board calls out, but they only get the tile if they can name the object. The opposite way is possible too: The game master doesn't show the picture but names the object shown on the tile. The player who finds the picture on his/her board gets the tile. The first player to have covered all the images on his/her board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Memory lotto&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a board. He/she gets 30 seconds to memorise the images. Then the player boards are placed on the table, face down. The game master picks up one tile after the other and shows the image or names the object. The player who thinks the image is on his/her own player board calls out. The tile is placed face up next to the player board. If two players call out simultaneously, the game master puts the tile at the bottom of his/her stack. If an image isn't claimed by any of the players, the tile is removed from the game. When the game master has used all the tiles, the players reveal their boards. For each matching tile, they get two points; for each incorrect or missing one, one point is subtracted. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More game variations are possible using the different colors on the backs of the picture tiles and multi-picture boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box indicates that it was &amp;quot;Made in Western-Germany&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
