			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 10,000 Random Rolls series...provides sheets containing ten thousand rolls of the named die or dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who would want such a thing, when they can just roll some dice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Maybe when you GM, you don't always want to let on that you're making a roll. The sound of you crossing off a number from the list might just be you making a note of something, but the sound of dice clattering is a dead giveaway of a roll.&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Maybe you have terrible luck, or thing your dice are cursed (despite that time you microwaved the one that kept fumbling, as a warning to the others).&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Maybe you have an allergy to polyhedrons.&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Maybe you just like looking at lists of random numbers &amp;ndash; I'm not here to judge.&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Maybe there's another reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Provides summed results of 10,000 3d6 rolls (e.g., all numbers are 3 through 18.  Numbers are formatted in six columns per page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
