			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The neon signs flicker on, one after the other, advertising cheap beer. They wink to each other like oversized, gaudy fireflies, and then they stay lit, beckoning the people in from the outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basement of the bar, a rat wanders into the gap between worlds. Water rises around it, and it vanishes, consumed by the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind the bar, a woman runs her fingers over a series of carvings in the wood. They are already becoming worn and smooth. Tomorrow night, she will deepen them with a special knife. The carvings remind the spirit of the river of its bargain. They remind the spirit of the building of its job. They remind the pack that runs the bar of the importance of its territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She tenses. The spirit of the building is behind her. She shuts her eyes tight, and for a moment, gives in to the urge it creates in her. &amp;ldquo;Sometimes I think about eating someone,&amp;rdquo; she whispers. &amp;ldquo;Changing, chasing someone down, and eating him in an alley.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know,&amp;rdquo; says the spirit. &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t tell.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wolf wearing the form of a man flips the &amp;ldquo;Closed&amp;rdquo; sign around. Shy&amp;rsquo;s Kill is open for business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Collection of Horrors is an anthology of Storyteller tools inspired by the Horror Recognition Guide that you can either use in conjunction with the Guide or as part of your existing Hunter: The Vigil chronicle. You can get a free introduction here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each story kit in the Collection of Horrors (which you can buy individually, as a bundle or as a subscription) contains variety of appropriate tools; usually an SAS scene, a character with a character sheet, and props ranging from maps and reports to print out and hand to your players, to short imbedded audio files that you can play at your gaming table. These kits represent a collection of evocative story tools that you can write a story around, drop into an existing SAS or even string together. They aren&amp;rsquo;t stories in their own right, but rather pieces that you can snap together into whatever shape you want. Using the Guide can add even more props and ideas to this anthology, but it&amp;rsquo;s not required to use the various story kits in the Collection of Horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
