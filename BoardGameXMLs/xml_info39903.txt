							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Multzo</name>
									
			<description>Multzo, a game for 2-5 players, uses the 24 tiles and 24 coins from a piecepack. (The four dice and four pawns are not used.) It is in the family of Poker and other vying card  games. But it doesn't require cash to be interesting. Players try to gain groups of tiles with the highest value, and there are four different ways to determine the best group (and up to four winners!) each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
