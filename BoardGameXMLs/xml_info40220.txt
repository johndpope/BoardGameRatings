							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bringing Up Father Game</name>
									
			<description>George McManus' Bringing Up Father (a.k.a. Maggie And Jiggs) was a very popular newspaper strip of the early 20th century. This is a simple race game based on the strip, for up to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strip centered around Jiggs, an Irishman who comes into wealth in the United States. Even so, he still wants to keep his old pals and eat corned beef and cabbage at Dinty Moore's tavern, much to the consternation of his bourgeois wife, Maggie. The constant warfare between them is the source of much of the humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features the strip's characters as playing pieces and their surroundings as the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
