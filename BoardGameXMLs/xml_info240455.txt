							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Isle of Captain Vale</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of adventurers stumbles upon a mysterious island that doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear on maps and is surrounded by both colorful mist and poisoned waters. One thing is known: There&amp;rsquo;s treasure here. But what else lies on Vale&amp;rsquo;s Isle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Isle of Captain Vale is an original adventure in the Sword Coast setting of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. It is meant for use with D&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;s fifth edition rules, and it is intended for three or more 2nd-level player characters. By the end of the adventure, players reach 3rd level and obtain some magic items. It can be adapted to fit almost any setting if necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was written as the second installment in a loosely connected, three-part story, starting with The Storm to Come and ending with The Plight of Palmwood (coming soon!), which are penned by the same writer. DMs do not need to use any of the adventures as part of the same story if they do not want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Isle of Captain Vale is mostly an exploration adventure with combat elements set on a secluded, lost island. In the context of the three-part story, the party of PCs are responding to a call for adventurers from Palmwood, a resort island town about 500 miles off the Sword Coast. However, their ship was sabotaged while en route in The Storm to Come by a woman searching for Vale&amp;rsquo;s Isle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure relies heavily on the cunning and ingenuity of the PCs. Some of the monsters encountered on the island will be far too powerful for the PCs to fight at such low levels, so they&amp;rsquo;ll have to figure out creative ways to deal with the problems that arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
