			<description>Parli-cards is a curious blend of trivia and traditional card games. Included are two decks that feature portraits of the current (for 2011) Senate, two decks of easy and hard trivia questions, four bags of different color bingo chips and a hardback gameboard depicting the United States with the electoral votes marked on each state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several games are outlined that parallel rummy, war and poker (but are called POTUS, Filibuster and Veto). Can also be played as a straight trivia game. The games incorporate the senators in play too. For instance, the poker variant holds a full house with senators from the same state in higher rank than a full house that does not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apparently there is also a version that features all the presidents and vice presidents with appropriate trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
