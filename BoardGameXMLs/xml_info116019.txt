			<description>That's Life! was a magazine-style television series on BBC1 which aired from 1973 to 1994, presented by Esther Rantzen (1940 - ) throughout the entire run. Esther features on the box for this game. The show concerned itself with consumer problems and complaints and this theme is addressed in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to acquire a Bath, a TV Set, a Cooker, a Car and a Footballing Dog for their home. (That is right, I did say a Footballing Dog - the show often featured viewer's pets that were rather unusual).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board in order to try to obtain the items. There are the usual squares, such as trade squares (players can trade amongst themselves if they wish).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out! If you sell a leaky bath or a broken-down car,you could be put in the hot seat by Esther. Esther can Be called in to expose the rogue traders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;1 Game Board.&lt;br/&gt;4 Playing Pieces.&lt;br/&gt;4 Sets of Pieces(Bath,TV Set,Cooker,Dog and Car).&lt;br/&gt;1 Pack of Service Cards.&lt;br/&gt;1 TV Camera Piece&lt;br/&gt;1 Die&lt;br/&gt;Rules Are Printed on Inner Box Base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
