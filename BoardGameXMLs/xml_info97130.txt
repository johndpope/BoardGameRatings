			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quick-Start Rules Guide contains details of the core system for the homebrew LARP game Werewolf: The Lament of Gaia. It assumes knowledge of Werewolf: The Apocalypse, specifically citing the 2nd edition core rulebook as a source (the current core rules at the time this was written).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was designed for a game that was to be run in England, and thus the range of allowable Garou tribes is limited to those that the designer considered to be active in this country (Fianna, Bone Gnawers, Glass Walkers, Silver Fangs, Children of Gaia) and breeds were restricted to only Homid or Metis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
