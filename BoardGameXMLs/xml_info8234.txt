							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rhumb Line</name>
									
			<description>Rhumb Line is a sailing race game from Newport to Tortola. This game comes in a tube measuring 20&amp;quot; long with diameter of 2 1/2&amp;quot; and uses  a laminated map for a playing surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to race from Newport, Rhode Island to Tortola, British Virgin Islands. Players will roll one die for each move. Some moves will place the player on spaces that will indicate certain penalties. Some spaces will require the player to draw a chance card which will produce benefits or penalties. Other spaces will provide the opportunity to roll again if a nautical trivia question is answered correctly. The first player to reach the destination on an exact roll of the die will win the race and the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
