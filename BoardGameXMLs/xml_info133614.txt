							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atomic Submarine: Up Scope!</name>
									
			<description>This is a vintage 1950s dexterity game with a submarine warfare theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;gimmick&amp;quot; is a combination periscope/torpedo launcher that functions like an actual sub! Stand-up cardboard models of enemy ships are set up on a large triangular board decorated with ocean graphics. The sub commander looks through the mirrored periscope device (viewing down, not up, of course!) to target the enemy ships. The device contains two torpedo launchers with spring-loaded triggers. The torpedo looks like a plastic dart from a vintage dart pistol, but without the rubber tip. When the sub commander has the enemy in sight, he pulls the trigger and launches the torpedo. Scoring is based on the target value of the ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the periscope/launcher device, ships, torpedo darts, ocean board, and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
