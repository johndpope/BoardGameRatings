			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This second volume in the Spellbinder's Sourcebook series contains 50 arcane spells of dark and destructive power. Half of these spells are brand new and the other half are selected from Bloodstone's other publications, such as the Hero's Handbook. The transmutations and evocations in this collection have been selected for their impressive effects and broad utility. They are guaranteed to bring fresh and exciting new options to your d20 game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spellbinder's Sourcebook II contains 25 new arcane spells such as cry of damnation and blood sweat and tears, which causes subjects to suffer from bleeding, fatigue, and blurred vision. This volume also features new spells like speed of the wind and goblin horde for casters that prefer a more indirect method of defeating their enemies. There are also utility spells in this volume such as diminish and speed of the wind, which can assist a group of adventurers in many different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume II of the Spellbinder's Sourcebook also contains 25 of the most creative and interesting spells from the Hero's Handbook and the Book of Broken Dreams, all presented in d20 3.5 format. Useful and impressive incantations such as abyssal vortex, snow blind, and storm door have been re-edited and are included for your gaming pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the spells featured in this collection are transmutations, but there are also quite a few evocations as well. Several illusion and conjuration spells can also be found in this book along with a few spells from other schools such as necromancy and divination. There are spells that alter the subject's body, such as ooze form, and spells that alter the functions or abilities of objects, such as grappling rope and awaken object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
