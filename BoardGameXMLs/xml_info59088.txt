			<description>March of War is a game of fantasy combat between distinct racial armies for between two and four players. Each player commands one of the armies in an attempt to conquer his foes in an ultimate bid to best the opposing player's generals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are represented by square tiles, which list the unit's combat strength in each direction, as well as any special abilities the unit may possess. Players attempt to place their tiles in key positions to bolster their own defenses while trying to maximize their position against their opponents tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a number of action points to spend on his turn. These action points allow the player to perform such actions as playing new tiles, initiating combat, activating special tile abilities, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat between tiles always results in at least one tile being removed from the board. When this occurs, other tiles &amp;quot;march&amp;quot; in to fill the gap, potentially moving tiles closer or farther away from their targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The victor is the last player with a general in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
