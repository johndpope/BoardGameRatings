							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Duke: Middle Ages Siege Engines Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This expansion to the The Duke core game adds additional siege engine tiles as well as an engineer to utilize the siege engines to their full potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players lay the five tiles from the expansion pack on the side of the board, then start a standard game. Whenever a player pulls one of the five tiles noted below, they can choose at the moment to replace the drawn tile with the appropriate tile from this expansion pack. If the player decides not to replace the tile, he cannot replace the tile at any future time. Yes, this means a single player could have all five tiles on their side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These tiles replace the following tiles in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battering Ram = Marshal&lt;br/&gt;Trebuchet = Knight&lt;br/&gt;Catapult = General&lt;br/&gt;Ballista = Priest&lt;br/&gt;Engineer = Oracle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several new icons introduced with this expansion; Smash, Hammer, Area-Effect, and Non-capturing Move/Jump icons. Additionally, two new Enhanced Abilities are added, Redeploy (V) and Link (VI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
