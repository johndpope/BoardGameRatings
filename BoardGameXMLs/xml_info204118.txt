							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blackrock Brothers Abroad</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though moral turpitude is one of the defining characteristics of hill giant nature, there are still a few rules that all hill giants follow; rules like &amp;quot;The Clan Chief is Always Right&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Don't Throw Boulders at the Shaman While He's Meditating&amp;quot;.  These simple codes of  conduct allow the members of a hill giant clan to live together, if not in harmony, at least in partially controlled anarchy.  In this respect, the Blackrock clan was much the same as any other hill giant tribe, and like other tribes there were some members that were less inclined to follow the rules than others.  In the Blackrock clan, the prime troublemakers were the brothers Snagtooth and Bearbreath, named for their distinctive dental features and culinary tastes respectively.  Ever since they were old enough to throw rocks, these two had been a plague on the rest of the clan.  Even other hill giants considered them to be lazy, bothersome pests.  It came as no surprise then when they were caught breaking the tribe's most sacrosanct rule: &amp;quot;Never Steal the Clan Chief's Favorite Club&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For characters of 3rd - 5th level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
