							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creatures of Barsaive (Pathfinder Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fearsome and Fascinating!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The contents of this book have been transcribed from the speaking of Vasdenjas, a most noble and intelligent dragon. I have written down his words almost without alteration, as I found his rambling style of speaking most entertaining.&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;Tiabdjin the Knower, Scribe and Scholar of the Great Libray of Throal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Horrors are not the only threat to those who travel across Barsaive. The wild creatures of the land, some twisted by the Scourge into living nightmares, pose many dangers to the adventurer unlucky enough to cross their path. The beautiful death moth, with its fatal sting... the fierce pangolus, whose claws can disembowel a troll with a single stroke... the hell hound, whose magical fire burns everything it touches... all these creatures and more may be the death of the unwary adventurer unless he can defeat them in the pursuit of his quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures of Barsaive describes fifty of the most fearsome and fascinating creatures in the province of Barsaive, bringing them to life with a wealth of detail and beautiful illustrations. Told from the point of view of a great dragon, Creatures of Barsaive also offers some insight into that mysterious and powerful species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires use of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and Earthdawn Game Master's Guide (Pathfinder Edition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
