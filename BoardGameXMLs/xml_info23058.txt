			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaction, The Game of Molecules, is a card game that lets you flex your intellectual muscle. Science geeks and regular folk alike will enjoy Reaction's fast pace and competitive spirit, along with the high-quality components. &lt;br/&gt;To win, be the first to build the most molecules from the element cards you hold in your hand, and score the most points. It's that simple!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing cards until they can create molecules from the element cards in hand. When a player can build a molecule, they lay it out in front of them on the table. Opponents can add onto the molecule to turn it into a different molecule, or they can destroy it with a Bunsen Burner card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to run out of cards and also score the highest number of points from the molecules they created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaction includes the following high-quality components: &lt;br/&gt;-- 100 unique clear plastic playing cards&lt;br/&gt;-- A dry erase marker to &amp;quot;multiply&amp;quot; elements when creating complex molecules&lt;br/&gt;-- Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;-- Helpful chart of common Molecules to make the game easy to play for everyone&lt;br/&gt;-- High-quality outer box to store all items within&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For two or more players, ages 8 and up. Created, designed and marketed in USA. Printed in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
