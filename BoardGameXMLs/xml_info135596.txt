			<description>Simple luck-based game for the very young. The game consists of 6 dice cards, numbered 1-6, 72 luck cards and a die. The luck cards are distributed onto the dice cards. The active player rolls the die and picks a luck card from the corresponding stack, then follows the instructions (receive or give gold or pitch). If a player gives out gold or bad luck, s/he can choose the recipient. After two stacks have been emptied, the player with the highest postive difference between gold and pitch is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;No individual designer is credited. The games was designed and published by a handicapped people's workshop in Germany and is based on one of Grimm's fairy tales, Mother Hulda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
