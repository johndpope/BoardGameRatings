			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As parties of adventurers roam the globe in search of treasure, not everything they find will be gold, silver, or precious gems. Sometimes the party will come across more mundane, yet still valuable, commodities that are bought and sold every day and help keep the world economies going. How do you determine what the value of a pan flute, or a silver mirror should be? If a party should liberate a cart of bath oil from an unsuspecting merchant, what price will they get when they sell it in the next town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer this question Tangent Games has created Commodity Cards. Commodity Cards are cards that the GM can print out and use to determine the type, quantity, and value for different commodities. Commodity Cards IV: Finished Goods: The Adventurer's Kit deals with those commodities that have been made into adventuring gear, alchemical items, luxury goods, musical instruments, and tack. The set contains 200 different cards depicting finished goods from acid to zithers and perfumes to saddles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commodity Cards IV: Finished Goods: The Adventurer's Kit contains 200 different commodities for use in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No GM should be without Commodity Cards. Make them part of your gaming essentials today. Purchase your copy of the complete set of Commodity Cards IV: Finished Goods: The Adventurer's Kit today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
