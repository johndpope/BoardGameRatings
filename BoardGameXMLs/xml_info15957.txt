							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Final Fantasy VIII: Triple Triad</name>
									
			<description>Final Fantasy VIII contained a sub game called &amp;quot;Triple Triad.&amp;quot;  This game was actually sold in card form.  Boosters only.  10 cards per booster.  5 game cards, 5 visual art cards.  No modifications made.  Now internet play has been fan-made.  Only published in Japan to my knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, this is a modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe.  Play is on a 3x3 grid.  Each player has 5 cards he does not show the other player.  Cards are two-sided, one pink, one blue.  Cards are based on characters and monsters from the game.  There are &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; of cards, each level containing monsters, guardian forces (summon monsters), or player characters (highest level).  Each player chooses a color.  Randomly determine who goes first.  Place a card on the grid.  Each card has a &amp;quot;compass rose&amp;quot; of 4 different numbers, 1-9, and then A representing 10.  Higher levels contain higher numbers.  If I place a card with the number 4 at it's north, and you place a card with a number 5 at it's south directly above mine, you &amp;quot;flip&amp;quot; mine, and both are now your color.  You are trying to get the most cards to your color.  You can &amp;quot;chain&amp;quot; cards too.  If you flip a card, it can flip other cards.  Each card is only flipped once per turn.  Some cards have an elemental symbol on them, giving a +1 number bonus against anything not of that element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nice thing is you only need 5 cards.  In FFVIII, you could actually take one of your opponent's cards they played with if you won.  House rules for this type of play vary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
