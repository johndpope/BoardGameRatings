			<description>Advertisers variant of Snakes and Ladders, produced in 1935 to advertise D&amp;amp; W Gibbs &amp;quot;Dentifrice&amp;quot; Toothpaste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Size approx.35cm X 46cm when unfolded (central fold). Printed on cardboard - board has two holes and a string at the top to allow it to be hung up as an advertising item. Rules are printed on the rear of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes dice and 4 coloured counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game was posted in a pink envelope with the rules printed on them. Publisher unknown, but game was produced for D &amp;amp; W Gibbs Ltd, Wapping, London E1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to reach the land of Health and Happiness, and the player who gets there first wins. Along the way there are various difficulties to help and hinder the player; for example, the Gibbs Fairy helps, an Imp hinders, and a Giant (called Decay!) handicaps the player at the start of the game. Various spaces have actions associated with them, that send the player to other squares. A roll and move mechanism with a standard six sided die is used to determine each players movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unusual variant of Snakes and Ladders, produced by the Gibbs toothpaste company to promote their products and raise awareness of dental hygiene.
