							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Blaze</name>
									
			<description>Dragon Blaze is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game released in 2000 by Psikyo. It was ported in 2004 to the PlayStation 2 as part of the Psikyo Shooting Collection Vol. 3:Sol Divide &amp;amp; Dragon Blaze compilation. The game was later also released on its own for the PS2 in Europe by 505 Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Blaze plays like many typical 2D shooters by Psikyo, giving each character a normal shot, a charged shot, and a bomb. But each character (Quaid, Sonia, Ian, and Rob) also rides a dragon, which can be dismounted and be used as a weapon itself. The dismounted dragon initially acts as a piercing weapon, and then remains stationary shooting until the player calls it back using the same button. It can also be used to collect items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dragon Blaze&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
