			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrilling Powers offers you lots of inspiration for your next campaign of Worlds in Peril. This supplement features dozens of pre-made powers for you to use as presented or to tweak to your own preference. Following the powers section there's a team of four pre-generated heroes, each with a fully-fleshed nemesis as well as an arch-villain to defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A time travel-themed campaign outline gives you, the EiC, a place to start with a group of new players. This book is designed to provide enough inspiration for you to take the story in whichever direction you desire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the intuitive nature of the powers from Worlds in Peril, GMs of virtually any game system can use this book for their own supers game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
