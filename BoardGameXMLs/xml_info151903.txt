							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost Luna</name>
									
			<description>Outpost Luna, a captivating strategy resource card game with local play or multiplayer options via GameCenter, is now available in the App Store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth Federation has decided it is time to colonize the distant Outpost Luna, and is offering incentives to companies to build cities there. Being the adventurous space entrepreneur that you are, you take the challenge to be the first company to build these cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to build those cities, your construction bots will first need to locate the most productive land, gather resources, use those resources to build factories, towers, and housing structures, and then build the cities according to city blueprints provided by the Federation. Each blueprint is accessible to all players, but can only be used once; so the race is on to see which company (player) will be first to meet the requirements of each blueprint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does another company have some land and buildings that you would like? Producing a little gold can help you challenge another player&amp;rsquo;s bot in order to take the land by force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost Luna&amp;rsquo;s variety of strategic options will keep you coming back for more. It is an excellent two player game, with up to four players using Pass and Play or GameCenter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
