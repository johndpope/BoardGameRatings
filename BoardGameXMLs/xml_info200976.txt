							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Memoirs of a Hitman</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memoirs of a Hitman is a story in three parts about a man&amp;rsquo;s development from an innocent young soldier into a merciless hitman &amp;ndash; and about his attempt to reconnect with that youthful innocence. It is a tale of how a man lost sight of who he was in the midst of the horrors of war, only to rediscover himself in the rugged and beautiful nature of Iceland. In terms of mood, the game is close to movies like The American and Munich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players should expect a story-centered game where roles continuously shift hands, and with its emphasis on the story rather than immersion in the characters. That said there will be plenty of emotional scenes and tragic aspects to explore. Simple mechanics work to keep the game focused on the general theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
