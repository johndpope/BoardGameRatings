							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Smarts: Clear Your Mind</name>
									
			<description>Zombie Smarts is the infectious question and answer game that features grisly facts about the history, habits, and hungers of the living dead. Choose a card and learn how to combat a zombie invasion: What should you do if a zombie bites your friends? Can table salt reverse the effects of &amp;quot;zombification&amp;quot;? What is smarter - a zombie or a dog? True/False and multiple choice cards offer macabre information on zombie films, Voodoo, re-killing, undead encounters, and many other gruesome topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win by being the first person or team to get three answers right in each of the four categories or get sixteen answers right in any or all categories - which ever comes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
