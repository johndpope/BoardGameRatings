			<description>Star Soldier R is a futuristic scrolling shoot 'em up. Players can choose to play the 2-minute or 5-minute mode and are vying to get the highest score possible. Online leaderboards are present to see where a player ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only one level which is played through on either timed mode. While impossible to reach the end of the level in 2-minute mode, it is possible to complete it before the timer runs out in 5-minute mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released in Japan on March 25th, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released in the US on May 19th, 2008, with the EU release coming a day later on May 20th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
