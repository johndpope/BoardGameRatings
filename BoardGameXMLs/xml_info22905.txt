							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Phantom, Ruler of the Jungle Game</name>
									
			<description>The Phantom, Ruler of the Jungle, brings peace and safety to the natives. Called &amp;quot;The Ghost Who Walks&amp;quot;, he is rarely seen except in time of trouble. Then, as a warning of his constant vigilance, he leaves the mark of his skull ring at the scene. Each player is The Phantom, trying to be the first to reach all of the trouble areas and leave a skull ring mark as a sign of protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A plastic skull ring is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
