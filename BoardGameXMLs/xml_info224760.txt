							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frank&#039;s Thank You</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is Frank? Frank is any one of the Grayson's Grey Rangers - he's an opportunity to start a story if you will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frank's Thank You is the final product of those funded in the 2013 Shaintar kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for a group of 4-6 heroes just starting out (Novice or Seasoned), this three part adventure introduces you to the Epic High Fantasy world of Shaintar. Meet Frank: he could be anybody. He's dressed well but doesn't seem to be noble. He's...solid. A guy who knows his way around and has seen things. He's interested in you. Perhaps you have what it takes to join the organization he's with, but you need to be tested first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part one: Almahrad, known as the City of Dreams. Legend has it that the city was created by a demon who owed someone a favor - and they need your help. The rulers have a problem and they require outside help and Frank has picked you. Make your way through the city and follow the clues to the people behind the problem. Then you get to decide what to do with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frank is impressed and gives you the second assignment: Eastport. The city has been quarantined due to some strange illness and the city managers have asked for some help...healthy help. Meet with a city official to find out what the problem is and then move throughout the districts investigating as you go. Just when you think you've found everything, someone tries a power grab - what will you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In part three, you'll go to the small Brinchie kingdom of Eon'Voltuh and meet with Silverclaw, Queen and co-ruler of this place. She has a problem with the pink pearls harvested from her harbors and shoreline.  Not to mention there's this place people have been talking about called the Bonsinger's Bog - I sure hope you don't have to go there...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all three parts have been completed, Frank offers the group membership in Grayson's Grey Rangers and gives them a special ranger pin to show they are his recruits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
