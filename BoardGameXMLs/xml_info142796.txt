			<description>The Galactic Empire has fallen, and now many races are looking to seize power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board displays multiple sectors of space, each containing spaces for cards represnting planets, space-stations, etc that you can influence to gain resources/abilities. Using those resources to increase your influence in other sectors to expand your empire and earn final victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 12 rounds consists of the following phases:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Players choose 1 of the 7 action cards secretly, and pass the remaining cards clockwise until all players have chosen. These cards determine the player order for the round, and income.&lt;br/&gt; 2. In player order, players pay to place their influence cube on a planet/system card and take any immediate rewards.&lt;br/&gt; 3. Players earn resources for each cube on a planet/system that has an ongoing effect.&lt;br/&gt; 4. Each player that controls a sector (most cubes) gains that sector's bonus (VP or resources)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all planet/system cards are full, or at the end of the 12th round, the game ends and the player with the most VP wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
