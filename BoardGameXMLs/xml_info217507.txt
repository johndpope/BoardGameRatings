			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom is a small community inside The Dungeon that the players rule. Although it is referred to as a Kingdom for convenience's sake, it could be a village, a school, a company, or any other type of small group. Typically, in Make You Kingdom, all of the players take control of one Kingdom and, as its members, attempt to raise and nurture it. The Kingdom's assets can be thought of as being the collective assets of all the characters attached to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
