							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twin Crowns: Age of Exploration Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twin Crowns - Age of Exploration Fantasy is a campaign setting and rules expansion for Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;reg; Third Edition, published by Wizards of the Coast&amp;reg;. You need the D&amp;amp;D Core Rulebooks to use this expansion. The Twin Crowns world has a flavor like none other, combining the high fantasy elements with historical elements of the Age of Exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A comprehensive system for naval travel and combat&lt;br/&gt;     A rich and complete world with detailed geographic and cultural information&lt;br/&gt;     An elegant ritual system expanding both arcane and divine power&lt;br/&gt;     An elaborate cosmology and system of religion with far reaching effects beyond for every class&lt;br/&gt;     Hundreds of pages encompassing new races, feats, skills, spells, prestige classes, magic items, and monsters usable in any campaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great sailing vessels cross the Quilla Ocean from the Northern and Southern Empires to the colonies to the far west, avoiding savage pirates, vicious sea monsters and most of all, one another! The two Empires war, not only on the battlefield, but in the marketplaces as well. It is a race for power, resources and wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the heavens above, twelve deities look down upon Ptalmanar and guide it's people. The most devout worshippers undergo rituals of initiation to take a piece of their god's power into their own souls, opening their bodies to the touch of the divine. The greatest among them can rise to the level of High Priest, assuming the mantle of leadership of the flock and bearing the terrible burden of being the terrestrial voice of their deity. The Maker, creator of all, sits atop the divine wheel with the gods of light cascading down each side. At the bottom, surrounded by his dark children, sits the Unmaker, force of destruction and death. Their eternal struggle is played out wholly in the actions of their earthly followers, ever competing for dominance of the world and the place of Good and Evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our game world bears a richness and depth that few others can match. Highly detailed religion, with three tiers of power within each church that lie beyond just Clerics, Paladins and Druids. The two warring Empires are each carefully detailed so they bear their own identity and atmosphere. The colonial holdings across the ocean and the exploration of the new world are vexed by a fierce militant kingdom of elves seeking to expel the human invaders. Twin Crowns also offers a new system of arcane magic embodied by potent rituals that go far beyond the casting of a simple spell. Guilds of mages guard and covet the secrets of these powerful ensorcellments, and vie for korba, the essential ingredient in their casting. This is high fantasy unlike any you have ever experienced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
