			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMMUNITY is a game which focuses people's action in a make-believe community while allowing them to utilize their own judgments and apply their own beliefs and values as if it were real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game which can be played by all age groups, but which is aimed primarily at youth, 10 years or older, or adults who have not been previously involved in community action and decision making. Each player is encouraged to vocalize his opinion - to investigate how each group decision will affect him. It is recommended for groups of not less than seven nor more than fifteen players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no rules in COMMUNITY - only procedures by which to play. Dice Roll and Role Cards create a simulation of day-to-day living conditions and the responsibilities which we all must face. The Event Cards simulate events which affect the community and require a group decision. The Pollution Index forces the community to take group action and Community Improvements offer a way to improve the quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary: &lt;br/&gt;COMMUNITY is run by a Gamemaster who is in control of the game. Decisions about what a player can or cannot do are made by the Gamemaster based on his learning goals for the group. There are &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; included with the game, but these can be adjusted per the Gamemaster's discretion. The game is over or is &amp;quot;won&amp;quot; when the Gamemaster's pre-determined goals have been achieved or the players have failed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
