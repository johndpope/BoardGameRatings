			<description>Word Topper is a great way to build your vocabulary while having fun with your friends and family! Use as much word building strategy as possible to try and score the most points on every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Topper is quick to set up and easy to play. The more times you play, the more words and combinations you will learn to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start by choosing a dealer. The dealer deals out six cards to every player. After the deal is over, the dealer puts the rest of the deck face down to create a draw pile. He then draws 7 cards and places them face up in the middle of the table creating the community cards for everyone to play off of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, each player uses the cards in their hands to make the best scoring word possible by laying them on top of the cards placed in the middle. Scores their turn, then draws from the draw pile to make up for the cards they just played. The next player then plays their cards on top of the cards the previous player just played creating a new word and also new community cards. Each time a player plays the community cards and the players cards change, creating a constant change to the game every turn. Game play continues until all the cards are gone from the draw pile. The highest scorer wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus cards include double word points, skips, wilds, and switches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
