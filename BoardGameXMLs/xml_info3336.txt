			<description>All 38 cards are shuffled upside-down and evenly dealt to the players. Every player gets a total chip&lt;br/&gt;value of '20'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must play one card when it is their turn. The starting player begins and plays one of his Devil cards onto the table. Then its the next players turn. The starting player must play a Devil card in one of the colors of the cards in the hand of the player to his left. The colors of the cards in each players hand are visible on the backs of the various cards. The player, whose turn it is, now has 4 possible alternatives for playing a card from his hand.&lt;br/&gt;- He can play a Devil card with the same value as a 'free card', whose color is not yet represented on the table, face up. The player thusly starts a new row. This play costs the player no chips.&lt;br/&gt;- He can play a card with a higher value in an already started color row at the top or bottom end of that started color&amp;rsquo;s row. This play costs the player no chips. &lt;br/&gt;- He can play a card with a lower value in an already started color row at the top or bottom end of that started color&amp;rsquo;s row. This play costs the player the difference between the value of the card he is playing and the card onto which he is playing it, in chips. The player pays this value in chips to the player to his right.&lt;br/&gt;- He can play an Angel card onto the free end of any row in which there is no Angel card played so far. This play costs the player no chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the dealer plays his last card. Since the dealer is last in the round, the dealer is always the one to play the last card. Whomever has the most chips at this point, is the winner if this heavenly hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
