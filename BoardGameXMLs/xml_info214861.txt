			<description>DON'T CRASH! Help the Monsters ride to work without breaking the Elevator!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cooperative math card game for kids, your Elevator is full of Monsters trying to go to work. If the Elevator gets too heavy, it breaks and everyone loses. If the Elevator reaches the 20th floor without breaking, everyone wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters in the Elevator won &amp;quot;Best Family Game&amp;quot; at the 2016 Boston Festival of Indie Games and is currently 1 of 5 finalists in the Hasbro &amp;quot;Next Great family Game&amp;quot; contest. It is designed for 2-6 player, ages 7-to-11 (and up), takes 2 minutes to learn and 5-20 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two decks: The DRAW and the FLOORS. The Draw deck contains MONSTERS with weight numbers on their bodies. Each Floor of the Elevator is a new round of the game, where players check the new Floor card and the Monster cards in the Elevator to see if any of those Monsters exit (get discarded). Then the players each enter a Monster card from their hand into the Elevator at the same time, and finally they add up the weights of the Monsters in the Elevator. If the sum is above the Elevator Capacity (50 x the number of players), the Elevator crashes and everyone loses. Otherwise, everyone gets a new card and play continues to the next Floor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also ACTIONS in the Draw deck you can choose to play instead of a Monster, including cards that Change the Floor up or down, cards that make one Monster exit to Get Exercise or take a Phone Call, or cards that completely clear the Elevator with Giant Bees or a Fire Alarm. Families can decide how much they want to keep their hand secret and how much they want to share for easier cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, in the ADVANCED MODE the Floors are shuffled and played face-down, and without knowing what Floor might show up next the likelihood of crashing goes up and the game gets much more intense with every round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
