							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jeu de la Révolution Française</name>
									
			<description>A race game for any number of players taking place on a board depicting events of the French Revolution. The game was produced during the revolution, apparently for propaganda purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players advance from the fall of the Bastille towards the National Assembly. Players landing on certain spaces are required to pay tokens and/or suffer other penalties. Players falling into the well must await rescue by another player. A player in prison must await another player to take his place. A player landing on the Death square must return to the start. The winner is the first player to land on the final space, by exact count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
