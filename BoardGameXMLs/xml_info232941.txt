			<description>Have you ever had the impulse to drag the whole roll of toilet paper at one go? Now you can realize your evil idea just in iDragPaper!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player from Touch Arcade forum told us a story about this game: &amp;quot;My nephews and I really enjoyed playing this game the other night. We tried to find the best strategy to unroll the paper, back n forth finger sliding, long strokes from top to bottom, short strokes, turning the phone toward you, away from you, and a bunch of other ideas. My nephew Mark had the best time at 9 seconds.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, it's a funny game for you and your kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So, what is it? Click Start to start the game. Choose how many players are playing. Swipe the screen to drag the toilet paper. Drag the paper as fast as you can and possibly you are in the top ten. Take the challenge now and have fun!Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
