			<description>Relive the glorious moments of the epic race between Hare and Tortoise! Several decades ago, Hare suffered a crushing defeat against a determined Tortoise. This painful affair threw disgrace and dishonour onto the Hare's clan and it would take many generations for the affront to be forgotten. Forgotten, did I say? Never! Hare is determined to restore his family's honor &amp;ndash; but Tortoise will not give up without a fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woodland Race is an asymmetrical race game in which audacity and strategy will be your best assets! The players build the track over successive rounds, sometimes helping Hare and sometimes helping Tortoise. Hare is fleet of foot but will often need to stop for a rest, whilst Tortoise is slow but moves with purpose. Many obstacles arise on the way, and who will win is up to you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
