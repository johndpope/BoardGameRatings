							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monegassen Ramsch</name>
									
			<description>Monegassen Ramsch contains one Dimension Card and 32 play cards (Ramsche). At the start of the game every player has seven cards on his hand and an empty discard pile in front of him. The goal is to get rid of your cards by placing them into the other player's discard pile. You get points for every card that's in the other players's discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main mechanic is similar to Ramschrounds in Skat plus four special effects cards. As you play you can always choose in which discard pile you want to play your card. Sometimes you want to play them in your own, because of these effects like &amp;quot;mirror the discard piles&amp;quot; etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
