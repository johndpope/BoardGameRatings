Will you look to protect your own strength or weaken others?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steal Ghost Cards and Trade Nightmares with diligence. Build strength through Turning Point activation or clever resource management. Collect gold through set collection or sneaky bluffing...But don&amp;rsquo;t let greed be your downfall&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage your board position carefully or discover how being in the lead increases your risk of being trapped by Scrooge&amp;rsquo;s tricks and villains. Whatever you choose, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to watch your back for other scrooges!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tension builds as players reach the climatic final challenge, Scrooge's Moment of Truth. But are you ready? Are players holding back power cards? Or will fate turn you into a hero?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deeply immersive, highly interactive and fiendishly funny. It&amp;rsquo;s a game for families, friends and fun-loving adults of all ages. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge full of tricks and traps, ghosts and nightmares, Heroes &amp;amp; Villains. A game that will sharpen your mind and sharpen your wit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With multiple strategies to victory&amp;hellip;how you do it, is up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAN YOU OUT-SCROOGE, SCROOGE?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
