			<description>The object of the game is to move your spaceship pawn from the Earth to three of six orbiting planets and be the first one to return to Earth.  The game is played on a 36 by 36 grid with the Earth at the center.  Players get fuel cards numbered 1 through 10 to control their movement.  Each turn, you play one fuel card to move your ship that number of squares either horizontally or vertically, but not both.&lt;br/&gt;There are also two fuel ships.  Every player on his turn rolls a die and moves one of the fuel ships.  If you land next to a fuel ship, you can retrieve any one used fuel card.  When you are out of fuel, you can only move one square per turn. You also retrieve any 3 used fuel cards on every planet you land on.&lt;br/&gt;Each planet has a series of 10 to 12 dots that describe its entry/exit orbit.  To leave Earth, you have to follow the 12 orbit dots before you enter the vertical and horizontal grid of open space.  Likewise, when you want to land on a planet, you have to start on the outermost orbit dot and follow the orbit down to the planet's surface.  Sorry, no transporters in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
