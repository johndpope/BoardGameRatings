			<description>MetaHistory #3 - A set of naval miniatures rules.  From the packaging:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command At Sea is a scale simulation of naval battles.  Units are single ships.  Each ship is defined by its guns, compartments and combat factors.  You play by acting as commander of a ship or task group with a mission.  You plat the moves, you fire the guns, you assess the damage.  And it is all to actual 1/4800 scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command At Sea is not a board game; it is played on the floor.  It is as close to real fighting ships as you can get and not be blasted.  The scenarios provided are for 3 battles of Savo Island near Guadalcanal in WWII.  If you love the big ships or haven't experienced naval miniatures play you won't want to miss Command At Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level: Very advanced play for 2 or more Ages 18 and up&lt;br/&gt;Playability: Complex learning, rapid play system.  3-8 hours playtime&lt;br/&gt;Components: 24 ship counters, rules, 20 ship data charts, 20 ship command plots, 4 turn gauges and damage tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
