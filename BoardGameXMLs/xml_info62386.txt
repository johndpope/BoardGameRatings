			<description>A massive wooden board contains plenty of holes. On this board, a rubber band is placed around pins. Each player draws a shape on a sheet, and then they are simultaneously revealed. Now the players take turns rolling a die which determines how many pins can be moved and how the rubber band's position can be changed. The goal is to be the first player to move the rubber band into the shape that was sketched before the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
