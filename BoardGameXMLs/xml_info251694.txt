			<description>The deck consists of 48 food cards, each displaying one of six kinds of food, including three cheese cards. The nine cards in each of the five non-cheese foods (suits) are numbered in such a way that each such suit contains three triplets that add up to twenty five, eg, 4, 6, and 15. The object is to collect the most triplets. Each player begins with a hand of five cards. In turn order, a player asks for a food. Every player who has a card or cards of that food in her hand must offer all of those cards  and no others to the questioner. Players who do not have that food in their hands may either sit out or bluff by offering the questioner one or more cards of any type. The questioner chooses one offer, sight unseen, and adds those cards to her hand. Players meld their triplets when they create them. Play continues until only the cheese cards remain in players&amp;rsquo; hands. Players score one point for each melded triplet and minus one for each cheese card in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
