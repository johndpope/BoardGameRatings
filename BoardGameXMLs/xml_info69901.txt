			<description>A card game published on thegamecrafter.com that bears a fairly strong resemblance to Uno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game with seven cards.  The first player to get rid of their hand wins.  On your turn, you can play a card matching the color of the face up card or a special card.  If you do neither, you draw a card.  The card can be immediately played.  Special cards include Skip, which skip the next player's turn, rainbows, which can be played after any color and cause the next player to draw a number of cards, power animals, which can be played on any color and allow the player to play all cards in their hand of that animal, and bug cards, which require the next player to play a bug spray card or draw a card, continuing until a bug spray is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From TheGamecrafter.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Be the first to play all the kitties, doggies, mousies, and bunnies from your hand. Power animals will help you out, but watch out for the dreaded Bug or you'll need to find some Bug Spray!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast-playing card game for 2-6 players. We play it with kids ages 4 and up. By Colleen and Matt Leacock.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents:  &lt;br/&gt;47 cards&lt;br/&gt;Rules document&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
