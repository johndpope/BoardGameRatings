			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AI's at the abandoned spaceport got bored.  To pass the days they used the maintenance systems to modify two of the small housekeeping bots to race around the site's reconfigurable service-ways. As they are semi autonomous the 'bots have to receive their directions in burst transmissions.  Now the AI's are happy steering, drifting, and jumping their machines against each other in full on races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Microbot Racers players assume the role of one of the two spaceport AI's racing the other.  Each round they select the actions their 'bot can take on the action card before sending them their instructions in a burst transmission.  Players will need to avoid obstacles, hazards and each other in their mad dash round the track, but can make life difficult for one another by triggering the reconfiguration switches that cause sections of track to rotate or flip, changing the course in mid-race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was an entry in the 2016 2 player PnP competition.  A microgame requiring only the 11 cards and a few extra components, its is quick and easy to build and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
