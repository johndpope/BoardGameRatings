			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See who can act out the most fancy words in this game that will make you giggle! Packaged in our colorful carry-along bag that's made for the fun-lover on the move...Games to Go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 48 action cards, 10 card stands, 21 game chips, colorful carry-along bag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn the current player will draw an action card, and then perform in sequence from memory the actions of any previously drawn action cards as well as the card just drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get a number of chips to trade in for hints should they not be able to remember a portion of the sequence; the player who can perform the longest sequence correctly without running out of chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action cards have both the name of the action as well as a picture demonstrating the action for children too young to read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
