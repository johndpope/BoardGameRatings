			<description>Simple children's game which combines Bingo with a top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bingo aspect is that the winner is trying to mark a line of three on a 5x3 card of animals. Instead of &amp;quot;Bingo!&amp;quot; the player shouts &amp;quot;Pink Elephant!&amp;quot; Winner of the particular game gets point chips from other player depending on circumstances. PLayers then shuffle cards and start another round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall winner is player who has the most points at the conclusion of play. (The rules are nebulous on how many rounds should be played.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another twist in this game is how the squares to be covered are to be selected. Instead of a draw bag as in Bingo a top is used. On the tops spindle are placed two plastic discs. One red and one white. The top with the two discs is spun in the game box bottom which has a gridded board with various colored animals in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The red disc indicates what color of animal should be covered and the white disc indicates what animal. There are also provisions in the rules for covering multiple spaces. As an added twist it is acceptable to nudge the top to try and get it to throw a disc off in a particular direction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
