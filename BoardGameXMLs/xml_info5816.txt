			<description>Board games (petties) have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history; some even pre-date literacy skill development in the earliest civilizations. A number of important historical sites, artifacts and documents exist which shed light on early board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Greeks always played the ancient board game (petteies) with the name &amp;quot;Pessoi&amp;quot; and Atherma Archegona is the recreation of this ancient board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game from ancient Hellas with boards found dating to about 15.000 B.C. and it is for 2-6 players. Each player has their own pawns. Pawns must have the signs of ancient Greek letters. There are also three dice with ancient Greek shapes on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest die roll plays first. All pawns entering the board must make a word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
