			<description>Seeing there were no word games for Stonehenge, I felt compelled to create one, and Lexihenge is a result. I would like to thank everyone at the summer 08 Spielbany event for playtesting and feedback of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 2&amp;ndash;10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: The object of the game is to score the most points after seven rounds.&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Timer (to time 1 and 5 minutes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dictionary or other list of legal words to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A way for people to write down their answers for each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Way to record score (pen and paper works or use the Stonehenge board with figures)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deck of Stonehenge cards, excluding the black cards and the trilithon cards. In game, each color represents a group of letters:&lt;br/&gt;White: A, B, C, D, F&lt;br/&gt;Blue: E, G, H, J, K&lt;br/&gt;Green: I, L, M, N, P&lt;br/&gt;Yellow: O, Q, Qu, R, S, T&lt;br/&gt;Red: U, V, W, X, Y, Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A guide for each player (or team) as to which letters a color represents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which ever player (or team) won the most rounds wins. In event of a tie, the tying players shuffle all the cards and play one more round. This continues until there is one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
