			<description>Tableaux C&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;bres is an educational game published by the French game manufacturer Fernand Nathan that introduces students to the grand masterpieces of the art world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tableaux C&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;bres includes six colorful game boards (each displaying ten art masterpieces), a deck of 60 Painter cards, a deck of 60 Artwork Description cards, 60 circular Detail discs, and an instruction booklet. Depending on the number of players, each person plays the game with a minimum of one game board. After the two decks of cards are shuffled, each player is dealt 5 Painter and 5 Artwork Description cards and also selects 5 Detail discs that have been shuffled face down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns playing as many cards and/or discs as possible. Any remaining cards are shuffled back into their respective decks and the discs are mixed face down with the others on the table. The goal is to match one circular Detail disc, one Painter card, and one Artwork Description card for each masterpiece on a player&amp;rsquo;s game board(s). The first player to do so is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
