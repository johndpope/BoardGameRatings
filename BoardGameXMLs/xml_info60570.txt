			<description>User Note: For characters level 5-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While passing through the bustling city of Galishor on your way to Dragon's Bluff, you visit the establishment of Hlavius Griff, a merchant who comes highly recommended for the quality of his adventuring gear. The shop's assistant attends to you, recommending the priciest items. From the back of the store comes wailing and groaning. &amp;quot;Oh, that's Master Griff,&amp;quot; the clerk says. He leans forward and whispers, &amp;quot;terrible news today.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Griff appears and immediately eyes his assistant. Griff is plump and prosperous-looking, but disheveled at the moment. &amp;quot;Who are you wagging your tongue at, boy?&amp;quot; he snaps. He pulls up short when he sees you. &amp;quot;Oh, I'm sorry. Today has been less than... good. I've been short with everyone. My ship was lost, fully laden with cargo. It ran aground two leagues north of here. And those cowards of a crew won't go back to salvage it! Losing the cargo is bad enough, but a family heirloom was aboard the ship, locked away in my monogrammed chest. I would pay dearly to get it back...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've seen this scenario before - man in distress pays adventurers handsomely to retrieve locket, charm, or arcane tome that eats the world. Yeah. This should be easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
