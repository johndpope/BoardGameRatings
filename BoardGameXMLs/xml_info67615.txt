			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which sort of dangers hide in the sewers? Where is exactly located that damned thieves hideout? Where is the temple devoted to that filthy deity? Where is that underground smugglers dock? And, finally, how can we do to avoid becoming hopelessly lost in that damned sewers maze? Find it in Sewers Below!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be assembled in a 17x22 inches map, in different configurations.  Sewers Below presents four color maps you can arrange as you wish to form a larger map. You can even print more than one copy of the same map in order to obtain a bigger map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains the following sewer-themed maps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maze&lt;br/&gt;Many underground waterworks cross and connect themselves in this filthy maze. Some secret doors lead to mysterious chambers containing goods or leading to other places below the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hideout&lt;br/&gt;Nobody is able to find this hideout whose secret entrance is hidden somewhere in the sewers maze below the city. A corridor encircles the whole hideout and lead to the actual entrance of the complex. Inside, a self-sufficient environment do exist, containing refectory, barracks, storage rooms, a fresh water well, and many other facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Temple&lt;br/&gt;Someone whispers the sewers temple is devoted to a ratlike deity, others tell tales about unaware citizens drawn in the sewers and forever lost, maybe victim of horrid sacrifices. The temple features a main entrance and secret side entrances. Inside many other shrines are found, along with cells, high priests room, kitchen, larder and guard posts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dock&lt;br/&gt;This sewers dock is well protected by two sturdy portcullises. A nest of rooms, accessible via secret doors, surrounds the dock entrance. The rooms are provided of arrowslits to defend the entrance. Only small rowboats can access the dock, this due to the small size of the sewers channels, although it is told that smugglers can shrink the size of larger boats in order to unload precious cargoes of illegal goods in the storage rooms of the dock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
