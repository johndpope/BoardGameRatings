			<description>This is a game about the Elfstedentocht (Eleven Cities Tour), a 200-km ice skating race that leads through eleven different cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to win the race by being the first to reach the finish. Every turn, a player rolls a die and moves his pawn (a skater) as many spaces forward as the die indicates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the field where he ends, several follow-up actions are possible, such as having to move back some spaces (due to adverse wind) or taking another turn (because the public cheers you on). On certain fields, the player must answer a trivia question on the Elfstedentocht. The questions are about the race itself and about the eleven cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
