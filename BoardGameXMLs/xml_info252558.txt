							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knight Fall</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knight Fall sees the party encountering a knight whose family has fallen on hard times after backing the wrong side, losing lands and titles in the process. The knight, although still possessed of some honour, directed at those who work for him, is no longer a true knight as he has been pushed to breaking point and beyond. The characters will most likely encounter him as they search for highwaymen who have been operating in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is aimed at d100 systems but is generic enough in nature to be adapted to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter, and around half a page are ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
