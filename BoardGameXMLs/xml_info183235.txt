			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s a fur-flying frenzy for the late Olga&amp;rsquo;s cash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For weeks, the nation has been captivated by the competition to win the fortune of the late Olga. The rules are simple, the one who takes care of all the cats wins. But contestants are running out of patience as their opponents resort to tossing cats and outright sabotage. There&amp;rsquo;s only a handful of contenders left, will you be the last caretaker standing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feline Fortunes is a card game for 2-4 players that plays in 20-30 minutes. In the game you&amp;rsquo;ll need to manage the cats in your Lap, defending yourself and attacking others. If you run out of Patience, you&amp;rsquo;re out of the game, and the last player to keep their wits is the winner.&lt;br/&gt; COLLECT CATS&lt;br/&gt;Gather Olga&amp;rsquo;s cats into your Lap and show the world you&amp;rsquo;re the best caretaker. Gather 3 or more and you&amp;rsquo;ll get back some of your precious Patience as they purr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TOSS CATS&lt;br/&gt;If a cat falls off your Lap, you can toss it at an opponent to wreak havoc with their play space. You don&amp;rsquo;t win the cash by playing nice, after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNIQUE CATS&lt;br/&gt;Cats can push each other, fight with one another, launch other cats and even copy each other&amp;rsquo;s abilities. With more than 60 cat cards, who knows what will pounce into your Lap next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STRATEGIC CATS&lt;br/&gt;All information is open in Feline Fortunes, so you always know what you&amp;rsquo;re opponents are capable of. But a single move can dramatically affect the entire game, so don&amp;rsquo;t get too comfortable, buddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
