			<description>From inside the book,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Inner City is a contemporary role-playing game.  That is, the players in the game assume the roles of the characters in Inner City while playing.  In order to play this game, one of the players must assume the role of City Master, the referee of the game.  The City Master must, with the help of this rule book, pass arbitrary judgement upon the actions of the players in the game and the outcomes of these actions.  The other players imagine themselves as, or in other words, assume the roles of, people in a slightly alters modern-day city.  Generally speaking, the city of Inner City is what a man from another planet might expect of an average American city after watching several days of prime-time television.  Rampant violence, corruption, good cops, bad cops, villainous criminals, and organized crime are the mainstay of Inner City.  So!, be your favorite crook, cop, private investigator, or whatever, and above all have fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inner City Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;Game Map&lt;br/&gt;Set Of Dice&lt;br/&gt;Sheets Of Play Money&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
