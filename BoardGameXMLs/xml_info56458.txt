			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the darkest jungles of the inner world, where the red sun can barely be seen above the trees, there is The Green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millennia ago two immortals, the Lady of Leaves and the Insect Queen, had a contest here. The Lady of Leaves brought forth her chalice, which restores health to all green and growing things, and brings life to the world. Into this cup, the Insect Queen threw her wand, which causes the dark, gnawing, biting creatures of the world to strengthen and grow. If the chalice won, the insects would starve as the plants grew too tough for them. If the wand won, the plants would be chewed and the land would become a monstrous union of hives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contest continues. The Green is the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
