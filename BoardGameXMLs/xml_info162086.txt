							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">House Nicolai</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The House Nicolai is about Necromancy, dark arts and Voodoo. Telling the tale of Nicolai, one of the most infamous vampires formerly of the Daemoni Bloodline, the Sourcebook tells the tale of how Nicolai was a gifted Thaumaturge who was given special privilage from the Loa. Ancient spirits who taught Nicolai the arts required to free himself from his dark masters. The Daemoni have tried to exterminate the members of the House Nicolai since they left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The House Nicolai helped spread Voodoo and Necromancy through the known world among their mortal counterparts. Moving from the Carpathians to Africa to the Carribean, the members of House Nicolai craft their arts and spread their influence through the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these dark nights, nothing is more fearesome than the name Daemoni. Nothing, that is, except the vampires who can control other vampires. The House Nicolai rules both a mortal sect and immortal sect, spreading their influence and helping those who deserve it. Using ancestral magic, House Nicolai is here to stay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
