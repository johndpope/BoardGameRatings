							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Narnia Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Board and Card Game. Battle between Aslan and the Kingdom of Narnia against the White Witch and her minions. Abstract skirmish level combat. Each figure represents 1 creature (1:1 scale). Victory: The Narnian forces win if they either defeat the White Witch or her entire army. The White Witch wins if she defeats Aslan or the Army of Narnia.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forces of the Kingdom of Narnia include Aslan, the King of Narnia, a Duke, an Earl, four Archers, and eight Infantry. The Forces of the White Witch include fifteen assorted monsters in addition to the Witch herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the units. A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the shared deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
