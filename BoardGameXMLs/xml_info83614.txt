							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: Fort Donelson</name>
									
			<description>1862 - Fort Donelson (American Civil War in 3D)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D sees the Union army under General U.S. Grant laying siege to the Confederate held Fort Donelson.  Grant has just come directly with his army from his victory at Fort Henry only a few days prior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Confederate General John B. Floyd has held a council of war and it was proposed that the Confederate army should attempt to breakout and head for Nashville.  So on the morning of the 15th February 1862 the Confederates prepare for their assault, luck is on their side as General Grant is away from the immediate location of Fort Donelson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort Donelson has a time limit of 12 bounds in which the Confederates must achieve their objective.  Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 2 hour period of continuous play.  The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit.  You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion.  The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in four quadrants, the Fort Donelson six page Battle Report, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice.  The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you continue this great series of battles with another victory?  Play North or South in this the third of the American Civil War in 3D series of board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Source: wargamesdownload.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
