			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devil&amp;rsquo;s Highway is a story roleplaying game in which players take on the roles of bikers in a &amp;ldquo;motorcycle club.&amp;rdquo; Living just beyond the reach of the law, the bikers are involved in drugs, gun running, theft, and general lawlessness. Recently there has been a change in leadership that has caused some concerns for the club, both internally and externally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devil&amp;rsquo;s Highway is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: &lt;br/&gt;scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
