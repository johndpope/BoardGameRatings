							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Supergoal: La Gazzetta dello Sport</name>
									
			<description>Supergoal - La Gazzetta dello Sport is a card game which fully simulate an Italian football game (soccer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team plays &amp;quot;Control&amp;quot; cards to play the midfield game. The winner of the fase enters the &amp;quot;Action&amp;quot; fase as the Attacker. Here the attacker plays a card representing a type of kick. The player in defense must play a &amp;quot;Goal keeper&amp;quot; card which matches the type of kick, otherwise the attacker scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play &amp;quot;referee&amp;quot; cards to block the other player's actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this very easy and rapide exchange, one simulates a full soccer game. A game lasts about 15 minutes, and the mechanics are super easy to understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was sponsored by the italian sports newspaper &amp;quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
