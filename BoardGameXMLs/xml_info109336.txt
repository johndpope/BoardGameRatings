			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Genius Games is proud to announce a new line of products for use with the Pathfinder RPG. The Genius Guide series of products are short electronic books that feature new templates, classes, spells, prestige classes and/or magic items. For use by players and GMs, each Genius Guide is low-priced and ready to be dropped into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release introduces the Harrowed. These creatures are mortal beings whose connection to the world around them has been removed through use of the &amp;quot;Harrow&amp;quot; spell. When first encountered they may appear to be undead, and even most experienced groups will be surprised when the party cleric attempts to turn them and fails. Harrowed are a fun way for GMs to throw a new type of creature against players who have become jaded with the typical monsters found in most adventures. Harrowed can also be the focus of adventures after a player finds a loved one the subject of the spell and now must quest in order to find a way to reverse it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
