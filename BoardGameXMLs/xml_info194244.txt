			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spazz is set in a world like our own. Exactly like our own. There is no time. None at all. You can't relax. You have work to do. People are depending on you. If you mess up then the whole thing is over. Pressure and Strife keep getting in your way. You have Limitations, but you have Ambitions too. And thru it all there is always some one yelling at you. some one who keeps throwing things in your way, some one who controls everything you do. Everything's a Struggle, and your the Victim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published only as an ASCII text file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
