			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Day of Judgement is coming. The angels continue to serve God and complete missions that bring the Second Coming closer. On the other hand, the demons fight for their lord always trying to destroy humanity. Satin has a plan. His demons continue to fight and occasionally win. For each victory, his plans get closer to becoming a reality. One day, he will come to Earth as a human and lead the humans away from God. He will gather the darkness and destroy the gates of heaven and his armies will raze Heaven. In his plan, God will be destroyed and Satin will take his place. God knows what will happen and continues to prepare for the end. He knows of Satin&amp;rsquo;s plan, and Satin understands this himself. All angels know of the end, but they do not know how it will happen and when it will come. However, Satin plans on outwitting God and winning the war. Regardless of Satin&amp;rsquo;s plans, it is the angels&amp;rsquo; job to make sure that God&amp;rsquo;s missions are fulfilled so that God can rescue his believers one-day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
