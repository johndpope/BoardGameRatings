			<description>SanremoN is a collectible card game.&lt;br/&gt;It celebrates 67 years of events and characters of Sanremo's Festival setting them in a fantasy universe.&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 40 downloadable cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;Being able to bring your opponent's life points to 0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;It is played exclusively in two (1 Vs 1) and with a single deck of cards. The two players (Challenger A and Challenger B), after having shuffled the deck fish 5 cards each.&lt;br/&gt;The remaining cards remain available to Challengers who at the end of each round of play will fish one or more cards, depending on how many will they play, so you always have 5 cards but no. Each Challenger has 5000 Life Points departure.&lt;br/&gt;In the first round, the Challenger A plays his first card, choice among the 5 in its possession. The Challenger A is in the process attack, then the ATK points of the card played will be those to be taken into account.

If the ATK points of the opponent A will exceed DEF points of the opponent B, the Challenger to win the turn and the difference between ATK of A and B will be the DEF&lt;br/&gt;points to be subtracted to the Opponent's Life Points B. If the ATK points are equal to or lower than DEF points opponent, no Life Point will be subtracted from the Challenger B.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, played cards are collected in a new deck (the discard pile), and the two Challengers&lt;br/&gt;will fish from the draw pile as many cards as they were played before moving in round next.

After all the cards collected in the deck Waste will be reshuffled and put back into play. So for 5 times at most.&lt;br/&gt;The winner will be the one who will manage to bring the Life Points opponent to 0 or one who, at the end of the Fifth phase of the game, will have higher Life Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
