			<description>Publisher's Flavor Text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2645. Earth&amp;rsquo;s governments have all fallen. Corporations now run the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Fast Food Wars of 2483, pizza corporations emerged as the dominant ruling entities of the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2640, life was discovered in six previously unknown galaxies. Recent advances in space travel now make it possible to leap to and from these galaxies in minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, Earth&amp;rsquo;s pizza corporations are in a race to become the most well known pizza franchise in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game: In Solar Slice, each player assumes the role of a Pizza Corporation. At the end of the game, the corporation with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game: A game consists of 4 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round: Each round consists of 4 phases: Galaxy Prime, Marketing, Delivery, and Scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Galaxy Prime Phase a launch card is revealed which establishes both the Galaxy Prime (the trump color), and the Scoring values of each galaxy for the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Marketing Phase players place a Marketing Ring onto the board in any galaxy they choose. This helps to protect their interests in that galaxy from sabotage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Delivery Phase, players make a total of 10 Deliveries. A Delivery consists of each player playing 1 card from their hand The winner of each Delivery advances their pawn in a galaxy of their choosing.  Players win deliveries by either playing the highest numbered card of a starting color, or the highest Galaxy Prime card. Any sabotage cards played during the Delivery decrease  a chosen player's advancement in a particular galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Scoring Phase, players advance their pawns on the score track according to the values listed on the Launch Card associated with the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
