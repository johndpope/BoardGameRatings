			<description>The players try to find out who vandalized a house. There are eight suspects on cards. Three clue chips are laid out face-down (with hat, coat and shoe symbols).&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and can take a card and solve a task written on the card. If the card shows a clue, the player can check the corresponding clue chip to get information; if the card shows fingerprints, the player just gets the card. When a player has seen all chips, the turn is finished and the player has to announce which suspect was guilty. If several players find out in the same turn, the one with most fingerprints is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is TKKG-themed. TKKG is a series of children's detective stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
