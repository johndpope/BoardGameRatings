							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Shrine of Kyuss</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Shrine of Kyuss is another offering of not very much used creatures from the Fiend Folio. In this case, The Sons of Kyuss. I've never ran across these guys before and Si made a suggestion for them. These guys are very nasty. So if you dislike your party immensely throw a small horde of Sons of Kyuss at them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one has a plot hook that has nothing to do with what is actually going on. The twist can be discovered or it can simply be a hunt and grab session. However, if the party ignores what they have found, traveling in the area become more difficult as the Sons of Kyuss make frequent appearances. And should Kyuss himself rise from his tome and unleash his waiting army, things are going to get very bad, very quick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
